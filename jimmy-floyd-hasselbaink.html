  <p><b>[Cobblers manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink was excited to make the club’s eighth signing this transfer window]</b> We are pleased to bring Boris in on loan. He has trained with us for a few days and so he already feels at home. Boris is a striker with pace and a lot of technical ability, he is highly rated by <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and we are pleased to welcome him in to the squad.<br /><br />We think we have had a very positive transfer window so far and January’s results have been very encouraging. We continue to talk to some targets to improve the squad further which we hope to get over the line before the deadline, so everyone is continuing to work hard</p>

  <p><b>[Another former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> team-mate, Hasselbaink spoke of <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>’s leadership qualities in comparison to those of <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a>]</b> They’re both totally different. They both have leadership. Frank was a lot quieter, JT was more vocal, but you could see he (Lampard) was a leader. You would always think JT would become a manager more, but Frank was a leader in his own right. Not as vocal, but always doing the right thing, always leading forward and always taking people with him but in a more quieter and respectable way.<br /><br />Don’t get me wrong, JT was respectable, but in a different way and in a different manner. They both have got that qualify of being a leader, and they both have won a lot in this game so they can give that experience to their players</p>

They need to do something different. If you try and replace him it’s not going to work. In the last few years, if you look at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> for instance, with <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> they tried to replace him and couldn’t. Also the same with <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a>, they went in a different direction. And, you know, <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> has been forgotten at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. In a way that’s what <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have to do. They need to maybe go in a different direction with a different approach.<br /><br /><b>[The last time two London rivals locked horns, back in January, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">the Gunners</a> were able to contain the threat of <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a> and secure a 2-0 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> win]</b> What <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> did in that game is the intensity was so high from their top six players. They pressed them so well - and we all know <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> want to play from the back and control the game in that way. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> did that really well by stopping them and punishing them. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> need to understand if that happens again they have to play from the front. They have to attack <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s back line. We all know that their weak point is in defence so you have to exploit it</p>

  <p><b>[Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink believes <a href="matthijs-de-ligt.html">Matthijs de Ligt</a> is ready for a move to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> The Dutch have always been not afraid to put young players in. In that aspect, they have done a really good job and we can finally say that the national team has a really bright future ahead. De Jong, De Ligt, Virgil Van Dijk, Kenny Tete, Stefan De Vrij. The majority of the players are yet to reach their full potential. The best is yet to come and I think they will push England in the Nations League.<br /><br /><a href="frenkie-de-jong.html">Frenkie de Jong</a> is going to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. An exceptional talent who is good with the ball and he has a really bright future ahead. He has been fantastic for <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> this season in the Champions League and domestically. De Ligt has already been doing it for a long time. He is the first real quality defender to be at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> since <a href="jaap-stam.html">Jaap Stam</a>. At Netherlands, he has Van Dijk alongside him, he looks like he will follow De Jong to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> which would be a good move</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink was critical of his old club as they made a slow, sluggish start to life under new manager <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>]</b> They lost the ball way too easy. Players were having too many touches, sometimes seven, eight touches and it slows the game down. It will be a lesson for Frank to see players and in a way it will make his mind up. Moving the ball fast is his idea of how he wants to play the game. The majority of successful teams do move the ball quickly. We saw today, especially in the second half, certain players were dwelling a little bit too much on the ball. They didn’t have a solution before they had the ball. It might be that it’s pre-season, it might be that they’re not fit yet and it will come. For some it might be a little too much<br /><br /><b>[<a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> has already departed the club for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> this summer, with USA international <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a> having joined from <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> and <a href="mateo-kovacic.html">Mateo Kovacic</a> having made his loan deal from Real permanent]</b> That is for Frank to figure out, who those players are and who he will go further with.

  <p><b>[<a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> has been urged by <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> legend Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink to set his sights on <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>’s striking berth in the senior England side]</b> As a young boy when you dream of being a footballer you want to play at the highest level and the highest level is England. <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> has been called up. He is going to get the chance and he has to compare himself with the best <b>[striker]</b> and that is Kane at the moment. He has to try to get Kane’s position. It is not easy but that is going to be the next step. He has been invited for the England national squad. Now, can you make that place yours? The only way is to do well for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, keep on scoring and, when you go with England, show that you can do it on that level as well<br /><br /><b>[Asked for his assessment of <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> in 2019-20]</b> Very good, very sharp around the box - I like him. His movement is really good. I think when he plays in a dominant team he will score lots of goals because of his movement and he gets himself on the end of things. That is a good habit to have. He holds the ball up <b>[well]</b>, gets the ball past <b>[the defender]</b> and gets his shots away. Those are really good attributes that a striker needs to have. He scores ugly goals. So for me he should be able to get 20-plus goals<br /><br />It’s magnificent to see. For <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, especially, their identity has not been like that in the past but if they can keep this group together and they have got <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a> as well, <a href="ruben-loftus-cheek.html">Ruben Loftus-Cheek</a>, <a href="reece-james.html">Reece James</a>. If they can keep those boys together I think in two or three years <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> can really dominate <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, obviously with additions to the squad</p>

That’s very unfair.<br /><br />Also you have to think: why would a player of <a href="antonio-rudiger.html">Rudiger</a>’s stature come out with these kind of lies? People don’t do that, players don’t do that. I find it hard to believe there is no evidence. It’s being demonised in two ways - being demonised on the pitch and then when you come off the pitch you’re being demonised again, because there is no evidence and you’re then labelled as liars. So it’s a no-win situation, it just goes on</p>
