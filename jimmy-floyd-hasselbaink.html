  <p><b>[Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has warned Chelsea they cannot afford to be a one-man team with Eden Hazard]</b> For me it’s a very bad thing if you become a one-man team. Hazard is magnificent and has been exceptional but if you look at last season with Liverpool, Salah scored so many goals and they became a one-man team as well. They didn’t win anything. If you are a one-man team you won’t win any trophies so others are going to have to step up. They have to step up and help him.<br /><br />If the player wants to go he’s going to go. He’s been a great servant to the club and has done it the right way if he wants to go. But Chelsea should build a team around Hazard and not lose him. They need to get more stars on the same level as Hazard and be a force in England and Europe like what Man City are trying to do now<br /><br />If you’re a top club like Chelsea you have to try and play dominant football. You know you’re going to have the majority of the ball, 60, 70 per cent and much of that needs to be played in the opposition half to suffocate the opponent. It wasn’t like that last year and the year before. The year they won the title it was through counter-attacking football and often the other team had more of the ball even at Stamford Bridge. You can win the league with what Chelsea were doing in the transition, but in the second season you have to see a progression and that wasn’t the case. Sarri has come in and changed that straight away. It has happened a lot quicker than people thought it would. And they are improving too, very dominant and have the ball a lot. Because of that you’re seeing the smiles back on the players’ faces again as well. There is still some improvement to make because against the big teams as they are only drawing. The next progression is to beat the big teams and especially at Stamford Bridge. Against Liverpool they drew and against Man United they were hanging on<br /><br />I think Chelsea are still a little behind Man City. City have so much strength in depth and the Champions League is not affecting them. But if Chelsea can keep on improving and don’t allow the gap to become bigger than it is now then you never know. With Liverpool they are not as fluid as they were. I don’t know if they have enough to keep on challenging City and maybe they’re suffering a bit from coming out of a big group in the Champions League</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea should be cautious when considering a bid for Inter Milan striker Mauro Icardi]</b> I’d have to see Icardi in the Premier League first. The Italian league is totally different. Obviously he’s a good player and has great potential but so many of the foreign stars come here and cannot cope with the physicality and pace of the Premier League. If he does come we’d have to be patient with him.<br /><br />Giroud does make other players around him better when he plays. He is very unselfish. Does he need to score more goals? Yes, it’s important for a striker to score and because that will help him play more games but he has other qualities. I like Morata. A lot of people are taking about him and he’s getting a lot of mixed messages. That is not helping him. He needs to keep on looking at his qualities and he’s got big qualities. I don’t think he should play the physical game. He should play to his strengths which is an eye for goal and his little runs behind the defence. He’s quick and he makes things difficult for defences and that’s what he needs to keep on doing. He shouldn’t play like Giroud because that’s not him</p>

  <p><b>[Former Leeds striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink says the Premier League would benefit from the presence of his old side]</b> Leeds fans are one of the best in the country. They’re a one-city club and they’re a proud people. They need and deserve to be in the Premier League even if it’s just because of the fans who always create such an atmosphere at Elland Road. Also the numbers they take to the away games - it’s always lively. There are only a few clubs in the Championship who would make the Premier League better and Leeds is one of them. It’s not only the exciting football that the Premier League will benefit from with Leeds but from having the whole club. They would be a big addition to the league because they are a magnificent club. I’m extremely happy with how they’re playing - it’s such good football and nice to the eye and I’ve been to see Bielsa at Leeds to find out what they’re doing and how they’re doing it. He is an exceptional coach.</p>

  <p><b>[Kante call put Sarri in this position but Chelsea criticism is unfair]</b> I think the criticism is a little unfair towards him, he had a really good start to the season. He has put Kante in a different position because he sees that position in a different way and that is where it <b>[the criticism]</b> started. Whatever you say, Kante is the best defensive midfield player at winning the ball back, so that has raised eyebrows. He believes in his way. He believes in playing football in a certain way and that is dominating the ball in possession. That is how he believes Chelsea is eventually going to win titles and cups. You need to give him the time, it’s only six or seven months that he’s been in the building, so you need to give him the time and you need to give him the trust<br /><br />At the moment they are really inconsistent and they need to get that consistency of winning games again. They are going through a bad spell and nobody would have thought they would have lost against Bournemouth in that way. It’s a difficult moment for Chelsea when they are playing away and still having that style of play. They are making chances but they are not scoring the goals and hopefully that can change now with <b>[Gonzalo]</b> Higuain. Can they now go to the next level? That is the question</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea must tie Eden Hazard down to a new long-term contract after being hit with a transfer ban]</b> They can’t replace him or get somebody who they can work on to become as good as Hazard. I know they have bought <b>[Christian]</b> Pulisic, but they will need more to replace Hazard. It’s now about believing in Chelsea and them persuading him to sign a long contract.<br /><br />It’s not good for Chelsea, particularly with how things are going at the present time. But on the other hand, you can spin it, in a way it is good news for the younger players like Callum Hudson Odoi and also Loftus Cheek, who now will get chances. They will have to look at their youth if this <b>[transfer]</b> ban is held</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea must secure their place in next season’s Champions League]</b> It’ll be difficult for Hazard if Chelsea aren’t in the Champions League next season. That’s why the game with Tottenham is every bit as vital as the Carabao Cup final, maybe even more. But sooner or later I think the club will have to shuffle things around anyway to provide a pathway for young players like Callum Hudson-Odoi. They have some great young players coming through but if they can’t get into the first team they will go to clubs like Manchester United, Liverpool and Spurs who give them a chance.</p>

  <p><b>[Callum Hudson-Odoi’s performances for Chelsea and England should be enough to warrant a place in the Blues’ starting line-up]</b> It might be that he lifts the team in a different way and gives them a different dimension,” he told BBC Sport. Chelsea should bring more youngsters through. I would say Hudson-Odoi deserves a chance. You have to say yes, he should be given a chance, because the others in his position are not really playing well at this moment. The only one that is really producing his best - a seven or eight or sometimes a nine - is Eden Hazard.<br /><br />It’s easy to say things and criticise, but let’s not forget what he has inherited and how the team was playing before he got there. He changed the style totally and that’s going to take time. Consistency-wise, he will be a little bit disappointed. They should be better. But it’s his first season in England and he is learning. He has brought a lot of positive things to Chelsea. Let’s not forget that</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea urged to launch Icardi raid]</b> Chelsea are in desperate need of proven firepower so I would love to see them make a move for <b>[Robert]</b> Lewandowski or Icardi this summer. Icardi would be my preference as I’m a little bit worried about Lewandowski’s age. I think Icardi is a more realistic target while also being more likely to adapt to the Premier League. Lewandowski is a superb striker but he is the wrong side of 30 and we have seen with Higuain that England is not an easy place to come at that stage of your career.<br /><br />Chelsea have dozens of players out on loan and they may need to tap into that pool if they’re unable to make new signings for the next 12 months. I can see <b>[Alvaro]</b> Morata returning to Chelsea because I think the squad is in desperate need of a striker and <b>[Gonzalo]</b> Higuain hasn’t looked like the answer so far this season. <b>[Kurt]</b> Zouma might fancy his chances of coming back to Chelsea and becoming part of the squad, but I don’t think he would earn a regular starting role. <b>[Tiemoue]</b> Bakayoko will be moved on this summer because he hasn’t come remotely close to performing as he did at Monaco. That move simply hasn’t worked out for either party. There’s a couple of young players in the Championship, <b>[Mason]</b> Mount and <b>[Jay]</b> Dasilva, that might eye a role in the Chelsea squad next year similar to what <b>[Callum]</b> Hudson-Odoi has had this season. I’ve been impressed with both of them, but it’s a big step up from the Championship to performing for Chelsea so I do think next season might come too soon for them</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Chelsea have a £100 million asset on their hands in Eden Hazard]</b> I think the ball is entirely in Hazard’s court whether he will still be a Chelsea player next season. Chelsea have done everything they can to show that they love him and want him to stay, but he has one year left on his contract and he is in a controlling position to negotiate. I know that Hazard and his family are happy in London, but the lure of playing for Real Madrid may prove too strong. Chelsea cannot afford to allow Hazard to leave the club for free so he will either sign a new contract or be sold this summer. Hazard is a £100million asset, a £150million asset if he had another year on his contract, and Chelsea have a responsibility to not ignore that type of money. Hazard has been a great servant to Chelsea and the club will decide to honour his wishes by allowing him to leave if he doesn’t sign a new contract.<br /><br />I think playing for <b>[Zinedine]</b> Zidane at Real Madrid is potentially the dream scenario for Eden Hazard and I’m not sure what more Chelsea can do to convince him otherwise. Hazard has never won the Champions League and he might feel he has a better chance of winning that trophy at Real Madrid than at Chelsea. The club would probably need to promise huge investment in the squad, but they might be powerless to do so as a result of the transfer ban<br /><br />I don’t think Chelsea should pursue Mateo Kovacic. I think he was signed as a way to get better value from the deal that saw <b>[Thibaut]</b> Courtois go to Real Madrid, but he hasn’t been used correctly at Chelsea. Kovacic is a defensive midfielder and that is where he performed best at Real Madrid, but Chelsea are already blessed with Jorginho and <b>[N’Golo]</b> Kante in that role. Chelsea need a midfielder who has creativity and can split defences with a final pass, who can set up strikers and achieve assists, but this is not Kovacic’s strength</p>

They both have leadership. Frank was a lot quieter, JT was more vocal, but you could see he (Lampard) was a leader. You would always think JT would become a manager more, but Frank was a leader in his own right. Not as vocal, but always doing the right thing, always leading forward and always taking people with him but in a more quieter and respectable way.<br /><br />Don’t get me wrong, JT was respectable, but in a different way and in a different manner. They both have got that qualify of being a leader, and they both have won a lot in this game so they can give that experience to their players</p>

  <p><b>[Former Chelsea striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has revealed he thought John Terry was more likely to go down the management route than Frank Lampard]</b> I always saw John Terry going into management a little more than Frank Lampard. Don’t get me wrong, Frank was a leader but he was quieter. You could see he was a born leader. You don’t have to be loud to be a leader and he just did the right things, at the right times, in the right way. He’s doing well at Derby and JT is in a different role at Villa. They’re both going for it and doing it in their own way. It’s going to be an interesting final between their two sides. I don’t think management is the next step for JT. He’s at the right place, with the right manager (Dean Smith) and the right person as well, who will give him room to express himself. It’s only good for his education and development to be where he is now.<br /><br />If Chelsea get a transfer ban, I can see why they’d go for Frank Lampard. But let’s not forget there’s a manager in place at the moment who hasn’t had a bad year. It’s been difficult, but not bad. If they hire Frank, they will need to give him time. But I can understand why they want to go for him, and he’s with former Chelsea youth coach Jody Morris who knows all of the young players so I can see why. They would need to give him time to implement his way</p>

  <p><b>[Former Chelsea striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink would relish the chance to see the Atletico Madrid forward at Stamford Bridge]</b> He can pick whoever he wants to play for. I would love to see him at Chelsea or in the Premier League, seeing how he’d cope with it but he can pick whatever he wants. If it is Barcelona, then what a combination that’ll be with Luis Suarez and <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi. It’s not great for <b>[Philippe]</b> Coutinho, it’ll be difficult for him to cope with another addition but he’s still a world-class player.<br /><br />If Chelsea don’t have a transfer ban, I think they’ll target two Crystal Palace players. Firstly, Aaron Wan-Bissaka can push Cesar Azpilicueta for a starting place and will learn a lot from him. He’s a very good right-back, and can defend very well. And then Wilfried Zaha brings the excitement. If Eden Hazard goes, you need somebody to take players on. Yes, they have Callum Hudson-Odoi but any good side needs four wide players, especially if something happens to Pedro or Willian. I think it will be difficult for Crystal Palace to keep them, with all due respect. If they’re going to go, I think it’s best for them to stay in London. Yes, Wilfried Zaha had a difficult move to Man United that didn’t work out so I think it’d be good for him to stay in London</p>

I like <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a> and I sometimes think he is not treated fairly. He is unfortunate not to get more opportunities. He does make the other players play better but the only thing is that he doesn’t get enough goals. I am glad he is staying. I don’t think <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> will stay.

You would have to get several good players to share that responsibility and to take that weight off a single player, like <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a>. Perhaps they can tweak the style of play or use some of the loanees from the Championship to do so<br /><br /><b>[<a href="ruben-loftus-cheek.html">Ruben Loftus-Cheek</a> ruled out after picking up an Achilles injury in a friendly win over New England Revolution]</b> It is very sad because he has been doing really well of late. He would have got in the team. He gives something extra to the others, something different and scores goals. He can create goals and he gives them an extra attacking intent. I think he will be a big miss. He is definitely good enough for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in the long-term. He just needs even more time and games. He definitely deserves his opportunities but it has been difficult to judge him when he has only had a game here and a game there<br /><br /><b>[Hasselbaink thinks Maurizio Sarri can look back on what has been a positive season]</b> They have done well overall to finish third.

Yes, the gap is still huge. Next year it is time to close that gap and become challengers for the title next season. It is always important to win competitions, especially European competitions for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> as a big club. They want to have as much success as possible.<br /><br />Will it be easy to beat <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in Baku? No. They are playing well in their European campaign and they have goalscorers. That means they will be dangerous. I think that the main thing was to get into the Champions League and it would be a bonus to get a cup. They were close in the League Cup and they have the Europa League final and challenging to win that. If they win that I would describe it as a very successful season. If not, it is a good season</p>

They pressed them so well - and we all know <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> want to play from the back and control the game in that way. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> did that really well by stopping them and punishing them. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> need to understand if that happens again they have to play from the front. They have to attack <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s back line. We all know that their weak point is in defence so you have to exploit it</p>

  <p><b>[Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink believes <a href="matthijs-de-ligt.html">Matthijs de Ligt</a> is ready for a move to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> The Dutch have always been not afraid to put young players in. In that aspect, they have done a really good job and we can finally say that the national team has a really bright future ahead. De Jong, De Ligt, Virgil <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a>, Kenny Tete, Stefan De Vrij. The majority of the players are yet to reach their full potential.

An exceptional talent who is good with the ball and he has a really bright future ahead.

  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink was critical of his old club as they made a slow, sluggish start to life under new manager <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>]</b> They lost the ball way too easy. Players were having too many touches, sometimes seven, eight touches and it slows the game down. It will be a lesson for Frank to see players and in a way it will make his mind up. Moving the ball fast is his idea of how he wants to play the game. The majority of successful teams do move the ball quickly. We saw today, especially in the second half, certain players were dwelling a little bit too much on the ball. They didn’t have a solution before they had the ball. It might be that it’s pre-season, it might be that they’re not fit yet and it will come. For some it might be a little too much<br /><br /><b>[<a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> has already departed the club for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> this summer, with USA international <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a> having joined from <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> and <a href="mateo-kovacic.html">Mateo Kovacic</a> having made his loan deal from Real permanent]</b> That is for Frank to figure out, who those players are and who he will go further with.

  <p><b>[<a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> has been urged by <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> legend Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink to set his sights on <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>’s striking berth in the senior England side]</b> As a young boy when you dream of being a footballer you want to play at the highest level and the highest level is England. <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> has been called up. He is going to get the chance and he has to compare himself with the best <b>[striker]</b> and that is Kane at the moment. He has to try to get Kane’s position. It is not easy but that is going to be the next step. He has been invited for the England national squad. Now, can you make that place yours? The only way is to do well for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, keep on scoring and, when you go with England, show that you can do it on that level as well<br /><br /><b>[Asked for his assessment of <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> in 2019-20]</b> Very good, very sharp around the box - I like him. His movement is really good. I think when he plays in a dominant team he will score lots of goals because of his movement and he gets himself on the end of things. That is a good habit to have. He holds the ball up <b>[well]</b>, gets the ball past <b>[the defender]</b> and gets his shots away. Those are really good attributes that a striker needs to have. He scores ugly goals. So for me he should be able to get 20-plus goals<br /><br />It’s magnificent to see. For <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, especially, their identity has not been like that in the past but if they can keep this group together and they have got <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a> as well, <a href="ruben-loftus-cheek.html">Ruben Loftus-Cheek</a>, <a href="reece-james.html">Reece James</a>. If they can keep those boys together I think in two or three years <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> can really dominate <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, obviously with additions to the squad</p>

That’s very unfair.<br /><br />Also you have to think: why would a player of <a href="antonio-rudiger.html">Rudiger</a>’s stature come out with these kind of lies? People don’t do that, players don’t do that. I find it hard to believe there is no evidence. It’s being demonised in two ways - being demonised on the pitch and then when you come off the pitch you’re being demonised again, because there is no evidence and you’re then labelled as liars. So it’s a no-win situation, it just goes on</p>
