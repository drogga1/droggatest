  <p><b>[Pogba becomes first Premier League player with own Twitter emoji]</b> Manchester United is the most connected and engaged club in world sport and we continually strive to find new ways to communicate with our global following of 659 million people. We are the number one Premier League team on social media with a reach of over 130 million total social connections across all platforms. Twitter is one of our most popular channels, last year gaining 3.3 million new followers; more than any other Premier League team. This emoji is another great tool for our supporters to connect with the club through a digital environment, particularly as the excitement builds for Sunday’s match. Since returning to the club Paul has become an important player. He is an iconic figure for our supporters around the world, one of the best players in the game and a terrific role model</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd unveil retro 2018-19 third kit]</b> It’s great to be able to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the club’s first European Cup win. This jersey represents an important moment for our club - when we became the first English team to win the competition. Adidas continues to demonstrate how forward thinking they are. We are all acutely aware of the threat of plastic to the environment and we are delighted to be able to raise further awareness with this recycled kit, which I am sure the fans will love.</p>

Our shirt is much more than what we wear, it embodies the passion of our fans and their allegiance to the club. Kohler is known around the world not only for its cutting-edge design and luxury products but also a genuine commitment to stewardship and sustainability and is an exciting addition to our family of commercial partners.</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd launch new home kit for 2018-19 to commemorate Newton Heath foundations]</b> There are many great moments in this club’s fantastic history, and none more important than the year the club was founded, back in 1878. This shirt from Adidas pays homage to the year we were founded, and marks 140 years of footballing success. The train track graphic on the shirt is a reference to the origins of the club, when the team was known as Newton Heath <b>[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]</b> Cricket and Football Club. Again, Adidas has shown how innovative they are with their designs - taking a moment from the past and reshaping it for supporters into a jersey which I am sure the fans will love</p>

We know our fans will not want to miss any games played in the coming months and will be disappointed if that is to be the case, but clearly we must all play our part in the efforts to combat coronavirus. By pushing the season ticket renewal deadline back and confirming our policy if games were to be cancelled or played behind closed doors, we want to ease any concerns our loyal fans may have in the current circumstances</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> to introduce safe standing next season]</b> It should be stated, up front, that our overwhelming priority is to keep our people safe from the Covid-19 pandemic. It may seem strange to talk about stadium plans at this time, but football and our fans will return when it is safe, and our preparations for that must continue in the background. This announcement is the latest step in what has been a long journey with our fans. We have listened to their feedback, in particular, the representations made by <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> Supporters’ Trust <b>[MUST]</b>, and worked with Trafford Council to develop and approve this proposal. Our belief is that the introduction of barrier seats will enhance spectator safety in areas of the stadium where - as with other clubs - we have seen examples of persistent standing. It also allows us to future-proof the stadium in the event of any changes to the current all-seater stadium policy. If the trial is successful, we may consider further implementation of barrier seating in other parts of the stadium. We will now move on to develop the installation, compliance and licensing plan for the trial, with a view to having the new seats installed for when we can welcome our supporters back to Old Trafford</p>
