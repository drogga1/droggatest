  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> agree to pay millions back to supporters should season be void]</b> We appreciate the patience and the support we have had from our fans throughout this challenging time and welcome the constructive discussions we have had with MUST and fan representatives. We know our fans will not want to miss any games played in the coming months and will be disappointed if that is to be the case, but clearly we must all play our part in the efforts to combat coronavirus. By pushing the season ticket renewal deadline back and confirming our policy if games were to be cancelled or played behind closed doors, we want to ease any concerns our loyal fans may have in the current circumstances</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> to introduce safe standing next season]</b> It should be stated, up front, that our overwhelming priority is to keep our people safe from the Covid-19 pandemic. It may seem strange to talk about stadium plans at this time, but football and our fans will return when it is safe, and our preparations for that must continue in the background. This announcement is the latest step in what has been a long journey with our fans. We have listened to their feedback, in particular, the representations made by <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> Supporters’ Trust <b>[MUST]</b>, and worked with Trafford Council to develop and approve this proposal. Our belief is that the introduction of barrier seats will enhance spectator safety in areas of the stadium where - as with other clubs - we have seen examples of persistent standing. It also allows us to future-proof the stadium in the event of any changes to the current all-seater stadium policy. If the trial is successful, we may consider further implementation of barrier seating in other parts of the stadium. We will now move on to develop the installation, compliance and licensing plan for the trial, with a view to having the new seats installed for when we can welcome our supporters back to Old Trafford</p>

We wanted to take this from being a valuable message of support to real tangible help for the essential work that Kick It Out do in this area</p>
