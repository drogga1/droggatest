  <p>What I’ve seen is that we have come a very long way. When I was growing up, there was no such thing as girls’ football. To play, you had to fight to play with boys teams – and that’s what I did. But although the opportunities for girls who want to play the game are so much better, we still have a way to go. And as the national team, we have a duty to lead that effort and to inspire the next generation</p>

  <p>[Scotland women vs Japan women. Scotland boss Shelley Kerr insists reaching the knockout stages is still her prime target] It probably makes our job a bit more difficult because the dynamic changes for Japan. It was always going to be tough for us, we’re the second bottom pot three team, but we need to win at least one game. The target hasn’t changed, we still want to get out of the group.<br /><br />[Kerr is keen to build on that sense of momentum] When you finish a game so strongly, you need to have a similar mindset and remember the positives. We need to concentrate on being better on the ball if we are to create chances. That’s something we didn’t do very well in the England game. We’ve got the players capable of doing that and we’ve worked really well in training to put in place a gameplan we think can be successful. They’re [Japan] very efficient, effective, disciplined, organised - it’s what we’re trying to instil in our Scottish team. I’ve been a huge admirer of the Japanese team for many, many years. They’re a formidable team and that shouldn’t be lost just because they drew with Argentina</p>
