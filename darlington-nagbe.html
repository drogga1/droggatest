  <p><b>[Nagbe is thriving, and has positioned himself as a strong candidate for a starting role for the March qualifiers]</b> Last year I had my son so I came in a little bit late, but this year I’ve been here from the beginning, and I’m used to the guys and am comfortable with the guys, and Bruce has been great. Overall, it felt good on the left side and hopefully I can keep it going.</p>

  <p><b>[Darlington Nagbe embracing fresh start with Atlanta United]</b> I think I’d still be <b>[in Portland]</b> if <b>[Porter]</b> was there. It was a good relationship between player and coach. I was comfortable with Caleb and once he left I thought it was good for me to make a chance and experience a new environment. Not just for me, but for my family.<br /><br />It’s been fun, especially Tata. He preaches attack and not just to attack, but to play the proper way. It’s been fun getting to know these guys and play with these guys and the chemistry is getting there<br /><br />Obviously I’ve been with Caleb since I was 17, so having a new coach there has to be more communication on my end knowing exactly what he wants, as opposed to being with Caleb, where I kind of knew what he wanted already from all the years I spent with him. <b>[Martino]</b> is real open to questions, and enjoys when players ask questions, so I’ve been doing a lot of that. Even though it’s nice to play for one coach for a long time, you have that chemistry, it’s good for you as a player to experience a new coach and new ideas and expectations from a different coach<br /><br />It will probably hit me when the World Cup starts. It’s still surreal. It’ll be strange to watch the World Cup without the U.S. being a part of it. I think once it starts, and you see the opening ceremony and all that stuff, I’ll probably start thinking, ‘Man, I could’ve been there’.<br /><br /><b>[The Trinidad &amp; Tobago match remains a bit of a blur for Nagbe]</b> It was just a strange game, I don’t know how to explain it. Some crazy goals that happened. I think everything happens for a reason and hopefully we can learn from it and then become better. Hopefully whoever goes through qualifying for the next World Cup can learn from that and realize that these games aren’t easy, and you have to show up as a team and perform<br /><br />I’m realistic. I’ll be 32 at the next World Cup, which isn’t too old, but there’s young and up-and-coming guys coming into the field as well. Whatever way I can help is cool<br /><br />That’s one thing me and my wife talked about. With soccer not being one of the major sports in the States yet, it’s pretty cool that young African American kids get a chance and opportunity to see a guy for their hometown team that’s the same color as them. Hopefully I can reach out to them and let them know they can be there one day, and they don’t have to stick to certain sports, and they can try any sport, whether it’s soccer or anything<br /><br />As a player, what more can you want? To go from Portland and that fan base to Atlanta and that fan base? A lot of teams don’t have fan bases like that, and a lot of players don’t get the chance to even play with one fan base like that, so to be able to play for two of them is special. I’m looking forward to it</p>

  <p><b>[Darlington Nagbe says that staying home with his family is worth more than representing his country, even at the World Cup]</b> I get to do this for a living, I like what I do for a living, I get to be home a lot. I think the national team kind of took away from me being home a lot of those breaks that we would get. The only time I think about it is when people ask me about it. You know those games, man. It’s fun when you put on the jersey and the whole country is cheering for you. It’s definitely different, it’s definitely special, but at the same time, I try to look at it like if I went to the World Cup, how would it affect me? Would I come back and be like, ‘I went to the World Cup?’ Is it worth missing time with my family? If not, then why would I do it?<br /><br />You’d see guys get some time off and things like that, then we’re travelling to St. Vincent’s to go play on a cricket field and stuff like that<br /><br />For me, it’s just a grind. I feel like where you travel to play makes a big difference - drinking out of water bottles, brushing your teeth with that. People don’t really see that</p>
