<blockquote>
  <p>[Mark Hartmann produced another wonderful goal and assures fans] Good performance from the team. We would have liked to not conceded that last goal. It was a very open match but we did enough today to get the three points.<br /><br />Today we changed to a 4-5-1 where I played a little bit deeper and that means I could get on the ball a bit more. Obviously attacking wise, Roskam was a bit alone so it was important for me and Lee [Jong Ho] to get a bit up. It worked obviously<br /><br />I don’t know, it’s looking like it. That one in the first half didn’t go in but we scored the rebound. As long as we keep winning and the team keeps scoring goals, I’ll be happy. Yeah, what was that all about? No, it’s all good. It went down as my goal anyway. I feel it’s good to be part of the team. It’s a good team, everyone wants to win and everyone is happy to play with each other, so it’s all good. We are better than the bottom two and hopefully we’ll keep climbing up the ladder</p>
