  <p><b>[Fiorentina’s Sebastien Frey Forgotten By France Coach Raymond Domenech]</b> I hope to go to South Africa. But something would have to change on a technical level. I still ask myself why <a href="raymond-domenech.html">Domenech</a> does not call me up, and I don’t think I can do more than I already am</p>

  <p><b>[Frey claims <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> did nothing wrong as he believes the first-leg controversy came back to haunt the team]</b> We are very angry and disappointed, but we have no regrets as we did our best, we played a great game and we won. But, we are sorry seeing the result from the first-leg game. We are very sorry. Had the game in Germany finished 1-1 then we would have gone through tonight. But, I believe we go out with our heads held high and we are proud with what we have done. We are just angry that we are out, but this was not our fault</p>

  <p><b>[Sebastien Frey Will Remain At <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> Despite Competition From Artur Boruc]</b> The attitude of the club during the summer suprised me, I don’t think signing a great keeper was the priority. I was perplexed but it is clear the club can buy who they want. Blanc is a friend and I can’t demand to be called up, but I think I deserve a phone call. Now I have another three years at <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> and my tormented summer has made me stronger</p>

  <p><b>[Fiorentina’s Sebastien Frey ready to make comeback from injury]</b> I’m ready to return to match action. I’m feeling very well and my knees are strong and stable. I’ve been working very hard in the past five months to recover from my injury. I’m ready to play again, but I don’t want to cause any problems. I’m already happy if the coach <b>[Sinisa Mihajlovic]</b> gives me some playing time toward the end. If not, I’ll make sure I’m perfectly prepared for next season</p>

  <p><b>[Goalkeeper Sebastien Frey has revealed that he held talks with <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> giants <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> ahead of the 2011-12 campaign, and added that <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> side <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> have also showed an interest in signing him in the past]</b> Actually, last summer I was in talks with <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>. <b>[Genoa president Enrico]</b> Preziosi was very convincing though. In the past, <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> and Stuttgart attempted to sign me, but it never worked out. I would have loved the experience of playing in another league, and for such an important team, but it never happened<br /><br /><b>[The Frenchman then went on to discuss <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> shot stopper <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Gianluigi Buffon</a>’s election as the best goalkeeper of the past 25 years]</b> I don’t know how they determined that he’s the best, but I think that they’re right because Gigi has been very consistent. Picking <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a> was definitely not a mistake, but <b>[Real Madrid’s Iker]</b> <a href="iker-casillas.html">Casillas</a> would also be worthy of that title for what he’s achieved. I think that what has happened was inevitable in the end. We did some great things in the past. However, when the club had the chance to make the final step to become a big team, nobody showed the willingness to do just that. The chance was there, but the club didn’t take it</p>

  <p><b>[Sebastien Frey pays tribute to Inter]</b> Inter are the club who brought me to Italy, I can only be grateful to them. I also hold president Massimo <a href="massimo-moratti.html">Moratti</a> in great esteem. Inter have it written in their name: they are a club where foreigners have always been important and who helped bring success in the last few years<br /><br /><b>[Inter head into Sunday’s game on the back of a poor run of form and a coaching change, but Frey insists that Genoa will approach this game with the greatest care]</b> This will be a complicated match. We will have to give our best</p>
