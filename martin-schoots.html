  <p><b>[Christian Eriksen is focused on playing matches at Tottenham amid talk of interest from Barcelona, says his agent Martin Schoots]</b> I prefer not to comment on what the newspapers write about the future. The only thing Christian wants to do is focus on playing his matches. We let the rumours be rumoured, even now, when Christian’s merits as a player who sets up a goal are better than anyone else, and now he scores also very important goals. Christian just wants to be important for the team, it is the only thing that matters to him.</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Eriksen’s agent says he is thrilled to see his client linked with such clubs as Manchester United and Real Madrid]</b> I don’t comment on rumours much. But when clubs like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester United are mentioned, it’s always a compliment. Since Christian was 14 years old, big clubs have shown interest. The first were Chelsea, AC Milan and Barcelona, since then there has been no transfer window without any offer or interest.<br /><br />It is not all clubs known by the press. Christian is not a guy who wants to talk too much. He talks with his feet</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Eriksen’s agent has revealed the exact details of the Tottenham star’s fitness issues]</b> Such an injury can be chronic and it is true that Tottenham also fears that<br /><br />Some international media have translated Age Hareide’s words badly. Christian has no chronic injuries - nobody has said that. He just has an injury related to some fatigue and, for that reason, he is having some rest. That is normal because, otherwise, it would not heal. Somebody has not translated well. Christian is doing everything to be back as soon as possible</p>
