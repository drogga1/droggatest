  <p><b>[New England Revolution hope two-striker look of 2016 can form foundation for 2017 success]</b> Jermaine Jones gave players like myself and some other attackers freedom to go forward. At the same time, not only was he destroying plays in midfield, he was also a big key in linking passes up from defense to offense. We lost a player like that when he left, so trying to find a way to get that connection between the defense, midfield and forwards, I think was tough.<br /><br />Before you had the two wingers which stayed out wide and then it was just me and the striker. Now when you add one more guy to the triangle, it adds another piece to the attack, which can be very dangerous when everyone has to go one-on-one against us</p>

  <p><b>[Mr. Dependable Kelyn Rowe earns USA chance with consistency and versatility]</b> He’s gotten more and more consistent and I’d say he’s ‘Mr. Dependable’. He’s been asked to play multiple positions this season. You plug him in and he does the job.<br /><br />You see so many guys who, when put into <b>[an unfamiliar]</b> position, they don’t want to play it, they don’t want to learn it or they think they know it. But he’s willing to learn it and take the good with the bad. He knows he’s not the best at it but he wants to be the best at it.<br /><br />If shows he can be ‘Mr. Consistent’ on the club level he should be able to do it on the international level</p>
