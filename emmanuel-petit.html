  <p><b>[Emmanuel Petit says that Monaco youngster Kylian Mbappe is ahead of where Thierry Henry was at a similar stage of his development]</b> The two have very similar profiles in terms of where they play, their explosiveness, their physical power, the way they carry the ball. I think that Mbappe is ahead of Thierry Henry when it comes to using the ball when he’s moving with it. Many players only use the power of their speed. He’ll take the ball, knock it beyond an opponent and run in behind, which is not at all what Mbappe does. Mbappe runs intelligently. He’ll go into the space that develops and he’ll always try to avoid a direct confrontation with his marker. I find that where he’s ahead of Thierry Henry, but it was difficult in the context of the Spain match. But he must take away the positives. I really want to see him again in the France team soon.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal’s transfer policy has been slammed by Emmanuel Petit]</b> The reason why Arsenal are not at the top of the league and fighting for the big titles is because half of the team is not good enough to play for Arsenal. It’s as simple as that. Arsene Wenger has to change his policy. They’ve got the money now in the bank, they’ve got a lot of money. I spoke with Mr Dein two weeks ago. They’ve got a lot of money in the bank, they’re rich. Financially they have no problem, they paid back the loan for the Emirates Stadium. They spent £30-£40m on players like Mustafi, Xhaka for example. They didn’t do that in a good way, they did it in panic.<br /><br />What Arsenal have been doing in the transfer market for me I have not been impressed a lot. The recent two or three years you know, I think they need to change that. Last summer for example, I have been very disappointed by the fight, it’s like they were signing very quickly the last few days before the end of the market. Top clubs you analyse very precisely what you need about six months of a year before the end of the season. So I think Arsenal have to react in a better way in the transfer market and they have to change the salary cap. They cannot compete with the biggest clubs in Europe if they don’t change that because on top of that Arsenal haven’t won trophies, big trophies for so many years. If you don’t improve those two things I think it will be very difficult to bring big players to Arsenal</p>

  <p><b>[Emmanuel Petit has affirmed he is delighted to see the impact former France team-mate Zinedine Zidane has made since taking over at Real Madrid]</b> I’m of course surprised - being the manager of Real Madrid is not an easy job. Winning La Liga at Real Madrid is not easy. They change managers every two seasons a lot of the time.<br /><br />What he’s doing at Real Madrid is amazing - he has charisma. Even when your name is Zinedine Zidane it doesn’t mean you’ll get the support from the dressing room. The name will get you respect but after a couple of weeks the players will test you, they will question your decisions. They will try and fight your authority.<br /><br />The way he managed the team and the turnaround he’s brought about is incredible. Before Zidane, some managers tried to rest Ronaldo but they couldn’t as he wanted to play every game. Zizou has convinced him he should play the games he can to really help the team. Then he goes and scores a hat-trick against Atletico in the Champions League semi-final!<br /><br />It didn’t work as well with Ancelotti and Benitez - when they tried the players didn’t listen and fought the authority. Zidane has communicated in a smooth way, he’s a natural. It was a surprise when he won the Champions League last season - I wanted to see how he’d cope with La Liga over the course of a season. If Zidane could win the Liga regularly, that would be more important to me than the Champions League - and he’s done it in his first season. The week in, week out test of that league is the real test of a manager<br /><br />I have respect for both clubs but for one player in particular I would love Juventus to win the Champions League - I want them to win it for Gigi Buffon. This guy, I love him. He’s such a great example to the younger generation. How he handles himself as a player and a person. To me he’s one of the greats, like Xavi, <b>[Andres]</b> Iniesta, <b>[Andrea]</b> Pirlo, <b>[Xabi]</b> Alonso at Bayern Munich, those who you never hear from, they let their football do the talking. Then when they do talk, they are intelligent, educated and speak with a pure love of football. For this reason, I want Juventus to win for Buffon</p>

Martial was very good the first months with Manchester United and since Mourinho has managed the team he’s not in the same position anymore. It’s a risk. Talent is something very important in football but you need to have confidence as well from team-mates and your manager. You have to be tough and strong in your mind</p>

They will play the Champions League, he <b>[Martial]</b> will have playing time and the competitions will be long until the end of the year. So going to Inter which is under reconstruction, there are a lot of uncertainties at this level there. It’s a risk to take but I think he has the qualities to claim to play more at Manchester United. Whether it is on the left side or even in the centre, he has already shown that he has the instinct of a scorer.</p>

  <p><b>[Emmanuel Petit has launched a savage attack on Arsenal’s players]</b> When I see them play - and I see them a lot - they seem to play ­without motivation. The blame is put on Arsene, but I cannot see that it is all down to him. Why should it be? Why should a player need motivating to play for one of the biggest clubs in the world, in one of the best stadiums in the world? Some of them do not seem to know what it means to wear that Arsenal shirt. Maybe they should take a step back and ask themselves what they can give to the club. Not what the club can give to them. Someone should sit them down and tell them not to act like babies and kids. They should be proud of wearing that Arsenal shirt<br /><br />No one expects them to win every game. That is not going to happen. But there must be pride in playing for the club. The body language of ­players puzzles me. Yes, Alexis Sanchez is a warrior. He always plays like that. But many of those players do not seem to realise how lucky they are to be at the club. I just want to shake the tree and tell them how fortunate they are to play at a club of Arsenal’s standing. If Arsenal are to achieve anything this season, then the motivation must come back into the team - and the players have to be responsible for that.<br /><br />There is only so much the manager can do. But how can these ­players not motivate themselves to play? How is that possible? There will be ­motivation for some who have the World Cup at the end of the season. But you can not hope to go to a ­tournament like the World Cup if you are not in good form for your club. But that should not be the reason for them to play well. To play for Arsenal should be enough. That is what makes me so very upset</p>

  <p><b>[Emmanuel Petit has warned Arsenal that to compete for the Premier League title they must aim higher than Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang]</b> There has been a lot of speculation about the likes of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Malcom coming in - but Arsenal should be aiming higher. Because they are not competitive on the pitch at the moment, they need to be more competitive with wages. If you can’t guarantee trophies - or at least compete to win them - then you must offer players more in order to come to the club. That’s the way it works.<br /><br /><b>[Petit isn’t sure whether Mkhitaryan is the man Wenger should be signing]</b> Since he signed for United, he hasn’t been involved enough, and I’m not sure he has a winning mentality. Sometimes he reminds me of Mesut Ozil - you really have to push him to show his character, and put him under pressure to display his best qualities. There’s no doubt he has great skill, but I’m not sure he’s the kind of footballer Arsenal need. They should be focussed on other positions</p>

  <p><b>[Thierry Henry would be the wrong choice to succeed Arsene Wenger]</b> He has his statue outside the stadium, and he benefits from an impressive credit in terms of affection and love not only from Gunners fans but also the whole Premier League. He’s the player, after Ryan Giggs, who has made the most impact in the Premier League. That shows you the extent to which he is in people’s minds and has been for a long time. If you add to that his passion for football, he could do something good - but he is a novice. He’s the third assistant coach of Belgium. When you see Patrick Vieira, who is coaching in the MLS … the MLS is different, but he belongs to Manchester City. So, bring back a former player? Yes, but I think that given Arsenal’s current context it’s not what Arsenal need right now. I think they need a seasoned coach who’ll put things on the right track.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal are going nowhere with a reported transfer budget of £60 million]</b> When I hear about the amount of money Emery has to spend, I can’t believe it. Where are you going with £60m? You’re going nowhere. With that amount of money, you can put the best manager in the world on the sideline and the team won’t change much. There is quality at the club, but not to match the likes of Manchester City or Liverpool. They need to bring in top quality players. I want to say to the board: can you just stop bringing in young players for one year? We’ve had enough of young players. The club is full of them. It’s been like this for 15 years now, we need something else. We need talented experienced players. We need big characters and big personalities. This is what has been missing. For me, £60m is ridiculous.<br /><br />Emery is very talented. He has a very specific vision of what he wants to do on the pitch with his players. At Arsenal he will probably want to do exactly what he did at Sevilla. He was unable to do that at Paris Saint-Germain because of the egos in the dressing room. He was being eaten by the players, and he didn’t have the personality to be the leader of the dressing room. When the Arsenal players meet him for the first time they will be surprised. They will see a young and talented manager, but his desire, passion, commitment and professionalism may surprise them. He loves the game so much that he reminds me of Arsene. He eats and sleeps football - he doesn’t have a life, he’s like Wenger was at the beginning of his career.<br /><br />Having watched him over the past two years in France, you could see he was frustrated. it was obvious he was alone at the club. The President didn’t protect him and Emery had to front up alone to criticism. The players spoke out against him. I pitied him sometimes - he never got the chance to do what he wanted. There were too many divas in the PSG dressing room. Some at Arsenal can be the same, but I hope they give him the chance. I want to see the same passion and desire that Liverpool show, which is what Emery’s Sevilla used to produce. I want to see Arsenal express themselves, no matter the opponent or the tactical system. Quick passing, quick movement, then pressure straight away when you lose the ball. I desperately want to see that type of play back at Arsenal.</p>

  <p><b>[Emmanuel Petit believes former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is unlikely to end up at Real Madrid]</b> I don’t believe that Wenger could ever end up at Real Madrid. Why? Because he’s had the opportunity at least three times before. For his own reasons he decided to stay at Arsenal each time, so I don’t see why he would change his mind about that now, even though he’s no longer at the club. Also, this is not the word I would use, but Arsene does have a reputation in Spain for losing, largely because of the Champions League. The way he would want to manage a club is not the way things work at Madrid either. It is a very political club. The pressure, the way the president is always involved, he wouldn’t have the freedom he had at Arsenal. So I don’t think he would be a fit for the Real Madrid job<br /><br />There was some speculation in France around Paris Saint-Germain as a destination for him, but now they have Thomas Tuchel as coach, so it’s hard to know where he could go next as a manager. What I do know is that, at PSG, what’s been missing is authority and respect for the institution. Many Paris players didn’t show respect to the club throughout the season. Wenger would certainly help bring that into the club</p>

I want to see that Pogba, with the mindset that he is against the world, when he has no option but to show to the rest of the world that he has the potential to be one of the best in his position. He thrives on anger sometimes and I want that Pogba. I wish we could have Pogba like this every game. Every time he is angry, every time he has this anger inside of him and he wants to show people are wrong, I know I want this guy.<br /><br />Something I have been saying for ages is that Didier has a luxury that former managers didn’t have in terms of options. He can make two national teams with the same level, no problems at all. So stability could be something very important to help the players in terms of confidence. He has to stick with his decisions even if some players offer big criticism. We know we have very talented individual players but we know as well that, for the moment, we don’t have a team.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal will continue to struggle to force their way back into the Premier League’s top four as long as they refuse to address their defensive frailties]</b> Arsenal’s defence is still a long way from the level needed to compete with the top four teams in the Premier League. We saw it again against Cardiff. It is a recurring problem, that dates back years with Arsenal. It has never been fixed, neither by Unai Emery, nor Arsene Wenger, nor the players out on the pitch. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette can score 40 to 50 Premier League goals a season between them if they are picked to start matches. But even with these two, Arsenal won’t be able to finish in the top three if they don’t sort out their defensive problems.</p>

  <p><b>[Emmanuel Petit has accused Alexis Sanchez of going into hiding after receiving his big pay-day at Manchester United]</b> The manager is on the bench, so you need to show pride in your own performance when you are on the field and the first one who has gone into hiding at United is Alexis Sanchez. He wanted to leave Arsenal because he was chasing the salary United could offer. Now he receives so much money and in nine months what has he done? Nothing. I have not seen him. I think they signed his brother. I understand that players believe they deserve certain financial rewards when they reach a certain level, but what we have seen from Sanchez at United has not been acceptable.<br /><br />Maybe some players are irritated or tired by the way Mourinho does things, but this guy knows what it takes to win trophies. Like how they play or not, Mourinho’s record proves he is one of the great winners. Look at the case of the France national team during the World Cup last summer. They didn’t always play well, but when you look back in the history books of the game, it will say France won World Cup in 2018. This is all that matters in the end. The record books will not say they didn’t play well in this game, or this player was poor in this game, or the keeper made a mistake in the final. Who cares about any of that? It’s all about winning the big trophies. It doesn’t matter how you get there. Mourinho knows this and he has won more than almost every manager in the game. What I would say is that some players are hiding at Manchester United. I bet some are quite happy to hear the criticism of Mourinho and say it is all his fault. They hear the media saying Mourinho is doing this wrong, doing that wrong and they smile, but he is not on the pitch. He puts you on the pitch for one of the biggest clubs in the world and it is your responsibility to play well. Too many of them have been hiding and it is not good to see</p>

Also, the president of Paris Saint-Germain <b>[Nasser Al-Khelaifi]</b> didn’t show him respect either. Too many people are trying to be in charge at PSG and Emery was left alone.

He knew he could not win the battles at this club. It was not just Neymar. It was other players who would try to influence things and if they didn’t like how something was being done, they didn’t go to the manager, they went to the president. I would say that 80 per cent of the dressing room were doing whatever they wanted to do and that is not a position any manager wants to be in. You have big egos at PSG and they don’t take orders very well from anyone. Emery is now in a job where his vision for the game can be laid. There are not so many egos at Arsenal and I think everyone is following the way he wants to go. I’m happy for him</p>

There are big rumours in France about him taking over as Bayern Munich manager. Some of them said he is going to go to Madrid, I don’t believe in it. Some of them said there is big things at Paris Saint-Germain as a sporting director. You’ve got big names there. Can you imagine if you put Arsene Wenger there? I don’t believe in it. I still believe Arsene is passionate about the field, working with the players. This is something really important for him. It’s vital, so I don’t see him working in the offices. He could, he has the knowledge and the intelligence to do that. He still has experience to give on the pitch.<br /><br />What happened with Arsenal gave him a big kick up the arse. It was meant to be. It was even a bit too late but I think that was good for him. Now he does not have the security and he has had to take a step back. He has to think ‘what was missing, did I do everything right?’ Just like a player after a game. I know him very well and he has done that. I’m sure he knows exactly what was wrong. Even when he is almost 70 years old that will serve him as an experience. They needed a change. Even Arsene knows it. He knows that after 20 years at the same club and frustrating years. It’s like living with your wife after a while things are not the same way. It was like a divorce, but it was meant to be</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal icon Emmanuel Petit has hit out at managers and players who view a top four finish in the Premier League as success]</b> The money in the Premier League now is nice for players, but if they are like me, the only thing that matters is winning trophies. Top four is not a trophy. It is a mistake to say that. I know Arsene used to say a top four is as good as a trophy, but come on. That can never be the case. Top four is okay if you are building for the future, but who will sit back in 20 years’ time and remember the team that finished third or fourth in the Premier League this season? I tell you the answer to that question and it is no one. The way the Champions League is now, some clubs and players view being in that competition as the only target, but this is a shame for me. I remember when the Champions League had one team from each country and the fight to be in that competition was fierce. Now you have so many options to qualify for this competition and I have the feeling that clubs are more happy to make money than win trophies.<br /><br />I’m happy for Unai Emery that he has been given this chance after what was two very frustrating years with Paris Saint-Germain. He won the title with them, but they didn’t succeed in the Champions League and some players didn’t show respect to him. The president of Paris Saint-Germain didn’t show him respect either.

It was like Arsene Wenger when he came to Arsenal and everyone said Arsene who? Now we are seeing Emery getting the credit he deserves for a good start at Arsenal and I believe he can take the club back to the top. Arsenal have already closed the gap on the top four teams of the last couple of seasons and you can see real progress. What Emery has done in a short space of time is fantastic</p>

I’ve seen glimpses of improvement compared to previous years but you can’t perform for just half an hour against Liverpool. You need to be fully switched on for 90 minutes, especially away from home. If Arsenal go to Anfield thinking they can just keep plodding away the way they have been, it’s over - they’ll leave the stadium with three or four goals against them</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal legend Emmanuel Petit is not expecting his former club to secure a return to next season’s Champions League]</b> How can you say Arsenal have a chance in an away match against City when you see the way they have played away from home this season? They play so well to beat Tottenham and Chelsea at home and then lose to Southampton, West Ham and Liverpool in horrible away performances. This is not the results of a team that will finish in the top four. When I look at Manchester City and Liverpool, they play with the same style at home as they do away and that is not the case for Arsenal this season.<br /><br /><b>[Petit went on to predict Manchester United’s revival under interim boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer]</b> All the teams chasing the top four positions are feeling the breath of Manchester United on their shoulders and I would expect them to find a way to finish in the top four. Chelsea and Arsenal have shown inconsistency this season and yet we have seen a very different United since Solskjaer replaced Mourinho and I believe they have the talent in their squad to continue to win games. Tottenham are looking good to finish in the top four, but if I had to pick a team to get the final qualifying place for next season’s Champions League, it would be United. They have had a great winning run and have closed a big gap that opened up between them and the other teams in the top six, with their 1-0 away win at Tottenham sending out a big message that they are coming back. The big games against your main rivals are so important, so when you see United winning at Wembley and then beating Arsenal in the FA Cup at Emirates Stadium, it is a big statement from Solskjaer and those players that they are ready to go again. Maybe what we have seen since his sacking is proof that Mourinho could have been sacked earlier because this is another example of a team showing they hold all the power. You can be the best manager in the world, but if you do not have your players behind you 100 per cent, they will make you look bad. You cannot sack 11 players and it is always easier to sack a manager. In this case, the decision was easy to make because clearly the United players were not happy with Mourinho and they have shown that even more now that he has gone<br /><br /><b>[On Paul Pogba]</b> He is a different player, but we all know that Pogba only performs at his best when he is loved. He likes the attention and wants the affection from everyone. He wants to be given responsibility and to be the key man in the team and when he gets it, he can be a beautiful player who is very influential and a leader. As soon as there is trouble, as soon as he decides he is not happy with a manager at a club, he doesn’t care anymore. Players like Pogba know they have the power now. They control a manager, they control a club and they will not share that power. This has been proved time and again now. Mourinho didn’t have the power at United and he went to war with the players to try and show he was the boss. That power is not with a manager like this anymore. A manager needs to get his players working for him and Mourinho never managed that at United</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal have seen their appointment of Unai Emery and subsequent lack of transfer activity questioned]</b> The frustration level must be very high for Emery as in only his second transfer window as Arsenal manager, he was told he cannot sign anybody. You look at the money Manchester United , Liverpool and Manchester City spend and unless you join them and put the cash on the table to compete for the best players, you are going nowhere. Tottenham are not spending money, but they are in the position Arsenal were in a few years ago building a stadium, but there is no excuse for Arsenal now. If you sack Arsene Wenger and then say to the guy who replaces him you have no money to spend on new players, I would ask what was the point of sacking Wenger in the first place?<br /><br />Defensively, Arsenal have not been good enough this season, so I was surprised they did not try to sign defenders in January, but the problems they have will not be solved by signing a player or two. When I look at Manchester City and Liverpool, they play with the same style at home as they do away and that is not the case for Arsenal this season. This is not a case of mental strength of spirit in my opinion because the performances at home against Tottenham and Chelsea shows what this team is capable of. Then we see them lose at Southampton and West Ham before being smashed by Liverpool at Anfield and I ask why? Clearly, the defence is a problem. The better teams are getting through them far too easily and when I hear Emery say he is happy with his defence and he does not need new players in these positions, I’m pretty sure he does not believe this</p>

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri’s nightmare spell at Chelsea harks back to the days of Jose Mourinho’s disastrous second coming]</b> understand that a manager has to stick with his views and opinions, even sometimes against his own players’ thinking - because maybe he’s right - but I’m sure that Sarri is very nervous. His body language in a recent press conference showed this, as did what he did with Guardiola on Sunday. Things like this shouldn’t happen, and when they do you show everyone - fans, journalists, players - that you’re losing the plot. It reminds me a bit of the dark times under Jose Mourinho.<br /><br />Sarri said he is a strong man, that he has a vision for the team and will ignore the critics, especially in relation to Jorginho and N’Golo Kanté. He said that he would stick to his guns. I understand and I appreciate that - I respect it - but I think he has forgotten something very important: he doesn’t have to convince the press or the fans, he has to convince his players. And for the moment it’s difficult to believe his players are confident about the way they play and the way he wants them to play. Should Sarri be sacked right now? When Roman Abramovich feels the pressure like this, he doesn’t dwell on feelings, he just cuts down the tree. He did it with Jose Mourinho and he did it with Antonio Conte after winning the Premier League, so he will have no emotion about doing the same with Sarri. If the next result is a bad result, that could be the last game for him</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil can be a big weapon for Arsenal in their North London Derby date with Tottenham]</b> It has taken time for Ozil to show his real level on the pitch again. He did well against Bournemouth and looked fresh mentally. We know his quality - the only question is about his motivation, and what I saw on Wednesday is the beginning of the answer. Unai Emery’s management of Ozil has been good. He’s left him at home and put him on the bench at various times, giving him a few minutes here and there before now thrusting him back into the first team. It’s a long process and it’s necessary to concentrate not only on the player but also on the man - for weeks, Emery has been doing that. So, I hope Ozil will keep enjoying himself on the pitch and keep his mind fresh. If he can do that, it will be a big weapon for Arsenal until the end of the season<br /><br />It looks like Emery wants to start with just one of Alexandre Lacazette or <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> in the team. In the big games, it seems as if he wants him team to be harder to break down, which means playing with just one striker. Tactically, the balance isn’t the same when both of them play, but just because you play with two strikers it doesn’t mean you can’t have balance. But he wants to play with different systems and to change his system regularly - personally I believe that Arsenal are a very good team when they’re both on the pitch. They score goals almost every single game - if it’s not Lacazette, it’ll be <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> - and create chances for one another constantly. At the moment, it’s working with one up front and the players are responding well when they come off the bench. Lacazette and <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> are both performing and scoring goals when they come on as substitutes. But I still think that when they play together, they’re a terrific partnership.</p>

It was a moment of genius - a miracle from Giggs<br /><br />The feeling was of big frustration. But we had big respect to Manchester United.

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil looks like a dead player on the pitch]</b> Unai Emery is a good coach and a good manager. He needs to be given time for players to adapt to his style and his methods. He changes his tactics often and rotates his starting team to suit those tactics. He’s a proven winner in the Europa League, and even if you consider it the little sister of the Champions League, he’s won trophies. So I hope the Arsenal board will back him in the transfer market and allow him to brighten up his dressing room with better players, especially in defence.<br /><br />There are so many players at Arsenal who need to leave the club this summer. It’s been too long since we’ve seen them compete for the title, and the only way they’ll do it is with an improved squad. But they must continue with Emery.

The board just need to give him the power; he can’t continue next season with the same group of players. For example, what is going on with Mesut Ozil? He looks like a dead player on the pitch.

A collective unit. Not just the first 11 but the whole group. This is why he’s constantly rotating his side and including young players. I like this idea, but it’s difficult for players to operate in a system like this. He changes so often - but you need to be playing regularly in order to adapt like this. His demands from the players are huge. But if they show the character they’ve shown recently, they have the potential to do something.

What about <a href="dani-ceballos.html">Dani Ceballos</a>? He’s one of the few <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> players who can create something with his passing.

There’s a problem somewhere. Maybe it’s a mental issue or maybe Emery simply doesn’t like him or doesn’t trust him<br /><br />I can understand why many <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> supporters are losing patience with <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a>. As a manager he has a bad record away from home - not just with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, but also while he was in Spain. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> showed no character and it pisses me off because it has been the case so many times away from home. The starting XI he picked against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> was strange. It’s difficult after an international break when you have to play teams that don’t have as many players involved in the international fixtures<br /><br />But you know what to expect when you go to <a href="sheffield-united.html">Bramall Lane</a> - you know the qualities of the <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> team. They fight, especially in front of their home crowd, and they get balls into the box and put pressure on at set pieces. That’s what they did against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.<br /><br />But more importantly they didn’t show any technical quality on the pitch. They gave away so many simple balls and had no inspiration, imagination or creativity. They looked so heavy. This isn’t <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> - you need to take the ball and show what you’ve got. But I haven’t seen that in years. Nothing has changed since <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> left<br /><br /><a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> wants to build from the back. Like against <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>, when they were leading 2-0 before making a stupid mistake because they tried to follow Emery’s instructions. Some of those <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> defenders don’t have the technical quality to do that. Or if they do, they don’t have the character to do it. Teams like City can do that because their players aren’t scared. But most of those <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> players, when they feel someone at their back, whoa, it’s a problem</p>

For me, he can’t be the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> captain any longer. It’s impossible. What he did was unacceptable. What he did on the pitch is one thing, I’ve made it clear that I don’t know what he adds to the team. But what <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a> did as he left the pitch is totally different. You can’t do that - it’s like betrayal in England<br /><br />If I were to talk to <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a>, I would say: ‘You are doing the most exciting job in the world, and you have to make sacrifices. You must understand that, when you play for a big club like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, and are captain on top of that, you must be an example on and off the pitch. Right now, you’re not. So, lay down. Don’t answer any questions that might be a problem - just shut your mouth, work, and try to get back the fans’ and players’ confidence. This is the toughest game you will have to play since becoming a player<br /><br />I played with guys like <a href="tony-adams.html">Tony Adams</a> and <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a> - real leaders, big captains - and they showed the personality and character of what it means to be <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> captain, whatever happened on the pitch. Adams and Vieira always respected the fans - I don’t think <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a> understands what it means to be a supporter in England. He doesn’t know the love those people have for the club and the players, they always support you. I appreciate my time in England because of that. I have witnessed fans booing players before, of course, but not like this. The anger was something else. It’s clear, they don’t want <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a> to play for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> anymore.<br /><br />It’s very difficult for the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans to forgive <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a>. They don’t want him to play for their club anymore. To pass over what happened would be really difficult for <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a>. Is he going to have the guts to keep <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a> as captain? I’m not sure. But, more importantly, are the club going to do something about what happened? I think they have to, as a message to the fans and the players. Whatever happens on the pitch, the fans have the right to boo and show they are unhappy, the same way they have the right to applaud when you score and win games. It’s normal. This is an absolute basic for life as a football player; it’s the same in the street, even if someone comes up to you and says you’re shit, you have to keep your nerve.<br /><br />I know it’s difficult, especially with the pressure <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a> has been under for the last few weeks. He’s been criticised by the fans and the media - by me, too, as a player, rather than as a person - but this is what it means to be captain of a big club. Now, <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a> has to be very solid in his mind. He needs to realise that what happened on Sunday was a mistake.

I’m sure he knows the end is not far away<br /><br />Honestly, I don’t think he’s suited to the intensity of England. He doesn’t like being closed down and being fought - in Spain he’s protected. It would be a pleasure for English fans to see him there but I don’t see why a club like <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, for example, would move for <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> at 32 or 33. If City wanted to buy him, they should have tried to do it a couple of years ago<br /><br /><a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has won so many trophies and when I look back on <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>’s team from 10 years ago it’s clear now the club was at its peak. Those players wrote their own legends in that period. It’s normal that after you reach that level you realise there’s nothing else above it, and the only way is down. You can’t stay at the top forever. If you look at the players they’ve bought since then, you can see they haven’t had the financial might to compete against the biggest powers in the transfer market. They’re one of the biggest clubs but financially they’ve been a bit of a nightmare recently. Now they have to sell before they buy and these days if they want to bring in the world’s best players it costs them €80m or more</p>

  <p><b>[Emmanuel Petit says <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> finding the cure for ‘sick’ <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> When <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> took over at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, the team was sick. Sick on the pitch and in the dressing room. They were losing shape and blindly going nowhere. They were weak. Now, after several weeks of the <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> regime I’ve seen different things happening in terms of intensity, togetherness and work rate off the ball. The mentality is different and some players are getting back to form, like <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Granit Xhaka</a>. I’m very pleased with how he has played and the mentality he has shown<br /><br /><a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> has looked better on occasion and I’m happy with what I see from <a href="lucas-torreira.html">Lucas Torreira</a>. The players seem to be getting the message from <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> and I think it’s clear what he wants from them on and off the pitch in terms of discipline and commitment. It looks like they’re following the rules he sets out on the training pitch.<br /><br />They haven’t been winning as many games as they’d like but they also haven’t been losing. More goals are needed if they want to win, which is the major problem. The first priority when <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> took over was to stop the team conceding stupid goals, and he has done that. But in the meantime they’re suffering a bit up front - I think if they keep playing like this that, sooner or later, they’re going to win games</p>

People are looking at them now because last year they won a European trophy, but really they have been like this for the past two or three years.

  <p><b>[France legend Emmanuel Petit backs <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> boss]</b> Is Tanguay <a href="tanguy-ndombele.html">Ndombele</a> overweight? He looks a little bit. But his body language does not help him. He needs to improve physically. When I see him I think ‘Come on, you can do more than that’. He received the same criticisms at <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>. We all know the potential of <a href="tanguy-ndombele.html">Ndombele</a>. I like this type of player and I used to watch him in France. He was not regularly a top player. Sometimes he could play a beautiful game - then three days later be average. He is not consistent enough. He doesn’t play well with any regularity. He has quality but I agree with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> in that <a href="tanguy-ndombele.html">Ndombele</a> could do much more. When he is very motivated, fit and ready, with his mind and body, and when he has the ambition to perform well, he becomes a top player<br /><br />When you move to a new country you must make an effort to adapt. You cannot be a foreign player not speaking the same language because communication in the dressing room and on the pitch is so important. When he wakes up every morning he needs to ask the same question, ‘Am I doing the best I can?’ It is hard to be a top player and you have to sacrifice everything to get there. You cannot lie to yourself<br /><br /><b>[<a href="tanguy-ndombele.html">Ndombele</a>’s obvious talent meant that it was considered a coup for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>]</b> If he wants to be a top player he needs to perform well every game. Every player has the right to a bad game now and then. But you don’t have the right not to give 100 per cent</p>

He arrived in football with incredible potential, an unpolished diamond. He had an exorbitant transfer fee to live up to at a club populated by stars. He had to take it all on and off the pitch. In his stats, he also progressed. He has shown great maturity in many areas. Despite everything, he tends to annoy me more and more … he forces things too much … he tries to force it and makes the wrong decision. He is annoying even to his own team-mates. We forget that he is young. He has already proven great things, but we always ask for more. What he does is incredible, he has a bright future ahead of him. But putting pressure on himself because he wants to win a Ballon d’Or is annoying. He has to be careful with his behaviour. Too much ‘Neymar-izing’ could turn against him</p>
