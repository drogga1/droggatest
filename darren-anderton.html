I love his arrogance on the pitch, how clever he is into finding the positions that he does and his willingness to try everything. He is a real joy to watch. I don’t think anyone can be compared to <a href="paul-gascoigne.html">Gazza</a> <b>[<a href="paul-gascoigne.html">Paul Gascoigne</a>]</b> because he was a genius and we haven’t created a player like that since</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Anderton says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> should have pursued <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> manager <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> for longer when replacing <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>]</b> Man United were too quick to hire <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> and <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> would have been better suited to handle the task that’s at hand at the club. I’m glad they hired <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> as it meant the <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> rumour went away, but United seemed to have rushed the decision. He came in and got off to a great start, but when you look at where they are at now, it almost looks as if the players decided to work that little bit harder over that period of time and then almost gave up. Also, if you look back at their unbeaten run, those were probably games that they should have been winning anyway. At the start, he came in and gave the whole club that freedom to go and express themselves and the chance to move away from the blame culture experienced under <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>, but now his lack of experience in management is really showing. If <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> is able to recruit the players that he wants over the summer, they have a good chance of achieving success next season.<br /><br />Pochettino’s threat to leave <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> if they win the Champions League is a real one and Levy should be taking it very seriously. This would be a massive blow to the club and I don’t think that <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> is playing mind games with <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a>, I think the concern is genuine. He is telling Levy not to take what he has done for granted and that without heavy investment, it will be an impossible task to stay at the desired level. You’d like to think that if <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> win the Champions League, he will stick around to build on his success. However, he is a man in demand, and there will always be a queue of clubs ready to give him what he wants. The problem is that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are never going to be able to afford the £400,000 - £500,000 a week contracts that the top players expect. It just doesn’t work in accordance with the way that the club is run. The reality is, though, in order to stay competitive, there needs to be investment in the squad</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Anderton says <a href="donny-van-de-beek.html">Donny van de Beek</a> should be <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s top transfer target]</b> <a href="youri-tielemans.html">Youri Tielemans</a> had a good half season at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> but <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> should look to sign <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>’s Van de Beek over the Belgian. He was excellent in both legs against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and would be a great signing for the club. He’s a different class to the other players <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have been linked with and the one I think they need to sign ahead of anyone else. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s wage structure means that regardless of whether they win the Champions League or not, they won’t be able to sign Europe’s top talent. I think that <a href="toby-alderweireld.html">Alderweireld</a> is the one player that has already made his decision and he won’t be at the club next season. At the end of the day, the very top players are going to want top money and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> don’t pay what United, City, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> do.

If you are a player looking in from afar, I would like to think it is a team that most players would love to come be part of and make a difference and help <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> challenge consistently. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have everything set up to go and be a top team for the next decade, but if they aren’t able to offer the big money to accompany the stadium and the manager, it’s going to be very difficult to attract the top players and keep hold of their stars.<br /><br /><b>[Anderton is hoping <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> will remain at the club amid reports the Denmark international is a target for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> Once the likes of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s declare an interest in him, it’s going to be difficult for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> to compete with them.

It’s very worrying when you talk about those players as this would leave a big hole in the defence that would need replacing quickly. Ake is a class player, he’s a very good defender who is comfortable on the ball. <a href="eddie-howe.html">Eddie Howe</a> getting him down to <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> has been one of his greatest achievements at the club. <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> owe a lot of their <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> survival to Ake.

  <p><b>[Darren Anderton says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> will find it ‘near impossible’ to keep <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> at the club]</b> <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have a near impossible job of keeping Eriksen at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> whether they win the Champions League or not. Eriksen is good enough to walk into any team in the world. He’s a rare breed of player that can score as many goals as he can create. His passing and awareness are out of this world, he’s world class. Although some <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fans thought he disappeared a little bit in big games, there was never a doubt of what he could do and he’s pulled them out of sticky situations this season. Once the likes of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> declare an interest in him, it’s going to be difficult for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> to compete with them.

  <p><b>[Darren Anderton claims <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> had grown stale under <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>]</b> I’ve been to a few games this season and it has looked a bit stale, a bit lacklustre. Maybe Jose is what’s needed, something to freshen it up. The reality is in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> it hasn’t been good enough, and the Champions League hid that a little bit last season. Everyone is really disappointed with <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> leaving, myself included, but Jose is a winner. What Poch has done at the club is amazing, but the one thing that keeps getting thrown at him is not winning a trophy. So if that’s what it’s all about, then Jose is the man. He’s winner, he’s been there, seen it and done it at many different clubs all over Europe<br /><br />Football is about winning, it’s a business, and that’s why <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> is the best and has been the best for many years. Will fans be jumping off their seats? Who knows? It might be a much more dogged style. I remember when <a href="george-graham.html">George Graham</a> came in as manager and he made us very difficult to beat. The fans most certainly weren’t happy about him coming, but it’s about winning trophies and for me winning the League Cup was my highlight at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, and with all the talented teams I played it, that’s really not good enough</p>
