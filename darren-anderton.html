  <p><b>[Darren Anderton reveals his admiration for Dele Alli]</b> I’ve got to say that I loved <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Stevie G</a> <b>[Steven Gerrard]</b> as a player and Scholesy <b>[Paul Scholes]</b>, but <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a> for his age is just a freak of a talent. I love his arrogance on the pitch, how clever he is into finding the positions that he does and his willingness to try everything. He is a real joy to watch. I don’t think anyone can be compared to Gazza <b>[Paul Gascoigne]</b> because he was a genius and we haven’t created a player like that since</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Anderton says Manchester United should have pursued Tottenham manager <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> for longer when replacing Jose Mourinho]</b> Man United were too quick to hire Solskjaer and <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> would have been better suited to handle the task that’s at hand at the club. I’m glad they hired Solskjaer as it meant the <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> rumour went away, but United seemed to have rushed the decision. He came in and got off to a great start, but when you look at where they are at now, it almost looks as if the players decided to work that little bit harder over that period of time and then almost gave up. Also, if you look back at their unbeaten run, those were probably games that they should have been winning anyway. At the start, he came in and gave the whole club that freedom to go and express themselves and the chance to move away from the blame culture experienced under Mourinho, but now his lack of experience in management is really showing. If Solskjaer is able to recruit the players that he wants over the summer, they have a good chance of achieving success next season.<br /><br />Pochettino’s threat to leave Tottenham if they win the Champions League is a real one and Levy should be taking it very seriously. This would be a massive blow to the club and I don’t think that <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> is playing mind games with Daniel Levy, I think the concern is genuine. He is telling Levy not to take what he has done for granted and that without heavy investment, it will be an impossible task to stay at the desired level. You’d like to think that if Tottenham win the Champions League, he will stick around to build on his success. However, he is a man in demand, and there will always be a queue of clubs ready to give him what he wants. The problem is that Tottenham are never going to be able to afford the £400,000 - £500,000 a week contracts that the top players expect. It just doesn’t work in accordance with the way that the club is run. The reality is, though, in order to stay competitive, there needs to be investment in the squad</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Anderton says Donny van de Beek should be Tottenham’s top transfer target]</b> <a href="youri-tielemans.html">Youri Tielemans</a> had a good half season at Leicester but Tottenham should look to sign Ajax’s Van de Beek over the Belgian. He was excellent in both legs against Tottenham and would be a great signing for the club. He’s a different class to the other players Tottenham have been linked with and the one I think they need to sign ahead of anyone else. Tottenham’s wage structure means that regardless of whether they win the Champions League or not, they won’t be able to sign Europe’s top talent. I think that Alderweireld is the one player that has already made his decision and he won’t be at the club next season. At the end of the day, the very top players are going to want top money and Spurs don’t pay what United, City, Liverpool and Chelsea do. There is always going to be an issue with certain players, because whether they admit it or not they are always going to want as much money as they can get, regardless of how ridiculous all the money being thrown around is at the moment.<br /><br />If Tottenham do win the Champions League, it would make it more difficult for the likes of Eriksen and <a href="jan-vertonghen.html">Vertonghen</a> to walk out the door, but at the end of the day, money talks. Tottenham have an incredible stadium and an incredible manager in <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>. If you are a player looking in from afar, I would like to think it is a team that most players would love to come be part of and make a difference and help Tottenham challenge consistently. Tottenham have everything set up to go and be a top team for the next decade, but if they aren’t able to offer the big money to accompany the stadium and the manager, it’s going to be very difficult to attract the top players and keep hold of their stars.<br /><br /><b>[Anderton is hoping Christian Eriksen will remain at the club amid reports the Denmark international is a target for Real Madrid]</b> Once the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona’s declare an interest in him, it’s going to be difficult for Tottenham to compete with them. At some point in a player’s career they are going to want to play at one of those clubs, it’s natural. He is a loyal guy, so it wouldn’t surprise me if he does stay but it’s far from a formality<br /><br /><b>[Aston Villa midfielder Jack Grealish has been mooted as a potential replacement for Eriksen]</b> Jack Grealish wouldn’t improve Tottenham’s team and they’ve got better players in his position already. We’ve seen from his performances for Aston Villa this season that he’s a very talented player but he isn’t good enough to walk straight into their starting team. Grealish certainly has the potential to develop into a top, top player and he would fit the Spurs ethos, but if he joins it would very much be as a squad player.<br /><br /><a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> wouldn’t get in Tottenham’s starting team and he would be too expensive to sit on the bench. There’s no doubting he is an excellent player but I don’t see him coming into the Tottenham team and replacing the likes of Son Heung-min, Christian Eriksen, Dele Alli or Harry Kane. He’s has got a little bit of arrogance, swagger and a real belief in his ability, but he would be a hell of a lot of money to spend on someone who is not going to walk straight into the team. If he was to come in as a squad player, he would be an incredible addition</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Anderton suggests that Aaron Win-Bissaka and Nathan Ake would be more suitable targets]</b> Jack Grealish wouldn’t improve Tottenham’s team and they’ve got better players in his position already. We’ve seen from his performances for Aston Villa this season that he’s a very talented player but he isn’t good enough to walk straight into their starting team. Grealish certainly has the potential to develop into a top, top player and he would fit the Spurs ethos, but if he joins it would very much be as a squad player.<br /><br /><a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> wouldn’t get in Tottenham’s starting team and he would be too expensive to sit on the bench.

He’s has got a little bit of arrogance, swagger and a real belief in his ability, but he would be a hell of a lot of money to spend on someone who is not going to walk straight into the team. If he was to come in as a squad player, he would be an incredible addition<br /><br />Tottenham need to get Wan-Bissaka before another club signs him. Kieran Trippier had a brilliant World Cup but he has really struggled at times this season and I think Wan-Bissaka would be a great signing and an excellent long-term replacement for him. Spurs play more games than Palace which he would need to adapt to and he would be expected to get up and down the pitch even more than he does already but he has the quality to make the step up. I think he would really bring the best out of Tripper again as well<br /><br />Nathan Ake would be the perfect replacement for Alderweireld at Tottenham. With Alderweireld’s contract up in the summer, all the signs point to him leaving the club which would be terrible for Spurs. <a href="jan-vertonghen.html">Jan Vertonghen</a> is also coming into the final year of his contract and he is at the age where a club of Barcelona’s stature would be very interested in him. It’s very worrying when you talk about those players as this would leave a big hole in the defence that would need replacing quickly. Ake is a class player, he’s a very good defender who is comfortable on the ball. <a href="eddie-howe.html">Eddie Howe</a> getting him down to Bournemouth has been one of his greatest achievements at the club. Bournemouth owe a lot of their Premier League survival to Ake. It wouldn’t surprise me to see Tottenham going for him. I know that Nathan Ake is very happy at Bournemouth, but Tottenham is a very attractive option</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Anderton says Tottenham will find it ‘near impossible’ to keep Christian Eriksen at the club]</b> Tottenham have a near impossible job of keeping Eriksen at Tottenham whether they win the Champions League or not. Eriksen is good enough to walk into any team in the world. He’s a rare breed of player that can score as many goals as he can create. His passing and awareness are out of this world, he’s world class. Although some Spurs fans thought he disappeared a little bit in big games, there was never a doubt of what he could do and he’s pulled them out of sticky situations this season. Once the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona declare an interest in him, it’s going to be difficult for Tottenham to compete with them. At some point in a player’s career they are going to want to play at one of those clubs, it’s natural. He is a loyal guy, so it wouldn’t surprise me if he does stay but it’s far from a formality.<br /><br /><b>[Adrien Rabiot is preparing to depart PSG as a free agent]</b> Rabiot would be a fantastic addition to the Tottenham team, but he is going to have his pick of most top clubs. Rabiot is a top draw player, if he came to Spurs, he would fit in with the way that Spurs play very easily. He has got so much ability, so much awareness. He passes the ball beautifully. He is a player I really rate and would love to see at the club</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Anderton claims <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> had grown stale under <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>]</b> I’ve been to a few games this season and it has looked a bit stale, a bit lacklustre. Maybe Jose is what’s needed, something to freshen it up. The reality is in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> it hasn’t been good enough, and the Champions League hid that a little bit last season. Everyone is really disappointed with <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> leaving, myself included, but Jose is a winner. What Poch has done at the club is amazing, but the one thing that keeps getting thrown at him is not winning a trophy. So if that’s what it’s all about, then Jose is the man. He’s winner, he’s been there, seen it and done it at many different clubs all over Europe<br /><br />Football is about winning, it’s a business, and that’s why <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> is the best and has been the best for many years. Will fans be jumping off their seats? Who knows? It might be a much more dogged style. I remember when <a href="george-graham.html">George Graham</a> came in as manager and he made us very difficult to beat. The fans most certainly weren’t happy about him coming, but it’s about winning trophies and for me winning the League Cup was my highlight at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, and with all the talented teams I played it, that’s really not good enough</p>
