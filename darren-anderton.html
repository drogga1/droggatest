  <p><b>[Dele Alli is a freak and can be compared to Steven Gerrard and Paul Scholes]</b> I’ve got to say that I loved Stevie G as a player and Scholesy but Dele Alli for his age is just a freak of a talent. I love his arrogance on the pitch, how clever he is in finding the positions that he does and his willingness to try everything. He is a real joy to watch.<br /><br />Let’s not put any ideas into Daniel Levy’s mind but who knows what Dele Alli would cost now. I don’t think you could put a price on him. He’s that good and that young and for me, he does it all. People talk about his temperament but you can’t really take that away from him, that’s his edge<br /><br />I would certainly like to think Harry Kane will stay at Spurs for his whole career but there will be plenty of offers for him over the years. He is a genuine, grounded loyal lad who wants to do well for the club he’s with and if things stay as they are I don’t think Harry will want to go anywhere else. He could earn a lot more money at other places but he doesn’t seem to be guided by money</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham midfielder Harry Winks boasts playmaking qualities which make him similar to Manchester United legend Paul Scholes]</b> I think he’s the real deal, absolutely different class. I love the way he plays. I think if you watch the way he passes the ball, it’s never sloppy. It’s always fizzed in at pace, almost the way I used to watch the United boys ping the ball about, like <b>[Paul]</b> Scholes. He always wants the ball and he’s ‘one of our own’ which I love. I used to room with Dean Austin when I was playing who was from Hemel and he knew Harry since he was a young kid and he’s always mentioned him to me that he’s different class. So he’s come into the team, and to break into a good team which is not easy, and he keeps doing the right things. He had a tough break with injury last year and missed out on the World Cup but he’s got such a good manner about him. I love the way he plays the game. I would say he almost goes unnoticed, that real quality. Whether it’s Huddersfield or at home to Barcelona, you’ll get the same performance.<br /><br />People will keep talking about it. People will keep asking the question if he doesn’t sign a new deal. Why is that? Is he not committed? Does he want to move on? Is he looking for a fresh challenge? For me, I would love to see him sign in terms of his importance to Spurs. He’s the one who has got that little bit extra in the final third. When teams come to Wembley and they sit there with 10 men behind the ball, it’s his quality in that final third that can really make things happen out of nothing. I’ve said it for a few years now that he is, if not the key player, one of the most important players in that team</p>

  <p><b>[Former Tottenham and England midfielder Darren Anderton has claimed he would not swap Christian Eriksen for Paul Pogba or Eden Hazard]</b> There isn’t anyone like him really. There’s Hazard who also makes things happen and opens teams up and Pogba is doing that too at United. But I wouldn’t swap Eriksen for anyone, that’s for sure. There was a spell where Spurs supporters were concerned that he never seemed to do it in the big games but I never really bought into that. When Spurs are playing well it’s usually because he’s the one making things happen. His ability to make a pass makes him a world-class talent and I love watching him play.<br /><br />Harry Kane is the best striker in the world and a winner. You can rely on him and trust him. Of course, he’s an incredible talent but it’s his character I think - his mindset and desire - that makes him second to none. That’s why he’s the player he is and England captain. He’s a good lad with both feet firmly on the ground and he’s everything you want from your star player. Of course, there are always going to be worries with a player of that calibre because other clubs will want him but I’m more than confident that Harry will want to stay with Spurs and achieve everything he wants to achieve at Spurs. For me, he’s got the potential to be better than Shearer, I mean he really is that good. He’s world class already and if he continues in that vein he’ll break every goalscoring record going and achieve whatever he wants. Who knows where his career will take him? I always come back though to his mentality. He does have that Shearer thing where he doesn’t get bullied by big centre-backs, he throws them all over the park. He’s also quicker than people give him credit for. He’ll make runs into the channels. He comes deep to be the linkman. Then, at the end of the day, he’s in the box scoring goals as well. He can also score every goal: 20 yarders, headers, curlers. He does it all and, for me, there isn’t a flaw in his game</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur will have sealed Champions League places come the end of the season]</b> It’s always all about the run you’re on because results breed confidence. Spurs have definitely had a wobble and lost some games that really they shouldn’t have - the Southampton game, the Burnley game. These are games where if you want to be in the top four or challenge for the title you can’t lose and especially in the manner that they did. So that was disappointing and then, of course, the immediate reaction is to start looking down and start worrying. It would be quite a negative to not finish in the top four, especially with the new stadium coming next week. I still fancy Spurs though to join Liverpool and Manchester City. Then I’d go for United.<br /><br />When I look at Liverpool I don’t see them being a better team than Spurs to be honest but they’ve done the business and got the points. They’re the one who is still up there. It’s a tough one to call. I went to watch the game at Wembley earlier this season and Liverpool were by far the better team, no doubt about it they were different class and Spurs struggled to keep with them. But are they still at that level? Now, this weekend it could go either way with so much talent on display. There’s a great work ethic across both teams and it will be some battle. I’m looking forward to watching it, that’s for sure</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham’s new stadium will keep the likes of Harry Kane and Mauricio Pochettino at the club]</b> It <b>[the stadium]</b> should help bring in the best players in the world, it should help keep the best players that we have, it should help keep the manager. Everything’s positive about it and the fans are going to love coming here every week and watching the team<br /><br />I loved it, it was amazing. People always ask me what I loved about playing with Spurs and it was always playing here in the special stadium that it was. But now you come in and it’s just another world. I’ve been fortunate to go to some of the best stadiums in the world, and this is up there<br /><br />It really does feel like a bigger White Hart Lane. I think that’s because it’s on the same site and you do have the same drive in and things like that. The same memories. I loved it. It’s definitely ready for Wednesday</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham need to be looking to bring in world class players]</b> Yes he certainly does. Pochettino has done unbelievably well since he’s come to the club. He’s taken Spurs on and all the players who were there before he’s improved individually. But they’ve got to keep improving the team. The new stadium was built for Champions League football, not the Europa League, so they’ve got to get into that next year for sure. In order to bring new players in as well, if you want the best players in the world, you’ve got to play in that competition. When it comes down to it, they’ve got to start winning trophies and bringing in more players, world class players.</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Anderton says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> should have pursued <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> manager <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> for longer when replacing <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>]</b> Man United were too quick to hire <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> and <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> would have been better suited to handle the task that’s at hand at the club. I’m glad they hired <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> as it meant the <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> rumour went away, but United seemed to have rushed the decision. He came in and got off to a great start, but when you look at where they are at now, it almost looks as if the players decided to work that little bit harder over that period of time and then almost gave up. Also, if you look back at their unbeaten run, those were probably games that they should have been winning anyway. At the start, he came in and gave the whole club that freedom to go and express themselves and the chance to move away from the blame culture experienced under <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>, but now his lack of experience in management is really showing. If <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> is able to recruit the players that he wants over the summer, they have a good chance of achieving success next season.<br /><br />Pochettino’s threat to leave <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> if they win the Champions League is a real one and Levy should be taking it very seriously. This would be a massive blow to the club and I don’t think that <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> is playing mind games with <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a>, I think the concern is genuine. He is telling Levy not to take what he has done for granted and that without heavy investment, it will be an impossible task to stay at the desired level. You’d like to think that if <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> win the Champions League, he will stick around to build on his success. However, he is a man in demand, and there will always be a queue of clubs ready to give him what he wants. The problem is that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are never going to be able to afford the £400,000 - £500,000 a week contracts that the top players expect. It just doesn’t work in accordance with the way that the club is run. The reality is, though, in order to stay competitive, there needs to be investment in the squad</p>

I think that <a href="toby-alderweireld.html">Alderweireld</a> is the one player that has already made his decision and he won’t be at the club next season.
