<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former Ajax and Netherlands star Ruud Krul has backed Frenkie de Jong to excel at Barcelona]</b> What I already know is that Barca will bring much to him. He will learn and progress. He has not yet reached his full potential, and he is able to raise his level a little more. During the first six months at Barcelona, he will have to adapt to the Barca system. But he has the talent to succeed there. Maybe not immediately, because there will also be a new lifestyle and new habits that differ from what he knows in the Netherlands. There will be a lot of changes in the same time. It will not be easy, but he has everything to be a good Barca player.<br /><br />It is true that he is still young. Young people always make mistakes, but they learn and do not reproduce them a second time. He will become more mature over the years, and master his position more and more. He will still improve a lot. For me, he is a good guy and a good player. He is well balanced (in his life) and has a good mentality. He has a big future. To improve defensively and tactically, I am sure that the Italian championship is better. But on the other hand, Barca’s style of play will be familiar to him because it resembles that of Ajax</p>
