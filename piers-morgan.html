  <p><b>[Piers Morgan invites Trump to be Arsenal manager!]</b> The moment I invite President Trump to be Arsenal’s new manager - because he’d build a strong defensive wall, have an attacking philosophy &amp; want to win big trophies at all costs. See his hilarious response on Sunday night, ITV, 10pm.<br /><br />It would be a high risk appointment, admittedly…</p>

  <p><b>[Piers Morgan on an evening with the Rooneys]</b> I had a great dinner with Wayne and Colleen in LA, with my wife. It was just the four of us and it was about two summers ago. Wayne’s absolutely hilarious and he likes a drink. So we had a few drinks and we had a few more drinks and we get to about 11:30pm, and he gets to go up to leave, and he trips backwards into a large Olive tree pot. And he’s lying, trapped in this pot, and Colleen just looked down and said, ‘For God’s sake Wayne, let’s get you home.’ So I assumed he was going home. But I woke up in the morning and checked my Twitter feed, and there was one from Colleen at 5am, from a nightclub in Hollywood, saying, ‘Having a great time with Wayne! (laughs). So they party those two!</p>

  <p><b>[Piers Morgan has slammed <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> for refusing a 12.5 per cent pay cut]</b> Shame on you <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a>, shame on you. Let me get this straight, some of the younger players, on far less money than you, are taking a 12.5% pay cut, a minuscule drop in the ocean for you and you don’t want to do it because you want ‘to see how the financial situation plays out’ whilst you’re sitting on your backside on your PlayStation every night, rather than playing football<br /><br />Really? I’ve reserved my condemnation for football clubs who have been furloughing using taxpayers’ money when they have plenty themselves. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, they all got shamed into doing u-turns on this kind of thing.<br /><br />The players, I felt, were getting a bad rap. This is why some of them deserve a bad rap. People like <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> that have said ‘no. ‘No, sorry, I might be one of the highest-paid players at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, I may be one of the highest-paid players in the world. I might be worth gazillions and I might be sat on my backside doing nothing at the moment but no, I’m not going to take a pay cut</p>

  <p><b>[the Dutch football association announced they have abandoned their top flight, the Eredivisie, with no champion, no relegation and no promotion.

Every other solution I have seen is less fair than simply accepting the season cannot be finished &amp; voiding it. Holland has realised that, but we’re still desperately trying to save a season that can’t be saved<br /><br />I would think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans are a lot more concerned about how many of them were infected with #Coronavirus during the <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> game at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> on March 11, on the very same day the @WHO declared this a global pandemic…</p>
