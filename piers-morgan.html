  <p><b>[Piers Morgan on an evening with the Rooneys]</b> I had a great dinner with Wayne and Colleen in LA, with my wife. It was just the four of us and it was about two summers ago. Wayne’s absolutely hilarious and he likes a drink. So we had a few drinks and we had a few more drinks and we get to about 11:30pm, and he gets to go up to leave, and he trips backwards into a large Olive tree pot. And he’s lying, trapped in this pot, and Colleen just looked down and said, ‘For God’s sake Wayne, let’s get you home.’ So I assumed he was going home. But I woke up in the morning and checked my Twitter feed, and there was one from Colleen at 5am, from a nightclub in Hollywood, saying, ‘Having a great time with Wayne! (laughs). So they party those two!</p>

  <p><b>[Sutton United goalkeeper Wayne Shaw is out of contract at Sutton at the end of this season and was was asked by host Piers Morgan if he would consider a switch to the Emirates]</b> We have a big problem with our defence at the moment. We could do with a big unit in goal like you. Are you ready for a transfer? Can I facilitate it? Most of our players get about £40,000 a day for doing, what I see as, very little. What would it take to prize you and your pies out of Sutton to Arsenal?.</p>

  <p><b>[Piers Morgan says Trump would sack Wenger]</b> Would Donald Trump consider success to be somebody who hasn’t won a major trophy in 13 years? No, I think he would be using the immortal words: ‘Arsene, you’re fired’! The real problem is that Arsenal fans don’t care enough. They have been too brainwashed. This is the worst season Arsene Wenger has ever had. We are going to end up out of the top four.<br /><br />We are sixth in the table, we were dumped out of the Champions League for the eighth consecutive year at the last-16 stage. He has never even won the Champions League. This guy talks like he is Alex Ferguson, talks like he is Jose Mourinho, and he has not won the league since 2004. He has won a couple of FA Cups - well whoopie do!<br /><br />It is completely unacceptable. I’m afraid not enough Arsenal fans care. I have given up trying to persuade them. If they want to carry on with Wenger for two, three more years and languish where we have been for the last 13 years and never really compete for the two major trophies, then so be it. This is supposed to be the promised land where we had the new stadium paid for and we were going to compete with the big boys. We can barely compete with Stoke City!</p>

  <p><b>[Piers Morgan invites Trump to be Arsenal manager!]</b> The moment I invite President Trump to be Arsenal’s new manager - because he’d build a strong defensive wall, have an attacking philosophy &amp; want to win big trophies at all costs. See his hilarious response on Sunday night, ITV, 10pm.<br /><br />It would be a high risk appointment, admittedly…</p>

Let me get this straight, some of the younger players, on far less money than you, are taking a 12.5% pay cut, a minuscule drop in the ocean for you and you don’t want to do it because you want ‘to see how the financial situation plays out’ whilst you’re sitting on your backside on your PlayStation every night, rather than playing football<br /><br />Really? I’ve reserved my condemnation for football clubs who have been furloughing using taxpayers’ money when they have plenty themselves. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, they all got shamed into doing u-turns on this kind of thing.<br /><br />The players, I felt, were getting a bad rap. This is why some of them deserve a bad rap. People like <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> that have said ‘no. ‘No, sorry, I might be one of the highest-paid players at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, I may be one of the highest-paid players in the world.
