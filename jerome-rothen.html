  <p><b>[Former winger Jerome Rothen says Neymar has ‘spat on the shirt’ of Paris Saint-Germain in trying to force a move away from the club]</b> I have lots of people around me who liked him. I say it in the past tense because he has spat on the shirt and on those people who spend a good part of their salary on the season tickets that pay his wages. When he says that the best memory of his career is the comeback with Barcelona, ​​which was the biggest disappointment in the history of PSG, it’s disgusting. He will leave. The discussions are only dealing with the financial arrangements, the concessions. The best thing is for him to leave as soon as possible and move on. It will be a loss, because any team is stronger with Neymar than without<br /><br />PSG don’t suffer from a lack of talent, rather a lack of team cohesion. So hopefully his departure will close their ranks. <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> must step up again this year and take control of the team. The departure of Neymar must allow PSG to build a very strong team. Especially if <b>[Phillipe]</b> <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> arrives. For PSG to take their place among the top clubs, the coach has to transmit the love of the club and the desire to fight</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="edinson-cavani.html">Cavani</a>, along with <a href="keylor-navas.html">Keylor Navas</a> and Leandro Paredes, were videoed topless at mixing decks late into the night]</b> I can’t believe it. They don’t care about what face they show the world. When they are good, there’s no problem. But the truth remains on the park and in the knockout stages of the Champions League, where <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> have been the laughing stock of Europe each year</p>

  <p><b>[Jerome Rothen says <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> was almost done before coronavirus crisis]</b> I know from club sources that a deal to take <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> was almost done. But with what has been happening, I’m sure that <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a>’s arrival at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> will be postponed<br /><br />There is no way that <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> will extend his contract with <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. They will have an agreement between them in place because <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> agreed to let him go this summer. In my opinion, it’s just a question of time</p>
