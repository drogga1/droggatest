  <p><b>[Eugenie Le Sommer says she would trade all of her club honours to win the Women’s World Cup on home soil in 2019]</b> That’s a tough one. I have to say yes. I’d take the World Cup because I can always go back to my club and win more titles with them. The World Cup is the most beautiful of competitions. It’s the stuff dreams are made of</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="megan-rapinoe.html">Rapinoe</a>’s Ballon d’Or 2019 blitz exposes big visibility problem in women’s football]</b> <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> spoke about asking players what they want to improve and what we think, to help them to be better. We discussed some <b>[ideas]</b>. We spoke about the pitch. We need to have a good pitch with a good stadium with some people inside. When I watch a game, even if it’s my league, if it’s a bad pitch, bad stadium, I will change <b>[the channel]</b>. To keep people watching, we need to have a good environment. This is important<br /><br /><b>[Referring to the quarter-finals of the Champions League which will take place in March]</b> The next round? Wow. Before that, it’s like, how many goals will we score, you know?<br /><br /><b>[In <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>’s round of 32 tie this season, they played Ryazan of Russia]</b> I prefer to play against a big team. Even if it’s harder and we can lose. I prefer the feeling before the game, the adrenalin. <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> has to work on the competition to have maybe a third team from England, France, Sweden, Spain, Germany directly qualify<br /><br /><b>[How about group stages?]</b> Yes, why not? I like it with the men. We need to try another way and to have more competitive games because now it’s … it’s not boring, but for me, Champions League, it’s ‘wow’. We need to play big games. I understand also that the first round is easier, but some teams need to qualify before that</p>
