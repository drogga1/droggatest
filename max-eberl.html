  <p><b>[Fabian Johnson signs contract extension with Borussia Monchengladbach]</b> With his versatility on the pitch and his calm, reliable character in the dressing room, Fabian has developed into a leading player within the team. We’re delighted that he will be remaining with us for another three years</p>

  <p><b>[Monchengladbach’s sporting director Max Eberl <a href="marcus-thuram.html">Marcus Thuram</a>]</b> We’re thrilled to have Marcus on board. He is a fast, robust and dangerous attacker who fits into our squad well. We’re confident that he will make his mark in the Bundesliga</p>

  <p><b>[Borussia Monchengladbach sporting director Max Eberl was the man who brought <a href="marcus-thuram.html">Marcus Thuram</a> to the club and he is extremely happy with the acquisition]</b> Marcus is a very open person, he laughs a lot and is always positive. He really helps lift spirits in the dressing room</p>

  <p><b>[When the opportunity to appoint <a href="marco-rose.html">Marco Rose</a> came along, Gladbach sporting director Max Eberl did not have to think twice]</b> We do our coaching scouting very intensively and therefore had Marco in our sights for a long time. We also watch a lot of European Cup matches and wanted to see him play live. Afterwards we met in a VIP room, we could not fly home at such a late hour. The meeting was really coincidental and not planned. We talked for a long time and exchanged ideas and philosophies. As sporting director you rarely have the chance to get the coach you want. In probably 90 per cent of cases, you choose the one on the market that seems to suit you best after you have dismissed a coach. But you rarely get the solution you want. If Marco hadn’t been on the market or had rejected us, it would have been logical for Dieter to continue sitting on our bench</p>

  <p><b>[Selfless Gladbach players give up millions to help pay staff in response to coronavirus crisis]</b> I didn’t have to explain much <b>[to the players]</b>. The players know what’s going on. It’s their job, they have already informed themselves and thought about it. The team has offered to forego salary if it can help the club and its employees<br /><br /><b>[Asked if it was a proposal the club was planning to respond to]</b> Yes. I am very proud of the boys. It is a clear signal: We stand together for Borussia, in good times and in bad. They want to give something back to Borussia and therefore also to all the fans who support us. The coaching staff joined in, just like our directors and managing directors</p>

  <p><b>[Borussia Monchengladbach sporting director Max Eberl confirmed Fabian Johnson’s upcoming departure on Monday while also announcing that veteran Tobias Strobl is also set to depart]</b> Tobias Strobl has informed us that he would like to join FC Augsburg at the end of the season. We have also reached an agreement together with Fabian Johnson to let his contract run out</p>
