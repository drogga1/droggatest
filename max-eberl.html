  <p><b>[Mahmoud Dahoud has agreed a deal to join Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season for an undisclosed fee]</b> It was important for the player and the club that a decision was reached. Now it’s off our minds and we can move on. We will reinvest the money we get for Dahoud and try to find a good replacement for him.</p>

  <p><b>[Borussia Monchengladbach have confirmed that defender Andreas Christensen is set to return to parent club Chelsea next season]</b> He must go back to Chelsea. Those are the two players <b>[Dahoud and Christensen]</b> that we have to replace in the summer. There are no others. And we don’t want any others <b>[to leave us]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[Fabian Johnson signs contract extension with Borussia Monchengladbach]</b> With his versatility on the pitch and his calm, reliable character in the dressing room, Fabian has developed into a leading player within the team. We’re delighted that he will be remaining with us for another three years</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea defender Christensen ‘would like’ to stay at Monchengladbach]</b> We will lose him, because he has to return. This is certain. But, if he does pre-season at Chelsea and then does not play the role that he hopes to, we have the chance to talk again as a club where he has gained two years’ good experience.<br /><br />It could also be that he plays. Or it may be the case that they want to sell him for €25 million, then we would be out of the race. But there are still these opportunities, because Andreas is incredibly comfortable in Gladbach and he, I think, would like to stay in Gladbach.<br /><br />He would also like to be a regular in Chelsea’s starting XI, but they have just become champions who will play in the Champions League and will also want to achieve something next season. In any case, Andreas feels very comfortable in Gladbach.</p>

  <p><b>[Borussia Monchengladbach have signed England Under-20 defender Reece Oxford on loan from West Ham]</b> Reece Oxford has played for England at youth level and is considered one of the country’s best young defensive talents. This loan deal gives us the chance to add a very interesting player to our squad. On top of that, we’ve had good experience with signing young Premier League players in the recent past</p>

  <p><b>[Borussia Monchengladbach have played down their interest in re-signing Chelsea centre-back Andreas Christensen]</b> We’ve got an outstanding relationship with Andreas, but the topic is not currently on. We’ve got a top central defensive partnership, with Mathias Ginter and Nico Elvedi. Although we have some money to spend, I’ve heard that Chelsea will only sell Andreas if they allow him to leave, and the amount they will ask for is very large</p>

  <p><b>[Do Chelsea have a buy-back clause for Thorgan Hazard?]</b> There is no clause. I do not want to comment on any contract content. But we also do not need to make any secrets about it. If we get such a top player from Chelsea, then Chelsea has, of course, always the opportunity, in whatever form, to think about this player.</p>

  <p><b>[Gladbach have chance to renew Thorgan Hazard’s contract]</b> He told us he wants to see where we play in the end. Yes, he is interesting for other clubs. Nevertheless, we have a chance to extend with him if we succeed on the field. But, if Thorgan still says he wants to take the next step, then it must be next summer. I cannot do without this money. Of course, we will have to be creative if we want to extend with him. But there are situations right now, you have no chance.<br /><br />When Southampton got around to Vestergaard, it was an opportunity for us to make some money. When the money was in the box, it was clear that we wanted to attack our benchmark<br /><br /><b>[On Matthias Ginter]</b> Nice. That means that he plays a good season. First of all, I have to have an offer. For me, it only becomes interesting when a player comes to me. Then, I have to deal with it. For Ginter, there was no request</p>

  <p><b>[Borussia Monchengladbach unfortunately have no offers from the Premier League for Borussia Dortmund-bound Thorgan Hazard]</b> Unfortunately there is no offer from England. The German market is more realistic than the English one.<br /><br />Thorgan is an interesting player on the market, but he does not bring the performance of the early part of the season</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[When the opportunity to appoint <a href="marco-rose.html">Marco Rose</a> came along, Gladbach sporting director Max Eberl did not have to think twice]</b> We do our coaching scouting very intensively and therefore had Marco in our sights for a long time. We also watch a lot of European Cup matches and wanted to see him play live. Afterwards we met in a VIP room, we could not fly home at such a late hour. The meeting was really coincidental and not planned. We talked for a long time and exchanged ideas and philosophies. As sporting director you rarely have the chance to get the coach you want. In probably 90 per cent of cases, you choose the one on the market that seems to suit you best after you have dismissed a coach. But you rarely get the solution you want. If Marco hadn’t been on the market or had rejected us, it would have been logical for Dieter to continue sitting on our bench</p>

It’s their job, they have already informed themselves and thought about it. The team has offered to forego salary if it can help the club and its employees<br /><br /><b>[Asked if it was a proposal the club was planning to respond to]</b> Yes. I am very proud of the boys. It is a clear signal: We stand together for Borussia, in good times and in bad. They want to give something back to Borussia and therefore also to all the fans who support us. The coaching staff joined in, just like our directors and managing directors</p>
