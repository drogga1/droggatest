  <p><b>[Goalkeeper Paul Izzo says belief is growing at Central Coast Mariners that they can make the A-League finals after Sunday’s win over Adelaide United]</b> It’s a massive <b>[result]</b>. We’ve been unlucky for so long. We knew we were playing great, we needed to get results like we’re now doing and hopefully we can make a late push <b>[for the finals]</b>.<br /><br />We know we’re progressing and it was only a matter of time before we started turning heads and people started taking notice. We’re proud of today<br /><br /><b>[Izzo’s excellent display was even more impressive considering he copped a Sergio Cirio shot directly in the face in the second half]</b> It hurt a lot. I was a bit dazed for a bit and trying to figure where I was and figure out the score for a second. But I was fine, I got through it</p>

  <p><b>[Central Coast Mariners have confirmed Paul Izzo will leave the club]</b> It’s very tough for me to leave the Mariners. This season we’ve seen how good things can get at this club and how good they can be so it was a hard decision <b>[to leave]</b>. <b>[Central Coast’s goalkeeping coach]</b> Matt Nash has done so much for me, he never gave up on me and has put so much time and hard work into me. I want to say a huge thanks to the Central Coast Mariners who took a big gamble on me. It took time for me to put in a strong season. They were very patient and showed a lot of faith in me.</p>
