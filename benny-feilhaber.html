  <p><b>[Benny Feilhaber ready to make most of a national team second chance he had given up on]</b> It’s something that I wasn’t sure would ever happen again. It feels like a second chance, and because of that, it’s very motivating. I’m excited to be back and I want to make my stamp in this camp. It didn’t feel like I would be back. I had turned that page in my career and tried to focus on the things I could and putting together good MLS seasons. I always watched the national team and it’s something that I looked back on fondly, when I had my national team chances with Bob. I closed that book, and to have it reopen again unexpectedly is an amazing feeling.<br /><br />It’s been six years and I’ve changed a lot. I’ve become a better player. That’s one of the reasons why I’m so motivated now. I think when I played on the national team with Bob <b>[Bradley]</b>, I was still developing as a player, I wasn’t at my best. I feel the last two or three seasons, I played at my best pretty consistently and it’s exciting to have the opportunity to play at the highest level, the international level, with your national team when you are playing at the highest level of your own career.</p>

  <p><b>[The Galaxy’s opening goal]</b> The fact I lose a ball in midfield, and we give them a gift of a goal, gave them life and it took away a bit of our confidence and willingness to play. We can’t allow ourselves to change the way we play, because we know that we can be very good when we play our style.</p>

  <p><b>[Benny Feilhaber says that the Colorado Rapids knew he was frustrated with how things were going at the club]</b> For me I knew it was going to be a process there, but I think everybody that was part of that organization envisioned something different for the first 10 games of the year. Having said that, it didn’t go according to plan and not what I imagined. I’m 34 years old. I don’t know how many more years I’m going to play. I want to be playing on a team that’s competitive and fighting for championships.<br /><br />I think they understood my position. Obviously when I went there I thought we would be something where, I think everybody over there thought it would be something different than the first 10 games showed. They knew I wanted to be competitive and I was a bit frustrated with how things had gone. Those were the conversations and once I found out Kansas City was a team that was interested, I obviously told them I’d love to go there<br /><br />Some of the quality isn’t healthy right now. But the quality is there to become a championship team this year, or else I wouldn’t have come here, or I wouldn’t have wanted to come. I guess theoretically it’s not my choice, but I really wanted to come here and that was one of the reasons why.</p>

  <p><b>[Benny Feilhaber announces his retirement from football]</b> Making it’ in professional sports is about preparation, talent and, most importantly, opportunity. I was lucky enough to have some talent, but, more importantly, I was prepared because of the countless sacrifices my parents made as I was growing up</p>
