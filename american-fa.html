<p>: 2019 07 04
The National Women’s Soccer League has announced a deal with ESPN to televise 14 matches through the remainder of the 2019 season</p>

<p>: 2019 07 05
Who holds the most appearances for the USWNT? Kristine Lilly with 354 appearances and 130 goals.</p>

<p>: 2019 07 05b
Who is the USWNT’s top goalscorer? Abby Wambach	with 256 appearances and 184 goals</p>

More than 50 members of the United States Congress have added their signatures to a letter demanding answers from the US Soccer Federation regarding inferior wages paid to the country’s female footballers</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[World Cup bonuses are also diminished, with male players landing some $55,000 compared to a figure of $15,000 for women, while the game’s authorities handed the men’s team a $5.4 million bonus after their round of 16 exit at the 2014 World Cup – some $3.7m more than they handed the female squad after they lifted the trophy a year later. Such disparity has caught Congress’s attention – none more so than Rep] What more will it take for our players to receive the recognition and compensation they deserve? The USWNT is the most successful team in women’s soccer history, winning World Cup titles in 1991, 1999 and 2015; winning four Olympic gold medals; and holding the No. 1 ranking entering the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup. However, despite doing the same job as the U.S. Men’s National Team, USWNT players are receiving inferior wages, working conditions, and investment from U.S. Soccer</p>

  <p>[Congress questions USWNT pay inequality on eve of World Cup Final. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer added] Discrimination (is) staring us all in the face. These women, who inspire our country with their poise, tenacity, skill and excellence every time they take the field deserve to be fairly compensated</p>

  <p>[Just like four years ago, the USWNT parade will take place in Manhattan, New York where the USWNT members will be presented with keys to the city by Mayor Bill de Blasio. Mayor said of the 2015 ceremony] Young women who watched that game will grow up and they’ll tell their daughters and tell their sons about that 2015 championship team that made history - that opened minds and brought us together.</p>

  <p>[Senator Joe Manchin on Tuesday introduced a bill to the U.S. Senate that, if passed, would see the federal government withhold funding for the 2026 World Cup until U.S. Soccer ‘agrees to provide equitable pay’ to both the U.S. men’s and women’s teams] I received a letter from Coach Izzo-Brown highlighting her worries that women on the WVU Women’s Soccer Team could one day make the U.S. women’s team and not get paid the same as the men’s team. That’s just plain wrong. That’s why I’m introducing legislation that will require the U.S. Soccer Federation to pay the men’s and women’s national soccer teams equitably before any federal funds may be used for the 2026 World Cup.<br /><br />The clear unequitable pay between the U.S. men’s and women’s soccer teams is unacceptable and I’m glad the U.S. Women’s Soccer Team latest victory is causing public outcry. They are the best in the world and deserve to be paid accordingly. I’m encouraging everyone to call their Senator and Representatives to help us get this bill passed and finally create a level playing field for all</p>

  <p>[USWNT accuses national federation of ‘sad ruse’ over gender pay gap claims] This is a sad attempt by USSF to quell the overwhelming tide of support the USWNT has received from everyone from fans to sponsors to the United States Congress. The USSF has repeatedly admitted that it does not pay the women equally and that it does not believe the women even deserve to be paid equally. The fact is the women’s team requested the same compensation structure as the men have, so they would be paid equally for equal performance.<br /><br />USSF refused, ordering lower compensation in every category for the women’s team in a pay for performance structure. That is patently unequal pay. The USSF fact sheet is not a ‘clarification’. It is a ruse. Here is what they cannot deny. For every game a man plays on the MNT he makes a higher base salary payment than a woman on the WNT. For every comparable win or tie, his bonus is higher. That is the very definition of gender discrimination. For the USSF to believe otherwise is disheartening but it only increases our determination to obtain true equal pay. If the USSF cannot agree to this at the upcoming mediation, we will see them in the court of law and the court of public opinion</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[US Soccer though, has pushed back against the idea the women requested a different compensation structure] During the last CBA negotiations in 2017, U.S. Soccer offered the USWNTPA the same contract structure as the Men’s national team and they rejected it, stating they preferred a guaranteed salaries and benefits over the pay-to-play structure</p>

<h4 id="2019-07-30c-retrieve">2019 07 30c Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>[USWNT equal pay dispute sees U.S. Soccer miss the mark with misleading claims. A statement from the U.S. men’s soccer team players association read] The Cordeiro letter includes the claim that the USWNT lost $27m over the past 11 years, but admits that is based on false accounting because the Federation ‘traditionally’ does not count any of the sponsorship, television, or marketing money the Federation generates from USWNT and USMNT players and their games. What U.S. sports team makes money if they don’t count television, sponsorship, and marketing revenue?</p>
