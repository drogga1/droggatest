The suit was under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and alleges that US Soccer ‘paid only lip service to gender equality and continues to practice gender-based discrimination against its champion female employees’] While we welcome the opportunity to mediate, we are disappointed the plaintiffs’ counsel felt it necessary to share this news publicly during the Women’s World Cup and create any possible distraction from the team’s focus on the tournament and success on the field.

  <p>[World Cup bonuses are also diminished, with male players landing some $55,000 compared to a figure of $15,000 for women, while the game’s authorities handed the men’s team a $5.4 million bonus after their round of 16 exit at the 2014 World Cup - some $3.7m more than they handed the female squad after they lifted the trophy a year later. Such disparity has caught Congress’s attention - none more so than Rep] What more will it take for our players to receive the recognition and compensation they deserve? The USWNT is the most successful team in women’s soccer history, winning World Cup titles in 1991, 1999 and 2015; winning four Olympic gold medals; and holding the No. 1 ranking entering the 2019 <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Women’s World Cup.

  <p>[Senator Joe Manchin on Tuesday introduced a bill to the U.S. Senate that, if passed, would see the federal government withhold funding for the 2026 World Cup until U.S. Soccer ‘agrees to provide equitable pay’ to both the U.S. men’s and women’s teams] I received a letter from Coach Izzo-Brown highlighting her worries that women on the WVU Women’s Soccer Team could one day make the U.S. women’s team and not get paid the same as the men’s team. That’s just plain wrong. That’s why I’m introducing legislation that will require the U.S. Soccer Federation to pay the men’s and women’s national soccer teams equitably before any federal funds may be used for the 2026 World Cup.<br /><br />The clear unequitable pay between the U.S. men’s and women’s soccer teams is unacceptable and I’m glad the U.S. Women’s Soccer Team latest victory is causing public outcry. They are the best in the world and deserve to be paid accordingly. I’m encouraging everyone to call their Senator and Representatives to help us get this bill passed and finally create a level playing field for all</p>

  <p>[USWNT accuses national federation of ‘sad ruse’ over gender pay gap claims] This is a sad attempt by USSF to quell the overwhelming tide of support the USWNT has received from everyone from fans to sponsors to the United States Congress. The USSF has repeatedly admitted that it does not pay the women equally and that it does not believe the women even deserve to be paid equally. The fact is the women’s team requested the same compensation structure as the men have, so they would be paid equally for equal performance.<br /><br />USSF refused, ordering lower compensation in every category for the women’s team in a pay for performance structure. That is patently unequal pay. The USSF fact sheet is not a ‘clarification’. It is a ruse. Here is what they cannot deny. For every game a man plays on the MNT he makes a higher base salary payment than a woman on the WNT. For every comparable win or tie, his bonus is higher. That is the very definition of gender discrimination. For the USSF to believe otherwise is disheartening but it only increases our determination to obtain true equal pay. If the USSF cannot agree to this at the upcoming mediation, we will see them in the court of law and the court of public opinion</p>

What U.S. sports team makes money if they don’t count television, sponsorship, and marketing revenue?</p>
