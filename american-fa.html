First-half goals from Jose Cifuentes and Jhon Espinoza were enough to hold off the United States in a 2-1 Ecuador victory in the Under-20 World Cup quarterfinals in Poland.</p>

The United States Women’s National Team’s 13-0 victory against Thailand today is the largest margin of victory in the history of the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup (men’s and women’s)</p>

<p>: 2019 06 19
How much does the USWNT earn compared to USMNT? female WNT players would earn a maximum of $99,000 or $4,950 per game, while similarly situated male MNT players would earn an average of $263,320 or $13,166 per game</p>

<p>: 2019 06 20
The USWNT opened their campaign by scoring 13 times against Thailand - recording the biggest win in either men’s or women’s World Cup history to put side well on its way to the 18 needed to set a new mark</p>

<p>: 2019 06 22
Revenge will not be on the menu for the U.S. national team when it takes the field against Trinidad and Tobago in Gold Cup action on Saturday in Cleveland. No number of goals, and no margin of victory, will erase the memory of the USMNT’s devastating World Cup qualifying loss to the Soca Warriors in 2017. What Saturday’s Gold Cup group match will be able to provide isn’t revenge, but catharsis</p>

  <p>[U.S. Soccer provided a statement about the mediation. The suit was under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and alleges that US Soccer ‘paid only lip service to gender equality and continues to practice gender-based discrimination against its champion female employees’] While we welcome the opportunity to mediate, we are disappointed the plaintiffs’ counsel felt it necessary to share this news publicly during the Women’s World Cup and create any possible distraction from the team’s focus on the tournament and success on the field. We look forward to everyone returning their focus to the efforts on the field as we aim to win another title</p>

Pay discrimination has been a hot topic during the Women’s World Cup in France, with 28 U.S. women’s national team players currently embroiled in a lawsuit with U.S. Soccer over wage issues.

More than 50 members of the United States Congress have added their signatures to a letter demanding answers from the US Soccer Federation regarding inferior wages paid to the country’s female footballers</p>

  <p>[World Cup bonuses are also diminished, with male players landing some $55,000 compared to a figure of $15,000 for women, while the game’s authorities handed the men’s team a $5.4 million bonus after their round of 16 exit at the 2014 World Cup - some $3.7m more than they handed the female squad after they lifted the trophy a year later. Such disparity has caught Congress’s attention - none more so than Rep] What more will it take for our players to receive the recognition and compensation they deserve? The USWNT is the most successful team in women’s soccer history, winning World Cup titles in 1991, 1999 and 2015; winning four Olympic gold medals; and holding the No. 1 ranking entering the 2019 <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Women’s World Cup. However, despite doing the same job as the U.S. Men’s National Team, USWNT players are receiving inferior wages, working conditions, and investment from U.S. Soccer</p>

  <p>[Senator Joe Manchin on Tuesday introduced a bill to the U.S. Senate that, if passed, would see the federal government withhold funding for the 2026 World Cup until U.S. Soccer ‘agrees to provide equitable pay’ to both the U.S. men’s and women’s teams] I received a letter from Coach Izzo-Brown highlighting her worries that women on the WVU Women’s Soccer Team could one day make the U.S. women’s team and not get paid the same as the men’s team. That’s just plain wrong. That’s why I’m introducing legislation that will require the U.S. Soccer Federation to pay the men’s and women’s national soccer teams equitably before any federal funds may be used for the 2026 World Cup.<br /><br />The clear unequitable pay between the U.S. men’s and women’s soccer teams is unacceptable and I’m glad the U.S. Women’s Soccer Team latest victory is causing public outcry. They are the best in the world and deserve to be paid accordingly. I’m encouraging everyone to call their Senator and Representatives to help us get this bill passed and finally create a level playing field for all</p>

  <p>[USWNT accuses national federation of ‘sad ruse’ over gender pay gap claims] This is a sad attempt by USSF to quell the overwhelming tide of support the USWNT has received from everyone from fans to sponsors to the United States Congress. The USSF has repeatedly admitted that it does not pay the women equally and that it does not believe the women even deserve to be paid equally. The fact is the women’s team requested the same compensation structure as the men have, so they would be paid equally for equal performance.<br /><br />USSF refused, ordering lower compensation in every category for the women’s team in a pay for performance structure. That is patently unequal pay. The USSF fact sheet is not a ‘clarification’. It is a ruse. Here is what they cannot deny. For every game a man plays on the MNT he makes a higher base salary payment than a woman on the WNT. For every comparable win or tie, his bonus is higher. That is the very definition of gender discrimination. For the USSF to believe otherwise is disheartening but it only increases our determination to obtain true equal pay. If the USSF cannot agree to this at the upcoming mediation, we will see them in the court of law and the court of public opinion</p>

  <p>[US Soccer though, has pushed back against the idea the women requested a different compensation structure] During the last CBA negotiations in 2017, U.S. Soccer offered the USWNTPA the same contract structure as the Men’s national team and they rejected it, stating they preferred a guaranteed salaries and benefits over the pay-to-play structure</p>

  <p>[USWNT equal pay dispute sees U.S. Soccer miss the mark with misleading claims. A statement from the U.S. men’s soccer team players association read] The Cordeiro letter includes the claim that the USWNT lost $27m over the past 11 years, but admits that is based on false accounting because the Federation ‘traditionally’ does not count any of the sponsorship, television, or marketing money the Federation generates from USWNT and USMNT players and their games. What U.S. sports team makes money if they don’t count television, sponsorship, and marketing revenue?</p>
