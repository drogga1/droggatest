<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Peter Gulacsi was left disappointed with his team’s failure to snatch the win against Bayer Munich]</b> I think today the plan worked really well. We wanted to stay really compact against Bayern - they have such offensive quality, they have scored many goals, so we wanted to stay stable. But we also wanted to threaten and to use our speed up front, and in the second half, we could do that. Maybe a draw is a fair result but we played our best game so far here. It’s not about the position in the league, it’s more that we had the chance to beat the best team in Germany away from home. It’s a step forward but I think there was more in the game <b>[than a point]</b></p>
