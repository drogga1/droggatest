<blockquote>
  <p>[Vitesse defender Matt Miazga has been fined by the club for inappropriate behavior in which he grabbed the private parts of an opposition player] First of all, we regret the commotion that has arisen. We have fined both Tim and Matt directly after the events because we do not fit the behavior they showed within the Fair Play concept of the club. However, we found the punishment Tim received was not given in proportion. That does not mean that we approve the incident, on the contrary, as the imposed fine proves. The penalty, however, is by no means consistent with suspensions imposed after similar incidents. That was the main reason to appeal against the verdict; a straight-line penalty. Perhaps we could have largely prevented the commotion by also communicating this immediately after imposing the fines.</p>
