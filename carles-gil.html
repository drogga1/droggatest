  <p><b>[Former team-mate Carles Gil says <a href="adama-traore.html">Traore</a> is a phenomenon and might be fastest ever footballer]</b> He is a phenomenon. You will see nothing similar with his characteristics: powerful, speed … no doubt, he is the quickest in the world. I have always talked to friends; I don’t know if there has been as quick a player ever. Because we all would know him. It is just insane.<br /><br />He had to polish other things. People have helped him and now he is showing that, having those characteristics, he will make differences for sure. He still needs to improve little things, but he is called upon to make a difference<br /><br /><b>[The pace and hustle of English football perhaps suits <a href="adama-traore.html">Traore</a> better than La Liga]</b> Yes, possibly, it is true. English football is maybe a more physical game and he is outstanding in that aspect. It doesn’t matter where he is because he will be outstanding in terms of fitness. Tactically, it is maybe not as good <b>[in English football]</b>; there are more spaces, something which benefits him. He prefers to have three rivals, but having loads of space, <b>[rather]</b> than one-on-one or two-on-one in a little space. It is more complicated for him. That’s why maybe <b>[English football]</b> suits him better. Anyway, again, having those characteristics, if he improves other things, he is almost unstoppable</p>

  <p><b>[Carles Gil was surprised by the standard of <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> upon joining New England Revolution]</b> <b>[MLS]</b> has surprised me positively. I believe we have a different view from Europe about what this league is. Probably we think it has a much lower level than it actually has, looking at players who come here to end their career. This is changing a lot and we will be aware of it as the years go on. I am very good. It is a different format with no relegations and playing playoffs, but it is a very attractive league to play in.<br /><br />Personally, it’s been great. One of the reasons I came here was due to the confidence they showed in me. I wanted to get back to the level I couldn’t show in previous years. Being honest, I have felt very comfortable since the beginning. I have performed well when I have been shown confidence, and I knew I was at the time that I needed that again. That’s why I took the decision.<br /><br />I don’t mind where and when it is, but sooner is better. And especially in the safest way possible. If it has to be in Orlando, let it be in Orlando. And if we can restart the league as it has always been, it is even better. My opinion is to go on, safety granted, the best way possible</p>
