  <p><b>[Paul Gascoigne on himself]</b> When I was at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> I used to go and watch the youth team play, the under-19s, before we played. I think it was Colin Harvey <b>[in charge]</b> at the time and he said to watch this young kid, he’s 14 and playing for the under-19s. I thought I’d stay and watch for a little bit, and he came on when they were getting beat 1-0 with 20 minutes to go. He banged in two goals. I think you can watch them on TV - they’re incredible! What a player! I thought, ‘He’s going to be good’. After the game I went in and said, ‘Well done lads. I’ve got £40 spare - is anyone going out tonight?’ <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> said, ‘I am’, so I went, ‘There’s £40 quid, go and get yourself a couple of pints tonight’. That’s when I knew he was going to be brilliant. He’s never given the £40 back, so the interest is about £1.2m now!</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Gascoigne on Italia ‘90]</b> We were at the team hotel before Italia ‘90. We’d been there about eight days. We’d been messing about in the pool and that, but I’d got a bit bored and was dying for a drink. All the lads were sunbathing, but I saw this cocktail hut and ordered a Pina Colada. All of a sudden I saw <a href="bobby-robson.html">Bobby Robson</a>. He goes, ‘Hey you, what you got there?’. I said, ‘A strawberry milkshake, gaffer’. He goes, ‘Let’s have a taste’. I was sweating. I thought, ‘That’s it, I’m not going to the World Cup’. So he tastes it and goes, ‘Very nice. I’ll have one of them’. So I’m panicking even more. I’m behind the gaffer trying to gesture to the barman, and he cottoned on <b>[to give <a href="bryan-robson.html">Robson</a> a non-alcoholic cocktail]</b>. He tastes his and goes,’ Nah, that’s not the same.’ I thought that was it, but then he goes, ‘Where’s the umbrella, the sword and the cherry?’ I’d got away with it!</p>

  <p><b>[Quote on Gary Neville]</b> I was fortunate to play with some great right-backs <b>[. . .]</b> you see players today as wing-backs, getting forward, getting round the back and whipping in crosses and people say this is the new game, but he was doing it 10 to 15 years ago. <b>[. . .]</b> He was confident, he was a really quiet lad but he got stuck in and he was a team player. He was a guy that you would never see jogging back - he was up and down that line. He was an honest player</p>

  <p><b>[on Alan Shearer]</b> Let’s not forget, he had two severe injuries, he was out for nine months with his ankle, another nine months with his knee; imagine how many goals he’d have scored if he’d been fully fit! - Rob Lee<br /><br />I was at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> and he was making his debut for Southampton and I didn’t really know who he was, but the guy was phenomenal. After the game, I put my arm around him and said ‘you stick in there son, and you’re going to be a decent player’, he just looked at me and said ‘aye, cheers Gazza’, and that was it.<br /><br />But wow, this guy could score. Outside the box, inside the box, he had a free-kick on him like a rocket. What I liked about <a href="alan-shearer.html">Shearer</a> was he didn’t like getting messed about. He gave it as good as he took it. He would get rattled and he hated it, but he wouldn’t roll over. He’d be straight back up. <b>[. . .]</b><br /><br />He had a bad ligament injury and he came through that. One of the good things with <a href="alan-shearer.html">Shearer</a>, even though he got rattled, he never let anyone know. He was always quiet and just got on with it and you knew he was going to get his own back. He just knew where the net was.<br /><br /><b>[. . .]</b> I was watching his ‘100 Greatest Goals’ on Sky and some of them were absolutely phenomenal. I had a bit of a lump in my throat watching it. <b>[. . .]</b> I went to his testimonial and I had tears in my eyes. He went back there and he showed them he had it</p>

Look at my face and look at the veins in his neck as he’s grabbing my knackers. I’m trying to call out to the linesman but I couldn’t get my words out. I just squealed in a high-pitched voice. I remember in the pre-match team-talk the manager giving all his instructions to everyone and then just turning to me and saying, ‘Good luck, son’.<br /><br />I didn’t know what he meant until we got into the tunnel. Vinnie came up and said, ‘It’s just you and me today, fatty. I ain’t playing football - and neither are you’. Three minutes into the game, I asked the referee how long there was to go! What was embarrassing was that the ground was really small and everyone could hear what Vinnie was saying and they were laughing at me.<br /><br />At one point he goes, ‘Oi, fatty, I forgot to tell you that I take the corners. So you just wait there until I’m back’. I was so petrified I just said, ‘It’s OK, I’m not going anywhere. It was probably the only game in my life that I was pleased when it was over</p>

Snoop Dogg vs Paul Gascoigne: Why are they having a social media feud? Snoop began the battle on Instagram on Thursday, when he posted a picture comparing himself to Gazza aged 20 and aged 47. The former footballer’s images were captioned with ‘Alcohol Abuse’, while those of the musician were similarly captioned ‘Marijuana Abuse’ in an apparent attempt to show that cannabis is safer than alcohol</p>

  <p><b>[Alcohol Change UK has hit out at Snoop Dogg for using the pictures of Paul Gascoigne to illustrate alcohol abuse]</b> It’s an unhelpful contribution to the debate around alcohol. Paul Gascoigne has been struggling for many years with a range of health issues, often in the full glare of the media spotlight. Anyone experiencing such harms deserves better and should not be stigmatised in this way. Photos such as these do nothing to help us understand the impacts of alcohol harm on individuals, which are often complex and varied</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Gascoigne has voiced his concern that too many players are becoming robots]</b> There are too many robots, definitely, because there is so much pressure on players and managers not to lose the game - they’re frightened to lose. I always say keep trying things and, eventually, it will work out. But they’re afraid to try. I don’t know what these coaches are doing to our young players coming through, I really don’t, because we don’t have many players like Maddison coming through. He wants to be on the ball, he is creative, he takes people on. I’ve seen him do that often for <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, when I’ve been watching games. <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> has done a great job, got them playing great football. They just miss that something creative in the middle, the willingness to have a go at someone. Just have a go</p>
