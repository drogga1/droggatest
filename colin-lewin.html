  <p><b>[Just four minutes had gone when Martin Taylor clattered into Eduardo at <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a> in February 2008 and inflicted an injury that remains fresh in the mind of everyone at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> more than a decade later. The look on Cesc Fabregas’ face as he glanced down at his stricken team-mate said it all]</b> It was February 23, 2008. I couldn’t tell you the dates of any cup finals, but I can tell you the date of Eduardo’s injury. We were weirdly lucky that day that the hospital they took us to was Selly Oak in <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a>, which is where all the military come back to when they suffer their nasty war injuries. So there was this horrific ankle on the bed and the surgeon came in and was very flippant at what he was looking at. ‘Don’t worry about that, we’ll get that done tonight’ he said. We could have been at any hospital in the world, but fortunately we just happened to be taken to Selly Oak that day<br /><br />The first thing to say is Dick has been brilliant. Our business brain wasn’t the largest between us and Dick helped us out from the start and has been great. There’s been many an hour spent on the phone to Texas talking through business plans and various other bits and pieces. It’s been really great of Dick to do that. And Arsene was always encouraging us. He’s obviously very good friends with <a href="david-dein.html">David Dein</a> so was hearing about it through him as well as Dick. He gave us various bits of advice along the way<br /><br /><b>[His sudden departure came during a major revamp at the Emirates following the announcement that <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> would be stepping down]</b> We went in having no idea it was going to happen. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> at the time had a high-performance director <b>[Darren Burgess]</b> who had been brought in from Australia the summer before. He made a decision to make some changes. So it came as a complete surprise. I was gone and I had three very good physios working with me who were told to apply for one job. Two of them politely told the club to poke it and the one fella who got the job by default ended up leaving a few weeks after that. So yes it was a shock. I didn’t see it coming at all<br /><br />I found it really hard at first. The first two <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> games of that new season I watched in a little bar in Portugal sat in the corner on my own because I just didn’t know what to do. It was a horrible feeling after so long to have to watch a game and not be involved in it. It took me a long, long time to get back to wanting to watch <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> again, even though I had no ill feelings apart from against one or two individuals, who have now left</p>
