  <p><b>[Taylor had a very direct approach to the game]</b> If people think all we did was whack the ball and chase it, it must have been a very poor First Division! I was brought up watching the kind of football where teams went forward trying to score. I enjoyed my team doing that.</p>

  <p><b>[on David Beckham]</b> His football does not seem to suffer by all of this going on around him. You look at his passing and he makes it look so simple. When he passes the ball, it always seems to go where he wants it to go. That sounds simple, but believe me, it is not</p>

  <p><b>[20 years since Graham Taylor’s World Cup failure]</b> If you say ‘Holland’ to me, to this day I see <a href="david-platt.html">David Platt</a> running through on goal. I can’t help it. When things don’t go well as an England manager, it sticks with you for the rest of your life.<br /><br /><b>[Leads at home to Norway and then the Netherlands were painfully squandered, putting qualification in doubt]</b> We played very well in both of those games and if we had won just one, which we deserved to, we would have been OK. We were a point above the Netherlands, with two games to go. A draw would have been enough for us to qualify and we were as confident as we could expect to be<br /><br /><b>[The England skipper was hauled to the ground by <a href="ronald-koeman.html">Koeman</a>, but referee Karl-Josef Assenmacher decided to only show the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> man a yellow card, rather than red. The documentary was to show Taylor imploring the German official to send <a href="ronald-koeman.html">Koeman</a> off, memorably asking fourth official Markus Merk]</b> What sort of thing is happening here? I could not believe what I was seeing. It was a goalscoring opportunity and <a href="ronald-koeman.html">Koeman</a> should have gone. Fifa had made a very strong point in the weeks before the game that the denial of a goalscoring opportunity was a straight red card. He should have been sent off, absolutely<br /><br />That was when I lost it. I honestly felt that we were being cheated. The referee was favouring the home side, I really felt that, as the free-kick we had blocked was exactly the same. The only other occasion in my career I felt like that was when I was in charge of Lincoln and we had a terrible penalty awarded at <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a>. But this was obviously worse.<br /><br />I lost the plot because I honestly and truthfully felt that England were being cheated in a vital game for the country. That was the worst I’ve ever been on a touchline. I’d never been like that before. But that is the one time I end up on film, so that’s what people remember<br /><br />The referee’s got me the sack. Thank him ever so much for that won’t you? I try not to think about what would have happened next if <a href="ronald-koeman.html">Koeman</a> had been sent off. I’m sure we would have qualified for the World Cup and I probably keep my job. But that’s life<br /><br />I didn’t ever expect that we wouldn’t qualify, I was arrogant enough to think that. So I was keen to show the problems of being England manager. Then, as the results went on and we didn’t qualify, I became more central to the documentary, quite rightly. You’re the country’s number one villain<br /><br />One positive which came out of it is that people saw I was passionate about the job. But I can’t watch it. I put a little bit of the documentary on my computer recently but I couldn’t watch it. I said to myself ‘don’t watch it Graham, because for the next week you’ll be down’</p>
