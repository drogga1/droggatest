  <p><b>[Bologna sporting director Riccardo Bigon is hopeful that Ibrahimovic’s good relationship with head coach <a href="sinisa-mihajlovic.html">Sinisa Mihajlovic</a> will see him make a switch to Stadio Renato Dall’Ara]</b> With just a month and a half to go before the transfer market opens, Ibrahimovic and the coach already have a very strong relationship. They spoke to each other. He expressed an openness to the idea of coming to <a href="bologna-fc.html">Bologna</a>, but right now he’s taking time to evaluate all the possibilities for his future after announcing his farewell to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. We are very fascinated by this situation, but it is clear that we are not in control of it 100 per cent. The choice is exclusively up to the player, we are just waiting. We’re ready and we’re more than positive<br /><br />Riccardo Orsolini’s first call-up for Italy is a source of pride for all of us. Even if he didn’t get to play. Andreas Skov Olsen also demonstrated his talent with his national team - I’m happy with the beautiful goals he scored and we hope to be able to trust him going forward<br /><br />We went into the game against Sassuolo (a 3-1 loss) off the back of many good performances but with few points collected. We expect more. In <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>, you can’t just play nice football, you need concreteness. This is what we need to look for now</p>

  <p><b>[Bologna Director of sport Riccardo Bigon on <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a>’s next move]</b> The coach has a personal relationship with Ibrahimovic, but I don’t know if that could turn into negotiations<br /><br /><b>[Bigon insisted <a href="bologna-fc.html">Bologna</a> will not be accepting any offers for Italy international forward Riccardo Orsolini either]</b> We will be the club most affected by the coronavirus, but we will not sell off our talents. It is fortunate because we do not need to do it and we certainly won’t sell. I can say that with certainty</p>

  <p><b>[Ibrahimovic had been linked with <a href="bologna-fc.html">Bologna</a> before he joined Milan, largely due to his relationship with the club’s head coach <a href="sinisa-mihajlovic.html">Sinisa Mihajlovic</a> - who was on the backroom team at Inter when the forward was with the Nerazzurri]</b> I understand the media interest in making this a story, as he is such an important name at the top level, but Ibrahimovic is not a possibility. We are no longer in contact. He had spoken to <a href="sinisa-mihajlovic.html">Mihajlovic</a> in the winter, then made his choices and from then we haven’t taken the situation into consideration. He called me a few days ago and we’ll see what he decides to do in the summer. He certainly won’t remain at Milan, it remains to be seen whether he’ll join us or return to Sweden</p>
