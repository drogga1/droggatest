  <p><b>[Burdisso enjoyed a stellar campaign with the Lupi after joining them on loan from the <a href="inter-milan.html">Nerazzurri</a> last year]</b> I think you should stay at Roma. You are one of their most important players and the fans love you</p>

  <p><b>[Walter Samuel says they showed everyone that Inter are still here with Champions League win over Lille]</b> We knew it was important to win tonight <b>[Wednesday]</b>, important to edge closer to qualification and important after losing to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> <b>[last Saturday]</b>. We wanted to show everyone that Inter are still here and that’s what we did with this win. We’re happy today but we’re already thinking ahead toward the match against Genoa at the weekend, because now we have to climb back up the table</p>

  <p><b>[Walter Samuel announces retirement]</b> There comes a time where you have to listen to your body. It’s not an easy decision for me. I need more time to recover than before. The younger players are fine a day after a game but it takes me two to three days to recover. It will never be the same again.</p>
