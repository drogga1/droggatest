  <p><b>[USA midfielder Heather O’Reilly announces her retirement from international football]</b> I have spent nearly half my life in a U.S. Soccer uniform, so making the decision to retire from international play was incredibly hard and emotional. But quite simply, after 230 caps, thousands of practices, many trips around the world, and having played in three World Cups, and three Olympics, it just feels like the right time. Now, I’m looking forward to being a USWNT fan. American Outlaws, where do I sign up?</p>

  <p><b>[Heather O’Reilly on her retirement from the USA women’s national team]</b> Anyone who has seen me play, or even seen a picture of me play <b>[yes, the ‘game face’]</b> can see my passion for soccer. What can I say? I wear my heart on my sleeve. Because that sleeve of that jersey, on this team for this country, is sacred to me</p>

  <p><b>[Former U.S. women’s national team star Heather O’Reilly says she was proud of how bold this year’s World Cup-winning group was while using their stage to be more influential than any team that preceded them]</b> I think that forever and ever our team has been about winning. We’ve never really been shy about that. Even since the early 90s with the creation of the national team, it’s been about winning championships and anything less than winning is not our standard. That’s nothing new. The way that the team stepped into the spotlight and was very bold and unapologetic in the way that they approached things, I’m really proud of them because maybe they’re being more influential with their platform than we were in the past. I think that’s an incredible thing and that’s really important for the growth of this sport and the growth of women’s sports. Get it done on the field and use your platform off the field. That seems like a good game plan to me<br /><br />My shout to fans is if you fell in love with the team or fell in love with players, stay in love. Keep following them. Communities are craving being a part of something and I think that being part of club football is the next frontier for the women’s national team. It happens a lot more than every four years. If people have an appetite for that now, they can see it a lot more often. We have to continue to find ways to reinvent the league here and make it an attractive bit of entertainment. No one is going to come because they should or because they should support women’s sports. I mean, that’s great and if you feel inclined to do that, then that’s fantastic, but I think the fan bases really will come when they feel part of something exciting and feel entertained and feel like they’re part of a community<br /><br /><b>[O’Reilly retired from the international game in 2016 and, having watched this past World Cup as a fan, broadcaster and former team-mate of those involved, she found a new appreciation for the team while reflecting on her own time with that group]</b> It was awesome. I would say this felt like it was my fourth World Cup, three as a player and the fourth on the sidelines, but I still felt part of it in a different way. I had a broader appreciation for the tournament overall because when you’re a player you’re so in the zone and focused on your task, but being able to see the team from afar, I could appreciate what I was a part of for 14 years. I was so proud of the team. They backed up their words with action and they won it and they did it in style. I was thrilled to be able to talk about them in a positive way.</p>

  <p><b>[Heather O’Reilly will retire at the end of her season with North Carolina Courage]</b> I hope I leave with the players and the fans that it is possible to be a ruthless competitor but also try to be a good person. And that it’s cool to work hard - I think I’ve always given it my all, there’s no secret about that. You know that I’m leaving my heart out there, and that’s something to be celebrated</p>

  <p><b>[Heather O’Reilly speaks after her final career appearance]</b> I’ll remember doing angels on the field in the confetti and looking up at the sky. I’ll remember the locker room scene. A lot of Budweiser. It was a packed house tonight. It was special. I’m all cried out, at least right now. I feel like I’m in a really good, peaceful time. That was incredible. They kind of saw me off the field, but I didn’t want to take anything away from the team</p>
