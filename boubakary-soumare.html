  <p><b>[When quizzed on his immediate future and the exit talk from <a href="lille-fc.html">FC Lille</a> which has focused on him]</b> It has not worried me. Reporting matters to the people who read it and the people who write it. I do not see myself leaving. I feel good here. I am learning, we have big objectives to attain, like qualification for the Champions League. A departure is not on the cards. I want to do a full season, yes. I am not saying that I am in the starting XI (guaranteed), but the place that I have in the team today, I worked hard to get through the work that I put in, I won it. I cannot see myself leaving without seeing this through. I feel good, my team-mates help me. It is not the time to leave. I do not want to leave with any regrets. I have already had discussions with the coach. I told him very clearly. I have a very precise idea of where I want to go in my career. I know today where I am. And I like being here<br /><br /><b>[He added when asked about mooted interest from <a href="real-madrid.html">Santiago Bernabeu</a>]</b> <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> is the highest level. But I don’t know if I will need to take a middle step, quite simply because I am not looking to leave right now. I am focused on <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a> and the France U21s</p>
