<blockquote>
  <p><b>[When we went out to <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>. In the end, <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> won the Champions League, but we’re not satisfied with that part]</b> We want to bring three titles to Wolfsburg every year. The past is behind us. My focus is entirely on the current season<br /><br /><b>[The 22-year-old would get her reward becoming the youngest player to play in the division as a result]</b> It was exhausting. In the first few games I only played a few minutes at a time, but that became more and more over time. Even in the dressing room, it was not always easy. I was 15; other players were 30. I was scared at the beginning. I was very nervous and had a lot of respect, because I never thought I would play in the first team at the age of 15. If I can be a role model for some girls <b>[in Poland]</b>, it makes me happy. I just want to give everything in every game and show these girls that even a woman can play football<br /><br /><b>[Now, young girls can aspire to be the next Pajor or Harder - creating female role models that neither had growing up]</b> There was very little women’s football on TV during my childhood, so I found my role model in <b>[Cristiano]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. When I first saw him play on TV, I just thought ‘Wow!’ He’s the best player in the world and I’m always trying to watch his games and learn something<br /><br />I always say that titles with the team are the most important to me. If I can help with my goals, all the better</p>
