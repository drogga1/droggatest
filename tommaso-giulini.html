  <p><b>[What hope does Italy have of kicking out racism when Bonucci justifies Kean abuse?]</b> If <a href="federico-bernardeschi.html">Federico Bernardeschi</a> had celebrated like that, he would’ve been treated exactly the same way by our fans. If Paulo Dybala had the same drama queen antics after the goal that Blaise Matuidi did, he would’ve been treated exactly the same way. We cannot go around calling the entire Cagliari crowd offensive things. If there were racist jeers, then our fans got it wrong, but it happened because of the celebration and would’ve happened even if the goalscorer had a different colour of skin. I don’t want people to start being self-righteous about it, because I heard that already, whereas Juventus players came to me afterwards and confessed Kean was wrong to celebrate that way<br /><br />All I heard were whistles and jeers, but if you with your microphones picked up a few isolated racist insults, then of course those were wrong but there’s no need to be self-righteous about it and cast a shadow over the entire Cagliari fanbase or the club</p>

  <p><b>[Cagliari chairman Tommaso Giulini has responded to the racist chanting towards Juventus forward Moise Kean]</b> This issue merits a profound amount of analysis that I realise is complicated to express in a television studio in a few chaotic minutes. Having said that, there are two aspects to take into consideration: First, even just one racist ‘boo’ must be condemned, always. But a condemnation is not enough, because to beat racism you need effort, culture and initiatives. All of this is done by Cagliari, from the School of Tifo to the Future Curva for children, from the Fourth Category of the Football Academy to other numerous initiatives, all of them aimed at creating a different cultural context. The realisation of our new stadium is also part of this vision. Racism is to be condemned, but above all to be defeated. And to do that, we must add actions to words.<br /><br />Secondly, there is one other aspect that is not remotely tied to the first and which regards a very sensitive issue called respect. We teach the lads of our youth academy that football is joyful and fun. At the end of it all, the goal is a wonderful moment to be shared. We do it every day and are trying to learn from clubs like Barcelona or Manchester City, who for some time have worked with youth on these aspects. Last Friday <b>[against Chievo]</b>, after his goal, Fabio Pisacane did not to go ‘challenge’ a group of fans who were already tense because of their situation in the table, but he mimed the gesture of a pregnant belly to share the joy with his team-mates. Despite all of this, we must all work hard to ensure that, starting from the youngest fan, we understand that to respect others, their state of mind and their frustration. Always. I repeat, this is not a cause and effect issue, as nothing in any way can justify a racist ‘boo’. Racism is to be condemned always, in every form. But the antibodies are created above all by teaching the new generations that football is joy and respect for others, which in turn makes us better people</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> president Tommaso Giulini said ‘closing curvas isn’t the answer’ to ending racism in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> after Inter star <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> was subjected to monkey chants last week]</b> We’re trying to work in a serious way, through the awareness of our stewards who will have to report people to DIGOS <b>[a law enforcement agency]</b>. It’s not easy to lipread with technology: we’ll also ask the decent fans for help, that is 99.9 per cent of <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> supporters. Fighting ignorance is difficult, so we can only raise awareness. This incident has caused huge anger and frustration in us for all the initiatives we’re carrying out. We were the first to introduce a school for young fans. <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> isn’t a racist city at all. I’m so sorry that this image of us has also gone abroad. I hope we aren’t banned. Closing curvas isn’t the answer: as I said before, stewards must be made aware. I won’t rule out, however, that any of my stewards saw something or a camera identified someone chanting. Once they’re recognised, these people could be denied entry if they try to re-enter the stadium<br /><br />You have to stop games because otherwise we won’t go anywhere. I know it’s a big step to take, but we have to do it because otherwise those 4-5 stupid people will always be there. <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>’s appeal was right. It’s up to us players to show we can be role models for all ages. We carry great influence. If it starts with us, that’s a good thing</p>
