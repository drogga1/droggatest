  <p><b>[Cagliari president Tommaso Giulini said ‘closing curvas isn’t the answer’ to ending racism in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> after Inter star <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> was subjected to monkey chants last week]</b> We’re trying to work in a serious way, through the awareness of our stewards who will have to report people to DIGOS <b>[a law enforcement agency]</b>. It’s not easy to lipread with technology: we’ll also ask the decent fans for help, that is 99.9 per cent of <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> supporters. Fighting ignorance is difficult, so we can only raise awareness. This incident has caused huge anger and frustration in us for all the initiatives we’re carrying out. We were the first to introduce a school for young fans. <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> isn’t a racist city at all. I’m so sorry that this image of us has also gone abroad. I hope we aren’t banned. Closing curvas isn’t the answer: as I said before, stewards must be made aware. I won’t rule out, however, that any of my stewards saw something or a camera identified someone chanting. Once they’re recognised, these people could be denied entry if they try to re-enter the stadium<br /><br />You have to stop games because otherwise we won’t go anywhere. I know it’s a big step to take, but we have to do it because otherwise those 4-5 stupid people will always be there. <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>’s appeal was right. It’s up to us players to show we can be role models for all ages. We carry great influence. If it starts with us, that’s a good thing</p>

  <p><b>[Cagliari president Tommaso Giulini says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> &amp; PSG-linked <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> planning for next post outside of Italy]</b> I made a bit of a mad phone call towards the end of January, offering <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> the job, knowing full well it was going to be impossible. Massimiliano told me his next adventure will be abroad, even if he was fascinated by the proposal of leading <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> during our centenary year. I knew even before making the phone call that it was going to be improbable</p>
