  <p><b>[The story of Liverpool, Roma and the European Cup final of 1984]</b> It’s the greatest night of my career. You got used to winning trophies at Liverpool, but to know at the end of the season that you were the best team in Europe? That was a step above, it felt like we were part of the elite<br /><br />It was some occasion. You probably don’t appreciate it at the time, but looking back you do. Beating a team in front of their own fans in a European Cup final? It’s some achievement<br /><br />The aim at the start of every season was the same. You want a trophy, two if possible, all of them if you can. We never said one was more important than the other, we just went for the lo<br /><br />We were a top side. We rarely worried about the opposition. We just went out and played. And if we played, we reckoned nobody would stop us<br /><br />We seemed to perform better away from home that season.<br /><br />People always ask about being intimidated playing Roma. But that Bucharest tie was 10 times more scary. Souness had broken their best player’s jaw in the first leg at Anfield, so they wanted to kill him over there. They wanted to kill all of us!</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool will be able to fend off Real Madrid’s interest in £150 million-rated Mohamed Salah]</b> Unfortunately, there’s been a history of player sales and that’s just how the football club is - but I really don’t see it at all. He loves playing for Jurgen Klopp, he loves his team-mates and he gets the whole Liverpool thing. He’ll already be on big money. Unless Real Madrid say they’ll treble his wages I don’t think he’ll go, but I suppose you never really know<br /><br />You’d have to start at £150m and work upwards, that would be the first conversation, but Salah is probably worth even more. The thing with Liverpool is they’re used to it. Liverpool are and have been a selling team. You’ve just got to look at the history. You’ve seen it with Luis Suarez, Fernando Torres and Coutinho. Basically, the American owners let Klopp go and spend £30m, £45m - or even £75m in Virgil van Dijk’s case. But eventually along the line if they get a fantastic offer for a player and they can still recover, then they sell<br /><br />Klopp is familiar with this sort of situation from his time at Borussia Dortmund. He lost loads of players there - usually to Bayern Munich - but he didn’t moan. He realised that’s just the way things are. He knows what he signed up for and that’s the same at Liverpool. They’re playing fantastic football - even neutrals love watching Liverpool - and still managing to balance the books. There aren’t many managers that can do that. If they were to lose Salah they would bounce back - but I just don’t see him going</p>

  <p><b>[Former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson has praised Andy Robertson]</b> What was it - £8.5m <b>[initial £8m]</b> or something <b>[they paid for him]</b>? He is probably times that by five at the moment. I cannot remember a poor game from him.<br /><br />People in the game said to me, ‘He is great going forward, but defensively against the top teams, I am not sure.’ I tell you what, no-one has taken him apart as yet. The quality of his passing and crossing is outstanding. He is an extremely fit individual; he just looks like a player that doesn’t give a problem to the manager and gets on with it<br /><br />He has got all the tools. We will probably have a better indication at the end of next season. I always judge a player over two years. Sometimes they come in and have a great first season, and the second season is maybe not quite as good. That is when you really decide if they are going to be a great, or just a very, very good player. But very, very good at Liverpool is totally acceptable</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool legend Mark Lawrenson believes the only way to stop Cristiano Ronaldo is to make sure the Real Madrid star does not get anywhere near the ball]</b> Stop Ronaldo from getting the ball, I think that’s the way to stop him. I think Madrid are probably like Liverpool with <b>[Mohamed]</b> Salah. In that, if he doesn’t get a supply line then there is not a lot he can do without the ball. Definitely with Ronaldo, I think the team is built around him. It is all about him. He does not wander between the centre backs or chase centre backs to get the ball off them. They just tell him to stay there and it is up to us to get the ball to you and then you do your bit. Whereas, Salah, <b>[Robert]</b> Firmino and <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane all work really hard in trying to get the ball back. Ronaldo is a little bit fortunate. He has just been sensational<br /><br />People have been comparing Ronaldo and Salah, but you cannot compare the two. As good as Salah has been, I think <b>[Jurgen]</b> Klopp said it the other week, he has got a bit to go yet. Ronaldo has been doing it for five to 10 years. He has done it at the highest level. I kind of thought that this year might be when he starts to drop but it has just not been the case. I think when you look at Ronaldo, he is physically fit in the way he looks after himself. He is unbelievably good in the air, we never really saw that at Manchester United. I would like to think he is just on the wane now, but I don’t think he is. I am told that at Man United, he stayed behind every day and practiced everything. Obviously that hard work has paid off for him</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah will be the favourite to win the Ballon d’Or]</b> I think if Salah scores and Liverpool win then he has won the Ballon d’Or, to be honest. He has been sensational. He plays on the right so he is not stood in the middle and getting chance, after chance, after chance. He makes so many opportunities for himself. He reminds me a bit of Messi. Where he gets himself in a position where they are backing off him, they know what he is going to do but it doesn’t make any difference. He still does it and he goes past them and scores. I am not sure that I have seen anyone who moves his feet so quick. Especially when he is in the penalty area and has people moving backwards. I remember seeing the game against Tottenham earlier in the season and he did three of them, three defenders and they were all in really good positions to take the ball off him. He just went past them and he scored. They were all stood there bemused. It is just the pace at which he moves his feet with the ball and he is strong. That’s the other thing that people don’t realise how strong he is. He looks shortish and a bit weedy, but he is very very strong<br /><br />They will all want to buy him. Liverpool have sold players. Torres, Suarez and Coutinho. That’s just the way it is. He has only done a year. Everyone would love to take him but I would be very surprised if he moves. It is a bit like Harry Kane at Tottenham, I think it would be a surprise. I think there’s something about them where they know that they like where they are, what they are doing and everything in their world is good. It is kind of like why would you up sticks and move and run the risk? I think everybody likes him at the club, he loves the club, he is happy, but hey, money talks doesn’t it?</p>

  <p><b>[How do Liverpool stop Cristiano Ronaldo?]</b> You stop him getting the ball. To stop Ronaldo, you stop the players who will feed him. You cannot allow the ball to arrive to him. That means the midfield has to be in a good position. They have to close all the penetrating passes when they lose the ball in the transition. With Ronaldo, once the ball is at his feet, everything becomes more difficult.<br /><br />I think Madrid are probably like Liverpool with Salah. In that, if he doesn’t get a supply line then there’s not a lot he can do without the ball. Definitely with Ronaldo, I think the team is built around him. It is all about him.

  <p><b>[Liverpool are destined to win Champions League]</b> I wouldn’t normally be a believer in fate, but I am as far as this <b>[Liverpool]</b> group is concerned. If you look, I think the draw has been kind to them. People would argue, maybe with Manchester City not <b>[that much]</b>, but even in the games. If you take the first game, Roma are away, Karius went to catch the ball and he missed it and it hit the crossbar. If Roma score, then the game is completely different. In the City game, at half-time, in the second leg the goal that was disallowed should have been a goal. So I just have this thing with them, I think they are just destined to win it. Obviously we know it is Madrid, but it is not the Madrid team of four of five years ago. I think it is slightly on the wane.<br /><br />If you look, I think the draw has been kind to them.

We know, we have all played in finals and it didn’t make any difference if you won it the year before. Or if someone else was playing and it was five years ago. I don’t get it because it is a game of football with tremendous pressure. I don’t think that makes any difference but listen, I think it is 50/50 on who wins it, but then there’s something about Liverpool. It is like the man upstairs has gone I will let them win it this time around. I don’t think since it became the Champions League, that a team has won it for three years running so Madrid can do that<br /><br /><b>[He does agree that Zidane’s team may seem favourites to most]</b> Yes, <b>[Madrid favourites on paper]</b>. It’s is just the fact that they have won it for the past two years. That’s not a history thing, it is just that they have won it and it is most of the same players. I also think Madrid are a little bit cleverer in so far as Liverpool, although they play a pressing game, they don’t stop teams playing by falling over and trying to get people booked. I think there’s a bit of dark arts about Madrid. That helps Madrid as well, I think</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Lawrenson reveals how a viewer alerted him to get treated for a cancer scare]</b> Towards the end of last season, the editor of Football Focus received an email from a viewer saying they had seen me on TV and noticed I had a bit of dark skin on the left side of my face. Their message was I needed to get rid of it, or at least get it checked out urgently. I was already aware of the blemish and was planning to get an appointment about it, but like a typical 60-year-old bloke, I had been putting it off rather than sorting it out. That email was the kick up the backside I needed. I went to get it looked at immediately, and it was cancerous, so I had it whipped out straight away. I would urge anyone with any similar doubts about a mark on their skin not to wait, and to do the same</p>

  <p><b>[Former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson believes that a 0-0 draw at Anfield will suit Jurgen Klopp’s men]</b> Bayern are still a good side and they are well-organised and clever. They had clearly done their homework and made very few mistakes defensively at Anfield, and at the back they read the game very well. But they never really looked like getting an away goal, which means there is a good chance they will have to win the return on 13 March to go through. If they go on the attack at any time, they have to be very wary of Liverpool’s threat on the counter. It means the tie is left perfectly balanced. I am sure Bayern will believe the scenario suits them, but I would be confident Klopp’s side can go there and score, which is another reason why drawing 0-0 is not the worst result in the world.<br /><br /><b>[Lawrenson praised Bayern’s defence against Liverpool]</b> The reason this Champions League last-16 first leg was so cagey was not down to the Reds. It was because of Bayern’s defensive game plan, and how well they executed it. I am not expecting their tactics to be dramatically different in the second leg next month but, even if the Bundesliga champions only push on a little more at home, that will suit Liverpool’s strength on the counter-attack</p>

  <p><b>[Finishing second in the Premier League title race behind Manchester City would not undermine Jurgen Klopp’s achievements]</b> Finishing second would be tough to take, but it wouldn’t undermine Klopp at all. He’s seriously improved every player at the club, which is a feat in itself. I remember, when he came to Liverpool, saying that a lot of the other teams in the league would be thinking they wished they’d got him. What you see is what you get with Jurgen. He gets the football club, he gets the history. Quite a few of the managers in the past have tried to play the history down, as if it weighed a little too heavy on their shoulders, and didn’t like having the former players around. But Klopp gets it. Every time you go to the training ground, he laughs and says ‘here they are again, the winners’. He always stops for a chat and picks your brain about the club. He’s embraced it. So his job has been about more than winning this title. Though it’d be nice for him to win it, because every time he’s asked about not winning something with Liverpool, I’m sure he’s wanted to chin whoever’s asked it.<br /><br />I think Liverpool will get past Porto. I was at the home game, and Porto looked average, they couldn’t cope with the intensity of a top team. Then you have to believe it would be Barcelona in the semis. That would be just wow. Having played in many European nights, they’re always fabulous, but that would be way, way up there, the game at Anfield. Just the fact that it’s Lionel Messi, the greatest player ever born. But also Luis Suarez coming back. That tie would be 50-50, but Klopp has an unbelievable record over two legs with Liverpool</p>

  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk is performing at a level similar to that enjoyed when John Terry and Tony Adams were at their peak]</b> We know about Van Dijk’s ability and his leadership but the most impressive thing is that he has played with a succession of different centre-back partners this season: Dejan Lovren, Joe Gomez, Joel Matip and even Fabinho. Has it affected the team? No, because it is all about him. Honestly, he is so good, he is at that moment where John Terry and Tony Adams were at their peak - where you can play anybody with them and it doesn’t make any difference whatsoever.<br /><br />For Van Dijk to have a season where no-one has dribbled past him is just unbelievable. I know that on its own does not make you the best player in the Premier League but it shows how good a defender he is. It is an incredible statistic. As good as Sterling has been, I would actually have Bernardo Silva and <b>[Sergio]</b> Aguero in front of him in terms of their importance for City. I like quite a few Wolves players too but Raul Jimenez has been unreal. In the first half of the season he was getting in positions but not finishing the chances, but that all changed after Christmas</p>

  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk has moved above Real Madrid skipper Sergio Ramos in the pecking order of the world’s best defenders]</b> He’s very much up there in the pantheon of the players that they <b>[Liverpool]</b> have had. You look at the two full-backs as well <b>[Andy Roberson and <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a>]</b>, they have been brilliant. The goalkeeper <b>[Alisson]</b> has been outstanding. Whoever has played with Van Dijk has been really good - whether that be <b>[Joel]</b> Matip, <b>[Joe]</b> Gomez or <b>[Dejan]</b> Lovren. Everywhere you look around that team, the manager <b>[Jurgen Klopp]</b> has improved every single player. I don’t think he gets the plaudits and appreciation for what he has done with the team.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed further on whether Van Dijk can now be considered to have topped Madrid captain Ramos]</b> Easy. There are no dark arts with Van Dijk<br /><br />There were. But they are all looking at it now and thinking we could get £200m for him. Liverpool, I wouldn’t say they took a chance, but they probably thought they had to pay a little bit over the odds. But it’s worked out. His progression has been absolutely fabulous and he’s made it look so seamless. The biggest bonus that Liverpool have got is not just his ability, it’s that he really is a leader of the team. I know Jordan Henderson is the captain, but Van Dijk is the leader out of this current crop of players<br /><br /><b>[Asked if the Liverpool man is deserving of a place at the top of the Premier League pile]</b> Absolutely. I thought he might have got both, I really did. Good luck to Raheem Sterling, who has got the journos one, but I thought Van Dijk might have got both<br /><br />The trophy is still elusive and the more they don’t win one, everyone says they still haven’t won a trophy. But at the start of the season, all <b>[owners]</b> FSG will have said to Klopp is ‘get Champions League football’. They have got that weeks and weeks ago. They made £100m profit last year. Yes, of course Klopp would love to win a trophy but it is what it is. Is he not as good a manager because he has not won a trophy? No. He has improved every single player. With Klopp, he would love to win a trophy because a) that means everyone has won a trophy at Liverpool and b) it will stop everyone saying ‘you’ve not won a trophy’. If Liverpool finish on 97 points and City have 98, they deserve to win it. But it has been an absolutely unbelievable season for Liverpool</p>

  <p><b>[Quizzed on whether the Reds boss could single out Messi for special treatment]</b> No, I think he’s going to play to his strengths as he would do in the Premier League. If you stick somebody on Messi, you are uprooting the way that they play and complicating matters. I think he’ll just look for the nearest player to Messi to try and stop him as best you can. The strength of Liverpool would arguably be the front three, two attacking full-backs, so why ask them to do something that they are not particularly good at, or not as good at? If Liverpool have got the ball, then Messi hasn’t got it. They are very much on the front foot Liverpool and Klopp is of such a mindset that why would he change it? He very rarely changes anything. He’s normally 4-3-3, he might occasionally go 4-3-1-2, that might be a possibility. But his strength is really going forward so why would you go to somewhere like Barcelona and not hit them with your strength? It doesn’t really make footballing sense<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on what would represent a good result for Liverpool]</b> The thing is, we’re talking about Messi and Barcelona, but they will be talking about Liverpool’s front three. As good a side as they are, they are not naive enough to think that they can just turn up and play. I think both teams will be looking at it and thinking they can win, which is respect from both of them<br /><br /><b>[On the importance of the 27-year-old Roberto Firmino being fit]</b> He is very much the conduit between the three of them. Not as spectacular as <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane and Salah, doesn’t score as many goals, but just as important to the team and the manager. The rest of the players understand his role as well and appreciate it<br /><br /><b>[Mane and Salah have been providing the attacking spark for Liverpool]</b> Absolutely fine. How many goals has he scored? He got 44 last year. We all said at the start of the year that if he gets to 15 he’ll have done brilliantly. It’s the world we live in isn’t it? Because he wasn’t scoring a goal every single week, people think there’s something wrong with him and he’s not quite the same. He’s still been outstanding. The bottom line with those three is the total of goals they score. That’s been phenomenal. Tell me another three who have scored as many goals<br /><br /><b>[Asked if the selfish streak sometimes displayed by Salah should be of any concern]</b> That was more a case when he needed his 50th <b>[Premier League goal for the club]</b>. There is always a little bit of that - I can score, I can score - but I think the other players appreciate how good he is. Also, he’s not just a goalscorer, he’s a very good player, as everyone knows</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool don’t need Coutinho back]</b> I don’t think you can say that any team is lacking in areas if they get 97 points. They have over-performed. They might need another left-back to cover Andy Robertson, they are alright at centre-back, they are alright at right-back. Maybe a bit more of an attacking midfield player, or a No. 10. I don’t think he will sign many players. I wouldn’t expect more than two or three maximum. We have also seen with Klopp that he will wait until the right player is available. He just doesn’t like getting players for the sake of it. Recruitment now is massive at this level and his recruitment of players has been outstanding.<br /><br />It’s not necessarily bridges burned, I just don’t think they need him back. I think Coutinho needs to be the number one player in the team, which is why he has struggled a little bit at Barca. If Chelsea suddenly said give us £100m for Eden Hazard, you would take him in a heartbeat. But I think he might be learning Spanish as we speak!<br /><br />I think the days of selling <b>[Luis]</b> Suarez etc are all gone. Where would you go? Would you go to Madrid at the moment? I’m not sure you would because they have made a real mess of it this season. Barcelona? Possibly. You could be talking about a side that has been in consecutive Champions League finals, so why would you go anywhere else?<br /><br />Nobody really mentions the owners, but they have been great when you think about what they have done, how they have backed the manager. They signed him in the first place, which was massive. They built the new stand, possible adaptation of one of the other stands as well, the amount of money that they are making for the football club. It’s all very, very good and long may it continue</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool comeback against Barcelona would top Istanbul and be greatest result ever]</b> If Liverpool come out of Tuesday’s second leg against Barcelona and they are in the Champions League final, it would be the Reds’ greatest result ever. They have obviously had some big ones before and I have been there to play in or watch most of them, but because of the way Barcelona are, and particularly because of the genius of Lionel Messi, if Jurgen Klopp’s side get through this tie then this would be a recovery like nothing else I have seen before. Of course people will read that and ask ‘what about Istanbul?’ - when Liverpool famously fought back from being 3-0 down at half-time against AC Milan to win the 2005 Champions League final, but that was slightly different. That performance was absolutely brilliant, but it basically was just down to them gambling everything to get back in the game and throwing everyone forward. Do that again this time, and the tie will probably be over within a matter of minutes.<br /><br />The problem in talking about why Liverpool have still got a chance is that also you have to remember why they are in this position in the first place - Lionel Messi. Clearly Liverpool need to score some goals, but they also need to stop him, somehow. To do that, they will need to play in Barcelona’s half as much as possible because, as brilliant as Messi is, I haven’t seen him score from his own half yet. If Liverpool do manage to get some control of the game, and see lots of the ball in Barca’s territory, then it is possible that they can negate Messi a bit. But, even if that works, you just know there will be a spell in the game where he will come alive and then it will be a case of ‘hang on to your hats’</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp’s fantasy football at Liverpool will help to bring more top talent to Anfield]</b> He’s a perfect fit for the club. And I think players around the world are looking at Liverpool now and thinking ‘wow, I’d love to play for Klopp’. He is a massive sell for the club. He alone attracts players. Any player would love to play for him. I’m 61 and I’d love to play for him. He is creating something very special at Liverpool, and on Tuesday night he and his players created a night like no other. Fantasy football on a fantasy night<br /><br />Maybe Klopp sowed the seed when he told his players ‘it might just be possible’. And that’s the thing with Jurgen Klopp, he gets everything out his players, literally everything, and he makes every one of them better. Sometimes the most important people at a club are the players who don’t play regularly, because they’re the ones who can cause you problems. But Klopp does not allow that to happen. He takes no shit. He’s all the players’ friend, but he’s not their best friend. That’s the difference. He loses it on occasion too, and that keeps them on their toes. You cannot have performances like Tuesday night’s without all the players being in it together. You can see the camaraderie, and while those who aren’t playing might be miffed, you can see how pleased they are for the ones who do. That’s why that sense of team is so massive in the club. And that’s what Klopp has helped create</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool should be looking to lure Reece James away from Premier League rivals Chelsea]</b> Recruitment is the biggest thing for any club now and I don’t think Klopp will go mad in the transfer market this summer. But I tell you who I’ve seen - and I don’t think they could easily get him - the right-back at Wigan, on loan from Chelsea, Reece James. In that league he makes it look so ridiculously easy. I think he could make the step up. But of course he belongs to Chelsea at the moment.<br /><br />If you can spend £75m on one player, but nick someone else on the cheap and put the two together then it can be good business. The thing with Andy Robertson is they sold Kevin Stewart to Hull didn’t they. It was virtually pound for pound so what a fantastic deal that was</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have been urged to rekindle their interest in <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> midfielder Nabil Fekir]</b> When you look at this season, you can praise both of the top two teams together. One of them <b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> has edged an unbelievably good title race, rather than the other failing and losing it somewhere. That is why it is difficult to look through the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team and say they need to sign this or that to make sure it is a different story next year. They will need another left-back as back-up to Andy Robertson because Alberto Moreno is leaving in the summer, and <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> cannot expect James Milner to play there regularly. But it is not like the last couple of summers when it has been easy to identify what this team needs to improve it. In 2017 it was a centre-half, and <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> arrived the following January, while in 2018 it was a goalkeeper, and Alisson was the answer.<br /><br />Those problems have been solved, so primarily you are looking at adding depth in a few positions - at centre-half, or up front. You might argue that they don’t really need any one position desperately, but I think it would be nice if they could get an attacking midfield player, of the sort they have not had since <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> left for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in January 2018. A criticism I heard a lot, particularly earlier in the season, was that with <a href="alex-oxlade-chamberlain.html">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> sidelined, all of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s midfielders were too similar, and not good enough at opening up defences. I am talking about bringing in someone with a bit more creativity, like <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>’s Nabil Fekir, who they were going to buy last summer until the move fell through. The way the season has gone, you could not say they have missed him, but in future, they will have to look at having more ways to win games, especially against teams who just sit in</p>

But if people are thinking there are going to be five or six new players, I don’t see that. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> might need another left-back with <b>[Alberto]</b> Moreno going, because if <a href="andy-robertson.html">Andy Robertson</a> was out for two to three months, would you be happy with <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a> in there? This is where <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have to get a little bit closer to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, who just have world-class replacements everywhere.

They tried to get Nabil Fekir, which didn’t happen because of his knee, but that kind of player would be good.<br /><br /><b>[Whoever is targeted, Lawrenson believes <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> are in a good place after bringing a seven-year wait for major silverware to a close]</b> I’m obviously delighted and as much as anything for <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>. For <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, it was a little bit of a crossroads after having lost six finals in a row. It doesn’t matter how mentally strong you are as a manager, you have to start to question yourself when you have lost a series of big finals. You got a sense of that when he said that it was very important he won this one for his family, because they have had to go through it with him</p>

  <p><b>[The best right-back in the world? How <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> is reinventing the full-back]</b> This isn’t new, you know. What Trent has done is take it to a new level. It’s his mobility; his passing ability; his pace. His service from wide areas is fabulous. He gets his head up to have a look, and if on the odd occasion he doesn’t have time to do that, he’ll deliver right into the corridor of uncertainty.<br /><br />He has developed this whipped delivery which is really difficult to defend. When <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s centre-backs have the ball, both full-backs have their feet on the touchline, so it’s very hard for three opposition forwards against four defenders who are all very comfortable on the ball<br /><br />Trent practises every day, staying behind after training - and not just for a few minutes. We’re talking hours, setting up drills with players and coaches<br /><br />Trent was always the first name on the coaches’ lips - ‘We’ve got this right-back and he’s going to be some player’. It wasn’t just ability, but the way he got his head down and worked hard, and the way he lived his life.<br /><br />Any test, basically, he has managed to overcome. He had a bit of a wobble, but his mental strength is huge. That is worked on from an early age in the academy. When you move back from midfield to full-back, you think, ‘Crikey, I’ve got so much space to play. I must have leprosy, because no one’s come anywhere near me’. Your game intelligence becomes so much higher as you know what the person in those other positions has to cope with, so you know when to make a pass or a forward run.<br /><br /><b>[There is a school of thought that, such is his success at right-back, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s No.66 might revert to his original midfield berth one day. Mark Lawrenson doesn’t agree]</b> They’ve engineered a way of giving him space, meaning he has so much room to move into at pace - and once he’s got half a yard, you’re never going to catch him - so why would you change?<br /><br />The fans sing, ‘He’s the Scouser in our team’. You can show local lads Trent and say, ‘This kid has come from nowhere and is playing every week’. He’s making this position cool. That’s the best description I’ve heard</p>

It’s fantastic. When <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> came to the club, you felt this sea change. Within months you knew this was something completely different.
