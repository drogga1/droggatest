  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> target Diego Carlos says I’ll only leave <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> for much bigger club]</b> I’m very happy at <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a>. I really like the club and the city. The city is wonderful. We love it, my family and me. Coming to Seville is already taking a very big leap. If I ever leave <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a>, it would be to go to a much bigger club, because <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> is already great. My agent doesn’t talk to me about those situations. I am not interested in knowing about other teams. I always tell him that if he is going to tell me something, it must be something firm, that he does not come to me with stories, because I must focus on <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a>. I don’t want those things to cause a distraction<br /><br /><b>[Asked to pick out some memorable opponents from the past, he thought of <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> star <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Edinson Cavani</a> and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> forward <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a>]</b> <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Cavani</a>. He is very strong, he hits from anywhere, he never stops, he gives the defense a lot of work, he always went back to help his team-mates, despite his age<br /><br />Suarez. He is very intelligent, very expert. He knows how to position himself when he receives the ball and the defenders must be careful</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> defender Diego Carlos addresses <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> transfer links]</b> I don’t know if <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> wants me. There is a lot of news that comes out and that we see, but I don’t know. What I think about is to finish the league as good as possible and I leave that for later. They are very serious things for me and these situations must be left for later. I am focused exclusively on playing and finishing the season with <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> as good as possible<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> should be handed a place at Europe’s top table if it is unsafe for football to resume]</b> It is a very complicated situation and we do not decide. If the Federation says so, it is only fair because we were third, with more points. The table has been like that for a while and, if <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> ends now, we must keep that reward</p>
