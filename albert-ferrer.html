  <p><b>[On <a href="gianfranco-zola.html">Gianfranco Zola</a>]</b> What a phenomenon. So much quality, an eye for goal and a great brain. One of the greatest deep-lying forwards of all time despite being even shorter than me, though that’s something he always argued about! I remember one goal he scored against <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a>, a back-heeled volley between his legs direct from a corner. Typical Gianfran</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="marcel-desailly.html">Marcel Desailly</a>]</b> So powerful, like a rock. Marcel was one of the strongest players I have ever seen and the finished article as a defender. Had great positional awareness and you always felt secure with him next to you. Could also slot into midfield without any trouble</p>

  <p><b>[Brazil legend <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> has revealed that he never wanted to leave <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> back in 1997]</b> I don’t know exactly what the causes were, whether it was something personal or not, but it’s true that within the squad it was a little strange when we were told he wasn’t going to be with us, because his performances that year were spectacular</p>
