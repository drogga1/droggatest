  <p><b>[Jordi Alba ranks Iker Casillas as one of the best three goalkeepers in the world]</b> We know the quality of Iker and we are with him all the away. For me, he is one of the best three or four goalkeepers in the world. It’s not only me who thinks this, either.<br /><br />Everything went perfectly in that final. But Italy are always difficult to beat. They’re a team with a really strong spine</p>

We always look for each other to score goals and today we have done it twice.<br /><br />I hope we have Leo for a while, he has been at a spectacular level for 12 years. We hope he will continue having them and that the fans will enjoy it</p>

  <p><b>[Lionel Messi is a unique talent]</b> Finding another Leo is very complicated. There are great players here with whom I also understand perfectly, but above all we will have to wait and see how the coach wants to play.<br /><br />He is a special player and the only one of his kind at Barcelona. I have enjoyed playing with him since 2012 and he is a vital player for us, both in the national team and at Barcelona. He is having a magnificent season and we are better on the pitch with him. We must make sure he is healthy as he is vital to helping us win titles here and with Barcelona</p>

When Messi is playing there are always more chances to win games.<br /><br /><b>[On Sergio Busquets]</b> He is a crucial player for us. He gives us balance, with the ball he is the number one, in defence too, we hope he’s with us<br /><br /><b>[On Samuel Umtiti]</b> He’s a player who has grown a lot since he came to Barca. He’s a top player who makes us better and is committed to the team. Another thing is what he says and when he says it, and we have to respect that</p>

  <p><b>[What is Spain boss Luis Enrique’s problem with Barcelona star Jordi Alba?]</b> Of course, the decision surprises me. It is not something that I expected. I don’t know why I’m not going. I can tell when I’m bad and when I’m good, too. I’d like to go to the national team but it’s the coach’s decision and I have to respect it. At this moment, both Marcos Alonso and Jose Luis Gaya will represent the national team and they are two great players. It isn’t down to me if a coach calls me up or not. It’s a decision he’s made. I don’t have any problem with anyone on a professional level.</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona full-back Jordi Alba has admitted that he is disappointed by the lack of progress on a contract renewal]</b> I have no news. I don’t know what the club think of me and it’s strange because there’s not much more of my contract left. My intentions are to finish my career here but we’ll see as I don’t know what their intentions are or when they think it will be convenient to call me.<br /><br /><b>[Demeble’s 90th-minute strike cancelled out Diego Costa’s earlier strike in the table-topping clash to ensure that Barca remained a point ahead of their rivals]</b> We tried to create much more than them. But it wasn’t easy to get into the danger areas. We would’ve liked to win, but the match was a draw and that’s good in the end. They have players who can attack more. But Simeone’s style gives them a lot of success so they won’t change</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona star Jordi Alba says, accusing the award of favouritism towards Real Madrid players]</b> The Ballon d’Or is a lie, there are many club and press campaigns <b>[surrounding it]</b>. Everyone knows that Messi is the best player in the world by far. If Cristiano was still at Real Madrid he’d get the Ballon d’Or. There were many fans and journalists who wanted Cristiano to get the Ballon d’Or when he was in Real Madrid. Well, Cristiano left… and Modric gets it.</p>

As the years have passed I have kept growing and I notice the affection from the fans even more. I have always seen myself in Barcelona and my dream is to retire here. It’s obvious that my dream is to stay at Barcelona. It’s cost too much to get here to then have to leave. I have my family here, their support, the fans and my teammates. I don’t think I’d be happier anywhere else.</p>

  <p><b>[Jordi Alba says Barcelona star is ‘better than before’]</b> For me, Leo hasn’t changed. Our relationship has always been the same, he is very good. We have been playing together for seven years. He has made me a better footballer. As for his game, he’s even better than before, which could seem impossible because he was already the best in the world! He is above all other footballers by a huge margin.<br /><br />I like making jokes and setting the mood in the locker room. That’s important when you know that you spend a lot of time together. It makes everyday life more fun and enjoyable. The core of the team has been there for quite a few years now and I am one of the oldest. I grew up a lot at this club</p>

  <p><b>[Jordi Alba has expressed his disappointment at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> fans]</b> No one likes to play poorly or how we’re playing at the moment, but I don’t like it when in the 15th minute with the score goalless there are whistles. No one likes it when the fans go against you, especially in your own stadium. Our attitude is good and all the players are giving everything out on the pitch. I’m not going to hide. Just as I respect everyone, they also have to respect me. I respect <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> fans a lot. Even falling <b>[early]</b> in the Champions League <b>[in recent seasons]</b>, they have stuck with the team. It’s not easy when things are not coming off, but we have to live with that at the end of the day. We know that if we’re not at our best, it’s going to be hard. We have to be strong mentally to turn the situation around<br /><br />It’s as if Sarabia killed someone. Can the coaching staff not express themselves as they want? The comments he made are the most normal in the world. He lives the game intensely, he didn’t show a lack of respect to anyone. I would have done the same in his position - or worse. We’re not annoyed, not at all</p>

Seeing Leo with the enthusiasm he’s come back with is contagious for the rest of the group. I see the team as having a lot of enthusiasm. Mentally and physically we players have come back really well I would say, even better than we were before<br /><br /><b>[On a possible <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>’s return]</b> He’s clearly a unique player and he gave us a lot.
