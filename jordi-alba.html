The <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> quartet of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba have been named in <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> 19’s Ultimate Team La Liga Team of the Season. Between the posts, <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>’s Jan Oblak, who kept 20 clean sheets in 37 league appearances, is protected by a back four of Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba alongside Sevilla wing-back Jesus Navas and <a href="getafe-fc.html">Getafe</a> centre-back Djene. In the centre of the park, Pablo Sarabia is another representative of Sevilla, while Valencia’s Daniel Parejo and Sergio Canales of Real Betis make up the midfield three</p>

  <p><b>[Jordi Alba has expressed his disappointment at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> fans]</b> No one likes to play poorly or how we’re playing at the moment, but I don’t like it when in the 15th minute with the score goalless there are whistles. No one likes it when the fans go against you, especially in your own stadium. Our attitude is good and all the players are giving everything out on the pitch. I’m not going to hide. Just as I respect everyone, they also have to respect me. I respect <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> fans a lot. Even falling <b>[early]</b> in the Champions League <b>[in recent seasons]</b>, they have stuck with the team. It’s not easy when things are not coming off, but we have to live with that at the end of the day. We know that if we’re not at our best, it’s going to be hard. We have to be strong mentally to turn the situation around<br /><br />It’s as if Sarabia killed someone. Can the coaching staff not express themselves as they want? The comments he made are the most normal in the world. He lives the game intensely, he didn’t show a lack of respect to anyone. I would have done the same in his position - or worse. We’re not annoyed, not at all</p>

  <p><b>[Jordi Alba says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s enthusiasm is driving <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> squad]</b> He’s a vital player of us and we should enjoy having him all the time. Seeing Leo with the enthusiasm he’s come back with is contagious for the rest of the group. I see the team as having a lot of enthusiasm. Mentally and physically we players have come back really well I would say, even better than we were before<br /><br /><b>[On a possible <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>’s return]</b> He’s clearly a unique player and he gave us a lot. He chose and looked for other goals</p>
