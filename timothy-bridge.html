<blockquote>
  <p>[What is the ‘Cristiano Ronaldo Effect’?] The reasoning behind signing Ronaldo will have been two-fold. Firstly, it will be about trying to ensure that they not just maintain but raise the level of their on-field performances over the past few years. They believe that, even at 33, Ronaldo can win them the Champions League. Anyone who’s watched Juve’s Netflix documentary will know that European success is their primary aim. They’ve won Serie A seven years in a row; now they want the Champions League. And they, quite understandably, believe that Ronaldo can help them do it.<br /><br />At the same time, though, in an era in which Serie A wasn’t providing Juventus with the global exposure that clubs in the Premier League and the top two in Spain are enjoying, I think Ronaldo’s signing has to be read as a key part of an internationalisation strategy on the part of Juve. This transfer is about making Juve as attractive as possible to both fans across the world and potential commercial partners, with the aim of increasing revenue and moving up the Deloitte Football Money League. Ronaldo is still one of the best players in the world, if not the best, and that brings credibility. But he’s also undeniably the biggest draw in world football and that brings with it greater commercial revenue opportunities, which is where Juve still lag behind the game’s superpowers: Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United. So, fans want to follow him and, consequently, companies want to be associated with him. New commercial opportunities - that’s where the real value lies for Juve because, as we’ve already seen, they’ve experienced a massive spike in their social media following over the past month.<br /><br />[Ronaldo Economics] He’s one of the best known celebrities in the world and that has a massive value because more and more football fans nowadays follow players rather than teams. They either love the way they play the game or just love the personality, the image, and nobody has a better image than Ronaldo, so they’ll pay just to watch his games<br /><br />Ronaldo is obviously a major box-office draw. Some people will come to matches just to see him alone, firstly because he’s such a superstar, and secondly because, at 33, there might not be many more opportunities to see him again in the future. Even fans of other clubs in other leagues are keen to see ‘the Ronaldo effect’ in action; they want to know what impact this phenomenon can have on the Italian game. And that’s a global phenomenon, too, meaning Ronaldo has opened up new markets for Juventus and for Italian football</p>
