      <td>Richard Hamsik had waited long enough. His 15-year-old son, Marek, was doing well with the small Slovakian club Jupie Podlavice but Sparta Prague, who had shown an interest in him, were taking too long to conclude a deal to sign him<br /><br />Slovan Bratislava were another option for young Marek but they could not afford the €5,000 fee Jupie Podlavice were demanding and that is when Hamsik Sr took the decision to raise the money himself<br /><br />He borrowed part of it from two good friends and then, to get to €5,000, he sold the family car, a Skoda Felicia. Losing the car, however, was not the only hardship Hamsik had to endure to see his son succeed. To make matters worse, when the family travelled the 212 kilometres to Bratislava for training, the car they had borrowed had only two seats so Marek’s mother and Marek were in the front and his father had to sit in the back</td>

  <p><b>[Richard Hamsik talks about his dedication to his country. Note: September 2011 his relationship with the Slovakia fans hit a new low when, after a terrible 4-0 home defeat by Armenia, he was insulted by home supporters during a television interview. They felt that he was not working hard enough]</b> Since I started playing for the national team <b>[in February 2007 against Poland]</b>, I have always tried to put maximum effort in. I always did everything for our colours. For me, it is an honour to wear the shirt with a double cross on the chest. Of course I am aware that sometimes my performances were far from ideal. However, over the last two or three years, I have had more success with the national team <b>[as well as with Napoli]</b>. I think that Slovakia fans are more satisfied with my game now<br /><br /><b>[Hamsik’s improvement for Slovakia was aided by the appointment of Jan Kozak as national coach in July 2013. Previously, he had been deployed in a variety of positions but Kozak made him the main man, with a licence to roam]</b> I was given a freedom and I try to use it as much as possible. Of course, it is a sign of coach Kozak’s belief in my skills. On the other side, I now have bigger responsibility and I have to work really well with all my team-mates. Now I can go a little deeper to collect the ball and try to start attacks by finding my team-mates<br /><br /><b>[Asked about England before the game in Saint-Étienne, he picks out <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> as his favourite player]</b> I admire his playing style a lot. He is a world‑class player. The English team is going through a big change in regard to the players. There is a new generation coming through and there is a perfect blend of young and old. I am not sure if there is a player with the same characteristics as me. In the past the press has often compared me to <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> but I don’t know if that is true or not<br /><br /><b>[He is happy there despite being robbed at gunpoint not once but twice in the city. The first time was in 2008, the second five years later]</b> I have been playing there for nine years now, so <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> is like a second home for me. I am happy that I am there and that I have achieved a lot during my spell there<br /><br />We will see what happens during the summer but at the moment I am set to stay at <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>. <b>[A move away]</b> is talked about through the whole year <b>[in the press]</b>. I do not have problem with that, but I have a contract with <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a><br /><br /><b>[Would he consider a move to England if there was an offer?]</b> I don’t know. A lot of journalists have linked me with English teams many times in the past. The saying goes that there is no smoke without fire but I can say that I have never had a concrete offer from England</p>

  <p><b>[Marek Hamsik Would Consider Old Trafford Move]</b> That’s hard to say. It would definitely be the hardest decision in my career. Maybe everyone wants to play at these clubs, but I can’t answer that. I think that <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> are one of the top 10 European teams in terms of game play and performance<br /><br />As a footballer, it’s hard because you never know what comes next. I’ve still got a long time to go on my contract and I cannot see into the future. I’m not thinking about leaving Naples</p>
