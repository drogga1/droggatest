It is about team spirit and a good team performance.<br /><br />I think if I could score as many goals as Robert Vittek in South Africa I’d be really happy. But whether it’s myself or other players, it doesn’t matter. We have to keep our feet on the ground, and it’s not about myself.

  <p><b>[Richard Hamsik talks about his dedication to his country. Note: September 2011 his relationship with the Slovakia fans hit a new low when, after a terrible 4-0 home defeat by Armenia, he was insulted by home supporters during a television interview. They felt that he was not working hard enough]</b> Since I started playing for the national team <b>[in February 2007 against Poland]</b>, I have always tried to put maximum effort in. I always did everything for our colours. For me, it is an honour to wear the shirt with a double cross on the chest. Of course I am aware that sometimes my performances were far from ideal. However, over the last two or three years, I have had more success with the national team <b>[as well as with <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>]</b>. I think that Slovakia fans are more satisfied with my game now<br /><br /><b>[Hamsik’s improvement for Slovakia was aided by the appointment of Jan Kozak as national coach in July 2013. Previously, he had been deployed in a variety of positions but Kozak made him the main man, with a licence to roam]</b> I was given a freedom and I try to use it as much as possible. Of course, it is a sign of coach Kozak’s belief in my skills. On the other side, I now have bigger responsibility and I have to work really well with all my team-mates. Now I can go a little deeper to collect the ball and try to start attacks by finding my team-mates<br /><br /><b>[Asked about England before the game in Saint-Étienne, he picks out <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> as his favourite player]</b> I admire his playing style a lot. He is a world‑class player. The English team is going through a big change in regard to the players. There is a new generation coming through and there is a perfect blend of young and old. I am not sure if there is a player with the same characteristics as me. In the past the press has often compared me to <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> but I don’t know if that is true or not<br /><br /><b>[He is happy there despite being robbed at gunpoint not once but twice in the city. The first time was in 2008, the second five years later]</b> I have been playing there for nine years now, so <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> is like a second home for me. I am happy that I am there and that I have achieved a lot during my spell there<br /><br />We will see what happens during the summer but at the moment I am set to stay at <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>. <b>[A move away]</b> is talked about through the whole year <b>[in the press]</b>. I do not have problem with that, but I have a contract with <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a><br /><br /><b>[Would he consider a move to England if there was an offer?]</b> I don’t know. A lot of journalists have linked me with English teams many times in the past. The saying goes that there is no smoke without fire but I can say that I have never had a concrete offer from England</p>

  <p><b>[Hamsik’s father, Richard, has suggested Chinese Super League sides already expressed an interest]</b> The interest is serious but negotiations aren’t easy. For three years Marek has dismissed any idea of leaving, only focusing on winning the Scudetto with Napoli, but they’ve failed to do that again. The problem is that it’s not the main transfer window in China right now, that only happens in winter. So the first question, therefore, is when he would leave for China. Clubs have different ideas, the Asian season is up and running and Chinese teams have limits on the number of foreigners in their squad. Another thing is that Marek still has a three-year contract in Naples, so it’s all in the hands of his agents and his employer. Right now I see it as being 60-40 in favour of his departure to China. Now Marek’s agent, Juraj Venglos, is going to talk to the president of the club.</p>

  <p><b>[New Juventus signing Cristiano Ronaldo will need assistance if he is to elevate the Turin club to Champions League winners]</b> A single player, only one, never wins anything - even if you’re the best in the world. If you’re not Diego Maradona, you can’t win matches alone<br /><br /><b>[Maradona’s presence in Napoli from 1984 to 1991 heralded the club’s golden age]</b> We are always those same guys, one year older, interesting signings and team-mate who are returning from the serious injuries that stole them away from us last season. The coup is Ancelotti, if you don’t mind me saying. Napoli has landed the most successful coach available. When Ancelotti told me that he wanted to take us over, he gave me more motivation<br /><br />This is a team that has gone very close to the dream twice, which is back in the Champions League. Lorenzo Insigne is one of the strongest players around at the moment. And if you’re the best player in a country like this, you’re a top player. Kalidou Koulibaly is valued at €100m, so if that’s his price, what would you call him? Then we will see what Piotr Zielinski will become: he’s a talent in its purest form. And they you can add Dries Mertens, who has scored how many goals in the last two years? Someone who scores 50 goals in a couple of seasons is what if not a top player?</p>
