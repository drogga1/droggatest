  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain only have themselves to blame for inspiring a Champions League miracle from Barcelona]</b> They’re young and I think they lacked humility. In football, things change quickly, and it came back to haunt them. You have to wait for the end of both 90-minute matches.<br /><br />There wasn’t only them. You can be happy to win 4-0, but you have to stay humble. A little message is fine, but there is still a second leg. You mustn’t get carried away. When you have gone through to the next round, you can put out a few little things, but for me it was a lack of respect. I can tell you the dressing room was very angry about that. Even the wives of the players, such as Marquinhos’, who put a photo of her showing four fingers with her dog. Those are the little things that really annoyed the dressing room and that’s why we really, really wanted to pull off the ‘remontada’ <b>[comeback]</b>.</p>
