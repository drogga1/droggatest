  <p><b>[Former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and Lazio goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi sadly admits that Italy have no adequate cover for Gianluigi Buffon]</b> The crisis is there for anyone to see, and the gap in class between <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a> and the rest of the pack is massive, but I think it is partly his fault, because he is the best in the world and no one can stand up to him<br /><br />Is it because one too many foreign ‘keepers are landing in Italy? Yes, Italian ones have clearly less opportunities to shine, but I can understand how the clubs think. If a talented 18-year-old goalkeeper is already worth €4m, they are better suited going to South America and capture an already seasoned shot-stopper.<br /><br />We must correct the mistakes that have been done over the past few years and rebuild our excellent school. It was the best until some twenty years ago, but then something happened. Too many youngsters are benched after a single blunder nowadays and that puts too much pressure on them</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> goalkeeper and current Italy goalkeeping coach Angelo Peruzzi believes <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Gianluigi Buffon</a> is better than Inter custodian Julio Cesar]</b> Julio Cesar is very good, but for me the strongest is still <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a>. I think those who criticised him went over the top as you have to expect that he wasn’t the real <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a> after being out with injury for three months. I think <a href="alessandro-del-piero.html">Del Piero</a> is fantastic and he has always been a protagonist over the years. I still think we will see him with La Nazionale</p>

  <p><b>[Angelo Peruzzi, the ex-Juventus and Lazio ‘keeper, has opined on the season ahead and believes that the Old Lady will be a real force to be reckoned with]</b> <b>[Juventus have]</b> a strong, compact and well-matched squad. Above all, the midfield is particularly impressive for solidity, quality and the number of options. I don’t think it is inferior even to the great <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. I think he is keeping a low profile, which is ideal for a coach. He knows his football and has clear ideas. He doesn’t lack anything that will stop him from winning again.

Obviously the Champions League will be more difficult <b>[to win than the scudetto]</b>. <b>[Del Piero]</b> is extraordinary. He isn’t young any more, but he continues to be decisive. What’s more, he keeps on scoring! <a href="claudio-marchisio.html">Marchisio</a> and De Ceglie - they will be revelations</p>

  <p><b>[Angelo Peruzzi Tips <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> To Push Inter All The Way]</b> It was an already competitive group that has been strengthened, particularly in midfield. They will do well, both in the Champions League and in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>, where they will be the main rival of favourites Inter. Ciro is a friend, but he already had his own staff.

  <p><b>[Angelo Peruzzi Pleads With Milan Star <a href="alessandro-nesta.html">Alessandro Nesta</a> To Come Out Of International Retirement]</b> Dear Sandro, you have been unable to finish a World Cup three times due to as many injuries: give it another try as it’s your last chance. <a href="alessandro-nesta.html">Nesta</a> is an exceptional man and his coherent stance shows that. He has great respect for the group and only quit because of physical problems. But now that he has overcome them and is fit, he is still among the best in the world in his role. And he would be a starter in any national side</p>
