<blockquote>
  <p>[Regarding the distortion of competition] If somebody wants to invest more money, those rules don’t allow that. So that could be the basis of a legal challenge.<br /><br />FFP at least tries to be legal. It was designed with European competition law in mind, and UEFA tried to design FFP around it. While stems such as FFP may indeed restrict competition, and may be illegal, if you can find an objective justification for them, they might be legal. And according to the case law of the European Court of Justice, maintaining competitive balance is a legitimate objective<br /><br />Some time ago the Commission said that they politically endorse FFP. Of course that’s not a legal endorsement, and the same happened with Bosman; years before Bosman the Commission said ‘We agree with this new UEFA scheme’, only for the the Court of Justice to say that’s not your business. It’s a political call but the Commission has more or less said that FFP is ok<br /><br />Some legal scholars think [a challenge] would be successful. I think UEFA is pretty sure it won’t be successful because of the way European law has been applied to sport has changed over time. We are not in [the] Bosman [era], we are not in 1995. I’m pretty sure UEFA’s legal department is relatively confident that any challenge will not be successful. We will never have an answer to that until a case goes not just to the Commission but then to the European Court of Justice. But by reading what people say and my knowledge of European law, I actually think there are more possibilities of a legal challenge under European competition law to be unsuccessful than there are to be successful</p>

  <p>[How are Man City and PSG affected by FFP allegations?] UEFA has the powers, there are regulations in place, and at the end of the day Manchester City still needs to comply with the break-even rule and FFP regulations, if they want to play in the Champions League.<br /><br />I think UEFA is the most likely, because other types of challenges are more unlikely or more difficult to see come to fruition. That would be the most likely<br /><br />[Dr Garcia believes it is unlikely, although there could be several routes La Liga could take] It is difficult. It’s all very well and good to say they are going to the EC but they didn’t actually say what it is that they are going to go to the EC with. What is it that they are going to challenge? Who are they going to challenge? Under which legal base would they challenge? So it’s lacking in details.<br /><br />Now, could they challenge the clubs for anti-competitive behaviour or abuse of dominant position? I cannot see how you can argue that. You can try, you can say that they have anti-competitive behaviour or they are having an impact on economic activity, you have all those tests under different articles, which would be really, really difficult to prove, I think. Can they go and argue that UEFA not enforcing FFP is actually distorting competition? That’s difficult but perhaps I could see that, as an argument.<br /><br />All in all I think it is difficult to see a successful challenge. However, the simple threat of a legal challenge might empower UEFA to act differently. My take on that is what La Liga is trying to do is to put political pressure on UEFA<br /><br />In the Championship we’ve seen a number of transfer embargoes, the [£40m] fine to Queens Park Rangers, but on the evidence we have no rules have been broken<br /><br />[On Fines] Fines in the European Commission on competition policy issues are very, very heavy. It could be 10 per cent of the turnover. [City’s turnover was over £500m in their most recent accounts, PSG’s €486.2m]. There are some very heavy fines in the history of the EC, like the one they imposed on Google [£3.9 billion] and Microsoft [€900m and €561m]. The commission has the power to impose very, very heavy fines, which would not strip Manchester City or PSG of any titles but which would severely, severely damage the economy of the companies<br /><br />[Wilson and Dr Garcia believe City and PSG would have grounds to challenge the very principles of UEFA’s Financial Fair Play regulations either in the Court of Arbitration for Sport or the civil courts] UEFA knows that Financial Fair Play is on shaky legal grounds and then UEFA has a decision to make, do they lower the penalty or do they impose the full penalty and then go to court and defend the full system</p>
