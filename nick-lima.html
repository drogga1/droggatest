  <p><b>[Nick Lima’s rookie season is off to a dream start]</b> It was hard to grasp at first, but it only took a few days to understand why he did it. Kevin Grimes is a phenomenal coach and a smart guy and I was up for the challenge. It took a couple of months, but by the start of my sophomore year I had embraced it. Obviously the skill set, and getting comfortable with the position takes a while. I’m still learning. There’s still stuff to learn every day, especially when you make the jump to the next level.<br /><br />There was interest when I was there, in the summer heading into my senior year, but I had heard that there was an opportunity for the homegrown route to work in San Jose. I considered making Molde work, but the biggest thing was graduating and finishing out my degree, and also getting a full college season in. I wanted to come back and finish that off, and see where the homegrown route went. it’s my home, and that’s where I grew up. I wanted to be a part of this growth in MLS, in my home country. I couldn’t be more happy<br /><br /><b>[On Jurgen Klinsmann]</b> Jurgen is one of the nicest guys I’ve ever met, and he’s been just instrumental in helping me and mentoring me in my career. He’s guided me along the process, told me pros and cons for each choice. For a guy like him, who’s been through it all at the highest levels, it’s good to get his perspective on things, and what to do, and how to interact with the team, with the community off the field, along with what to do performance wise<br /><br />I’ve seen what <b>[Rosenberry has]</b> done, obviously hats off to him, he’s a phenomenal player. I’ve always dreamt as a kid of being on the national team. If I keep performing, and if I get the opportunity and get lucky enough to get a call, I’d be ecstatic for that, but my main focus is San Jose, and worry about that stuff rolls around<br /><br />This is a talented team, and a new team, and winning an MLS Cup is definitely a possibility. There’s something special in San Jose this year. We just have to keep getting better, but it’s something we can do. I know it’s a long season, and there’ll be hiccups, but the goal is to get back into the playoffs, and making it back to MLS Cup, where San Jose has some history</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Nick Lima? The American fullback with a chance to shine at the Gold Cup]</b> It was easy at first to look at it as you’re being the victim in a situation that you shouldn’t be in. But that’s also the last way you should see it because then it stacks up on top and instead of two games not starting, or three games not starting, maybe it’s eight games or 10 games and you miss a whole season or half a season.<br /><br />Anyone in that situation is going to be taken aback by it. You’re going to be emotional, it just depends on how much. After I was, then it was ‘This sucks, I don’t want to be in this position, not starting’, and you have to just be able to step away from the emotions and make decisions that will put you in a place where you’re starting again. I just had to buckle down, it was a challenge, no different than when I went to January camp<br /><br /><b>[Lima’s 2019 began with a call-up the USMNT’s January camp as the third right back on the depth chart, behind <a href="reggie-cannon.html">Reggie Cannon</a> and <a href="kevin-keegan.html">Keegan</a> Rosenberry]</b> It’s a big role because you’re moving inside, you’re able to break lines and make dangerous passes, but you’re also able to attack the width, be dynamic on the outside going in, on the inside going out. Obviously you’re a defender shutting things down, but also creating transition moments. You can have an impact in all aspects of a game, so whomever is in that role in the system is an important player<br /><br />It’s a big platform, a big stage, and my first opportunity and I’m extremely excited about being able to help the team any way I can. As a kid, you always dream of representing your nation in tournaments, along with also playing for the biggest clubs in the world and playing in Europe. Those are the goals, and this Gold Cup is my first chance to realize that experience<br /><br /><b>[On a team with plenty of big names, such as <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a>, <a href="weston-mckennie.html">Weston McKennie</a> and <a href="michael-bradley.html">Michael Bradley</a>, Lima isn’t generating much hype heading into the Gold Cup]</b> You’re talking about two of the top players in the nation, so it’s big shoes to fill, but at the same time it’s next time up for whoever it is. It’s an exciting opportunity, and if it’s me I’ll absolutely be ready to grind</p>
