<blockquote>
  <p>[Who is Nick Lima? The American fullback with a chance to shine at the Gold Cup] It was easy at first to look at it as you’re being the victim in a situation that you shouldn’t be in. But that’s also the last way you should see it because then it stacks up on top and instead of two games not starting, or three games not starting, maybe it’s eight games or 10 games and you miss a whole season or half a season.<br /><br />Anyone in that situation is going to be taken aback by it. You’re going to be emotional, it just depends on how much. After I was, then it was ‘This sucks, I don’t want to be in this position, not starting’, and you have to just be able to step away from the emotions and make decisions that will put you in a place where you’re starting again. I just had to buckle down, it was a challenge, no different than when I went to January camp<br /><br />[Lima’s 2019 began with a call-up the USMNT’s January camp as the third right back on the depth chart, behind <a href="reggie-cannon.html">Reggie Cannon</a> and Keegan Rosenberry] It’s a big role because you’re moving inside, you’re able to break lines and make dangerous passes, but you’re also able to attack the width, be dynamic on the outside going in, on the inside going out. Obviously you’re a defender shutting things down, but also creating transition moments. You can have an impact in all aspects of a game, so whomever is in that role in the system is an important player<br /><br />It’s a big platform, a big stage, and my first opportunity and I’m extremely excited about being able to help the team any way I can. As a kid, you always dream of representing your nation in tournaments, along with also playing for the biggest clubs in the world and playing in Europe. Those are the goals, and this Gold Cup is my first chance to realize that experience<br /><br />[On a team with plenty of big names, such as <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a>, <a href="weston-mckennie.html">Weston McKennie</a> and <a href="michael-bradley.html">Michael Bradley</a>, Lima isn’t generating much hype heading into the Gold Cup] You’re talking about two of the top players in the nation, so it’s big shoes to fill, but at the same time it’s next time up for whoever it is. It’s an exciting opportunity, and if it’s me I’ll absolutely be ready to grind</p>
