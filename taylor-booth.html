  <p><b>[Bayern Munich have signed United States youth international Taylor Booth to their youth academy]</b> I’m very happy with this next step in my career. FC Bayern is one of the largest clubs in the world. Being here in Munich at the FC Bayern campus and taking the next steps in my development makes me very proud.</p>

  <p><b>[Taylor Booth is not your typical American]</b> I can play anywhere in the midfield - I prefer 8 or 10 cause I like more of an attacking role. 8 I prefer for just a free, roaming role, I can always get on the ball. I love to have the ball at my feet. I love being involved in the game, getting my teammates involved in the game and I love to be able to dictate the tempo of the game<br /><br />I think I’ve gotten super lucky with the coaches I’ve had, the environments I’ve been in that have taught me that stuff. It’s natural, too. You can teach so much, but some of it has to be feeling and instinct. That, for me, is how I feel I play<br /><br />He said, ‘There’s a good little central midfielder. He’s little.’ I said, well bring him. I want to see him. And when he brings him to my tryout I genuinely loved his game. I loved him right away. I was like, this kid is the youngest on the field, he’s the shortest on the field, but his vision is super clean. He had a really good first touch and played simple soccer<br /><br />You’ve kind of just got to act cool. You can’t be a fan boy in the locker room or anything, but inside you’re starstruck. It’s the best players in the world, and you’re training with them, so it’s crazy</p>
