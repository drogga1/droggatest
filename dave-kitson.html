  <p><b>[Tony Pulis ‘despised’ Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger and wound up his Stoke players so much it contributed to Aaron Ramsey’s horrific leg-break in 2010]</b> Stoke manager Tony Pulis absolutely despised Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, hated the way he played, while Wenger hated the way Stoke played. They were the direct opposite of each other in football terms. They used to have little snipes at each other in the media. All week I had never seen a manager so desperate to win a game of football, it was bordering on out of control. It started that sort of feeling where it began to bubble within the players through the course of the week. Until finally it got to match day. The changing room was full of aggression and I remember the team talk more than anything. But it just went too far. His desperation to beat Wenger and justify his way of playing football. It crossed the line and went too far. He was just desperate to win and some of the tackles we would put in - myself included because it was asked of you - were shocking really.<br /><br />It was just horrendous. I distinctly remember Wenger turning around in the technical area absolutely horrified by it. The first person he looked at when he turned around was me on the bench because I was in line with him. Even though it wasn’t me who broke his leg, I was on that bench, part of that team. I didn’t know where to look, I was totally embarrassed. Prior to that happening I was probably quite a tough footballer and a tough man. But, in that split second, Wenger gave me that look and I lost something inside of me. I thought there is more to life than this. This was not the reason I became a footballer and I really didn’t want to be included in this or put my name to this. In that moment, I thought ‘I don’t want to be here, I don’t want to play like this and I don’t want to be a part of it’. I carried on for a bit after that but I just lost my stomach for it in the end. I would rather not be a footballer at all than have to play that way. It was always Tony’s way or the highway. If you didn’t do it, you didn’t play and you didn’t train with the first team<br /><br />In hindsight I should have sat down with Tony after that Arsenal game and told him I wasn’t happy, but it wasn’t really something you did. If you look at Pulis, he was successful. Success for Stoke City was staying in the Premier League and he achieved it. Nobody can deny that. He knows how to win football matches. He finds a way to win, that’s the mark of a good manager. It’s just the way that he went about it, I didn’t want to be a part of it</p>

  <p><b>[On racism]</b> You cannot condone this racism in any way, shape, or form. It’s disgusting. I do believe that players make themselves a target. Why Raheem Sterling? There are other black players on the pitch every single week. I just think that we have a duty of care to ourselves as footballers to be a little bit careful with social media and the way we portray ourselves.<br /><br /><b>[Referring to Sterling’s social media presence]</b> You sow a seed amongst people who are not racists not to like a particular person because they don’t want to see that in their faces every day</p>

  <p><b>[Dave Kitson has stressed his comments about <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> star <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> from 2018 were misinterpreted]</b> The day after my retirement I was kicking my heels, and I saw there was a convention taking place at a hotel close to my house. The hotel has been converted from a stately home and it was hosting a Ferrari convention. I went up there with my son for a look and said to him: ‘Take a picture, this will be funny.’ So he took a snap. I’m standing outside the hotel, in between two Ferraris. Without thinking, I posted it to my Instagram account with the caption: ‘Bored on the first day of my retirement’. It was a poor attempt at ironic humour. People who know me will know that I’ve been through the mill financially. People who don’t saw it as an expression of a glamorous lifestyle deserving vilification. The abuse I took was unreal. There were hundreds of responses. The majority of them included the words, ‘flash,’ ‘ginger’ and far worse. It really took me by surprise…the anger and nastiness. I didn’t really think the world was that harsh. Two or three years later, I was speaking on TalkSport and asked to give my opinion after Raheem had been viciously abused while playing for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. It was horrific. I couldn’t help but think back to the episode when I suffered a backlash as a result of posting glamorous lifestyle photos online. I said that I’d looked down Raheem’s social media feed and that while in the beginning it was about his cars and houses, I was pleased to see he had changed it because there is a lot of jealousy out there and I knew what it was like to have been on the end of unwarranted abuse. I said that it gave people a reason to dislike him as a person. Not that he had done anything wrong on his social media account but it gave certain people a platform to vent their ill-informed, ugly views. But I’m distressed that this has somehow morphed into a suggestion I condoned the shocking abuse Raheem suffered or that he otherwise asked for it. Nothing could be further from the truth. Perhaps I used clumsy language and for that I apologise. But I never have and never will condone any form of racism. I admire Raheem for taking up the fight and saying: ‘No, I’m not having this’. And I agree with him. More needs to be done. And I’m prepared to do it. And if he, or anyone, wants to discuss that matter with me, and what I intend to do, I’m more than happy to have that chat and put his mind - and that of other players - to rest</p>
