  <p><b>[Dave Kitson has stressed his comments about <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> star <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> from 2018 were misinterpreted]</b> The day after my retirement I was kicking my heels, and I saw there was a convention taking place at a hotel close to my house. The hotel has been converted from a stately home and it was hosting a Ferrari convention. I went up there with my son for a look and said to him: ‘Take a picture, this will be funny.’ So he took a snap. I’m standing outside the hotel, in between two Ferraris. Without thinking, I posted it to my Instagram account with the caption: ‘Bored on the first day of my retirement’. It was a poor attempt at ironic humour. People who know me will know that I’ve been through the mill financially. People who don’t saw it as an expression of a glamorous lifestyle deserving vilification. The abuse I took was unreal. There were hundreds of responses. The majority of them included the words, ‘flash,’ ‘ginger’ and far worse. It really took me by surprise…the anger and nastiness. I didn’t really think the world was that harsh. Two or three years later, I was speaking on TalkSport and asked to give my opinion after Raheem had been viciously abused while playing for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. It was horrific. I couldn’t help but think back to the episode when I suffered a backlash as a result of posting glamorous lifestyle photos online. I said that I’d looked down Raheem’s social media feed and that while in the beginning it was about his cars and houses, I was pleased to see he had changed it because there is a lot of jealousy out there and I knew what it was like to have been on the end of unwarranted abuse. I said that it gave people a reason to dislike him as a person. Not that he had done anything wrong on his social media account but it gave certain people a platform to vent their ill-informed, ugly views. But I’m distressed that this has somehow morphed into a suggestion I condoned the shocking abuse Raheem suffered or that he otherwise asked for it. Nothing could be further from the truth. Perhaps I used clumsy language and for that I apologise. But I never have and never will condone any form of racism. I admire Raheem for taking up the fight and saying: ‘No, I’m not having this’. And I agree with him. More needs to be done. And I’m prepared to do it. And if he, or anyone, wants to discuss that matter with me, and what I intend to do, I’m more than happy to have that chat and put his mind - and that of other players - to rest</p>
