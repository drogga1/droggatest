  <p>[Ray Clemence feels Alisson Becker will go down in Reds history if he remains loyal to the club over the next five years] He’s proved this year he’s a great goalkeeper. Truly great ones, the legends, continue to do that for the next five, 10 years. The word legend is thrown out without thinking, some of the players I was lucky to play with did it for six, seven, eight, 10 years - and that’s why they are so revered at Liverpool. But he’s had a great start. With foreign players, it’s partly down to how long they and their families want to stay at a club. Hopefully yes, but only they can make that call.<br /><br />He deserves all the accolades because of what he did last year. I’ve not met him yet, hopefully, I will at some stage, but he seems a very level-headed goalkeeper, not over-confident, but he’s got a good balance. He never seems to get flustered, the great goalkeepers always look in control of every situation. He has that ability to make saves other goalkeepers can’t make. But the great goalkeepers make the saves when the game’s tight, to keep them in it</p>

  <p>[Maybe Alisson Becker was just being modest. Or maybe he genuinely was surprised to learn he had been voted the world’s No.1 goalkeeper] He’s proved this year he’s a great goalkeeper. He deserves all the accolades.</p>

  <p>[Liverpool legend Ray Clemence says Liverpool will have a better chance of winning the Premier League this season, having ‘come so close’ last time around] It helps, having got so close. If you look back three or four years, they were finishing 20 points off the league champions. Now they’ve got 97 points, lost one game all year, and it still hasn’t been good enough. In any other league, that would win you the title. But they’ve got the confidence from knowing they can compete with Manchester City, and next year they need to make sure some of the points they dropped in draws, which they shouldn’t have, they win. That’s been the difference. There will be games where you’re going to struggle, and it’s finding a way to avoid losing that game, or nicking a tight win. That’s what Liverpool have started to do; that’s what they did in the Champions League final; they didn’t play particularly well after the penalty, but they found a way to win<br /><br />[Clemence went on to warn Liverpool that they will have a target on their backs across all competitions after their Champions League success back in June] It does one of two things - from the team’s point of view, you feel more confident because you’ve won a trophy and you know how to win a trophy. But also you have to realise that in the following season, everyone is after your head. You are the European champions. Whether that’s in the Premier League or Europe, every other team will want to beat you. It’s been a long time without a trophy for Liverpool. The Premier League is still eluding them at the moment, but winning the Champions League will give everyone belief around the club, be it players, fans, coaches. Having that monkey off their back of winning something, that should give them a big belief for next year. You have to expect the challenges will be greater next year, but at the back of your mind you’ve proved to yourselves you can win things and you just need to maintain that strong belief in how you won it, and continue to do it knowing that winning anything back-to-back is even more difficult</p>
