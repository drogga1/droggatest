  <p><b>[On Phil Neal]</b> It’s easy to see when you’re playing with him, that he’s got a tremendous awareness of every other player in the side and what their job is. In fact, he often tells me he’s a better goalkeeper than I am! Phil has so much skill on the ground that I don’t think he’d be lost in midfield. Add to that, his defensive qualities and the fact he’s no mean performer in the air and you’ve got a very good player indeed.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool have been urged by former goalkeeper Ray Clemence to sign Stoke City’s Jack Butland this summer]</b> For 18 months at Anfield I was watching them and I was closing my eyes because I didn’t know what the hell was going to happen. If only I had a pair of gloves! I know Simon Mignolet really well I keep in contact with him on Twitter and stuff and I feel sorry for him. I looked at the two keepers at the start of the year and thought ‘Simon Mignolet is a good shot stopper, he’s not great on crosses, not great on distribution and I’m not sure how he controls the back four, though it is more difficult now because you have different nationalities in front of you’. And then I looked at the German lad <b>[Karius]</b> and I thought, ‘Good looking lad but I’m not sure what his strengths are. I didn’t look at him as a great shot stopper I didn’t look at him as someone who commanded his box. His distribution was probably better than Mignolet’s. So, obviously Mignolet made mistakes, the other fella he came in, he made mistakes. And to be fair to Jurgen, he’s obviously decided, ‘He’s not for me and the other lad is going to have a chance at the end of the season’.<br /><br />Now to be fair, the last four weeks I’ve seen some improvement in him. I still think he doesn’t do right but he’s better than what he was. So I still think to be a team that has got a chance of winning the league title is that we need a top quality goalkeeper. I’d go with Jack Butland of Stoke. I’ve known Jack since he was 15. I’ve worked with him since he was 16. If ever I saw somebody who was focused on being the England goalkeeper, or being a top goalkeeper from a young age it was him. He’s one of these lovely people … when you are talking to people, it’s great when they look you in the eye and you know they are taking it in, and they want to learn from experienced people</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp is the best manager Liverpool have had since Bill Shankly]</b> If you ask me to compare them, I thought Shankly was a one-off, but then I’d have to say that Klopp is the nearest thing. The relationship Klopp has with the players and fans, it is exactly what Shankly had. He pulled the club together so it was one strong unit that would do anything to help each other out and Klopp has revived that. You only have to look at the last Champions League games, Manchester City and then Roma, the atmosphere in there was as it used to be when I played. Special nights. You can’t understate just how hard that is for a manager to achieve, and the bigger the club the more difficult it is. At any level it’s tough these days for managers because everybody wants success yesterday, and at a club the size of Liverpool there are so many factions you have to try to bring together. He appears to have done that and it’s a priceless achievement.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s three-time European Cup-winning goalkeeper Ray Clemence has called on <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> to be considered as a serious contender to win the Ballon d’Or]</b> Who had the biggest influence for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> over the full year? I would say it was <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a>. There’s an obsession with attacking and creative players winning it. It is more difficult to create and score goals but when you have an influence over a side like <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a> had last season, it wasn’t just what he did, it was what he gave. I think he should be a very strong contender for it. Alisson and <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a> have been massive. I like to put the two of them together because I think the two of them have been a massive influence at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> defensively and on the whole team as well.<br /><br />A year ago, if <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> went 1-0 up, you thought they are probably going to need to score another goal because they could concede one somewhere. <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a> and Alisson being alongside young, talented players has meant they can win with a single goal. The main two help with their experience. They are very difficult to beat and that’s what happened in the final. <a href="alisson-becker.html">Alisson Becker</a> made a few excellent saves in the second half. I think <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> would have gone on to win the game had they got that equaliser.<br /><br /><b>[Clemence believes that <a href="alisson-becker.html">Alisson Becker</a> played a huge part in helping his side beat <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> in the Champions League final]</b> For me, the great goalkeepers have a presence about them. Even before they do anything, they look like they are difficult to beat. They stand in that penalty area with size and agility. If they say something to a defender then they do it. He has all of that. He is capable of great saves, but many are - he does it in tight games. He has a massive influence on the game. In the Champions League final, it was his saves as much as anything that won it<br /><br /><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will now aim to go one step further in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and win the title in 2019-20]</b> It is difficult for a team to stick with what they have got in the modern game. If you stay still, people go past you. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> won it last year and they will make a couple of signings. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will have to be competing with them. In the last two years, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> has had a good first XI, but the bench isn’t as good as <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>. Last season it got better with <a href="divock-origi.html">Divock Origi</a> and <a href="xherdan-shaqiri.html">Xherdan Shaqiri</a> there. I think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> only need a couple, one or two. It might disappoint the one or two who get replaced but you have to keep the competition high amongst the squad. The most important thing was making sure that they won something. That’s got the monkey off the back of not winning anything for so many years. Hopefully, that will give them the motivation and the confidence to take it forward next year. It is the first time <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have won something for many years</p>

  <p><b>[Ray Clemence feels <a href="alisson-becker.html">Alisson Becker</a> will go down in Reds history if he remains loyal to the club over the next five years]</b> He’s proved this year he’s a great goalkeeper. Truly great ones, the legends, continue to do that for the next five, 10 years. The word legend is thrown out without thinking, some of the players I was lucky to play with did it for six, seven, eight, 10 years - and that’s why they are so revered at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. But he’s had a great start. With foreign players, it’s partly down to how long they and their families want to stay at a club. Hopefully yes, but only they can make that call.<br /><br />He deserves all the accolades because of what he did last year. I’ve not met him yet, hopefully, I will at some stage, but he seems a very level-headed goalkeeper, not over-confident, but he’s got a good balance. He never seems to get flustered, the great goalkeepers always look in control of every situation. He has that ability to make saves other goalkeepers can’t make. But the great goalkeepers make the saves when the game’s tight, to keep them in it</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> legend Ray Clemence says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will have a better chance of winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> this season, having ‘come so close’ last time around]</b> It helps, having got so close. If you look back three or four years, they were finishing 20 points off the league champions. Now they’ve got 97 points, lost one game all year, and it still hasn’t been good enough. In any other league, that would win you the title. But they’ve got the confidence from knowing they can compete with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, and next year they need to make sure some of the points they dropped in draws, which they shouldn’t have, they win. That’s been the difference. There will be games where you’re going to struggle, and it’s finding a way to avoid losing that game, or nicking a tight win. That’s what <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have started to do; that’s what they did in the Champions League final; they didn’t play particularly well after the penalty, but they found a way to win<br /><br /><b>[Clemence went on to warn <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> that they will have a target on their backs across all competitions after their Champions League success back in June]</b> It does one of two things - from the team’s point of view, you feel more confident because you’ve won a trophy and you know how to win a trophy. But also you have to realise that in the following season, everyone is after your head. You are the European champions. Whether that’s in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> or Europe, every other team will want to beat you. It’s been a long time without a trophy for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is still eluding them at the moment, but winning the Champions League will give everyone belief around the club, be it players, fans, coaches. Having that monkey off their back of winning something, that should give them a big belief for next year. You have to expect the challenges will be greater next year, but at the back of your mind you’ve proved to yourselves you can win things and you just need to maintain that strong belief in how you won it, and continue to do it knowing that winning anything back-to-back is even more difficult</p>
