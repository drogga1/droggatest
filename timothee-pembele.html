  <p><b>[Young <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> defender Timothee Pembele is confident that he is capable of breaking into the first team at <a href="psg.html">Parc des Princes</a> one day]</b> It is possible to succeed for a young <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> player at the club. You just have to work and have patience. Today, there is only one step between the Under-19s and the professional team. In case of injury, they call us. For us, that’s good<br /><br /><b>[He was, however, sad to see <a href="thiago-motta.html">Thiago Motta</a>, the previous youth coach, depart in the summer, with the former Brazil international highly rated on the training ground]</b> It is true that we have progressed a lot with this coach, both tactically and technically. He is a pure tactician, who helped us a lot last season. We were all disappointed to see him go. But it’s his choice. Now he leads Genoa in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>. Everything is going well for him, and that’s good<br /><br /><b>[Pembele, who is currently away with the France Under-17 team at the World Cup for that age group, has his eyes set on short-term targets that he believes are achievable]</b> At <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, I want to play with the professional team as quickly as possible. And with the national team, I want to win the World Cup. We are among the favourites and we can win it. But we will have to build in power and, having won already, our second game against South Korea can ensure qualification</p>
