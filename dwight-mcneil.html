  <p><b>[Dwight McNeil considers talk of interest from the likes of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> to be outside noise, with the talented teenager fully focused on his efforts at <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a>]</b> The gaffer <b>[<a href="sean-dyche.html">Sean Dyche</a>]</b> just calls it ‘outside noise’. I’ve got to focus on my football and if that comes around it comes around in time. The lads here and the gaffer try to keep me level-headed and help me keep my feet on the ground. I think the most important thing is for me to concentrate on my football and see where that takes me in the future. You can’t get too far ahead of yourself because I’m still 19, I’m still young, I’m learning and I’m still maturing as a person and a player. We’ll just have to see what happens. My aim is to keep playing every week. All I want to do is play football for <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a>. I just want to keep playing and keep improving<br /><br /><b>[McNeil added on dealing with the attention he is receiving]</b> Your friends send it to you and tag you in things, which you do look at. My agents tell my family to ignore it and just concentrate on the football side of things and they’d take care of that side if it ever came to it. I just concentrate on my football. It has a big impact on my family. They’re really good with it as well, they’re really mature, my dad <b>[Matty McNeil]</b> knows all about it. Everyone is just focused on the here and now rather than what could happen in the future. They told me, when I came back, to concentrate on what I’ve got to do and that will take me wherever it’s going to take me. The main thing was to look after myself and be ready for this season</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> winger Dwight McNeil warned off <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> move as <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> star’s father urges him to stay put]</b> He’s doing really well. It would be best for him to stay put at the moment and go that way. That’s instead of him going to a top team and just sitting there and getting drip fed into it. He’s got to keep working hard and listening to his manager and coaches. I believe with improvement he can be good enough for the top teams<br /><br />Dwight has burst onto the scene, and when he trained with us last season for England he was brilliant. He’s got to stay focused, keep performing well while he’s young, and his time will come. I’d say ‘don’t rush anything, just keep playing’ and Dwight is at the right club to do that. He just needs to keep playing games, because that’s the most important thing for somebody his age. He’s got the right manager to guide him and he’ll be in no rush to go anywhere. If I was him I’d stay put and keep playing games</p>
