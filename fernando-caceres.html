  <p><b>[Former Celta defender Fernando Caceres has revealed that he was once offered 500,000 pesetas to take <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> star <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a> out of a game]</b> We were playing Celta vs <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in Vigo and on the first touch <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a> tried to make, I hit him from behind. I helped him up and told him I’d been offered 500,000 pesetas (£2,700/$3,400) to take him out. He just looked at me and said: ‘If you can catch me’. I didn’t go to mark him anymore. I was scared, he was angry and when he got like that, he was very good; a strong and impressive player. <br /><br />Luckily, I never faced <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, but I would have found it challenging to deal with the things he can do with the ball. You see them and you can’t believe it. When Leo runs at you, what do you do? You don’t know, so you have to just kick him - it’s the only solution you have<br /><br />It’s very difficult to choose between one of the other, the times are different and the football is too. Diego spoke to all of us and told us that he hadn’t done the things they said, then in the press they only spoke of Diego’s positive doping test. That caused us a major distraction. We then had to play Romania whilst distracted and it took us out of the World Cup</p>
