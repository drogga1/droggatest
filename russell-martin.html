  <p><b>[Scotland’s Russell Martin says he has rarely come up against an opponent as troublesome as Poland international Robert Lewandowski]</b> Lewandowski is one of the best I’ve played against. His goal record speaks for itself with the form he is in at the minute. He is different but as a defender I always look at a striker’s attributes and think where you can affect them and try and influence them throughout the game. Players like him, <b>[Thomas]</b> Muller and <b>[Mario]</b> Gotze of Germany, who are in our group, are all among the top five or six in Europe at the moment, so it’s up to us to go and stop him. I relish the challenge. I enjoy playing against players like that and that is why I have worked so hard throughout my career, to test myself against players like that. We are doing it week in week out in the Premier League and this will be no different.<br /><br />We have to go and win the game on Thursday, it’s as simple as that. They are a good side but we have done well against them previously, twice, not too long ago. Looking back at the games against Georgia and Germany, they’re gone now. It’s all about the present and making sure we go into Thursday knowing exactly what we want to do and get what we want from the game</p>

  <p><b>[On Robert Lewandowski]</b> We will watch all the videos on him before Tuesday. He is a fantastic player but the staff here prepare us for everything. I’m sure we have seen enough of him in the Bundesliga with the goals he has scored to know how dangerous he is. So we will be ready.</p>

  <p><b>[Russell Martin on his little boy]</b> It’s been the most sensational 24 hours of my life. I flew <b>[to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> with the squad on Saturday. My wife called me at about 7pm to say she’d had a few twinges but nothing to worry about. Then she rang again at around 10:30pm to say, ‘This is it! This is happening!’ I jumped in the car and drove back to <b>[Norfolk]</b> and got there at about 3am. She gave birth at 9:25am. I left at 10:30am, back to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> on the plane with the directors. I got there just in time. I’d had no sleep at all, but the adrenalaine got me through. Just to play at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> is special, but to score <b>[…]</b> I’m knackered now but at least I’ve got a nice story to tell my little boy when he’s older!</p>
