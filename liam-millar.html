  <p><b>[Liam Millar on Alphonso Davies’ <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> rise]</b> I used to think I could take Alphonso in a race. And then I watched the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> game <b>[…]</b> We haven’t officially raced yet. Every time we go to, one of the coaches tells us to stop. They spoil our fun! Fonzie is crazy quick. Sometimes in training we’d be up against each other and it was always a good battle. Sometimes I would go by him, so I used to think maybe I could compete with him. I always thought it would be a close race and maybe he would just win, something like that? Now? I’m kinda like … I think he might smoke me! Don’t tell him I said that!<br /><br />I played at right-back and Alphonso played at left-back. The coach, <a href="john-herdman.html">John Herdman</a>, wanted an attacking team so he put his fastest players at full-back and, to be honest, I felt bad for the US Virgin Islands. We destroyed them. It was kind of like … unfair, you know?<br /><br /><b>[On the pitch, the youngsters impressed albeit against lowly opposition. Off the field, meanwhile, an instant friendship was formed]</b> We sort of said to each other ‘You and I are going to be around for a long time, so we might as well get to know each other. That was the first time we’d met, but we just became good friends straight away. Fonzie is a real outgoing guy. He’s just one of those guys who can talk to anyone and make them laugh, you know? He’s not cocky, there’s no bad side to him, he’s just a fun guy with a real outgoing personality. I spoke to him around the time he joined <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>. He would ask me if I found it tough moving away. I think it helped him that he had someone he could relate to, you know? I moved to England when I was 13, so he could see that everything was going to be OK.<br /><br />Everyone in Canada is so happy for him. He’s a crazy player, and he’s doing so well. And, for me personally, it drives me on. I want to get to that level, to be on the same page as him. When I see him doing what he’s doing, lighting up the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and the Champions League, it pushes me to keep improving. I love reading about him and <a href="jonathan-david.html">Jonathan David</a> <b>[the free-scoring Gent striker]</b> but it motivates me. I want them to be writing about me as well.<br /><br />It was a proud moment for me and my family. To be the first Canadian to play for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, it was a big thing, something I’ll never forget<br /><br />If any generation is going to get us to a World Cup, it’s this one. We have a lot of really good players. We all want to reach a World Cup. For a Canada team to do that, it’s the dream. We fancy our chances, 100 per cent. I honestly think we are easily in the top three in <a href="concacaf.html">CONCACAF</a>, and I know I sound biased but I don’t think the US are much better than us. We beat them 2-0 last year, and then we played them away from home, dominated the game but lost badly. They took their chances. It’s very, very possible for us to qualify for the next World Cup and then after that we are obviously hosts for 2026. But our goal is to qualify for 2022. That way, we can say we didn’t get any freebies</p>
