  <p><b>[on Matheus Fernandes]</b> <b>[Barcelona described the player as one who]</b> stands out for his defensive qualities in midfield and his ability to bring the ball out from the back. His usual position is as the holding midfielder due to his excellent skills at winning the ball back. The Brazilian is a well-rounded midfielder with an excellent right foot</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona’s Matheus Fernandes left speechless by chance to play with Messi]</b> I can’t explain it. To think that soon I will be playing with the best player in the world, I don’t even know what to say. It is a dream to get to that great club and have the opportunity to be part of it. My goal is to play for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. My contract <b>[with Valladolid]</b> ends in June and I want to be in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, it is every child’s dream. If I can’t go to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> now, I will continue learning at Valladolid or at another club where they value me. I am happy to be here and playing in <a href="laliga.html">LaLiga</a>. I think I’m going to succeed at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. I have the potential for it. I think I fit in with the style of play. I hope I can be there and stay there forever and make history at Barcelona<br /><br />I am very happy because the club showed interest in me. I have great qualities, but I am going to evolve much more there. I hope to be there for a long time and I hope to win many titles and bring much happiness to the club and the fans. If the club is happy, I will be<br /><br /><b>[Fernandes highlighted <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Sergio Busquets</a> and <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> as his main role models]</b> I am a box-to-box midfielder, but I also like to play in a holding role protecting the defence. I am a technical player. I know I still have a lot to learn, I am aware of it and I am trying to improve here at Valladolid, but I think I am going to mark an era at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. I need to finish better, play quicker. I think I am a good marker, I have good positioning, a good pass and the most important thing is will and I have the will to improve and do my best for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. I like Sergio Busquets’ way of playing a lot and I always noticed him, <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> too. I’m going to try to do my best to be able to get closer to the level of these great players, knowing that I still have a lot to learn</p>
