  <p><b>[Danny Jordaan backs Bafana Bafana to qualify for Afcon 2019]</b> It’s a reality of sport that you can get a tough draw, but I think we have shown over the last few matches that we are equal to Nigeria and that we have a good chance.<br /><br />It’s going to be tough to juggle the two competitions at the same time, but I think strangely the teams playing in this Nations Cup in Gabon will have an additional burden with a hectic programme for the year. They have a much stronger possibility for injury and burnout. It’s going to be a huge challenge to play in two qualification tournaments in one year and in addition to that you have the Nations Cup finals now and then there are also club commitments. So, for many teams it is a huge ask. It will require careful management by the technical teams of all of the countries<br /><br />As the situation stands now, when Libya hosts us it will be at a neutral venue, but it’s a long way before we play them and the situation could change, so we’ll see</p>

  <p><b>[Following the dismissal of Shakes Mashaba as South Africa coach]</b> We want to have the process expedited as Bafana Bafana have a bumper 2017 season in which they need to compete and qualify on three fronts - namely Chan, Afon and the Fifa World Cup in Russia 2018.</p>

  <p><b>[Desiree Ellis has been appointed permanent head coach of the Sasol-sponsored Banyana Banyana]</b> We are glad to announce the appointment of Desiree <b>[Ellis]</b> as Banyana Banyana coach; she fully deserves the appointment as she has come through all the ranks of our national teams. Desiree has three tasks to achieve; qualify for AFCON 2018 in Ghana, qualify for FIFA World Cup and the Olympics. I am confident Banyana Banyana will be up to the task.</p>

  <p><b>[South African Football Association president Danny Jordaan struck even closer to the heart of the problem than he perhaps intended in 2018, as none of the continent’s representatives made a mark at that summer’s World Cup]</b> If you look at the Nigerian team, not many play in the domestic league, and some had been awarded citizenship, meaning they were not developed in the country. Morocco had four Spanish-born players who are plying their trade in Spain, four of Dutch heritage and five who were born in France. This means three-quarters of the team was made up of players who were not born and bred in the country. I’m not sure whether that’s a wise thing to do</p>

  <p><b>[Siphiwe Tshabalala shot to fame when scoring the opening goal at the 2010 World Cup. South Africa marked 10 years since the 2010 World Cup kicked off on Thursday with a flood of memories and an insistence that the tournament legacy remains strong - even if Africa’s teams have underperformed since]</b> We had to overcome incredible pessimism to host the tournament, there was a strong sentiment that Africa did not have the capacity and that it couldn’t be trusted. We were under so much pressure to deal with the world’s negativity <b>[…]</b> After the World Cup, we saw a lot of that Afro-pessimism end<br /><br /><b>[Jordaan points to the infrastructure legacy of new airports, highways and sports stadia as a boon for the economy, notably tourism, and for the domestic Premier Soccer League, which he said had improved markedly because of the better facilities]</b> The stadiums are all still used, as are all the smaller venues in the townships that we refurbished as training venues. In 2014, Algeria and Nigeria made it to the second round but in Russia in 2018 all five African teams dropped out in the first round. We have to look at why we have slipped back since Ghana got to the quarter-final. The hope that we had that 2010 would signal the renaissance of African football in major competitions like the World Cup did not materialise</p>
