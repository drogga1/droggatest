  <p><b>[Danny Jordaan backs Bafana Bafana to qualify for Afcon 2019]</b> It’s a reality of sport that you can get a tough draw, but I think we have shown over the last few matches that we are equal to Nigeria and that we have a good chance.<br /><br />It’s going to be tough to juggle the two competitions at the same time, but I think strangely the teams playing in this Nations Cup in Gabon will have an additional burden with a hectic programme for the year. They have a much stronger possibility for injury and burnout. It’s going to be a huge challenge to play in two qualification tournaments in one year and in addition to that you have the Nations Cup finals now and then there are also club commitments. So, for many teams it is a huge ask. It will require careful management by the technical teams of all of the countries<br /><br />As the situation stands now, when Libya hosts us it will be at a neutral venue, but it’s a long way before we play them and the situation could change, so we’ll see</p>

  <p><b>[Following the dismissal of Shakes Mashaba as South Africa coach]</b> We want to have the process expedited as Bafana Bafana have a bumper 2017 season in which they need to compete and qualify on three fronts - namely Chan, Afon and the Fifa World Cup in Russia 2018.</p>

  <p><b>[Safa president Danny Jordaan has indicated that they are still negotiating with the potential new Bafana Bafana coach]</b> We have one person who we are dealing with. You <b>[the media]</b> are creating the confusion. We will let you know when we ­announce the coach.</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Jordaan has expressed his delight at the ascendency of Ahmad Ahmad to the highest position at Caf]</b> The new president will definitely bring change and improvement to the federation, but that we can only achieve if we work as a team. The distribution of revenues to various associations is another thing that will be looked at for example, and I think there will be more changes and improvements under the new president<br /><br />It had significant influence. As you know, the Cosafa region has 14 members, and to be elected as Caf president, you need 28 votes. So, if you have Cosafa behind you then you already have 50 percent of the votes.<br /><br />One of the main reasons why the previous regime took so long in power was because Cosafa members were not united going into Caf presidency elections, but we spoke about it and everyone agreed that African football needed a new leadership that will bring about change. Not to say Mr Hayatou was a bad leader, he contributed immensely to African football in the 28 years he served as president, but there are certain things we felt should change, and they were not going to change unless a new president was elected.<br /><br />If you look at the allocation of Afcon tournaments, you’d realize that West African countries have been preferred more than countries in the Cosafa and Cecafa regions, excluding South Africa in 2013 of course - Equatorial Guinea and Gabon in 2012, Equatorial Guinea in 2015, Gabon in 2017, Cameroon in 2019, Ivory Coast in 2021 and Guinea in 2023. So, those are some of the things we looked at, and decided that change was needed. In that way, we will have to come up with ways to ensure that everyone is considered going forward.<br /><br />Now, there’s a new president and his two deputies are new. So, it was about time, and we are confident that the change in leadership will help African football to grow even further. We will have our first meeting in May where we will be outlining new plans for the next four years. I don’t want to get into every detail, but things like revenue, broadcasting rights, advertising, men, junior and women competitions will be discussed in that meeting.<br /><br />Also some of the regulations that guide the federation will be revisited. For instance, under the previous regime, one would have to be a member of the Caf executive to be able to stand for Caf presidency whereas at Fifa there’s no such provision or requirement; anyone can stand for any position at Fifa. So there is a lot of work to be done, but we are all confident that we will achieve our objectives</p>

  <p><b>[Desiree Ellis has been appointed permanent head coach of the Sasol-sponsored Banyana Banyana]</b> We are glad to announce the appointment of Desiree <b>[Ellis]</b> as Banyana Banyana coach; she fully deserves the appointment as she has come through all the ranks of our national teams. Desiree has three tasks to achieve; qualify for AFCON 2018 in Ghana, qualify for FIFA World Cup and the Olympics. I am confident Banyana Banyana will be up to the task.</p>

  <p><b>[South African Football Association president Danny Jordaan struck even closer to the heart of the problem than he perhaps intended in 2018, as none of the continent’s representatives made a mark at that summer’s World Cup]</b> If you look at the Nigerian team, not many play in the domestic league, and some had been awarded citizenship, meaning they were not developed in the country. Morocco had four Spanish-born players who are plying their trade in Spain, four of Dutch heritage and five who were born in France. This means three-quarters of the team was made up of players who were not born and bred in the country. I’m not sure whether that’s a wise thing to do</p>

  <p><b>[Siphiwe Tshabalala shot to fame when scoring the opening goal at the 2010 World Cup. South Africa marked 10 years since the 2010 World Cup kicked off on Thursday with a flood of memories and an insistence that the tournament legacy remains strong - even if Africa’s teams have underperformed since]</b> We had to overcome incredible pessimism to host the tournament, there was a strong sentiment that Africa did not have the capacity and that it couldn’t be trusted. We were under so much pressure to deal with the world’s negativity <b>[…]</b> After the World Cup, we saw a lot of that Afro-pessimism end<br /><br /><b>[Jordaan points to the infrastructure legacy of new airports, highways and sports stadia as a boon for the economy, notably tourism, and for the domestic Premier Soccer League, which he said had improved markedly because of the better facilities]</b> The stadiums are all still used, as are all the smaller venues in the townships that we refurbished as training venues. In 2014, Algeria and Nigeria made it to the second round but in Russia in 2018 all five African teams dropped out in the first round. We have to look at why we have slipped back since Ghana got to the quarter-final. The hope that we had that 2010 would signal the renaissance of African football in major competitions like the World Cup did not materialise</p>
