  <p><b>[South African Football Association president Danny Jordaan struck even closer to the heart of the problem than he perhaps intended in 2018, as none of the continent’s representatives made a mark at that summer’s World Cup]</b> If you look at the Nigerian team, not many play in the domestic league, and some had been awarded citizenship, meaning they were not developed in the country. Morocco had four Spanish-born players who are plying their trade in Spain, four of Dutch heritage and five who were born in France. This means three-quarters of the team was made up of players who were not born and bred in the country. I’m not sure whether that’s a wise thing to do</p>

  <p><b>[Siphiwe Tshabalala shot to fame when scoring the opening goal at the 2010 World Cup. South Africa marked 10 years since the 2010 World Cup kicked off on Thursday with a flood of memories and an insistence that the tournament legacy remains strong - even if Africa’s teams have underperformed since]</b> We had to overcome incredible pessimism to host the tournament, there was a strong sentiment that Africa did not have the capacity and that it couldn’t be trusted. We were under so much pressure to deal with the world’s negativity <b>[…]</b> After the World Cup, we saw a lot of that Afro-pessimism end<br /><br /><b>[Jordaan points to the infrastructure legacy of new airports, highways and sports stadia as a boon for the economy, notably tourism, and for the domestic Premier Soccer League, which he said had improved markedly because of the better facilities]</b> The stadiums are all still used, as are all the smaller venues in the townships that we refurbished as training venues. In 2014, Algeria and Nigeria made it to the second round but in Russia in 2018 all five African teams dropped out in the first round. We have to look at why we have slipped back since Ghana got to the quarter-final. The hope that we had that 2010 would signal the renaissance of African football in major competitions like the World Cup did not materialise</p>
