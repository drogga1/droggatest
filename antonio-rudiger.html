  <p><b>[Antonio Rudiger has talked up the importance of the FA Cup to Chelsea]</b> It doesn’t matter what the competition is, if you have the chance to win a trophy you have to go for it. We want to reach Wembley but before that we must go to Leicester, give it our best and try to win the game. Barcelona is in the past now. We have to look forward. The FA Cup is still on for us, we have to go for it and that starts on Sunday.<br /><br />First of all, it’s going to be a battle. Leicester will try to give us a tough time and we will have to be mentally strong but we won’t be looking for excuses. Yes, we played a few days ago and, of course, there may be some tiredness, but we have to go there and show the right mentality</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Rudiger believes Antonio Conte mistook the defender’s recent comments as a personal criticism]</b> Probably. But I didn’t mean it that way. It was a fact, it wasn’t about the tactics. I did not attack anyone personally, I meant us as a team. I played quite a lot of games in recent weeks and months. This was a little break<br /><br />It’s just normal from my side. He’s my coach. I must respect him. And he’s a very, very good coach<br /><br />I think in the second half we <b>[could]</b> finish the game <b>[off]</b>. But like the last few months, we didn’t and we <b>[conceded]</b>. For me, it’s not easy to explain. I don’t understand why after 1-0 we always drop and let the opponent get more ball possession</p>

  <p><b>[Rudiger sounds Salah warning as Chelsea defender readies himself for reunion with 43-goal star]</b> If I play, it will be a direct duel against Salah. The good thing is, I’m not slow!<br /><br />He’s the most polite guy I have ever met in football. Of course you are always a bit surprised but I know his ability, his potential and I knew he would be good for Liverpool</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Rudiger retains his friendship with former Roma team-mate Mohamed Salah but is eager to keep him quiet]</b> We all know how important this game is and we are all looking forward to it. Salah is at the moment, for me, the best player in the league, but it is not only him that plays for Liverpool. We are very good <b>[friends]</b>. He was already good in Roma, but when he was there he would sometimes miss chances. But this year he is very, very clinical as well as being more strong than he was in Rome. I am very happy to play against him, because also it is a big game. This is why I play football. But they also have <b>[Roberto]</b> Firmino, <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane and the guys at the back. They have a great team, scoring a lot of goals.<br /><br />First of all, you have to let him play. What I can say is that he did well because he has been here since January and he’s only had four starts. It is not easy when you are on the bench and you come on, like in the Man City game. That’s not easy but I think he has done well. It is important for him to stay match fit and then wait for his chance. First of all, these good performances are because of him. I don’t want to make myself seem important but I try to help him because we speak the same language <b>[Italian]</b> and he is not so confident in his English. So that’s the perfect mix and I can speak with him during games and give him directions. At the end of the day he made very good performances <b>[for himself]</b>. I always try to get on well with my mates in the dressing room. Of course, you can’t like everyone. But here I do. They are funny guys and I think you have to make a good atmosphere in the dressing room because we see each other every day. You can make the dressing room like a funeral and, of course, we are not happy with the bad results. At the end of the day, you still have to go on<br /><br /><b>[On the Blues’ matches against Roma in October]</b> It was very emotional for myself. I didn’t show it, but <b>[I felt it]</b> inside. I played there, so I know what the environment is there. You play against a big team <b>[when you face them]</b>. Their fans are totally different to what I see in England. In life I think everything happens for a reason. Last year Roma were in the Europa League, so there was no chance to play against Chelsea</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Rudiger had to leave Borussia Dortmund’s academy to make a professional career for himself]</b> I didn’t get much, but when he spoke to me at the friendly match I saw he’s a coach that gives you motivation, like you’re the best in the world. That’s very good and one of his best skills as a coach. He had nothing to do with <b>[me leaving]</b>, because I was in the youth <b>[team]</b>. I knew for myself I had to leave Dortmund to play first-team football. I spoke to him twice, because he used to watch a lot of academy games. He also invited me to a friendly match. I was 16, or something like that. For me, it was important because at the time, Dortmund won the league twice in a row. There was almost no chance <b>[to make my debut]</b>. So for me, I was young but I was very realistic. I thought: ‘Okay, maybe I need to go’. It wasn’t a step back, maybe it was even a step forward. I went to a team that was a bit lower <b>[in the table]</b> but I was playing.<br /><br /><b>[When asked about his manager’s future]</b> I’m not taking part in this decision. It doesn’t matter <b>[what I think]</b>, if he is my coach next year he is my coach and I’ll work with him. The way he works is professional, and that’s good. For me it’s OK, because he does his work and he puts his all <b>[into it]</b> - I think you can see that on the sideline. That’s it, and the players have to do that as well. It’s a professional relationship and that’s good<br /><br /><b>[On Bayern Munich’s Hummels and Jerome Boateng]</b> Of course, they won important titles. I think to win the Premier League here is different than to win the title at the moment at Bayern Munich. If we don’t finish in the top four, this <b>[FA Cup]</b> is a little sweet that we can give to ourselves and the fans. As a team we know we did many things wrong. I think it’s a new start <b>[next season]</b>. In my career, I have only won one title and that’s with the German national team. Yes, this is what I want <b>[to win more with Chelsea]</b>. I want moments that I won’t forget<br /><br /><b>[Germany won the Confederations Cup last summer]</b> I’m confident I’ll be part of the squad. I had good years since I arrived in Rome, and if not for the injury I think I would have played in that first match. Yes, of course <b>[Chelsea will help me get selected]</b>. But apart from that, everyone wants to play for a big club. It doesn’t mean because you’re in a big club <b>[you automatically get in]</b>, because what if I don’t play? It’s the same as I felt in Rome. Roma helped me to get where I am with the national team. It depends on performances</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Rudiger is frustrated that his side didn’t finish off Arsenal when they had the chance in their International Champions Cup match in Dublin]</b> I think in the first half, we started well. We started very good. We scored early and that was very good, we had also could have scored more in the first half. In the end of the first half, we were a bit sloppy. We gave away possession to Arsenal and yes, we continued like that in the second half. The final pass was missing, these are things that we need to work on very quickly. I think the second half, it was an open game but to concede like this in the last minute. No, we have to win this.<br /><br />I was happy to score. This is my aim, I always try to do that and I hope to get better <b>[at scoring]</b></p>

It was good, we have a good understanding and he is a quality player. He did well with <b>[communication]</b>. When we needed to help him, we helped him. Today in general for us was a very good day. We all know Thibaut’s <b>[Courtois]</b> quality, but Thibaut is no longer a Chelsea player. I wish him good luck at Real Madrid but now we have to concentrate on Kepa because he is our goalkeeper. In his work he is very confident and off the pitch he is a quiet guy.<br /><br />We are happy because our pre-season games were not that good. Today we can be happy that we won the game - three goals and a clean sheet for us. It’s not always easy to adapt because it’s a new style of play, but I think that we moved the ball well. I think you say the players become more comfortable today. It’s all about working on it in training and improving</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Rudiger says the reaction to Mesut Ozil’s retirement from Germany is extremely sad]</b> What I don’t understand in this whole discussion is why some people are discussing whether there is racism within the national team. Mesut himself never said that in one sentence! I think it’s extremely sad how this has developed. Mesut was always a player in the Germany team that I looked up to. Too bad he will not be there now. In any case, we were all responsible for our elimination, it was down to individuals.<br /><br />We now have to look ahead instead of keeping an eye on this extremely disappointing World Cup again and again. Of course, we can’t wipe that experience away, but that must not be blocking us in the next games. Motivation should now be enough for every player to prove that in Russia it was anything but our normal form<br /><br /><b>[On Maurizio Sarri]</b> He has a very concrete idea of ​​how to play football. As he always points out, this will not work to perfection within weeks. That needs some time! Personally, I felt his trust from day one. I can also talk to him in Italian!<br /><br />The games <b>[in England]</b> are faster, more intense <b>[than in Germany]</b> and the calendar is extremely challenging, especially if you still play internationally. For this you have to be physically as well as mentally prepared. I’m very satisfied with my development in England, but I have to admit that if I had gone directly from the Bundesliga to such a big English club as Chelsea, the move might have been too early. The intermediate step to Italy was absolutely perfect for me. From a player’s point of view, you can learn a lot in Italy tactically. For example, my former coach Luciano Spalletti had asked me after one of my first training sessions under him what I had actually been training in Germany for years. In England, it’s a physical thing, the pace is the highest and the teams have a very high individual class, so you can not rest for a second, something can always happen. At the moment, I don’t see the Bundesliga at the top in areas like tactics, pace or physique</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Rudiger is fed up with comparisons between Maurizio Sarri’s Chelsea and that of former manager Antonio Conte]</b> Stop comparing. I don’t want to speak about the past. As you can see, we do a lot of ball possession and try to press high. Yeah, that’s a good sign <b>[to come back]</b>. It meant we are ready - it was a difficult game but in the end, with a bit of luck, we fully deserved this win. But if you saw the whole game, I wouldn’t say that it’s luck. Game-by-game I think it’s getting better and that’s our target. Before the internationals, we’ll try to win all of our games and then come back after and go on. At the end of the day, the three points are more important because the performances will come definitely. If I saw this game and the game against Arsenal in the first half and the last 20 minutes, we’re improving. But, for me, especially for everyone, three points are important.<br /><br /><b>[On Eden Hazard]</b> I think for the coach it isn’t an easy choice because at the front we have really good quality players and of course Eden is one of them. But we had Willian on the bench. It’s not easy for the coach but it’s good to have many, many options. Competition brings out the best in everyone. It’s good like that. For the attackers, it’s good because we mostly have the ball. It’s good for those players. To make those players defend is not their strength, especially Eden. But players like N’Golo <b>[Kante]</b> and Mateo are a good mix. Those two players can attack and also defend as well. Ok, it’s a good thing to always have the ball but it’s normal that you lose it. So we need big players to come to the back and I think N’Golo and Kovacic did very good<br /><br /><b>[On Jorginho]</b> I don’t know about statistics but of course he is one of our target players and he is very comfortable on the ball, which is good</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Rudiger is set to earn a pay rise and a contract extension at Chelsea]</b> I feel extremely comfortable with Chelsea, and I feel the confidence of the coaching staff, the fans, the entire club, every day, and that shows on the pitch as well. We play possession football under Sarri, which is very important to me, so we are always relatively high as a defence, but once we are passed, I still have my speed to be able to intervene.<br /><br />I’ve had some good chances to score myself this season and this time it finally went in</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea defender Antonio Rudiger considers the yellow card he was shown after being headbutted by Everton midfielder Bernard to be a joke]</b> It’s annoying because I don’t even tackle someone, do something and I get booked for being head-butted. Sorry, but that’s a joke. He <b>[Bernard]</b> was diving and I told him to stand up. Then he came with a lot of speed and hit me with his forehead, so for me to get a yellow card - to me that’s a joke. The referee didn’t see anything. Perhaps it’s the fourth official who was outside <b>[the pitch]</b>, maybe he said something to him <b>[Kevin Friend]</b> that I had provoked <b>[Bernard]</b> or something, but I just said, ‘Stand up’. If there is VAR in England, then Bernard has a problem. He would be sent off.<br /><br />I don’t feel happy because I wanted to win this game. There was a game on last night <b>[the Manchester derby]</b> that’s maybe important to us. But we failed to do our own job. If we don’t win these kind of games, we don’t need to look at City and Liverpool. Do we need to improve on getting three draws at home out of four? That’s clear. We had a lot of chances we missed. But we were unlucky. We didn’t see much from Everton up front. It was more a game to be decided by one goal. They had some counter-attacks, but I never thought they would score</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea centre-back Antonio Rudiger has revealed how terrifying boss Maurizio Sarri inspired their victory over defending champions Manchester City]</b> After the Wolves game, he <b>[Sarri]</b> was terrifying. He was going crazy. But that was okay because we shouldn’t have lost this match. The day after, <b>[Sarri]</b> was very calm and clear-minded. He spoke with us and made it clear that we have to believe in ourselves. He wanted us to go into the City game looking for the win. We spoke together. We all knew what was going on, we didn’t have to lie to ourselves: the mentality was the problem. One of the things that made us strong in difficult moments last season was that we knew how to suffer. This season, because things were going so good, we were thinking, ‘We don’t need to suffer’. Two teams, Tottenham and Wolves, proved us wrong. That’s why, against Manchester City, everyone saw a team that was ready to fight. We wanted to take the supporters with us and we did that. By ‘suffering’, what I mean is when we are having a tough time, we need to man up, keep our chins up and work. We were playing beautiful football at the start of the season, but that doesn’t mean you forget the ugly side of it: winning tackles, tracking back, doing everything defensively. Against Manchester City, we were very clinical, which was also important. That has been missing over the last month, but against City, we did something out of nothing<br /><br />The coach has given everyone the chance this season to prove themselves. Everyone has to accept this decision <b>[to play Hazard up front]</b> and perhaps it was a good <b>[choice]</b>. It wasn’t like last season when we tried to pump long balls to Eden. No, we tried to keep it on the ground</p>

I think that’s fair enough. He is a leader. He provides an example, not be speaking, but by showing that he’s very good. To reach 40 goals? Maybe he can do it. But what he does is okay. He is human, of course he is. But the way he is playing is fantastic, we all know what he is capable of. I am happy that he scored.</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Rudiger has said Chelsea should be ashamed of their performance against Bournemouth]</b> Everyone needs to be ashamed of what happened in the last game. Everyone needs to think very deeply about that because you can win, lose or draw, but it’s the manner which is important. In the second half, I can’t really describe it. We went out and they scored after two minutes then things went very badly. Nothing came from us - N’Golo <b>[Kante]</b> had a half chance but that was it. If you look at the view of football, we made it too easy for Bournemouth by losing the ball up front - everyone knows Bournemouth are going on the counter, and they were waiting for this. We have played better this season and that’s what hurts, we didn’t really try to change this result, that is what is bad.<br /><br />We call ourselves a top team, but this cannot happen to us. We have to be mentally strong for the rest of the season. It’s clear now, we are Chelsea, there has been a lot of criticism from outside but here we must be cool in our mind and be honest with ourselves. Tactics is not my business because I am not the coach, I am a player, but everyone needs to commit again. We need to go back to basics because it’s not normal for a Bournemouth player to take on four defenders and go through. Those basics are to win challenges, to look for challenges. It’s nice if you have possession but everyone needs to know what their job is, which is, first and foremost, getting a clean sheet. We have to find continuity because right now there are too many ups and downs. We have to win against Huddersfield and show a big reaction after the Bournemouth defeat</p>

Our biggest shortcoming is that we lost consistency. We always want <b>[it]</b>, but sometimes not a lot works out. We go blank a bit currently, but it’s no reason to talk everything down. I am not that kind of guy. For a long time, Chelsea had a defensive approach. And you can’t get used to something new overnight. Pep Guardiola’s first year wasn’t all that smooth as well<br /><br /><b>[Rudiger added on Sarri’s coaching style]</b> He’s a very emotional coach. But you can’t put everything down to motivation. We have been there when it mattered. We were the first team to beat Manchester City after all. We must be tougher. By now, we have a lot of possession, but we need to get something dirty back in our game</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Rudiger is loving life in English football]</b> I feel very comfortable in London. In my eyes the Premier League is the best league in the world. Every opponent is a difficult challenge, no game is easy. But that’s exactly what makes the charm. I’ve been here with Chelsea for one-and-a-half years now. I think, personally, I got better and better in the club month by month, adapting my game more and more to the league here<br /><br />Of course there are also outstanding and world-class strikers in the Bundesliga, such as Robert Lewandowski. But honestly, in the Premier League, even the teams in the lower half of the table have really strong players up front, which are so hard to defend. <b>[Salomon]</b> Rondon from Newcastle for example. This is 90 minutes of pure wear and tear, in which you cannot stop to focus even after a two-goal lead. But it’s fun, that’s how football should be!<br /><br />Of course I’ve been very annoyed recently that we have unnecessarily dropped points in some games, but for our goal to reach the top four we are still in business. The FA Cup is now really at an important stage. In the League Cup, we are already in the final. Although many people here think that this cup is not that important, a title is still a title and always something special</p>

You saw the way we played against Tottenham and Manchester City <b>[in the past week]</b>? It was different to the way we played in the first three months. Everyone needs to adapt. Have we found a good balance of how to play? Definitely. In life, you need to adapt to things. This League is different to Italy, you have to adjust a bit.<br /><br />He learned from that game against City. There we went high, we went to press, we wanted to win the ball and everyone knows what happened. We can play both <b>[styles]</b>. But it is always good to find the golden middle. It depends on the coach. He gives the tactics and the players follow.<br /><br /><b>[Rudiger insists the Chelsea squad are focused on securing the final Champions League spot]</b> It is good to know we have things in our own hands. We started with the win against Tottenham and now we have beaten Fulham. We want to continue like this. It’s not important to speak about other clubs. We need to look at own house and get our own things solved</p>

  <p><b>[Gonzalo Higuain has seen his progress at Chelsea hailed by Antonio Rudiger]</b> Higuain’s goal was impressive. This is how he is. He is trying his best and working for the team. Although he’s an experienced player who has played for Real Madrid and Juventus, this is a different competition. You also need to adapt and we as players need to help him as much as possible, and he can help himself by scoring goals.<br /><br />A London derby presents its own challenges. Although they are a team very low in the table, they tried and gave their all, their supporters were behind them, and there were some parts that were very dangerous. But we showed again that we can suffer. It was an important win. There are only 10 matches left and every one of them is a final. We started against Tottenham, we continued away now and it’s good</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Rudiger has described Chelsea’s second-half display in defeat to Everton as unacceptable]</b> It is like the same game as against Wolverhampton, only we lost. We played a good first half, the only thing you could say is if you could have scored one or two. We didn’t and it is unacceptable the way we came out and we lost the game in 10 minutes. We were passive and if you are passive against any opponent in this league it is dangerous. At the end of the day we played well in the first half but we didn’t score but the way we approached the second half is unacceptable. There is frustration. Everyone deals with it differently but it is just unacceptable<br /><br />We still we have eight games to go but we cannot say next week, next week, next week have to do better definitely because this match you are not allowed to lose it</p>

As I did in the other years in the team when I played with <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> or <a href="gary-cahill.html">Gary Cahill</a> … I am loud on the pitch. Especially with the young guys because you need to help them.<br /><br />There will be a period - that is normal because we are all human - that you will fall a bit, the performances will go down. But there especially you need to - and me as the most experienced in the back - need to help those young guys. I’m in for that.<br /><br />In my position, it is very important to speak, to be loud because I have the whole pitch in front of me and this has always been natural to me. I always have, even when I was young, been commanding. I don’t read too much <b>[about fans wanting me back]</b>. That’s why I don’t really feel the pressure. But it’s also good if the people want me back and of course, there is a little bit of pressure. It’s good in football when you have a little bit of pressure because then you are ready to perform. At the moment, we have to take every game step by step. We are in the top four and we are five points ahead of the fifth-place team. We are in a good position but we need to be aware of performances like <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and West Ham<br /><br />Nervous? Not at all. It’s not the first time I’ve been injured for a long time. The first time at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> for a long time, but other clubs no. I always came back very good, that’s what I do. I had the operation, the surgery. You listen to the doctor who did the surgery and you have to be patient and just wait for your time. That’s what I did. It is normal, I want to play, but I am not 19 anymore. I deal with that differently. If you are on crutches, then you can’t do anything so you just have to be patient and wait. The coach let me have a little pre-season. It was for two and a half, almost three weeks. I really thank him. It was good for the legs but not for the heart so it was a really good idea from him. It feels good. It’s been a long time, it’s been a while now, but I’m very happy that everything went well and we are in the round of 16. I’m very happy. I missed everything as well. It was a good match for both sides. That is why you play football. I have to say thank you to everyone - the backroom staff, the coaches for their patience, and also the fans for their patience<br /><br />I hope soon <b>[I will be at my best]</b>! Of course, it makes a difference after a long time injured. You need some games to come into but if the coach has the intention to let me play then I will never say no if the coach needs me. I have to be honest with him as well if I feel all right. Of course, I would do it anytime</p>

I don’t know why they would. Maybe it’s because I voiced about the racism.<br /><br />If you boo me because of that then you are poor people. I am sorry.

I’m not in the investigations. I’m not a police officer. I just hope always people do their job right. But nothing happened and, to be honest, it was not a surprise. For me, it was not a surprise, because they always get away with it. Not always, sometimes they get punished, but mostly they get away with it.<br /><br />The support from my club was there. Also players and everything. For me this was not enough. These people need to be punished. They need educating. It’s a lack of education, simple. We all, even including you, we all failed in this. Because if people are really honest, we have so many people coming into the stadium and in that game when it happened against me, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans got arrested and why, because <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans reported the other <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans who abused <b>[Heung-min]</b> Son.<br /><br />So on the other side, nothing happened.

It’s simple; we are alone in this. We have to deal with it in our way. Walking off the pitch doesn’t make sense if they still don’t get punished. Does it make sense to walk off the pitch? I don’t think so.<br /><br />As a consequence? This is not a consequence because the consequence maybe I am again the bogeyman. What point is it if I leave the pitch and no-one gets punished? At the end, how people write stuff, I will be the booed man again. If there is no punishment for these people, racism won.

  <p><b>[Antonio Rudiger says he played a part in convincing <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> to come to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and compared the newly-signed striker to <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> star <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Jamie Vardy</a>]</b> I did speak to him before because we have known each other for a long time. We spoke a lot during the lockdown and he told me he was interested in coming to England. Of course then I did my bit, what I had to do. Like everyone, I’m very excited that he’s chosen <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and I’m looking forward to working with him. I’ve known him since he was 17 and he did very good in the past few years. He can be very important for us<br /><br />He’s a really big threat to defenders. <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> is a more counter-attacking team but in terms of attacking the defensive line, he’s similar to <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Vardy</a>. He has a lot of pace and if the defender makes a mistake and loses the ball, then he goes! His development was just ‘wow’. In his first season everything was new for him in men’s football but then he started scoring more goals and of course with that comes confidence. He had very good coaches who believed in him and worked with him</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Rudiger says he will be in trouble with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> if <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> fails to perform after adopting an agent role]</b> <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> asked me for an assessment. I have known Timo for a long time. I made a clear recommendation to do everything possible to get him. From the next season on he will have to deliver, otherwise I will get trouble from the club afterwards<br /><br />Although he <b>[Werner]</b> is not a classic penalty area striker, he has a certain robustness well suited to the toughness of English football. Counterattacking may have been more difficult for him at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> or with a top Italian team, who are always dealing with opponents who sit very deep. Even outside the group of top clubs, many teams try to play positive and attacking football against us. This will give him the space he needs and hopefully he can use it as much as he did at Leipzig.</p>
