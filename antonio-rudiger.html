  <p><b>[Antonio Rudiger is ready to take on a leadership role in a young <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> side]</b> I see myself as helping them, as always. As I did in the other years in the team when I played with <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> or <a href="gary-cahill.html">Gary Cahill</a> … I am loud on the pitch. Especially with the young guys because you need to help them.<br /><br />There will be a period – that is normal because we are all human – that you will fall a bit, the performances will go down. But there especially you need to – and me as the most experienced in the back – need to help those young guys. I’m in for that.<br /><br />In my position, it is very important to speak, to be loud because I have the whole pitch in front of me and this has always been natural to me. I always have, even when I was young, been commanding. I don’t read too much <b>[about fans wanting me back]</b>. That’s why I don’t really feel the pressure. But it’s also good if the people want me back and of course, there is a little bit of pressure. It’s good in football when you have a little bit of pressure because then you are ready to perform. At the moment, we have to take every game step by step. We are in the top four and we are five points ahead of the fifth-place team. We are in a good position but we need to be aware of performances like <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and West Ham<br /><br />Nervous? Not at all. It’s not the first time I’ve been injured for a long time. The first time at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> for a long time, but other clubs no. I always came back very good, that’s what I do. I had the operation, the surgery. You listen to the doctor who did the surgery and you have to be patient and just wait for your time. That’s what I did. It is normal, I want to play, but I am not 19 anymore. I deal with that differently. If you are on crutches, then you can’t do anything so you just have to be patient and wait. The coach let me have a little pre-season. It was for two and a half, almost three weeks. I really thank him. It was good for the legs but not for the heart so it was a really good idea from him. It feels good. It’s been a long time, it’s been a while now, but I’m very happy that everything went well and we are in the round of 16. I’m very happy. I missed everything as well. It was a good match for both sides. That is why you play football. I have to say thank you to everyone - the backroom staff, the coaches for their patience, and also the fans for their patience<br /><br />I hope soon <b>[I will be at my best]</b>! Of course, it makes a difference after a long time injured. You need some games to come into but if the coach has the intention to let me play then I will never say no if the coach needs me. I have to be honest with him as well if I feel all right. Of course, I would do it anytime</p>

If not, it will be forgotten again in a couple of days (as always). I don’t want to involve <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> as an entire club into this situation as I know that just a couple of idiots were the offenders. I got a lot of supportive messages on social media from <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fans as well in the last hours - thank you a lot for this. I really hope that the offenders will be found and punished soon, and in such a modern football ground like the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham Hotspur Stadium</a> with dozens of TV and security cameras, it must be possible to find and subsequently punish them. If not, then there must have been witnesses in the stadium who saw and heard the incident. It’s just such a shame that racism still exists in 2019. When will this nonsense stop?</p>

  <p><b>[Rudiger investigation closed with ‘no evidence to support’ <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> defender’s racial abuse allegation]</b> The club and the Metropolitan Police have now exhausted all avenues of investigation following the reported incident at our home fixture against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> on 22 December. We carried out extensive reviews of CCTV images and footage, working with professional lip readers. All materials and reports have now also been reviewed by the police who have carried out their own investigation. The police have notified us today that, having reviewed and investigated, they have closed the crime report as they can find no evidence to support the allegation of racial abuse.<br /><br />We fully support Antonio Rudiger with the action that he took - however there is no evidence to corroborate or contradict the allegation and as such neither ourselves nor the police are in a position to take any further action. We are fiercely proud of our anti-racism work and our zero tolerance of any form of discrimination. This is one reason why we have attributed so much time and resource to investigating this matter. Had we identified anyone guilty of this we were intent on issuing them with a lifetime ban from our stadium as they would have no place among our proud, diverse fan base. If any new information comes to light, this will be fully investigated</p>

He didn’t open his mouth and he didn’t say anything. We all knew there were rumours but even he was very quiet and just did his work as a professional. That’s what I always say. Everyone is always important and, as the manager said, he always behaved well. That’s why I give massive respect to him. He was always patient, he never said anything, even when his transfer didn’t go through.<br /><br />He remained humble and worked hard on the pitch. And there was also a difference when he came on against United. Today he had a big impact on the team so I really have to say thank you very much. I’ve known him and been playing with him for two-and-a-half years. He is a team player. He always puts himself on the line. He is not only about scoring. Of course, he is a striker and he scores, he scored today and thank you for that, but he is always putting in the hard work and that is why I am very pleased</p>

  <p><b>[New father Rudiger wants to protect his son from ‘stupidity’ of racism]</b> I’m not trying to offend but you <b>[white]</b> people will never understand what goes through my mind in this moment, or other black players’ minds, I am alone. I am totally alone.<br /><br />It’s nice if people are speaking up for me but at the end of the day, it just replays. Authority wise I’m alone. I heard about it <b>[being booed]</b>. It’s sad. I don’t know why they would. Maybe it’s because I voiced about the racism.<br /><br />If you boo me because of that then you are poor people. I am sorry. This is a sign that we have a very big problem. At the end of the day, I am alone in this case because I am the one who has to swallow this. With the win it makes me feel like a bit like, yes OK, but it makes me feel like it will always be like this. For me, in this case, racism won. I’m very careful with this. I’m not in the investigations. I’m not a police officer. I just hope always people do their job right. But nothing happened and, to be honest, it was not a surprise. For me, it was not a surprise, because they always get away with it. Not always, sometimes they get punished, but mostly they get away with it.<br /><br />The support from my club was there. Also players and everything. For me this was not enough. These people need to be punished. They need educating. It’s a lack of education, simple. We all, even including you, we all failed in this. Because if people are really honest, we have so many people coming into the stadium and in that game when it happened against me, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans got arrested and why, because <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans reported the other <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans who abused <b>[Heung-min]</b> Son.<br /><br />So on the other side, nothing happened. It’s the people who were around. And that’s why I say if we don’t stand up, racism won. I will always stand up. It’s not only about myself. It can be homophobic or something like that. It’s about standing up for people. I think this is normal. I’m not hurting anyone. I’m not killing anyone. I will always stand up for other people. I will not leave anyone like this<br /><br /><b>[Only last week, Porto striker Moussa Marega walked off the pitch in protest after being subjected to racist abuse away at Vitoria Guimaraes]</b> There you see, he wants to leave the pitch and his team-mates try to stop him. And there it was clear, everyone heard it. And his own team-mates held him back to stay on the pitch. He was alone. And he was booked for going out because he was racially abused. It’s simple; we are alone in this. We have to deal with it in our way. Walking off the pitch doesn’t make sense if they still don’t get punished. Does it make sense to walk off the pitch? I don’t think so.<br /><br />As a consequence? This is not a consequence because the consequence maybe I am again the bogeyman. What point is it if I leave the pitch and no-one gets punished? At the end, how people write stuff, I will be the booed man again. If there is no punishment for these people, racism won. That’s how I see it<br /><br />Definitely. 100% <b>[the best week of my life]</b>. And to win a derby, it is even better. A very good week. This week was a week with ups and downs. But more ups, especially for me because of the birth of my son – the first birth. It was tough days for me but with this win I am very happy. I’m very tired right now. I’m happy. Now I’m going to the hospital and finally, he comes home. It’s very tough but with this game, I’m very happy. Firstborn child. I have never experienced this type of emotion or what was going on in my head<br /><br /><b>[Now the 26-year-old is a father, he is keen to see his son grow up in a less toxic world]</b> Of course because if it happens at football, it is also happening outside and outside my son is going to be growing up. I will try to do my best. I will do my best to make sure my son is not stupid like other people. Sorry for this word, I don’t have any other words for this</p>

They won’t be punished and at the end of the day I’m the bogeyman. It is not that I give up or no longer raise my voice. I will always raise my voice, but I am alone in this regard<br /><br />Everyone should look at their own house, because when I was racially insulted in Italy, I always heard: ‘In Italy this is normal.’ Everyone should start with themselves at home and then talk about others. No country has anything under control. There is support, but words and deeds are different. At the end of the day anyone can say: ‘I’m sorry!’ But only those who share the same fate as me can understand. I could make an Instagram or Twitter post but what good would that do?

Not always, sometimes they get punished, but mostly they get away with it. The support from my club and players was there. For me, this was not enough. These people need to be punished. They need educating. It’s a lack of education, simple. We all failed in this<br /><br />If we’re seeing a rise in hate crime, the Home Office is seeing a rise in hate crime and other bodies are seeing a rise in hate crime. It’s all linked because that’s what is going on in society at the moment. If it’s there, we’ll see it in football. In some of the cases we have seen, there is a real hatred there which we haven’t maybe seen as much of in the past. It’s really violent and very targeted, particularly on social media. Some of the social media reports we’ve seen you wouldn’t want anyone to see. We’re talking to people all the time that feel, post-Brexit, that ‘maybe this country isn’t for me.’ <b>[Politicians]</b> have to take that responsibility very seriously, they are the leaders of the country and they need to set the tone. Society is reflected in football</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Rudiger says he played a part in convincing <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> to come to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and compared the newly-signed striker to <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> star Jamie Vardy]</b> I did speak to him before because we have known each other for a long time. We spoke a lot during the lockdown and he told me he was interested in coming to England. Of course then I did my bit, what I had to do. Like everyone, I’m very excited that he’s chosen <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and I’m looking forward to working with him. I’ve known him since he was 17 and he did very good in the past few years. He can be very important for us<br /><br />He’s a really big threat to defenders. <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> is a more counter-attacking team but in terms of attacking the defensive line, he’s similar to <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Vardy</a>. He has a lot of pace and if the defender makes a mistake and loses the ball, then he goes! His development was just ‘wow’. In his first season everything was new for him in men’s football but then he started scoring more goals and of course with that comes confidence. He had very good coaches who believed in him and worked with him</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Rudiger says he will be in trouble with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> if <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> fails to perform after adopting an agent role]</b> <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> asked me for an assessment. I have known Timo for a long time. I made a clear recommendation to do everything possible to get him. From the next season on he will have to deliver, otherwise I will get trouble from the club afterwards<br /><br />Although he <b>[Werner]</b> is not a classic penalty area striker, he has a certain robustness well suited to the toughness of English football. Counterattacking may have been more difficult for him at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> or with a top Italian team, who are always dealing with opponents who sit very deep. Even outside the group of top clubs, many teams try to play positive and attacking football against us. This will give him the space he needs and hopefully he can use it as much as he did at Leipzig.</p>
