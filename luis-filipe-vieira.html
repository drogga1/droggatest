  <p><b>[Benfica president Luis Filipe Vieira says Luiz is preparing to renew his <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> contract]</b> I spoke to him again yesterday. We have a father-to-son relationship. He was in the car with his agent, preparing to renew his contract with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. He is someone who loves <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a>, but there is something else he is: he is a great professional and has to earn money. What he earns is unthinkable for <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> to pay. If <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> comes to a day when he says ‘I want to leave here’, if he is 35 years old, in perfect condition, we will take <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> of course. If he came, it would have to be for a million, but as a father, I would say ‘No, David, you’re not coming, don’t be crazy. You have to make money!’When the football is over, nobody goes after him. If he came today, he would have to come under these conditions, otherwise, he could not come</p>
