  <p><b>[Club America sporting director Santiago Banos says rumors the club was working to bring Jonathan dos Santos in from Villarreal were true]</b> I’m going to be frank. We practically had an agreement with him to be able to come in, but in the end he preferred to go to MLS. He used our offer to pressure the American team.<br /><br />We’re hoping we can bring in a new signing this week.</p>

  <p><b>[Club America considering another signing after Jeremey Menez and Cecilio Dominguez injuries]</b> We’re still analyzing this place. The truth is we already had finished our signings. We’ve got a really strong, very solid squad. Unfortunately Jeremy was injured. There’s still a chance. We want to sign somebody, if it comes to pass, who might be able to perform in the entire attacking portion of the team, who could play on the left, who could play on the right, behind the nine or in a partnership with another central forward.<br /><br />You have to remember that Diego Lainez, who is a young player who comes in raising his hand, has a lot of calls to the national team coming up this semester and he’s going to be missing a lot. So we also have to cover up this absence</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico wonderkid Diego Lainez’s future is away from America]</b> I spoke with them, I reiterated that at the right time we’ll open the doors for Diego. It’s not about keeping him here. The one in charge of those things, above all the economics, is Mauricio <b>[Culebro, club president]</b>. On the sporting side, clearly it wasn’t what we wanted because we want Diego to stay with us for longer and surely it’s not what the club expected in economic terms. You have to wait for the right circumstances to come together both for the player and for us and Diego could leave without issue.</p>

  <p><b>[Club America’s sporting director says it’s almost certain that Diego Lainez will leave Liga MX this winter]</b> It’s almost certain that he’s leaving this tournament. We don’t want to close the doors for him to go and compete in international leagues, leagues that are first class.<br /><br />Obviously he’s generated interested on the national and international level. Yes, it’s true there’s interest <b>[from Ajax]</b>, but there’s also interest from another pair of teams, so you have to wait and see. We should go into this calmly and look for the offer that’s best for the club and for Diego</p>
