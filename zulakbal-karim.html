<blockquote>
  <p>[PBMS not perturbed by defeat to Perak as they switch over to FAM League] We know and are realistic that Perak has the advantage from all aspect. However, we did our best and I’m pleased with our performance. We played the way we planned. We are not overly disappointed because we only plan for the FAM League and there are only good things that we can learn from this game.<br /><br />All three goals came from individual mistakes and from players who are new to the team. We’ll learn from there and do our homework. Our target is to be the best four in the group and advance to the quarter finals<br /><br />Slightly disappointing not to be able to play in front of crowd today but on the other hand, we didn’t need the crowd to motivate us. We did our best but luck wasn’t with us. Perak has the advantage as they have imports. We’ll concentrate on our FAM League matches</p>
