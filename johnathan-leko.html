  <p><b>[West Brom winger Johnathan Leko admits he is happy to put the racist abuse suffered at the hands of <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> goalkeeper Kiko Casilla behind him]</b> I’m just glad it’s over now. At the time, I was annoyed how long it took to get dealt with. That probably made me feel bad because nobody was listening to me or taking me seriously. Now I’ve changed my stance and would tell people to report any incident. I had a meeting with the <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> and they say if it happens again, they can speed up the process and get people to help. I’ve had lots of support - especially from <a href="jack-charlton.html">Charlton</a>. I’ve had nothing from the <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> side. It surprises me a little bit as I thought I would get some sort of an apology, but I guess they have to back their player. It’s done now and I want to move on. I don’t want to talk it over with him. No - I don’t want to do that<br /><br />I don’t think it’s impacted me. I think I’ve dealt with it okay and I’m happy and trying to get fit for next season. I feel I’m mentally stronger than I’ve ever been. Especially with the injury, I feel like I can get through stuff a lot more easily. It came at the worst time. I was playing and <a href="jack-charlton.html">Charlton</a> were a good fit for me. It was a good learning experience for me. I really liked <b>[manager]</b> <a href="lee-bowyer.html">Lee Bowyer</a> - he gave me a lot of opportunities. The recovery is going well so far and I’m ahead of schedule. It’s been hard because I can’t go into the training ground because of the pandemic, so I’ve been doing it on my own in the garage. Normally the physio is there to help you, but it has made me stronger. If I was fit, and the season was back, I would personally go back in. But I do understand those who wouldn’t. Some have families and people at home they want to protect. I sympathise with them, but personally I would play. I’ve not been tested, but some of the players have</p>
