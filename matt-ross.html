<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Meet the Aussie coach carving out a career in Korea]</b> I played football as a kid before taking up refereeing and had two seasons as an assistant referee in the NSL twenty years ago<br /><br />It was being on the sidelines during those matches that I started paying attention to coaches like <a href="ange-postecoglou.html">Ange Postecoglou</a>, Bernd Stange, <a href="graham-arnold.html">Graham Arnold</a>, John Kosmina and Zorin <a href="nemanja-matic.html">Matic</a>. At the time I never envisaged that I would follow their career path, but I still have clear memories of their coaching points and motivational techniques. I only started playing again at 28 and had a season in the Virgin Islands national league. The next year I began coaching with the Football Federation Northern Territory. After coaching in Darwin for five years I couldn’t really see a career path in Australia, so we left for Germany in 2012. I initially wanted to go to Europe just to improve my football knowledge and understanding, but ultimately to see if I was good enough to make it over there. My wife and I quit our jobs and flew to Germany to start from scratch. I needed full immersion in a traditional football culture to develop a deeper understanding of the game. I began as an unpaid video analyst, to coaching in the fourth division, youth team, first team assistant coach, caretaker coach, then head coach at Frankfurt. It was a bit surreal. It’s only when I look back now I realise how quickly I progressed.<br /><br />I can remember the sleepless nights the year we won the Champions League. I was the opposition scout/video analyst, teaching full-time, coaching the youth team and completing my <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> A Licence. I was flying around Europe and stretched to the limit physically and mentally. It was not until after we won it that you could stop and realise the weight of the achievement. You’re always thinking about the next game, the next training session, the next challenge. To then take over as head coach of the European champions mid-season, you just take it in your stride and get to work. There was no time to process it or enjoy it, you only feel the pressure of winning the next match. During my time in charge we finished third and fifth in the league and made the Champions League semi-final. It was a sharp learning curve and a wonderful experience<br /><br /><b>[Along the way Ross has battled prejudice in Europe because of his nationality and the lack of a high-profile professional playing background]</b> I don’t think there’s been an Australian head coach in Germany or Sweden in the women’s game. I don’t know why more Australian coaches don’t head overseas to challenge themselves and get out of their comfort zone. I started by taking the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> B license in Ireland. When I arrived in Germany, they didn’t acknowledge my AFC qualifications. It took me a year of door knocking to get a chance to prove myself at the bottom of the football pyramid. There was a definite prejudice – you’re an Australian, what do you know about football?<br /><br /><b>[Ross spent just one season in Sweden before the opportunity to coach in China arose]</b> Sweden was a fantastic experience. I had the plan to stay there long-term, until China came in with a deal that I couldn’t really refuse. It’s a great league and it’s not really acknowledged how tough it is. There is nothing between first and last in the league. You needed to be at the top of your game every week. The football culture was strong, yet very different to Germany, where the head coach leads the way. In Sweden it was much more of a horizontal organisational culture and more of a collective process. The players and the board wanted their opinions to be heard on everything, including if the head coach should stay or go<br /><br /><b>[There is also the small matter of helping South Korea qualify for the next Olympic Games, once the Coronavirus-caused shutdown ends]</b> In terms of the team and the Korean Football Association (KFA), they’ve been really welcoming and accommodating. It was an initiative from the KFA to get European-experienced coaches in for the first time. The players have really embraced our concepts and are the best group I have ever worked with. Technically, like the Japanese, the Koreans are very talented. There is tactical work to do, but it’s more about the self-belief that we are good enough to compete at the top level. We were ranked 20th last year and have moved up to 18th. We want to be a top 10 country. Part of the attraction of the role was to work with a senior international team, and with a country like Korea that have traditionally underachieved but have huge potential. My wife is Korean, so I’m very proud to serve the country and fully understand the importance of the national team to the nation’s psyche. We’ve got the Olympic playoff games against China scheduled in June, so I’m continuing to analyse them. We’re keeping in regular contact with the squad, monitoring their fitness and analysing other national teams. You keep working and preparing as best you can. I left China in December and moved here, which turned out to be very good timing<br /><br /><b>[While Ross has been based overseas since 2012, he continues to keep a close eye on Australian football]</b> It’s a dangerous time for Australian football. They’ve got to be really careful how they plan and strategise for the next 5-10 years, otherwise Asia is going to be a tough place <b>[for them]</b>. I can see what other countries are putting into their football development. Playing the Matildas would be great. I flew back to Sydney to watch them play against China. I coached Emily van Egmond in Frankfurt, so I was pleased for her to score such an important goal. We need to be playing games against the likes of Japan and Australia. That’s the fastest way we’re going to learn and improve<br /><br /><b>[Ross has recently been accepted onto the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Pro License course in Ireland alongside the likes of former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> defender <b>[John O’Shea]</b>(john-o-shea.html), ex-Chelsea goalkeeper <a href="carlo-cudicini.html">Carlo Cudicini</a> and former Perth Glory striker Andy Keogh]</b> I would have never expected to be in Korea two matches away from an Olympic Games. You just never know where football is going to take you. It’s been a great journey so far, but I still consider myself a young coach with a lot to learn. It hasn’t been a conventional career path. I’ve had my foot on the gas for eight years and I’m always chasing the next idea or innovation to improve my coaching</p>
