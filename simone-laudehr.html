  <p><b>[q: How would you assess <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Women’s EURO qualifying?]</b> The good thing is that we have maximum points, winning every match and picking up all 12 points. There have been some matches, like against Croatia, which was pretty close, where we just didn’t take advantage of the chances we created. But if you look at the results and the points, we are doing pretty well in top spot. And we plan on continuing that way<br /><br /><b>[q: The next big tournament is the Olympics in Brazil. Germany’s women have never won Olympic gold, so is that extra motivation?]</b> It would certainly be nice to win an Olympic gold medal, but I have to say it was already a big achievement to win Olympic bronze and, in general, to have participated at the Games, experienced it and lived with other sportsmen and women in the Olympic village, including the other German athletes of course. And just to watch the other sports. Winning a medal was one of my greatest experiences, so it would be nice to achieve that again. It makes you want more<br /><br /><b>[q: It will be the farewell tournament for your coach since 2005, <a href="silvia-neid.html">Silvia Neid</a>, and then <a href="steffi-jones.html">Steffi Jones</a>, already with the team as assistant coach, will take over. What do you think will change? Will there be a lot of changes or not many?]</b> Well, <a href="steffi-jones.html">Steffi Jones</a> is with us already, but not as head coach. I think things will become clear when the change takes place. At the moment we’re focusing on the ideas and objectives Silvia has. She is very ambitious, she wants to be successful and she has been showing that. We still have challenges ahead and we have been working on things according to her ideas. That is the focus right now. Then, when the change takes place, we can reassess. But at the moment she <b>[Steffi Jones]</b> is taking part in training, which is certainly important. But we’re completely focused on Silvia as head coach<br /><br /><b>[q: Looking at your own personal development as a player over the last few years, where would you say you have developed, or gained more experience?]</b> I’m now among the more experienced players. I think the last year, six months before the World Cup, I took a big step forward. And the World Cup itself was pretty OK for me personally, although I think we deserved more with the team than we achieved <b>[fourth place]</b> – or more precisely, than we didn’t achieve in the end. But I think the first six months of 2015 were a period where I took another step forward in my development and reached new levels. That’s when I learned some things I didn’t know or understand when I was younger</p>
