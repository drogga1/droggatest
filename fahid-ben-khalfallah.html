  <p><b>[Fahid Ben Khalfallah has claimed not one team has threatened Melbourne Victory during their six-game winning streak in the A-League]</b> Yeah, because we score goals and obviously with me as a winger or midfielder, I want to play in a team like that because we’ve been scoring goals and we’ve been playing really good football. The last six or seven weeks, I don’t think one team stayed with us or we were in trouble. When we’re playing like that we know it’s going to be hard for the other team.<br /><br />To be honest, as a player, we want to play. If I can play every three days, I’ll do it. That’s one thing we want. We don’t want to train, we want to play games. Obviously, that’s a long a trip but we’re soccer players. I’m very happy to go to New Zealand to play and if we have to go to Perth just after, yeah, we have to do it. We have to deal with that, so it’s not a problem, and we have a big squad, good quality players, so even if Kevin <b>[Muscat]</b> wants to make some changes he’ll do it and the team will be fine<br /><br />Yeah, I think so. To be honest, it was just amazing the way we played. We scored three goals - the goals we scored, I think we had everything, so I don’t know what happened after. Unfortunately, they scored twice… I don’t know if we relaxed, I have no idea, so I think it’s a good lesson. We should be more careful and we have to keep playing</p>

  <p><b>[Brisbane Roar attacker Fahid Ben Khalfallah has criticised his teammates following their 3-0 defeat to Sydney FC at Suncorp Stadium]</b> We have to look in the mirror because that’s not good enough. It’s ridiculous. It’s just the players - we have to do more. The staff, everyone <b>[else]</b> is amazing. We lost at home last week, we lose again and I’m done with that. We can’t accept that. We have to work harder. We have good players and great staff but that’s not enough unfortunately.</p>
