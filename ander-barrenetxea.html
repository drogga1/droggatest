  <p><b>[Real Sociedad’s Barrenetxea reveals ‘great satisfaction and pride’ after making Goal’s NxGn list of top U19 stars]</b> It is a great satisfaction and pride that I have been considered one of the 50 best under-19s in the world. To see you on a list with so many great names for the future is an extra motivation<br /><br /><b>[Barrenetxea added on how he has adapted to life in the Sociedad first team]</b> Going from being with your lifelong companions to a locker room with people with children was a pretty radical change. You have to know how to wear it and be calm, without wanting to run too fast due to the high level that you play. You play less than you played in other categories, but you have to take that as another learning process<br /><br /><b>[The Spanish midfielder said of his ongoing spell in self-isolation]</b> Aware of the situation we are in, we are respecting the quarantine without leaving home. The club has provided us with material so that we can carry out all the exercises that the physical trainers send us daily in order to be able to maintain our shape, while enjoying life with the family and spending the hours in the best possible way</p>
