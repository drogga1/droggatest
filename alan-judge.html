  <p><b>[Midfielder Alan Judge has revealed his daughter Emily requiring surgery in London was chief among the reasons a summer move to QPR appealed to him]</b> QPR did come in for me. I know it was said that the move did appeal to me and, yes, it would have meant playing in the Championship but there were a number of other reasons why I would have been interested and they are personal reasons<br /><br />My daughter Emily needs two operations and she needs those operations in London and I was living five minutes away from the hospital. You ask any parent what comes into your mind first - your family, your kids. The welfare of my family is number one for me. Always will be. I’ve kept it quiet until now. Only a few people know about it at the club. I don’t want to go into the details of the surgery. There are two stages but they are big operations<br /><br />I had to think about everything as a parent as much as a footballer and that’s why I felt staying in London and going to QPR was maybe the right thing to ask about. Sometimes more important things than football take over. I spoke to the owner and he said he understood my situation but wanted me to stay and that was the end of it. I was happy to get on with it from there. <br /><br />I can understand it that the fans can get disappointed if they hear a player wants to leave. They are entitled to their opinions but sometimes they are not aware of the full facts. I heard some comments that I didn’t care about the club and all that but those people don’t know me. I’m not like that. I’ve always given everything wherever I’ve been<br /><br />When the supporters watched me play against Sunderland they probably though ‘Crikey, what’s going on with him?’. It was the same at Peterborough. I sat outside the dressing room after that game and thought to myself ‘I can’t even cross a ball’<br /><br />The gaffer overheard me talking to myself and he knew where my head was and said it will come right in time. I feel I’m getting there now though. I’ve got over the <b>[wrist]</b> injury which put me back six weeks and my family have moved down to Ipswich this week which is massive for us as a family. My daughter will have her operations at the end of September so there is still the worry over that naturally but life is a bit calmer now and that will help my football</p>
