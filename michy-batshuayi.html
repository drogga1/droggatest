  <p><b>[Michy Batshuayi has joked that he hopes he does not lose his Borussia Dortmund place to sprint king Usain Bolt]</b> I watched the videos. He did nutmegs and scored a good goal. He’s a champion. He pushes himself beyond his limits every day. He wants to beat all the records. He’s trying to establish himself in another sport, that’s classy, I’m happy for him. But I hope he doesn’t come and take my place!</p>

  <p><b>[Michy Batshuayi admits to having had a lot of possibilities to consider prior to leaving Chelsea for Borussia Dortmund during the January transfer window]</b> needed game time to find myself. There were a lot of possibilities. With Dortmund, it was done very quickly. I had a game with Chelsea the next day, I had scored a double in the previous match and everyone was counting on me. Suddenly, while I was walking in the city, I found myself on a plane. On the one hand, I was happy to leave because I knew that I was going to benefit from more playing time. On the other, I had just put in some very good performances with Chelsea and the club would have preferred that I stayed.<br /><br />I have always wanted to play in Dortmund. I had already told reporters that. If you look, you only have to find statements I made at Standard. I was asked, ‘Which clubs do you want to play for during your career?’. I replied: ‘Marseille and Dortmund’. And now, I’m happy because I have been at both clubs - two major institutions in their respective countries and on the international scene</p>

  <p><b>[Batshuayi stated that he would only enter into discussions regarding his future once his international commitments were over]</b> Dortmund was a great experience for me. They welcomed me very warmly. I was in a good environment and you could see that on the pitch. It was a while since I had played so much. I can’t remember being allowed to play two games in a row at Chelsea. It was good to gain confidence. I don’t have a preference; they’re two beautiful clubs. My focus is on the World Cup right now and I don’t want to think about what happens afterwards.</p>

  <p><b>[Michy Batshuayi says he wants to return to Chelsea]</b> No. I’ve so much respect for Chelsea and I love them. This loan is important for my development, to show how good I am so that I can go back to Chelsea a better player. Everyone knows there’s real emphasis on technique in La Liga and I’m a technical player; in that sense it’s a good fit. But all leagues are a good fit for me - I can play anywhere. Germany and England were good fits too.<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether he has been in contact with his parent club since moving to Valencia]</b> I haven’t spoken to them, not at all. That’s something for my agent and Chelsea to take care of, but I’ve not spoken to the club or <b>[Maurizio]</b> Sarri<br /><br /><b>[Batshuayi also opened up on the difficulties he faced when he arrived at Stamford Bridge from Marseille as a 22-year-old]</b> Initially it was difficult for me. I was a young guy arriving at such a huge club, a changing room filled with stars. Fortunately I had Eden <b>[Hazard]</b> and <b>[Thibaut]</b> Courtois who took me under their wing and explained how things were done</p>

It’s a club I love deeply.<br /><br />When I was young, it’s true that I had some problems with discipline. But what young person doesn’t? Today, I’m 26 years old, I can channel myself and I work at training and in the game. I’m playful, but I choose my moments: at 0-0 I’m going to be serious, at 2 or 3-0 I’m going to play it up. Being cool is part of my personality. But it’s true: the pressure of football imposes the need to perform and win. The competition is raging, and seriousness is needed</p>
