<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Harry Kane has been criticised for no reason]</b> He’s been criticised for no reason because that’s how football is. Harry’s been at the top now for the last few years, banging in goals week in and week out. He’s been a regular, he’s been playing the World Cup, he’s been captain at the World Cup. What else can you ask from Harry? He’s still young and I’m sure he’s still got a lot to do and he’s not going to disappoint you guys. So, what do I make of this criticism? I don’t make anything, honestly, I don’t even listen to them and I hope he doesn’t as well<br /><br />It’s the start of the season so I can’t really judge at the moment. The season is long, especially in the Premier League and they’ve got the Champions League as well. But so far the start isn’t too bad. Now people have got expectations from Spurs, a lot of expectations, so I think they’ve got the players to back that expectation and they’ll do a good season. I’m not worried about them and I’ve got my faith and trust in them. I think they’ll be contenders for the top four, definitely they’ll be in there. There’s loads of good teams in there, it’s getting tougher and tougher. But I think they have the experience and they haven’t changed the squad so they know each other, they’ve been working together for a long time and I think that’ll pay off. They had a great season last season and I don’t know if they’ll better it this season because I’m not really good for gambling and for predictions. But I’m sure they’ll do their best and that it’ll pay off</p>
