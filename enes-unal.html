  <p><b>[At just 19 years old, Enes Unal has to live up to a big reputation. Already a Turkey international, contracted to Manchester City and enjoying a good season on loan at Twente in the Eredivisie]</b> I always work hard to score, choose positions and be able to shoot with my left or right foot. I just need to find the right position. If I get playing time and the positions come then I know I can score. I want to be a complete striker. I’m fast, maybe not the fastest, but I’m strong and I think a particularly deadly and effective striker. If I can take the ball to the penalty area or around the box, then I can score.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City made sure a €25 million buy-back option was included in their deal to sell Enes Unal to Villlarreal. Batur Altiparmak said]</b> I can’t give the names of the teams that were interested in Enes Unal. But our choices were down to two, a team from Spain and a team from Germany. We chose the team from Spain.<br /><br />We wanted Enes to play for Villarreal because they have been playing in 4-4-2 formation for a long time. And apart from Barcelona and Real Madrid, they’re used to having possession against every team. That’s why we decided that Villarreal was the best fit and the team from Germany was very sad about it. They really wanted to sign Enes.<br /><br />Manchester City didn’t interfere with our process. They just wanted us to keep them posted. At first, they wanted to loan Enes out again but we told them that teams eager to loan players are not usually very strong and often have financial difficulties. City agreed but told us: ‘We are a big club and we will only sell Enes if we have a buy back option. We can sell him for €15m and buy back for €25m’.<br /><br />Villarreal didn’t want to sign him on loan and neither did Monaco. Well, so much for keeping teams’ names out then. I’ve just let one slip. The French league is more complicated. There was a risk there for Enes</p>
