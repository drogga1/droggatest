  <p><b>[Nicknamed after Ronaldo, meet Ligue 1 rising star Rony Lopes]</b> The project they presented was based on young players who had a big margin to grow up and improve. The coach was Portuguese and some friends of mine were already there, such as Bernardo Silva.</p>

  <p><b>[Rony Lopes need look no further than complete Cristiano Ronaldo for inspiration]</b> For me, he <b>[Ronaldo]</b> is the best and the most complete. He plays well with his head, left foot and right foot. What is beautiful is that he works every day. He has already won five Ballons d’Or and continues to work. Frankly, we have to congratulate him for that because what he has been doing for 10 or 12 years in football is incredible. It’s a source of inspiration at every level.<br /><br />Individually, I think it’s been a very positive season for me. I managed to do good things, like my first game in the Champions League, my first goal in the competition and be called up to the national team for the first time. I scored goals and assists so I like my season even if it is not over and we still have one game to play. I am still a young player. I still have a lot to learn, that’s for sure. I learned a lot this year. A while ago someone in Portugal told me the same thing: ‘We hear about Rony for several years but he is still young, he is only 22!’ And it’s true that some people have heard about me since I was 15 so they consider me to be an experienced player now. I have some experience, but I still have a lot to learn<br /><br />Since the beginning of the season I knew what I needed to improve. I knew I had already played good games but, today, if you do not score or do not make assists nobody will talk about you. That’s why at the beginning of the season I tried to see what I was not doing well and why I was not scoring enough. I worked with the coach and with a mental coach. Until now, 2018 has been a beautiful year for me. Even if I’m not a striker, I want to be a player who scores goals and makes a difference</p>

  <p><b>[Rony Lopes says <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a>’s sacking by <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> was unfair]</b> The time with Henry was a very hard campaign because it was a moment in the season when we had 17 injured players. We played in the Champions League with five strikers who were 18 years old. Even if they are good players, they do not have the experience to play games like that. It was a hard season for them. I have never been in a situation like that in my life. I think people don’t really know what happened with <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry</a>. In my opinion, the club did not give him enough time. The training sessions were really good and the ideas were bright, engaging and good. When he had the players back fit, and the team starting to be how he wanted, the club sacked him. I did not agree with that. If they had given him more time, he could have been a fantastic coach for <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a>. In training, I could see the signs. The team had confidence back again. Things were going well at the moment they sacked him.<br /><br /><b>[For Lopes, the biggest challenge of the lockdown in Spain is keeping himself focused psychologically despite having nothing to train fo]</b> I am in Seville with my fitness coach and my cousin. For sure, if I was here alone I would go mad. These moments are crazy. We can only leave the house to go to the supermarket. If you go and you don’t know what to say to the police, you will pay a fine. The important thing is to follow the rules and protect people. The challenge is psychological for everyone. I am used to staying at home, apart from going for dinner, but it is a difficult period for us. We are used to training with dozens of friends, so it is difficult. We are training for nothing, as there is nothing at the end of the week. We have to keep our minds straight and think positive things</p>
