  <p><b>[Rony Lopes says <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a>’s sacking by <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> was unfair]</b> The time with Henry was a very hard campaign because it was a moment in the season when we had 17 injured players. We played in the Champions League with five strikers who were 18 years old. Even if they are good players, they do not have the experience to play games like that. It was a hard season for them. I have never been in a situation like that in my life. I think people don’t really know what happened with <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry</a>. In my opinion, the club did not give him enough time. The training sessions were really good and the ideas were bright, engaging and good. When he had the players back fit, and the team starting to be how he wanted, the club sacked him. I did not agree with that. If they had given him more time, he could have been a fantastic coach for <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a>. In training, I could see the signs. The team had confidence back again. Things were going well at the moment they sacked him.<br /><br /><b>[For Lopes, the biggest challenge of the lockdown in Spain is keeping himself focused psychologically despite having nothing to train fo]</b> I am in Seville with my fitness coach and my cousin. For sure, if I was here alone I would go mad. These moments are crazy. We can only leave the house to go to the supermarket. If you go and you don’t know what to say to the police, you will pay a fine. The important thing is to follow the rules and protect people. The challenge is psychological for everyone. I am used to staying at home, apart from going for dinner, but it is a difficult period for us. We are used to training with dozens of friends, so it is difficult. We are training for nothing, as there is nothing at the end of the week. We have to keep our minds straight and think positive things</p>
