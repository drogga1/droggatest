  <p><b>[USA Soccer trying to lock down Bayern prospect Timothy Tillman]</b> We even had his tickets and everything. He was all set and ready to go, but he decided at the last moment that he would accept a call from Germany. I think the door is still open. We’ve been trying, but at the moment obviously he’s still not with us. The contact started last summer, and we followed up to the point where he was going to join us in November when he got the call from Germany and decided to do that. We’re on top of it.</p>

  <p><b>[Tab Ramos names 20-player roster for U-20 World Cup qualifying]</b> This process is always difficult. Inevitably you always end up leaving a couple guys out who deserve to be on the roster. When selecting a roster for a tournament like this, where you are trying to qualify to the World Cup, you are putting together a best 11 and then players who can play multiple positions. So that’s what we’ve done. We are happy with the team and we are looking forward to qualifying</p>

  <p><b>[Tab Ramos needs his attack to catch up with his defense]</b> The area where we have to step up is getting to goal. We have to get to goal better. We have been scoring in the warmup games, but I feel like we should be doing better. Our transition play can get better. That’s something we’ve been working on really hard over the last couple of weeks, to make sure that when we go to goal, we go with speed.<br /><br />He’s really become someone who wants to lead the team, and I think that’s a great sign. He’s really taken to the idea of being a leader, which is something you love to see from your one of your best players<br /><br /><b>[On Tyler Adams]</b> You really can’t tell he’s one of the youngest guys on our team, the way he plays. He’s relentless and just has the right attitude. He could have been the captain of this team<br /><br />Even in the last cycle, when Gedion Zelalem sort of held the rains together with Emerson Hyndman in the middle, I don’t think there was ever one player who was the brains of the team, just running it. I think this group is a little bit of the same. Obviously, there’s no Emerson Hyndman here and Gedion we couldn’t have unfortunately, but we have good players. We have Sebastian Saucedo, we have Luca de la Torre. Having players like Eryk Williamson and Brooks Lennon, they’re all players who can create on the attacking side. We’ve given them full confidence to create, to be creative and think outside the box<br /><br />This team is a bit more of a transition team than we’ve had in the past. Whether it’s Jonathan Lewis, or Coy Craft, or Brooks Lennon, or Luca De La Torre, we have the speed to cause some problems for people, and if we can improve or transition play, we’ll be in good shape<br /><br />I’m sure that was really difficult for him. Obviously his dad is not around U.S. Soccer any longer, and I’m not sure if that’s a relief for him or not, and how he’s handling that part of it, but he’s really been flourishing the past couple of months. He’s at his best right now<br /><br />I believe this group is ready and knows what to expect from this tournament. We know there will be tough moments, and games that will test us, but this group is talented enough to handle it and get the job done</p>

  <p><b>[USA draws Ecuador, Senegal and Saudi Arabia in U-20 World Cup]</b> We are proud to have earned a group top seed for the 2017 U-20 World Cup. As CONCACAF champions and 2015 U-20 World Cup quarterfinalists, we have put ourselves in a great position for this tournament. Our youth national team program has been on an upward trend and we need to continue to push forward in Korea Republic. This was a difficult draw, but we are ready for the challenge. Our plan is to treat each game like a final, so our preparation now shifts to Ecuador</p>

  <p><b>[Can ‘Messi-type’ Christian Pulisic become America’s first soccer superstar?]</b> He was the littlest guy on the field, by far, but he was just thinking at a different pace than everybody else. His touch was so easy. He ran the show. He looked really tiny, like fragile, like somebody’s going to hurt him. Then, you notice no one’s going to hurt him because nobody can even get close to him. And it wasn’t because he had lightning speed. It was because he read the game so well. Nobody could kick him because nobody could think that fast.<br /><br />I just saw something in him that was completely different<br /><br />There were a couple of clubs that called me personally and asked me, ‘How is he different?’. I told them, ‘He is different because he is the real thing’.<br /><br />Up until about a year ago, we kind of took for granted he was jumping into games with the <b>[Dortmund]</b> first team, doing stuff that none of our greatest players have ever done. When you think about it, you think the Dortmund coach, in the Champions League game, looks at the bench and picks Christian. When you think about the kind of players he could pick and he picks Christian, that makes you go ‘whoa!’ It shows you how well he is doing<br /><br />I always try to hold back as much as I can from complimenting our younger players, because you know how we do. We automatically build the guy up, and then we kill him really because we don’t allow him to grow. With Christian, it’s clear by now that he’s a special player and it’s tough to ignore what he has done over the past year<br /><br />I think Messi-type players almost live in a different dimension than everybody else, and the game is slow for them. I think Christian has that ability. Obviously Christian’s not Messi, but I do know that he’s in a different dimension. The game moves at a different speed for him than for everyone else.</p>

  <p><b>[Tab Ramos believes the two months since the CONCACAF tournament have allowed some key players to gain valuable experience]</b> Do I expect more from us? I absolutely expect more. We led the tournament in shots on goal in CONCACAF - I think we had something like 81 shots and the second team had 60 in the tournament - and yet we didn’t even lead the tournament in scoring. So we were not great up front in CONCACAF, and we have to get better in the World Cup because chances are we won’t get as many chances.<br /><br />Coming in I was a little bit concerned with <b>[Zelalem’s]</b> form, and what it would look like, but after having seen him for the last three or four days in practice I’m convinced he’s ready to do a great job for us, so no concerns there. I would have hoped that obviously his career at this point would be a little bit more advanced. Two years ago he was already at Arsenal, he had already gotten some opportunities with the first team, and here we are two years later and still looking at the same type of scenario<br /><br />The team is not a whole lot different. We obviously added Gedion in the center of the field - that’ll help us because he’s a great possession player. We definitely have to get him to make the game-winning type plays, so hopefully we get that<br /><br />At this point, Cameron Carter-Vickers’s been running. He’s mostly been working on fitness so far, and we are hoping that in the next three or four days he’s going to continue to make progress and be available to us possible for early next week<br /><br /><b>[The Americans will head to Asia with confidence gleaned from an impressive run to a CONCACAF title]</b> We’re very proud that, for the first time, we get to travel to a World Cup as champions of our region, and I’m looking forward to seeing how the team responds to that. Normally we like to play the underdog role, and in this case although we remain underdogs we go there as champions and I hope that we can really take this new experience as a good one, and this becomes more the norm rather than the exception<br /><br />It’s definitely a difficult challenge. This tournament is certainly different than the CONCACAF tournament. I always feel that the CONCACAF tournament is long and we can plan that way because we have the talent to be able to plan for a long tournament. In the World Cup, any team can beat you, and by getting the runner-up team in South America as the first team you play, we already start with a final. So we cannot afford in this tournament to gradually get better. We have to come in already 12 days from now and play the first final. There’s no other way.<br /><br />Ecuador has a very potent attack. They can counter really well, so our pressure - if it gets broken at different times - they can create some difficult opportunities for us, just like they did when they beat Argentina 3-0, and when they tied Brazil 3-3. They’re extremely dangerous up front. But I think it’ll be a great experience for us. It’s a game that we have to come out and we feel we have to win</p>

But I believe in this team, so whoever has an opportunity to play I’m sure they’ll do a great job.<br /><br />We know they’re going to be a hardworking team. We faced them in the last World Cup and they’re going to make things difficult. We’re learning, we’re getting better. I feel that our team will be prepared. We know that it’s a final. You have to come out and win it</p>

  <p><b>[Much like Landon Donovan, Tab Ramos never saw himself as a No.10, even if coaches often used him there since many times he was the most skilled player on his team]</b> was also forced into the 10 role but I always saw myself as a right-winger type guy who could beat my guy every time and get the ball over and get good service to people. Get good assists to people. That was my thing. I wasn’t a 10 then either, I was more a one-on-one guy, beat you and get the ball over, get a good cross in, I could change the game that way.<br /><br />Claudio was more of an organizing type midfielder that spread the ball around, that really saw the game really well and kept everybody in the game. And then I see Landon as the more direct guy, more without the ball, that can make the run without the ball and kill you.</p>

  <p><b>[Tab Ramos has convened more than 150 of the top USA youth national team prospects for an unprecedented U.S. youth summit]</b> I do tell the kids here, you play for the U.S., it’s not a club. You have to feel the colors of the country, that’s really important. For me, playing for a national team is more a feeling than anything else. If we have players in this country who feel Mexican and want to play for Mexico, I think they should play for Mexico. If we have players here who feel American, who want to fight for the U.S. and represent America, they should play for us. I think it’s as simple as that<br /><br /><b>[Ramos admitted to being concerned about Gonzalez’s international future]</b> I can only control what happens with the U-20 and down. That’s what I do. I kept in touch with Jona, I have a good relationship with him. I’ve stayed in touch with him over the last six months. You can ask him about the relationship that we have. If at this moment he felt like Mexico is the right place for him for the rest of his career, then at that point there’s only so much you can do<br /><br />We have been respectful of everything he’s done. We’ve called him just about every year for every age group. It’s not like he’s gone unidentified. He just decided to switch to play for another country<br /><br /><b>[Ramos insists he isn’t concerned with the Mexican federation’s efforts]</b> We had a very successful year with our youth national teams. We’ve got good players and maybe they’re starting to feel like they have to come here and get players<br /><br />It can pull both ways, in particular of how you grow up a certain way at home. You feel that. You’re American, but you feel that. Going into the World Cup this summer I’m rooting for Uruguay. Why would I not? That’s where my family comes from. It’s only normal. Of course I would root for the U.S. if they were there, but they’re not. I think it’s normal to always have that pull, but I believe you can’t treat a national team like a club. You have to feel the colors and want to fight for it.</p>

  <p><b>[How the World Cup brought enemies Iran and USA together 20 years ago]</b> We talked about taking the picture together, and we asked everybody how they all felt and all the players were all for it.

We want to make people happy and make people cheer, so we took the picture together.<br /><br /><b>[Ramos recalled of the match, which finished with the Iranians winning 2-1]</b> We were a little bit afraid of their counter. That was a good Iran team. We had the ball more, but I think on the counter they were really dangerous and eventually they got us. If anything, we were dominating the game but unfortunately they caught us and sometimes that’s just the way it goes<br /><br />Maybe we did have a little effect on the political climate getting better. When you’re a player that’s not really what you do, but if you can help people understand each other and come together it feels good to do that<br /><br /><b>[Mohammad Khakpour]</b> was the nicest guy, and one of the few foreign players who I visited his house for dinner, and he came to my home for dinner.

Part of our way of breaking down Ukraine is not going to be by sitting all the way back and hopefully countering. It’s not something I’m comfortable with, it’s not something I like and it’s not something that fits our players. Our players want to attack. Our players want to be aggressive.

And this group sometimes just goes ‘we got this coach’. It’s that kind of group. I really like that. When I see us walk on the field and I see guys like Alex Mendez and Mark McKenzie and Paxton (Pomykal) and those kind of guys who are just so confident when they walk on the field. It gives you a good feeling as a coach that everything’s going to be okay. This group’s a little bit different like that<br /><br />Most of the public has not seen our team play, and don’t really know our players well.

  <p><b>[USA faces Ecuador with an eye on Under-20 World Cup semifinals]</b> When you have a second round game against France, and you get over such a huge hurdle, it’s not necessarily something that we’re used to. I think the mental aspect over the last three or four days has been the most important with the team. To make sure that they get a little time away, that they get a little time to feel good about what’s happened because that’s important. It’s a big accomplishment, but at the same time to now stay focused on what happens next.<br /><br />Ecuador is a team that attacks very well, that keeps the ball very well, and defends very well. A team like this, that has such a good trajectory in South America, it looks like a complete team. In tha sense, we’re going up against an opponent that we don’t see with any holes<br /><br />We’re going into the game to play our soccer. Our soccer is to win the ball, is to force the play, is to try and win. We’re two teams that are going out to win the game and I think it’s going to be a good game</p>

  <p><b>[Under-20 World Cup provides harsh lessons for promising USA team]</b> We didn’t play our best game. There’s no doubt. I think we’ve played better in this tournament, including when we lost the first game against Ukraine.</p>

  <p><b>[Tab <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Ramos</a> has left his role with the U.S. U-20 men’s national team to take over as head coach of the Houston Dynamo]</b> I’m excited to join the Houston Dynamo organization and I’m looking forward to the challenge of leading this group of players. This is a club that has winning in its DNA, a club with a clear vision for the future centered around development and a team-first mentality, and Houston is a city that has tremendous untapped potential as a soccer market, both on and off the field. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I can’t wait to get started</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="chris-richards.html">Chris Richards</a>]</b> Out of all the centerbacks I’ve coached I think he’s the one with the most potential. He has unlimited potential. All the other guys you could tell they’re good. They’re solid. I look at <b>[Matt]</b> Miazga, <b>[Cameron]</b> Carter-Vickers, Erik Palmer-Brown. I just think Richards has a really high ceiling. He also has great charisma, which other guys follow, and he makes a team better because of it</p>

  <p><b>[Tab Ramos on <a href="sebastian-soto.html">Sebastian Soto</a>]</b> He’s definitely a team-first type player and he’s excellent around the box. When he gets a chance, he puts it away. People just can’t do that consistently. You have tons of great players who can’t score goals and he can</p>
