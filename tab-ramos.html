  <p><b>[Who is Sebastian Soto? The Hannover striker who could be the USA goal machine at the U-20 World Cup]</b> He’s definitely a team-first type player and he’s excellent around the box. When he gets a chance, he puts it away. People just can’t do that consistently. You have tons of great players who can’t score goals and he can.</p>

  <p><b>[USA heads into Under-20 World Cup with high expectations, and the swagger to go with it]</b> I think we have the best team we’ve had. We have the most talent we’ve had, but I don’t know every single team in the World Cup right now. I don’t know if Ukraine doesn’t have the best team they’ve ever had in their history too. It’s really hard to tell. To me, it doesn’t make a difference. I just want our team to play well. We’re going to go win one game at a time and see how far we go.<br /><br /><b>[Ramos fully intends to have his team play the same attacking style at the World Cup that they showed off last November in their regional tournament]</b> The idea for us is always the same. We want to have the ball. We’re going to the World Cup and trying to figure out how we can break down Ukraine. How we can break down Nigeria. How we can beat Qatar. Part of our way of breaking down Ukraine is not going to be by sitting all the way back and hopefully countering. It’s not something I’m comfortable with, it’s not something I like and it’s not something that fits our players. Our players want to attack. Our players want to be aggressive. If it happens that we lose that way, we lose that way, but we’re losing that way going after it<br /><br />I hate losing more than I like winning so I worry about everything all the time. And this group sometimes just goes ‘we got this coach’. It’s that kind of group. I really like that. When I see us walk on the field and I see guys like Alex Mendez and Mark McKenzie and Paxton (Pomykal) and those kind of guys who are just so confident when they walk on the field. It gives you a good feeling as a coach that everything’s going to be okay. This group’s a little bit different like that<br /><br />Most of the public has not seen our team play, and don’t really know our players well. They just sort of know what they hear, and they definitely don’t know the other teams. So it’s really hard to say ‘this is the year we’re going to win (the Under-20 World Cup)’. Our goal doesn’t change. I want to go there and win every game, and then we’ll see where we fall</p>

  <p><b>[Ukraine U20s vs USA U20s. Tab Ramos is confident given his side’s quality that they can do well, but is unsure of their opponents’s quality]</b> I think we have the best team we’ve had.

  <p><b>[USA faces Ecuador with an eye on Under-20 World Cup semifinals]</b> When you have a second round game against France, and you get over such a huge hurdle, it’s not necessarily something that we’re used to. I think the mental aspect over the last three or four days has been the most important with the team. To make sure that they get a little time away, that they get a little time to feel good about what’s happened because that’s important. It’s a big accomplishment, but at the same time to now stay focused on what happens next.<br /><br />Ecuador is a team that attacks very well, that keeps the ball very well, and defends very well. A team like this, that has such a good trajectory in South America, it looks like a complete team. In tha sense, we’re going up against an opponent that we don’t see with any holes<br /><br />We’re going into the game to play our soccer. Our soccer is to win the ball, is to force the play, is to try and win. We’re two teams that are going out to win the game and I think it’s going to be a good game</p>

  <p><b>[Tab <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Ramos</a> has left his role with the U.S. U-20 men’s national team to take over as head coach of the Houston Dynamo]</b> I’m excited to join the Houston Dynamo organization and I’m looking forward to the challenge of leading this group of players. This is a club that has winning in its DNA, a club with a clear vision for the future centered around development and a team-first mentality, and Houston is a city that has tremendous untapped potential as a soccer market, both on and off the field. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I can’t wait to get started</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="chris-richards.html">Chris Richards</a>]</b> Out of all the centerbacks I’ve coached I think he’s the one with the most potential. He has unlimited potential. All the other guys you could tell they’re good. They’re solid. I look at <b>[Matt]</b> Miazga, <b>[Cameron]</b> Carter-Vickers, Erik Palmer-Brown. I just think Richards has a really high ceiling. He also has great charisma, which other guys follow, and he makes a team better because of it</p>
