<p>: 2019 06 12
Liverpool will demand £12 million for Ryan Kent this summer, with the young winger set to turn down the chance to join Leeds United on loan</p>

<p>: 2019 08 06
Liverpool have held talks with Leeds United over a deal that would see Ryan Kent leave Anfield for the Championship club before the closure of the transfer window</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Kent has completed a £7 million move from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to Glasglow Rangers and believes he has finally found home after several years as a footballing nomad]</b> I won’t lie - it has been incredibly tough over the summer, but I am a mentally strong person as it is anyway. It was massively important to find a home. For the past four years now, I have been on the move to different places and last year was the first time I have felt content with the football club I am at. The fans and the people within the team, the coaches, the players, everybody welcomed me with open arms and not just as a player but as a friend. My home is here now<br /><br /><b>[He added on sealing a switch and his ambition for the season ahead]</b> I’m over the moon. I got a feel for what it was to be a Rangers player, I felt like there was unfinished business from last year and I am hoping to put that right. I knew, if I kept myself correct, something good would happen soon and I have been ticking over, keeping myself to myself and this has happened now. After last season, I have evolved even more as a player and I think now if I could add that final end product to my game then it is going to be a good season for me and for the team</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Kent has blasted his former club <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, accusing them of lying to him as he sought a move to Rangers]</b> It was very tough. I had to stay mentally strong. When you are told you can do one thing and then you are lied to and it doesn’t happen, that is quite hard to take. I just had to keep myself fit and train on my own and make sure I keep my fitness levels up and I was waiting for a moment like this to arrive. There’s no bitter taste, the thing that I wanted from the start happened at the end so I am just happy with that. There were probably some slight concerns along the way when I thought this might not happen and I might have to plan for something else but I always had a feeling that it might go to the last day of the window and that’s what happened<br /><br /><b>[The move to Rangers almost never came off, but Kent wouldn’t have remained at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> either way]</b> I was already checked in and sitting in the departure lounge at Manchester airport. That’s when I get a call from my agent and the gaffer <b>[Gerrard]</b> saying ‘don’t go on the flight’. I was getting ready to fly out and sign for <a href="club-brugge.html">Club Brugge</a>. They are in the Champions League and that was one of the main reasons I was heading there. But my heart was set on coming back here <b>[to Rangers]</b>. I think I can achieve everything I want here and take myself to where I want to go</p>
