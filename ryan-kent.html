  <p><b>[Ryan Kent has left Liverpool on a season-long loan and linked up with Bundesliga side Freiburg]</b> Academy graduate Kent signed a new long-term contract with the Reds earlier this month and will continue his development at the Schwarzwald-Stadion for the whole of the current campaign. The 20-year-old winger impressed during a season-long loan with Barnsley last term and made seven appearances during Liverpool’s pre-season friendly programme. He has played one competitive game for the Reds’ first team, against Exeter City in the FA Cup in January 2016</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Kent is tired of changing cubs each year]</b> I want to kick-start my career somewhere now. I am tired of changing clubs each year, I want to settle down somewhere. Liverpool have been good to me, but the enjoyment factor of going back there each year and doing well in pre-season and going back out on loan, it is a repetitive cycle. I was 19 when I went to Germany <b>[at Freiburg]</b>. I started off at Coventry in my first loan spell, my first experience of football in a men’s environment, then stepped up a division with Barnsley. I had a successful loan spell there and thoroughly enjoyed it under Paul Heckingbottom, who was a great help. I then decided to take it to the next level and go to Germany. That didn’t work out so I decided to go to Bristol City. Then Steven Gerrard provided this opportunity for me. I wouldn’t have got the opportunity to play in the Europa League anywhere else. In my eyes, the season has been a success<br /><br />I’ve felt comfortable here, I’ve felt at home here. I think the way I have improved, the coaching staff and the manager have managed to find things in my game that other managers haven’t been able to get out of me. And that’s no discredit to other managers. I’ve been enjoying myself on the pitch and off the pitch and ultimately that gets the best performances out of me. I just want to finish the season as strongly as possible to help the team get as many wins as we can and then obviously I’ll sit down with my representatives and discussion will be had. I have three years left on my contract at Liverpool and there’s not much I can really do. Whether or not I get opportunities to go elsewhere during the summer, I’d want a club with ambition, a club that’s driven on getting silverware. I don’t want to join a team that’s just taking part, that’s not going to get the best out of me</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Kent has completed a £7 million move from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to <a href="glasglow-rangers.html">Glasglow Rangers</a> and believes he has finally found home after several years as a footballing nomad]</b> I won’t lie - it has been incredibly tough over the summer, but I am a mentally strong person as it is anyway. It was massively important to find a home. For the past four years now, I have been on the move to different places and last year was the first time I have felt content with the football club I am at. The fans and the people within the team, the coaches, the players, everybody welcomed me with open arms and not just as a player but as a friend. My home is here now<br /><br /><b>[He added on sealing a switch and his ambition for the season ahead]</b> I’m over the moon. I got a feel for what it was to be a Rangers player, I felt like there was unfinished business from last year and I am hoping to put that right. I knew, if I kept myself correct, something good would happen soon and I have been ticking over, keeping myself to myself and this has happened now. After last season, I have evolved even more as a player and I think now if I could add that final end product to my game then it is going to be a good season for me and for the team</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Kent has blasted his former club <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, accusing them of lying to him as he sought a move to Rangers]</b> It was very tough. I had to stay mentally strong. When you are told you can do one thing and then you are lied to and it doesn’t happen, that is quite hard to take. I just had to keep myself fit and train on my own and make sure I keep my fitness levels up and I was waiting for a moment like this to arrive. There’s no bitter taste, the thing that I wanted from the start happened at the end so I am just happy with that. There were probably some slight concerns along the way when I thought this might not happen and I might have to plan for something else but I always had a feeling that it might go to the last day of the window and that’s what happened<br /><br /><b>[The move to Rangers almost never came off, but Kent wouldn’t have remained at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> either way]</b> I was already checked in and sitting in the departure lounge at Manchester airport. That’s when I get a call from my agent and the gaffer <b>[<a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a>]</b> saying ‘don’t go on the flight’. I was getting ready to fly out and sign for <a href="club-brugge.html">Club Brugge</a>. They are in the Champions League and that was one of the main reasons I was heading there. But my heart was set on coming back here <b>[to Rangers]</b>. I think I can achieve everything I want here and take myself to where I want to go</p>
