  <p><b>[Hakan Calhanoglu has offered not to accept his wages from Bayer Leverkusen for the duration of his four-month ban, stating that he does not want to hurt the club any more than he has]</b> <b>[Calhanoglu]</b> and his current employer Bayer 04 Leverkusen discussed the situation in detail. At the same time, Calhanoglu offered to cancel his full salary including bonuses for the period of the ban.<br /><br />Bayer have nothing to do with the incidents at that time. The club was hit hard by the punishment, not just in a sporting sense, but economically too. This is why it is self-evident to me that I will not harm the club any further and for the time of my exclusion I will waive my salary</p>

  <p><b>[Team-mate Hakan Calhanoglu says <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> star Ibrahimovic has no ego]</b> He is not a new player for Milan. He is a world star and a very experienced player. He is our star. He has contributed to us in every respect - with his experience, game ambition, mentality, helping very well out on the field. Everyone on the outside sees ego. I think there is no ego, he is very approachable, very sympathetic, immediately joking, very enjoyable to spend time with him.</p>
