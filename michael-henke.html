<blockquote>
  <p><b>[<a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Klinsmann</a> took Bayern into modern times - and not with Buddha statues!]</b> He brought a lot of fresh ideas - and I don’t mean the Buddha statues on the roof!. He pushed for the renovation of the club’s buildings, made sure the players had a good diet on the training ground and gave them the chance to work with a psychologist. He wanted the club to form its own TV studio and wanted to build a new analysis department. He led <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> into modern times and the club still benefits from that today. He started a lot of things that would be unthinkable to leave out today<br /><br />Getting international influence is a positive thing but the Chinese approach is ridiculous, the wrong kind of players were bought. I kept telling the directors at my club: ‘If you want to spend so much money on players from abroad, spend it on players who will make the Chinese players better, not just to score goals. Don’t buy strikers from South America, but buy defenders from Scandinavia’. You could tell that so many players from abroad were only there to make money. <a href="demba-ba.html">Demba Ba</a> and <a href="obafemi-martins.html">Obafemi Martins</a> were top professionals from abroad who were very well respected within the team. But there were also two Colombians, who took it as a chance to relax and didn’t want to push their limits anymore. Players like that do not help Chinese football</p>
