  <p><b>[Ryan Sessegnon has drawn comparisons to Real Madrid star Gareth Bale with his performances this season]</b> He can play in two positions, as left-back or at left wing, and that is why he is being compared to Bale. Bale also started in that position before he made the switch to become a more attacking player. From my point of view, Sessegnon can play in different roles but I honestly think he could be more like an offensive back of a big team, like Marcelo. He has no physical resemblance to Marcelo but he is a player that can cover a lot of ground, needs space and can attack that space. I’m using him in the position that I am, but he can perfectly cover two positions<br /><br />He is an incredible player and I personally believe he will end up at a big club. We shall see. Many young players in England have gone very early in their careers to big teams and they don’t find any space. He opted to stay in the Championship and has a lot of experience in the tournament. I think he has done the right thing</p>

  <p><b>[Slavisa Jokanovic - The mastermind behind Fulham’s push for Premier League promotion]</b> I’m a very good observer and I had to check everything around myself. In this short time we tried to push the club in a different direction and tried looking for improvements in different parts of the club. I started to push the board and they supported my ideas to improve the club. All the styles have a final destination - to try and win the games. I want to win the games. We are in a good moment right now and from another side I believe our supporters are enjoying the way this was the team have changed.<br /><br />If you want to play the football on the floor then I need better tools for my work. They <b>[Fulham]</b> interpreted me well, they understand my position and really quick after a few months we started this kind of new improvements. The pitches weren’t in condition to try and find enough quality with what we wanted to do. The last two years we’ve been in perfect condition for our work. I believe we’re seeing the benefits of these improvements but can always do better<br /><br />My life is connected with football. I was a player, now a manager. I try to use all my experience in my job. Because I’m working in England, this is the only reason <b>[why I favour domestic-based players]</b>. If I’m working with Serbia, Israel or Thailand it’s about following the natural way. We are not on the level for bringing best players in the world. We want to bring people in with a similar level whether they are English or foreign. If they are a similar level I prefer domestic players as they know what life is like here and they don’t need so much time for adaption. This competition is really long with many games so you don’t have so much time to prepare and adapt. They must be ready for the challenge<br /><br /><b>[On Ryan Sessegnon]</b> He’s the best young player I’ve managed in my life. I’ve managed important players like <b>[Stevan]</b> Jovetic and <b>[Adem]</b> Ljajic in Partizan Belgrade but this man is really different. To play at this age he’s competing really hard at Championship level and shown fantastic quality. He’s one of the best football ‘projects’ in England and the world. He has huge potential ahead of him and a healthy mentality. I believe he can arrive and become a top player<br /><br />I want to make people around me better and I must be satisfied if they feel improvement in themselves. I try to make improvements for people all around me. Sometimes we need patience, sometimes we need the time to trust each other and this is natural but the intention for both sides is always positive. I try to make them better and they make me better too<br /><br /><b>[Jokanovic is quick to dismiss reports linking him with a move down the road to Chelsea]</b> This is nice for my wife to read the news and ask me about these kind of reports. I try to be focused on my job and try to do a good job and if I’m successful with Fulham in the future then some positive things can happens<br /><br />The Championship is an exciting and quality competition, we know it exists at that level. We are strong and believe we can be successful. We’re going to push until the end</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City vs Fulham]</b> It wouldn’t be a surprise if I said it’s one of the most difficult games for a team who’s recently been promoted. We know how they play football, we know it’s not easy to play at the Etihad. From another side, we interpret it as an exciting game. We’re not giving up before kick-off or anything like that.</p>

  <p><b>[Slavisa Jokanovic has backed 15-year-old Harvey Elliott to have a bright future at Fulham]</b> It’s a great opportunity for him. We believe the future can be bright ahead of him. <b>[But]</b> he must be at school <b>[on Thursday]</b> morning.<br /><br />He had some exams (earlier on Tuesday). He didn’t know <b>[he had a chance of being involved]</b>, I didn’t want to put him in any trouble. I gave him the opportunity to test himself at this level<br /><br />This kid shows the personality, like he says ‘I want to show you I am a very good player; I want to show you’. I say, ‘Okay, if you can show me I give you this opportunity’. A huge gap is ahead of him for improvement and to grow up and to be part of this profession<br /><br />He is definitely a talented kid. At the end he showed some of the quality. We believe in opportunities to test at the senior level.<br /><br /><b>[Jokanovic was eager to quell discussion of his side’s poor defensive form of late]</b> After four years (away) and six games in the Premier League, we’re not thinking of a defensive ‘crisis’. We played well, (and) in the last game against Watford we fixed our defensive problem</p>

  <p><b>[Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic expects Ryan Session will be called up to the England senior squad imminently]</b> Truly, I believe it will be soon that he will be part of the English national team. I never spoke to (Gareth) Southgate (England manager) about him. I spoke to people from the FA, before the World Cup. Some people think he’s a winger and some think he’s a full-back. He can play perfectly in both positions. His numbers are fantastic, as we check how many metres he is running in high intensity. You can be impressed with his physical performance. He is clinical in the opposite box and can score goals easy.<br /><br /><b>[At just 1.78m Sessegnon is small in stature but Jokanovic has no concerns over his ability to play in a defensive role]</b> Somebody says he is not strong enough to be a defender and they are completely wrong. He’s actually seven kilograms bigger than when he started working with us, that’s seven kilograms of muscle on his body. You can detect a big difference. I don’t know a winger or a defender who is stronger who can stop him. He must use this power in a legal way, with the experience he will use the body, use more physical contact. It’s weird we are talking about an 18-year-old player. I try talking about this when you are talking about men. He’s a kid with a body like a man. His limit is high. Close to the goal or far from the goal he can defend perfectly against any player, and still I am talking about an 18-year-old kid. I cannot compare, but I remember myself when I was 18 and I could not play in any position</p>

  <p><b>[Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic says he has no problem with Tim Ream’s recent comments]</b> There are not enough guys who want it, who want to fight for each other, for themselves, for the club<br /><br />I interpreted it and understand because I am talking with Tim Ream. He made some honest analysis about our situation. He’s a great example of a professional player. He’s always professional, always working well, honest, and my interpretation is that he’s not happy with himself and not happy with everything that’s happening around him. The message he wanted to send was ‘Come on, lads, we must do better, we must push harder, on the players’ side, on the staff’s side, for all the sides, for finding improvement’. I’m not interpreting his words as negative. I understand. I don’t have any problem because, as I explained, I interpreted it and understood his words as a positive message</p>

  <p><b>[Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic claims speculation over his job is not affecting his ability to concentrate]</b> I am living in my present, it is a natural question to come from your side when you are not winning games,” he said in the Evening Standard. This question is normal. Really, I am thinking about the next training, what is the best way to help my team and the best way to make another plan for the next game. This is only what I focus around. I cannot think about different things.<br /><br />I have a really good relationship with the owner but it is our professional relationship. He expects from my side, like the supporters expect, victories. At the end it is natural he cannot be satisfied with our situation like I cannot be or my players or supporters. Personally, our relationship is fantastic, but he didn’t bring me here because I am a good lad or something, he brought me here to win games and this is my challenge and my work</p>
