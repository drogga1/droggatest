<blockquote>
  <p>[Birmingham City hotshot Che Adams playing style is reminiscent of former Barcelona and Brazil idol Ronaldo] He reminds me a little bit of the old Ronaldo. He had that raw ability. I wouldn’t say he was electric quick but he was powerful and strong. He would brush people off and he could go through people. And he always had a finish at the end of it.<br /><br />[Baker also recalled Adams’ debut at Ilkeston, where he made an immediate impact] We were 3-1 down and he came on with about half an hour to go and he scored two and set one up. That was when everyone knew he would be starting. After about a month of him being a first-team player, it was not a matter of if he was going to go, it was when. Che played just in behind the striker, in a free role where he was prolific. Every time he scored people were saying it would add an extra few thousand pounds to his transfer fee</p>
