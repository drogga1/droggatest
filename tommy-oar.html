  <p><b>[Brisbane Roar have the depth to compete in both the A-League and the AFC Champions League]</b> We’ve got a lot of depth in the squad and there’s no reason why we can’t win all of the games, really. So there’ll obviously be times where there’ll be a lot of travel and it’ll be tough but I guess that’s when you use the whole squad. We’ve got a lot of quality and there’s no reason we’ll be dropping any points unnecessarily.<br /><br />We’ve kind of been working the whole pre-season and the whole season so far to make sure that when this part of the season came around that we were in good enough condition to handle it<br /><br />I guess there’s been a lot of rumours around but for me, I haven’t heard anything, any substance to those rumours and my focus has been purely on here and performing well this season. There’s no real reason I can see that anything will change for me in the next six months. I really want to win something with the club this year and I think we have the quality to do that</p>

  <p><b>[Tommy Oar’s Champions League dream crushed]</b> Obviously, I’m just devastated. It was a childhood dream. I have never played in the Champions League and I was looking forward to playing on such a big stage. But these setbacks are part of football so I just have to prove the coach wrong by performing in the domestic league. The coach has not told me specifically why he left me out. Since we qualified he made a lot of signings especially in the front third. I have a three-year contract and I will do all I can to help APOEL win the championship and hopefully prove they made the wrong decision to drop me from Europe.</p>

  <p><b>[Placed in Group H alongside reigning champions Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Tottenham Hotspur, APOEL Nicosia have been dealt the toughest draw]</b> A lot of people are writing us off from the group, but I think that situation helps APOEL play without fear. The Champions League is such a big thing for this club. For a team from Cyprus, playing in the Champions League with Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Tottenham is amazing.<br /><br />We knew when we qualified there was never going to be an easy draw, but this one is probably the worst or best we could have been given, depending on which way you look at it. When you play in the Champions League you want to come up against these teams. That’s the beauty of the competition so I think everyone is excited to play these games<br /><br /><b>[Experience]</b> is a strength of the team. If you look at our last qualifier against Slavia Prague, the team knows how to win. Playing at home, it’s often that we’ll be dictating the play and really taking the game to the opposition but we proved in that game that we know how to go physical and do what’s necessary to get a result. Although it was 0-0, we were quite comfortable from the first-leg result <b>[2-0]</b>.<br /><br />Of course, the coach looks at the opposition, but no matter who we’ve played so far my experience of him has been that he wants to win. Obviously when you’re playing these teams, you need to be aware of the traps and be very organised to stop them, but at the same time we have a lot of good attacking players with big pedigree who can also hurt any opposition<br /><br />Cyprus is a bit of a fortress. It’s a difficult place to come. We know the group will be difficult and we’ll have to play extremely well, but in the past teams have found it difficult here. When I got here, the one thing that surprised me about APOEL was the expectations of the fans. Every year they expect you to reach the Champions League. I knew a lot about the club, but it’s so ambitious and with that comes a lot of expectation of a player. It’s great to play for a club that has these ambitions</p>
