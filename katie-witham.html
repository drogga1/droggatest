<blockquote>
  <p>[American sideline reporters add unique element to soccer games] Sideline [reporting] is incredibly difficult because you have to be the ultimate multi-tasker and you have to be able to compartmentalize. I’m always looking at the action and the reaction of both the players on the field and on the bench. I’m also listening to what’s being said both on the field and on the bench. With all of that going on I’m focusing on what John [Strong] is saying, what Alexi [Lalas] is saying on the broadcast. I’m also communicating with my producers and you have to be able to juggle all of that.<br /><br />I’d say the majority of teams have a good comfort level with me. Depending on the situation of the game, they are comfortable with me saying ‘Hey, what’s going on with this right now?’ I can actually get information from the coaching staff in the middle of the game and then relay that to the broadcast<br /><br />It’s unnatural to have a reporter standing right next to your bench or your technical area while you have an important game going on. It’s something that as a reporter and as a female I’ve have to deal with people not necessarily liking you where you are, wanting you to be where you are. You have to be so strong<br /><br />[If] you don’t hear me do a report on it, it’s because I’ve gotten something and I pass it to the producers to pass to the guys in the booth<br /><br />You get moments throughout the game to have a voice and when you get that moment, make sure it’s important, make sure it adds to the broadcast, and make sure you say what you need to say in the most concise manner</p>
