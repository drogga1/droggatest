  <p><b>[Gavin Hoyte has revealed that he misses his older brother <a href="justin-hoyte.html">Justin Hoyte</a>, now that he has moved on to the Riverside Stadium]</b> When Justin went it was a little bit strange at first still is really… I gave him a bit of stick when he scored an own goal on his Middlesbrough debut but they won so that was the main thing. It was great for me to be with the first-team players at the training camp and work with the manager… it helped me as a player. The first-team players worked with me a lot and talked to me, it was good experience. <a href="william-gallas.html">William Gallas</a> and <a href="kolo-toure.html">Kolo Toure</a> told me that the biggest thing for me is talking on the pitch, and being confident on the ball, keep playing your game. So that’s what I need to do. Keep playing my football, keep playing in the Reserves and hopefully get to play in the Carling Cup team. You have to be excited to play against someone like him… He’s a great player and he has played in a lot of big games. He gave us a good test. He is strong so you have to change your game. You can’t get in a physical battle with him because he will just knock you off the ball easily. You have to be intelligent at the back and work your way around that. He is brilliant in the air so you have to work off his touch and work around him</p>
