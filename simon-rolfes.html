  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen sporting director Rolfes confident <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> will be back in May]</b> The most important thing was we got good feedback from politicians for our concepts for games without spectators. In the next week we will see which decisions are there. I don’t know exactly when but we hope we play in May, the middle or the end of May, we don’t know<br /><br />In the morning when they wake up, they <b>[players]</b> get five questions they have to answer and that goes to our pandemic officer and our head of medicine. So that’s the first check at home. Then we try to separate them as much as possible. We use different locker rooms at the stadium to try to keep the risk at a minimum</p>

  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen sporting director Simon Rolfes says <a href="kai-havertz.html">Kai Havertz</a>’s future is not decided]</b> We don’t know yet what will happen to Kai. We know that all the great clubs from Germany and Europe are after him and that he has the ability to play anywhere. He is a fantastic player and for many years Bayern have always been behind the young German talents, but we have to wait, there are many factors that influence. His future is not decided at all yet. Kai has a contract until 2022 and we are calm. I can only say that I love him and that I like to see him play. I’d like to see him as long as possible with the Bayer Leverkusen shirt. I have no preferences when it comes to other teams. He will be one of the great dominators of the game in the next 10 years<br /><br /><b>[Rolfes added on the qualities which have made <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> such a sought-after talent in recent seasons]</b> He is a very complete player and has also shown that he is a good finisher with his head and both feet. He is fast enough to play as a striker, but he is also a great No. 10, with creativity and timing. He can also play on the wing, not as a winger, but cutting inside. And yes, being able to score goals pays very well</p>

  <p><b>[Leverkusen’s Florian Wirtz becomes <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>’s youngest ever scorer in Bayern defeat]</b> I have known the player since he was 14. The possibility arose surprisingly because his contract was expiring, and so we tried. I knew that many clubs were interested and so we thought that before he went anywhere else, let’s try to get him to come here and stay close to home</p>
