  <p><b>[John Stones can be a good captain for Manchester City]</b> Whether John Stones becomes the captain in the long-term or not he’s certainly becoming a leader in his own way. He had a tough first season when he signed because he made mistakes but he was always brave enough to stand up to it then come back out and try the same things. He’s gradually getting the mistakes out of his game and is improving all of the time and he’s someone who is happy to accept responsibility. He’d be a good captain for City.<br /><br /><b>[on the Stones-Laporte understanding at centre-half]</b> They are very different to when you go back over the years to the centre-back pairings that United had. <b>[Nemanja]</b> Vidic and <b>[Jaap]</b> Stam, Steve Bruce and <b>[Gary]</b> Pallister even. They were tough tacklers whereas the two City have - who are the only two centre-backs that Pep has bought - are completely within his profile of ball-playing defenders. They don’t seem to be in positions to need last-ditch tackles. Instead they read the game really well and obviously with the team they have ahead of them - and Fernandinho in particular - they are not under so much pressure. This brings its own issue though because they need to concentrate all the time and remain switched on. The understanding that they’ve got could make this a long-standing partnership and certainly the most successful in Premier League history</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City are benefitting from being run by footballing people]</b> When you look at how Manchester City are run all of the decisions, all the way up, are made by footballing people; people who understand the game and have been involved in football for a long time and know all about the coaches needs and the player’s needs. Whereas at United it is businessmen all the way up who are qualified in other areas but with no understanding of actual football. This is why they fail in terms of transfer negotiations and the structure of the club. They don’t understand that it’s not just about the first team and the here and now. It’s about planning for the future and for all the money Manchester United have spent you don’t look at them and think ‘well in five years’ time they’ll be great because they have all these young players’. They are going to have to buy again and again and again.</p>

  <p><b>[Ben Chilwell and Aaron Wan-Bissaka would be unable to resist a summer move to Manchester City]</b> Chilwell would be a positive move for the club, and he’d help keep up the quota of English players at the club. He looks like a talented footballer. However, anyone that comes in as a left-back has to realise they won’t be an understudy, and due to injury problems they will be playing regularly at Man City. It’s a great chance for him to establish himself at one of the biggest clubs in Europe. Wan-Bissaka looked a very good player when he played the Etihad, he’s got great pace and gets up and down the pitch. He’s not as great on the ball as <b>[Kyle]</b> Walker, but defensively he’s excellent and very hard to beat. Playing with Kyle Walker will help him develop at such a young age, much like Chilwell it’s an opportunity they can’t turn down. With the chance to play Champions League football and learn under Pep Guardiola.<br /><br />Declan Rice is a very, very talented player and he’s doing well for West Ham. I’m sure Man City will be looking at him. The opportunity for him to go to a big club like Man City, and the fact he’s now an English player will be a factor. They’d do well in signing him</p>

  <p><b>[Raheem Sterling’s form and contributions will ensure he will always be in Pep Guardiola’s starting line-up]</b> He’s an outstanding professional and Pep Guardiola understands he’s a vital part of the team. Sane and Mahrez might interchange but Sterling will always be on the team sheet. His assists and goal-rate support the manager’s decision to make him an integral part of the team. Sterling’s attitude is brilliant, he’s got amazing speed and technical ability. But this season he’s improved his finishing and his overall team play. When you’re signed for £49 million, you might think you’ve made it. But he’s improving year on year and has taken on board what the coaches have said to him.<br /><br />Mahrez is in a transitional period at the club, much like Bernardo Silva when he joined the club from Monaco, coming with a big reputation. It takes time to adapt to the demands of playing under Guardiola, but when he gets the opportunities he performs. He’ll be hoping to make a similar impact to Sterling, and for Mahrez there is no better place to learn, develop and win trophies. Mahrez will still be at the club next year, and will be an important player in the future. But he will need to come back bigger and stronger next season.<br /><br />Champions League success is the goal for Man City, they won the Premier League and the Carabao Cup last season. The first-leg result against Schalke showed they’ve now got the resilience to win away games in Europe in difficult situations. Sheikh Mansour wanted to make a statement and didn’t want to hang around. They’re aware winning the Champions League takes a lot longer to than winning domestic trophies. They invested in the club and changed the way people thought of Man City. Man City have now become a superpower in England and the Premier League, but they will want to achieve the Champions League. They look ready, and whether it’s this year or next year they’ll win the Champions League. They’ve got a good young squad and a real hunger to achieve, along with a manager with the experience of winning the Champions League. Sergio Aguero, Fernandinho and David Silva are true professionals, but will want to win the Champions League before they think about leaving the club. Aguero seems to be getting better and better with age. It’s important that they keep these players to help the younger players, especially with the likes of Gabriel Jesus having a tough time adapting</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham midfielder Declan Rice billed as potential Fernandinho successor]</b> I could understand if he <b>[Gundogan]</b> did move on and wanted to go somewhere else to be the main man in the team because he’s a top player but in that squad, he’s just one of many. It would be great for Man City to keep him but they have got other options. He’s done that role well when he’s filled in but I think his mentality is that he wants to get forward and wants to be involved in the attacking play in the game. I think he’s someone that can step into that position for a short period but I don’t think City would see him as the man to fill Fernandinho’s shoes for the long term. I think Declan Rice at West Ham has been very good, he’s obviously progressed and has been named in the latest England squad. He’s a player I’m sure Man City are keeping their eye on, like a few other teams will be<br /><br />It’s very tough because the way Phil Foden plays football is perfect for Man City. He likes playing short passes and to get on the ball as much as possible and I don’t know where he could go <b>[on loan]</b> and play a similar sort of way that suits him. He’d obviously love to be getting a bit more time on the pitch but he’s getting told how good he is by City, I know Pep Guardiola loves him, so I can’t see a better place for him. As much as it would be great for him to play more, I just think what he’s learning from those players in training and the few minutes he does get in games will benefit him</p>

  <p><b>[Former City defender Dunne told of Sterling’s claims to the PFA award]</b> As fans and supporters of football you want to see players going forward, you want to see people that entertain you, score goals and certainly Sterling has done that. If you’re looking at attacking players I don’t think anyone has been better than Sterling with what he brings to the team with his speed and he’s using his intelligence to get into the right positions. From my own point of view as a defender and appreciating what Van Dijk has done for Liverpool, changing their team around in the last 18 months, I think he’s been a big asset to them and such an important player. In terms of the effect on a team Van Dijk has had that more than most but for entertainment, skill, technique and getting people off their seats, Sterling is ahead of him<br /><br />What I love about him is that he keeps progressing and just gets better and better. Sometimes players reach a level and that’s it but you just don’t see the end with him. It helps to play in a team like Man City with the goals and assists he’s getting, he’s certainly a player if not this season then in future that will be challenging for Player of the Year award and maybe even further on a European and world stage.</p>

  <p><b>[FA Cup win can help Man City match Man Utd’s 20 league titles]</b> I think any team that retains the Premier League is instantly up there, because it is such a difficult trophy to hold onto. But to be able to do that and clean up domestically adds another level to it. I think that’s the aim, I think they want to dominate for the next four or five, maybe 10 years, try to win as many as they can and make sure that this isn’t a short-term thing for Man City. They want to be a historically big club like Man United, like Liverpool, and to do that it takes time. But I think over the next period, as long as Guardiola is there, they will be looking to win every trophy they can domestically to get that honours list up higher and get them competing maybe more towards 20 Premier League titles<br /><br />With the players coming back early from the World Cup last August because they wanted to get their hands on a medal for the Community Shield, you can see they want to win every tournament. I don’t think they prioritise anything, they just want to win the next game all the time, and if they can get their hands on the FA Cup they’ll be more than delighted. I think with the FA Cup it just comes from that history and honour and pride, for the fans as much as anything it’s a huge thing to win the FA Cup. They’ve not won it enough, I suppose, for the amount of quality that they’ve had over the last 10 years. So to get that back on board it would be brilliant and even if that was it and they finished the season with a domestic treble that would be a very, very successful season for them<br /><br />With the state of the squad at the moment they just look like they’re ready. I think everybody is fit, there’s no suspensions, they’re all just playing well and they look like this year could be the year for them, but if you take your eye off the ball in that competition or make one mistake it can cost you dearly. It’s the one trophy that you couldn’t say they’re favourites for because there are other teams and if you do make those errors they will exploit them<br /><br />But he’s done it now over a period of time at two of the biggest clubs in world football and he’s in the process of turning Man City into one of those teams as well</p>

When you look at the fixtures coming up in the next couple of weeks you can see why he <b>[Guardiola]</b> says it is mission impossible. There’s five tough games in 15 days. If they come through with full points and all wins it would be getting closer and closer. At the moment it still looks mission impossible and it is a dream. But it is realistic because it’s Man City and we know what they can do, but it’s going to be so difficult to win all four</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester City defender Richard Dunne believes only complacency can derail the club’s title bid]</b> Complacency is the only thing that can stop Manchester City from becoming Premier League champions again this season. They could get overconfident and feel they have the job done before it is done. But I can’t see that happening. I can’t see the three other teams <b>[Burnley, Leicester and Brighton]</b> preventing them from scoring.<br /><br />Liverpool will see out the season in hope, more than anything else, while City look confident and as soon as they came away from Old Trafford with a win on Wednesday, they were in control. They seem to be over the disappointment of the Champions League, they can focus on the league title now and they can put everything they have into winning the league again. In fact the loss in the Champions League is driving City on to go for the treble. This run that City are on is incredible, if they do get 14 wins in a row that will be an incredible achievement. The midweek derby means that City and Liverpool have played the same number of games so it’s a lot clearer what City have to do, with no more games in hand to worry about</p>

  <p><b>[It’s impossible to replace Vinny]</b> You could see that personality that he had. He wanted to improve, he wanted the team to improve. I think he was only 19 or 20 when he came but he had the personality where he would ask if we could have a team meeting because he wanted to understand how can we do better. It just wasn’t what we were used to. He wanted to help the club get better, that was the thing. Even as experienced players you can’t turn around and say, ‘Oh I can’t be arsed today, I want to go home,’ but when someone has that enthusiasm to try to improve not just himself but all of us, you take notice of it</p>

  <p><b>[Richard Dunne has revealed how an insult about the nation from French midfielder <a href="claude-makelele.html">Claude Makelele</a> to Keith Andrews on the Croke Park pitch fired up the team ahead of the famous return leg in Paris]</b> There wasn’t a lot in the first game and we certainly didn’t play well. So you start to think that if we can play better, we have a chance.<br /><br />Sometimes you think that they’re France and you’re frightened by the name more than anything. But they weren’t as good on the pitch as they were on paper at the time<br /><br />At the end of the game, there was a scuffle. <a href="claude-makelele.html">Claude Makelele</a> said something to Keith Andrews, I think it was more derogatory about the country and that started to wind people up.<br /><br />That gave us enough reason to want to go and do something, it wound us up a bit. We didn’t feel after the match that it was over, we felt that we had another chance without any limitations on ourselves. .<br /><br />Because we’d lost in Dublin, everyone thought we’d go to Paris and lose three or four so for us it was a release of pressure. It didn’t matter if we lost three or four nil so we might as well go and score.<br /><br />There was a freedom to go and express ourselves and play without fear. You’re already out (if you don’t score) so you can go and affect the match. That’s what helped us<br /><br /><b>[Dunne said there was no rebellion and that it was simply a commonsense approach for a game the team had to win]</b> We all had the utmost respect for <a href="giovanni-trapattoni.html">Trapattoni</a>. When you’re losing there isn’t a lot the manager can tell you. He can’t say ‘I want you to sit back and do what we did in Dublin’. We need the complete opposite.<br /><br />I can’t specifically remember <a href="giovanni-trapattoni.html">Trapattoni</a> telling us this is what he wanted us to do or this is what I expect. I think as a group of players, we decided we weren’t going to take a backwards step in the match.<br /><br />There’s a difference between saying it and actually carrying it out. If you try and do it to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, they’re technically stronger than a lot of teams so they can deal with it.<br /><br />The energy and effort we put into it was strong. I don’t know in terms of a revolution that we all thought we were clever and all came up with a new tactic. We all just said let’s play higher up the field, circumstances need this, we can’t sit back</p>

  <p><b>[Richard Dunne says Losing <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> to injury is an obvious blow for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> City will plod on and I can see them going on a run of seven or eight wins in a row, they will find their form. They have had their setbacks, they’ve not had an ideal start to the season but they are still in there. I can see them putting all their focus on <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> for the next couple of months and then we’ll see what City are made of. They did it last season, winning 14 games in a row after Christmas, this is when they warm up in the season, so <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> need to be aware of that and react to it. They are missing defensive players but the injury to <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> is a blow. As good as <a href="gabriel-jesus.html">Gabriel Jesus</a> is, he doesn’t have the same sort of aura about him in the team that <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> does<br /><br />City are conceding goals as well and not winning games, draws with Atalanta and Shakhtar in the Champions League don’t look great. I feel as a club they felt the job in the Champions League was done, but it wasn’t quite done, City are just about getting over the line in Europe and not exerting themselves too much. You can’t switch off and then expect to switch back on again, football doesn’t work like that at the top level. You have to keep that tempo up all the time, you can’t pick and choose the games you decide to play in.<br /><br />The Champions League, for me, looks like a distraction for City. The fans don’t seem that up for it and overall they don’t seem to have that excitement for the group stages. They only get interested as a club in the knockout stage, and you can get caught out by that. City probably went into that game with Shakhtar thinking, ‘we have beaten them three times in the last four years so we’ll beat them again’, but if you are not at 100 per cent, any team is capable of causing you problems. City, at least, have made the last 16</p>

  <p><b>[Richard Dunne says <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> lost <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title when opting not to sign another centre-half over the summ]</b> If, as expected, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> do end up losing their league title, they will really have lost it last summer in the transfer market when <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> decided not to sign a centre-back.

They seemed to think they would be OK, but they didn’t take into account that injury to <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Aymeric Laporte</a> or the form of Nicolas Otamendi. So they were wrong to not sign a defender in the summer. They did sign <a href="rodri.html">Rodri</a> to give <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a> the chance to go and play in defence if he was needed, but they miss him in central midfield. More than anything else, that’s their biggest problem. Otamendi and <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a> have never been rock solid but when they had <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a> in front of them, he stopped a lot of the threats before they got through and that Fernandinho-type player is not there as <a href="rodri.html">Rodri</a> is not in the same vein, that’s where they are losing the battle at the moment. City either need to sign a centre-back or get <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Laporte</a> back, because for every two good games they have they will then have a slip-up. They just have that hint of instability about them, which they didn’t have last season, and other teams in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> can sense it<br /><br />For all their attacking prowess, and it is very good, City have failed over the last couple of years because you always think they’re not strong enough at the back.

That’s what he’ll want to remain. He wants to go and win trophies and if City are in a situation where they can no longer compete, because they’re selling players and can’t attract the top players because there’s no Champions League football, it will be difficult.<br /><br />I think the club has been organised really well - the whole club, not just the first team. They have a structure in place where they will survive and try and rebuild again. But to lose someone like <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> would be a huge blow. He’s what they’ve worked towards, to try and get him to come in as manager, and he’s been successful. You listen to players talk about why they sign for teams and Pep is a huge attraction for any player<br /><br />You don’t know what the owners are thinking and what their next move will be. All the players are going: ‘Are you staying?’, ‘I don’t know, someone in the Champions League wants to sign me, so maybe if this doesn’t work out … ‘. It might be similar to when the owners came in and took over at City. All the players in the dressing room are talking about it and wondering what’s going to happen next. Am I secure? Are they going to move me on? There is an uncertainty that grows within the club. They’ll appeal and the court case will probably go on for a while. The players will be thinking: ‘What’s going on this summer? Are we in the Champions League or do I move on?’. Also, the talk may be that <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is going to act and deduct points. It all becomes a bit messy and, as much as the players concentrate on the pitch and all that stuff, the talk all around them will all be about this situation<br /><br />You look at what’s happened with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> this year - they’ve had the transfer ban and they’ve been able to blood lots of young players. City have that number of talented players coming through in the background, their academy is so highly thought of. They just need players to get to the first team and this may be the opportunity for them. You can’t say the ban will benefit the club but in every dark cloud there is a silver lining somewhere and maybe for City that’s it. If the likes of <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> get to play on a more regular basis, if <a href="eric-garcia.html">Eric Garcia</a> comes through and other young players make a name for themselves … in the long run, isn’t that what <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> wanted?</p>
