  <p><b>[Richard Dunne has revealed how an insult about the nation from French midfielder <a href="claude-makelele.html">Claude Makelele</a> to Keith Andrews on the Croke Park pitch fired up the team ahead of the famous return leg in Paris]</b> There wasn’t a lot in the first game and we certainly didn’t play well. So you start to think that if we can play better, we have a chance.<br /><br />Sometimes you think that they’re France and you’re frightened by the name more than anything. But they weren’t as good on the pitch as they were on paper at the time<br /><br />At the end of the game, there was a scuffle. <a href="claude-makelele.html">Claude Makelele</a> said something to Keith Andrews, I think it was more derogatory about the country and that started to wind people up.<br /><br />That gave us enough reason to want to go and do something, it wound us up a bit. We didn’t feel after the match that it was over, we felt that we had another chance without any limitations on ourselves. .<br /><br />Because we’d lost in Dublin, everyone thought we’d go to Paris and lose three or four so for us it was a release of pressure. It didn’t matter if we lost three or four nil so we might as well go and score.<br /><br />There was a freedom to go and express ourselves and play without fear. You’re already out (if you don’t score) so you can go and affect the match. That’s what helped us<br /><br /><b>[Dunne said there was no rebellion and that it was simply a commonsense approach for a game the team had to win]</b> We all had the utmost respect for <a href="giovanni-trapattoni.html">Trapattoni</a>. When you’re losing there isn’t a lot the manager can tell you. He can’t say ‘I want you to sit back and do what we did in Dublin’. We need the complete opposite.<br /><br />I can’t specifically remember <a href="giovanni-trapattoni.html">Trapattoni</a> telling us this is what he wanted us to do or this is what I expect. I think as a group of players, we decided we weren’t going to take a backwards step in the match.<br /><br />There’s a difference between saying it and actually carrying it out. If you try and do it to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, they’re technically stronger than a lot of teams so they can deal with it.<br /><br />The energy and effort we put into it was strong. I don’t know in terms of a revolution that we all thought we were clever and all came up with a new tactic. We all just said let’s play higher up the field, circumstances need this, we can’t sit back</p>

  <p><b>[Richard Dunne says Losing <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> to injury is an obvious blow for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> City will plod on and I can see them going on a run of seven or eight wins in a row, they will find their form. They have had their setbacks, they’ve not had an ideal start to the season but they are still in there. I can see them putting all their focus on <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> for the next couple of months and then we’ll see what City are made of. They did it last season, winning 14 games in a row after Christmas, this is when they warm up in the season, so <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> need to be aware of that and react to it. They are missing defensive players but the injury to <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> is a blow. As good as <a href="gabriel-jesus.html">Gabriel Jesus</a> is, he doesn’t have the same sort of aura about him in the team that <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> does<br /><br />City are conceding goals as well and not winning games, draws with Atalanta and Shakhtar in the Champions League don’t look great. I feel as a club they felt the job in the Champions League was done, but it wasn’t quite done, City are just about getting over the line in Europe and not exerting themselves too much. You can’t switch off and then expect to switch back on again, football doesn’t work like that at the top level. You have to keep that tempo up all the time, you can’t pick and choose the games you decide to play in.<br /><br />The Champions League, for me, looks like a distraction for City. The fans don’t seem that up for it and overall they don’t seem to have that excitement for the group stages. They only get interested as a club in the knockout stage, and you can get caught out by that. City probably went into that game with Shakhtar thinking, ‘we have beaten them three times in the last four years so we’ll beat them again’, but if you are not at 100 per cent, any team is capable of causing you problems. City, at least, have made the last 16</p>

  <p><b>[Richard Dunne says <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> lost <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title when opting not to sign another centre-half over the summ]</b> If, as expected, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> do end up losing their league title, they will really have lost it last summer in the transfer market when <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> decided not to sign a centre-back. You need to plan for injuries and suspensions and City didn’t do that. They seemed to think they would be OK, but they didn’t take into account that injury to <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Aymeric Laporte</a> or the form of Nicolas Otamendi. So they were wrong to not sign a defender in the summer. They did sign <a href="rodri.html">Rodri</a> to give <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a> the chance to go and play in defence if he was needed, but they miss him in central midfield. More than anything else, that’s their biggest problem. Otamendi and <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a> have never been rock solid but when they had <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a> in front of them, he stopped a lot of the threats before they got through and that Fernandinho-type player is not there as <a href="rodri.html">Rodri</a> is not in the same vein, that’s where they are losing the battle at the moment. City either need to sign a centre-back or get <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Laporte</a> back, because for every two good games they have they will then have a slip-up. They just have that hint of instability about them, which they didn’t have last season, and other teams in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> can sense it<br /><br />For all their attacking prowess, and it is very good, City have failed over the last couple of years because you always think they’re not strong enough at the back. And now they need two centre-backs. One, <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Laporte</a>, is out with an injury and the other two don’t seem capable of putting together a string of performances to allow them keep clean sheets. I can’t see <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> going out to buy one, but they need someone who could come in right now and help out. Jonny Evans has been brilliant for <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, he knows the league and I wouldn’t be surprised if they did earmark him to come in for a year or 18 months. They will have to spend over £100 million to get a top-class centre-back, someone like Evans could be good in the medium term but he is doing well at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, they are happy with him and he’s happy there, so the Foxes would be entitled to ask for a very big fee. <a href="toby-alderweireld.html">Toby Alderweireld</a> is out of contract with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> at the end of the season, but would City really hand him a five-year deal?</p>

  <p><b>[Richard Dunne says Ambitious <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> could leave <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> due to Champions League ban]</b> Wherever he’s gone, he’s always been there to be a winner. That’s what he’ll want to remain. He wants to go and win trophies and if City are in a situation where they can no longer compete, because they’re selling players and can’t attract the top players because there’s no Champions League football, it will be difficult.<br /><br />I think the club has been organised really well - the whole club, not just the first team. They have a structure in place where they will survive and try and rebuild again. But to lose someone like <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> would be a huge blow. He’s what they’ve worked towards, to try and get him to come in as manager, and he’s been successful. You listen to players talk about why they sign for teams and Pep is a huge attraction for any player<br /><br />You don’t know what the owners are thinking and what their next move will be. All the players are going: ‘Are you staying?’, ‘I don’t know, someone in the Champions League wants to sign me, so maybe if this doesn’t work out … ‘. It might be similar to when the owners came in and took over at City. All the players in the dressing room are talking about it and wondering what’s going to happen next. Am I secure? Are they going to move me on? There is an uncertainty that grows within the club. They’ll appeal and the court case will probably go on for a while. The players will be thinking: ‘What’s going on this summer? Are we in the Champions League or do I move on?’. Also, the talk may be that <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is going to act and deduct points. It all becomes a bit messy and, as much as the players concentrate on the pitch and all that stuff, the talk all around them will all be about this situation<br /><br />You look at what’s happened with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> this year - they’ve had the transfer ban and they’ve been able to blood lots of young players. City have that number of talented players coming through in the background, their academy is so highly thought of. They just need players to get to the first team and this may be the opportunity for them. You can’t say the ban will benefit the club but in every dark cloud there is a silver lining somewhere and maybe for City that’s it. If the likes of <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> get to play on a more regular basis, if <a href="eric-garcia.html">Eric Garcia</a> comes through and other young players make a name for themselves … in the long run, isn’t that what <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> wanted?</p>
