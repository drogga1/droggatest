  <p><b>[Peter Beardsley on Thierry Henry]</b> I tell my kids in the Academy at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> to watch <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a>. He plays with such a swagger, not an arrogance, and that is a great quality. He always looks so comfortable. You talk about cars going from 0 to 60 in a matter of seconds, and he is like that. He just explodes. I could sit there for hours and watch him</p>
