  <p><b>[Cristian Pavon has opened the door to a possible €37 million move to Arsenal]</b> For the moment, we have not received any proposal, formally or informally. For now, they are all rumours, as always, just comments in the corridors. But I know very well what I said to Cristian when we renewed his contract. I am not going to cut off his career, but we made him a nice contract so that he would be comfortable. We put a release clause in the contract just in case clubs like this appear. It’s then the player who has the last word. He looks fine to me, very focused on 2018 with Boca Juniors. We always help him with his future, but I trust Pavon will be with us for 2018.</p>

  <p><b>[Barros Schelotto to part ways with Boca after Copa Libertadores defeat to River]</b> The club had to make a decision and we understood that the best for Boca was to start the year with a change, that we had to look for a new coaching staff. In no way am I here to fire him, I have no doubt that this is a ‘see you soon’</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="boca-juniors.html">Boca Juniors</a> president Daniel Angelici believes a deal for former Roma icon <a href="daniele-de-rossi.html">Daniele de Rossi</a> is all but sealed]</b> The negotiations for <a href="daniele-de-rossi.html">De Rossi</a> are well under way. In the coming days, he will fly to Buenos Aires. It is 99 per cent that Daniele will be a Boca player. To have a world champion say he wants to finish his career here fills me with pride. It is good for Argentine football to have a player like this</p>

He divided the dressing room and the board<br /><br /><b>[Angelici also remarkably questioned Roman’s very allegiance to Boca]</b> He cannot say Angelici supports Huracan or Gribaudo supports Independiente; there are no photos or evidence of that. But there is to show he is a Tigre fan</p>
