  <p><b>[Salomon Rondon compares <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> with basketball great Michael Jordan]</b> They are different sports, but <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> is able to win a game by himself at any time, exactly how Michael Jordan used to do it. Jordan would get the ball and score in the last second of a game. Therefore, I compare him to Messi</p>

West Brom striker Salomon Rondon is now the highest scorer in Venezuelan history after he shocked the United States with two early goals on Sunday</p>

  <p><b>[Salomon Rondon has completed a move to Chinese Super League side <a href="dalian-yifang.html">Dalian Yifang</a>, with the former <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> loanee being reunited with <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafa Benitez</a> after leaving West Brom]</b> Salomon Rondon has today joined Chinese Super League side <a href="dalian-yifang.html">Dalian Yifang</a> for an undisclosed fee. The Venezuela international will be teaming up with <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafa Benitez</a>, who led <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a> during his loan spell at St James’s Park last season. Rondon arrived at The Hawthorns in the summer of 2015 and made 120 appearances for the Baggies, scoring 28 goals. The club wishes Salomon and his family all the very best in the future</p>

  <p><b>[Venezuela striker Salomon Rondon has admitted that he was disappointed to leave <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a> this summer and had hoped to stay there permanently]</b> It was a beautiful year for me last season. I loved it because the supporters were behind me all the time. I enjoyed playing with the number  9 shirt, I scored goals and the atmosphere at <a href="newcastle-united.html">St James’ Park</a> was amazing. Always, I will remember that season. Was I disappointed to leave? Yes, because I was waiting for something. I was waiting for Rafa. When I went to the Copa America, I thought Rafa would sign for <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. But he didn’t and when Rafa said he was going, my possibility to stay at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> went down straight away. Rafa brought me to <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> and he fought with the owners to bring me there. So when Rafa said goodbye, I felt I would have to say goodbye as well. I understood in that moment I would not sign for Newcastle<br /><br /><b>[Rondon also hinted that the reason for <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>’s hesitance to sign him permanently had something to with his age - the forward turns 30 later this year]</b> Maybe a few years ago, <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> would have given me a contract. But it looks like the owner’s rule is that, ‘Because he’s 29, when I sell I don’t get more money from what I’ve invested in him’. I get that because, for the owner, it is a business. But I showed to all of them that even though I am 29, I am still scoring goals, I still assist my team-mates, I am still working really hard, I still feel like a young guy. I have had 12 years in Europe and no bad injuries, I try to eat properly, and I am professional. When you hear the comments about my age, those people don’t know about football</p>

  <p><b>[Salomon Rondon has revealed how close he came to completing a move to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> during the January transfer window]</b> It was all out of my hands. It means a lot to be linked with <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> because they have a great history and it must mean they think I did well in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. They started to talk to my agent and I was just waiting by my phone for a decision, maybe for the lawyers, but then I saw <a href="odion-ighalo.html">Ighalo</a> had signed. It didn’t get to the stage where an offer was made or anything like that, but I think it was really close<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he was left angry or frustrated over the failed transfer to United]</b> No, no - it’s just football. It’s decisions again and they obviously decided <a href="odion-ighalo.html">Ighalo</a> was the best decision for them. I’ve played against him and I’m pleased for him. All I can do is keep working. I’m concentrating on Dalian, on working and learning and listening to the manager. After that, we will have to wait and see. You just never know in this game</p>
