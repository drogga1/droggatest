  <p><b>[Andre Silva admits it is a dream to play alongside Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> Playing next to him is a dream. He is the best in the world. I can say that makes things easier. Things come out more natural, sometimes passes that could be more difficult he facilitates. We understand each other very well. It’s good to play alongside him. I occupy spaces. In the movements, we open spaces for each other.<br /><br />I consider Portugal stronger than Morocco, but the game will not be easy. Morocco has merit. There are no favourites and I do not think we are favourites for the World Cup. Everybody knows Morocco, there are a lot of players that were born in Europe, I think 17, and the game with Iran could have been different. Already we know they did not concede goals in qualifying and in the opening game they were only defeated by an own goal in the final moments. We have to trust in ourselves. We will find a way. If we show all our collective and individual quality will go well</p>

  <p><b>[AC Milan forward Andre Silva insists he would rather be playing in Serie A]</b> I am working to become the best striker in the World. I didn’t want to leave AC Milan, I wanted to play. I wanted to have opportunities and be the Andre that I always was. But I definitely needed more game time. I had many options but in the end, I said yes to Sevilla. Now I am here and I feel I’ve done the best possible choice.<br /><br /><b>[On Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> Training and playing with him is different. I can say that he is someone who transmits even more motivation to his team-mates, he makes me want more. Since I trained and played with him, I felt there was a lot more room to grow</p>

  <p><b>[Andre Silva says he has a ‘clear conscience’ amid claims by Sevilla coach Joaquin Caparros that he has exaggerated his injury problems]</b> I’m not simulating an injury, I have been receiving treatment. I have a clear conscience. I have wanted to play and the problem for me is that as time has passed the discomfort has worsened. Maybe this has not been handled in the best way and I should have taken a break in December to sort it, but Sevilla needed me and I wanted to play. My concept of professionalism requires extreme dedication to the club, in this case to Sevilla. Those who know me know that I always want to be an asset.<br /><br /><b>[Portugal face Switzerland in the Nations League semi-final on June 5]</b> I’m focused on the treatment, I know the squad is just around the corner. All injuries are recoverable from. If you recover why should not I go to the national team?</p>
