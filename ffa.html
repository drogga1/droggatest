  <p><b>[A-League clubs warn against FFA reform delay]</b> The Australian Professional Football Clubs Association <b>[APFCA]</b> has yet to have any meaningful engagement with FFA on the constitutional and governance reform the FFA committed in September 2016 to complete by March 2017. We would find it unacceptable if the visit by the FFA chairman Steven Lowy and FFA CEO David Gallop to the FIFA president either delays the long-overdue reform of the FFA General Assembly, or creates a circumvention of the committed process of engagement with stakeholders of the Australian game. It is the APFCA’s position that the professional game can no longer be expected to be the major financial provider to Football Federation Australia without fair democratic representation in the FFA General Assembly.</p>

  <p><b>[Football Federation Australia has denied players suffered heat stroke during Adelaide United’s 2-2 draw with Wellington Phoenix]</b> The FFA Heat Policy clearly states that drinks breaks should be implemented if the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature <b>[WBGT]</b> reaches 26 degrees and there should be consideration of delays and postponement if the WBGT reaches 28. The FFA Heat Policy offers greater consideration to players welfare than the FIFA policy and that of most other sports around the world. In line with FFA’s Heat Policy both clubs were informed throughout the week of the forecast WBGT for Adelaide on Sunday to ensure the players were professionally prepared.<br /><br />The WBGT reading before the match on Sunday in Adelaide was 25.6. Despite this, Head of A-League Greg O’Rourke, who was at the match, consulted both team doctors and it was agreed to insert drinks breaks into the match as a further sign of FFA’s interest in player welfare. This was all agreed and acknowledged by both teams. FFA has since been informed by medical staff at the match that no players suffered heat stroke during the match.</p>

  <p><b>[In their statement on Friday, the FFA stressed that Heather Reid’s comments at the time of <a href="alen-stajcic.html">Stajcic</a>’s sacking didn’t impact their decision to part ways with the coach]</b> FFA by this statement wishes to make clear that <a href="alen-stajcic.html">Alen Stajcic</a>’s contract was not terminated on the basis that he had breached his contract or had engaged in any misconduct. Any inference that has been drawn about these being reasons for Alen’s contract termination is wrong. FFA acknowledges that some of the speculation about the termination of Alen’s contract was caused by statements made by one of its directors, Heather Reid. These statements were not made on behalf of FFA and did not reflect the decision of the Board or the reasons why it made that decision</p>
