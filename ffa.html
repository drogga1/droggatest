  <p><b>[In their statement on Friday, the FFA stressed that Heather Reid’s comments at the time of <a href="alen-stajcic.html">Stajcic</a>’s sacking didn’t impact their decision to part ways with the coach]</b> FFA by this statement wishes to make clear that <a href="alen-stajcic.html">Alen Stajcic</a>’s contract was not terminated on the basis that he had breached his contract or had engaged in any misconduct. Any inference that has been drawn about these being reasons for Alen’s contract termination is wrong. FFA acknowledges that some of the speculation about the termination of Alen’s contract was caused by statements made by one of its directors, Heather Reid. These statements were not made on behalf of FFA and did not reflect the decision of the Board or the reasons why it made that decision</p>
