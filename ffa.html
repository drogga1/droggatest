  <p><b>[A-League clubs warn against FFA reform delay]</b> The Australian Professional Football Clubs Association <b>[APFCA]</b> has yet to have any meaningful engagement with FFA on the constitutional and governance reform the FFA committed in September 2016 to complete by March 2017. We would find it unacceptable if the visit by the FFA chairman Steven Lowy and FFA CEO David Gallop to the FIFA president either delays the long-overdue reform of the FFA General Assembly, or creates a circumvention of the committed process of engagement with stakeholders of the Australian game. It is the APFCA’s position that the professional game can no longer be expected to be the major financial provider to Football Federation Australia without fair democratic representation in the FFA General Assembly.</p>

  <p><b>[Football Federation Australia has denied players suffered heat stroke during Adelaide United’s 2-2 draw with Wellington Phoenix]</b> The FFA Heat Policy clearly states that drinks breaks should be implemented if the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature <b>[WBGT]</b> reaches 26 degrees and there should be consideration of delays and postponement if the WBGT reaches 28. The FFA Heat Policy offers greater consideration to players welfare than the FIFA policy and that of most other sports around the world. In line with FFA’s Heat Policy both clubs were informed throughout the week of the forecast WBGT for Adelaide on Sunday to ensure the players were professionally prepared.<br /><br />The WBGT reading before the match on Sunday in Adelaide was 25.6. Despite this, Head of A-League Greg O’Rourke, who was at the match, consulted both team doctors and it was agreed to insert drinks breaks into the match as a further sign of FFA’s interest in player welfare. This was all agreed and acknowledged by both teams. FFA has since been informed by medical staff at the match that no players suffered heat stroke during the match.</p>

  <p><b>[FFA release reform timeline]</b> Football Federation Australia will continue consultations with key stakeholders next week regarding the process to expand the membership of its congress which would allow broader representation in the governance of the sport.<br /><br />Last week FFA Chairman Steven Lowy AM and CEO David Gallop AM met with FIFA President Gianni Infantino, FIFA Secretary General Fatma Samba Diouf Samoura and senior FIFA officials in Zurich to confirm that FFA intended to expand the congress. FIFA expressed complete satisfaction with all aspects of the status of the process and FFA’s intention to have membership changes implemented through an Extraordinary General Meeting at the end of March.<br /><br />An EGM is necessary so that the existing Members - the nine member federations and one representative of the clubs - can consider a special resolution to amend the constitution of FFA based on the outcome of the stakeholders consultation process.</p>

  <p><b>[Red and Black Bloc has lashed out at Football Federation Australia’s intention to penalise them and Western Sydney Wanderers for their vulgar banner at Saturday’s derby]</b> We find it ironic that it takes the FFA barely 24 hours to respond to a banner deemed ‘offensive’, but take over 12 months to even commence an appeals process agreed upon in December 2015. Clearly football in this country is in the wrong hands. Football belongs to the people, not a dictatorial body or the likes of so called expert commentators.</p>

  <p><b>[FFA’s preferred deadline for expansion since discussions over growing to 12 teams became a strategic priority in October, interested parties such as South Melbourne and FC Tasmania have declared they would be ready for next season]</b> We recently advised the clubs that we must explore a new model for the Hyundai A-League/Westfield W-League. We agree that we need to protect the value of the existing licences in which the current owners have invested. We want to expand the leagues but this has to happen as part of a new structure. That’s why we are now working with the clubs to determine the future structure of the leagues and the criteria for expansion.<br /><br />We will examine these issues in detail and expect this work will take months rather than weeks. We know that those consortia that have expressed an interest in joining the league would want to be part of something that is financially sustainable and attractive as a sound investment<br /><br />The decisions we make around the future of the Hyundai A-League/Westfield W-League will have an impact on every aspect of football in Australia. That’s why we want to work with the clubs and other stakeholders on changes that benefit the whole game</p>

  <p><b>[National Premier Leagues clubs met on Monday to begin the process of forming a representative body in the hope of securing voting rights in Football Federation Australia’s Congress]</b> Youth development is something we’re proud of at MKFC <b>[Knights]</b> and it should not be forgotten that we built our stadium off the back of transfer fees associated with Mark Viduka.<br /><br />We have grave concerns about the way we currently lose youth players to National Youth League teams and their corresponding NPL squads with little to no financial compensation. In one season, we lost seven of our players to Melbourne Victory and Melbourne City youth teams.<br /><br />Further, of those seven, none made senior A-League team appearances, which poses questions for the viability of the current model where kids are plucked from our senior squads, play only against other kids - missing out on exposure to senior set-ups - and are then, in most cases, regurgitated back out into the NPL set-up<br /><br />We are of the strong opinion that this system will not work long term in anyone’s interest</p>

  <p><b>[Association of Australian Football Clubs - the representative body of National Premier Leagues clubs - has formally declared its desire to be included in Football Federation Australia’s congress]</b> The Association of Australian Football Clubs’ <b>[AAFC]</b> plans for its inaugural meeting of members in Melbourne next Monday, 20 March 2017 have been heartily supported by a great number of NPL clubs across the country. The AAFC has already been endorsed by a majority of NPL clubs. Most will be present at the first meeting with many having confirmed they will travel from interstate.<br /><br />As members of AAFC, the clubs will set its aims and priorities. Already, however, the overwhelming message from the clubs to AAFC has been that their priority is to secure formal representation, as a special interest group, at the forthcoming FFA General Congress as well as a permanent seat.<br /><br />These clubs field approximately 30,000 players who have been identified for elite development under FFA’s NPL model. Only with direct formal representation at the FFA table will the distinct and important interests of the NPL clubs be properly represented</p>

He confirmed FFA is awaiting the outcome of our decisions on Monday and advised he would table our request to be included in future Congress discussions to those attending the meeting today. As you can all see, in the week and a half since we formed and prior to our first meeting of members, we have gathered significant support and the full attention of FFA. FIFA encouraged us in our effort to become formally involved in governance, the PFA is supportive and keen to work with us and the media and other stakeholders are treating us with due respect and seriousness. FFA is waiting for us to report back to it our intentions.</p>

  <p><b>[Football Federation Australia’s director of referees Ben Wilson insisted that the use of video technology will not change how match officials go about their job in the first instance]</b> They will not be changing the way they referee the game. They’re still responsible for making the decision. They will make their decision and they will referee the game as if there is no VAR there. In the occasional event or the rare event that there is an error then there is that safety net of the VAR to correct that.</p>

  <p><b>[Football Federation Australia has dismissed the A-League clubs’ suggestion that they are keeping over 50 per cent of competition-produced revenue as totally incorrect]</b> The suggestion by the clubs that FFA will return less than 50 per cent of the revenue generated by the clubs in the coming year is totally incorrect. The reality is that FFA spending on the A-League in 2017-18 closely matches revenue generated by the league when cash distributions and league operating costs such as team travel, player insurance and match officials - which are paid for centrally - are taken into account.<br /><br />If the A-League was a stand-alone entity all of these costs would still need to be met. For this reason, the distribution communicated is affordable, without placing undue pressure on other areas of the game.<br /><br /><b>[But with funding required for grassroots football and various national teams, Gallop insisted FFA cannot provide more to the clubs]</b> It was hardly surprising that the owners of the clubs want more money and we are providing them with more money after reducing FFA’s own costs significantly. But the FFA Board also has a responsibility to the 1.1 million participants in community football and our national teams program. The only way we can provide the clubs with more money is to cut more funding to the grassroots and junior and senior national teams and we do not believe that is in the interests of football in this country</p>

We know that an expanded A-League is more than being all about us. It’s about our role in growing the game of football in Australia, how to get bums on seats and eyeball on TVs, and making them stick in both cases<br /><br />Our bid is complete. Our funding model is secure. We are ready to join the A-League. In our view, Brisbane is ready for two teams as well. To think it can’t support two teams is misguided</p>

Greater Dandenong is Victoria’s most multicultural municipality and the second most multicultural in Australia <b>[behind Auburn in western Sydney]</b> representing 156 different nationalities. We may be culturally diverse but we all share the one language of football. An A-League club in the region would be a multicultural club for all the community, seeking to represent all the local clubs in the region</p>

Any inference that has been drawn about these being reasons for Alen’s contract termination is wrong.
