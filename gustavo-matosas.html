  <p><b>[Bermuda stubbornly held the floodgates closed. They never opened. Despite a weary-looking squad working in heat that Costa Rica manager Gustavo Matosas called ‘infernal’ (the heat index was over 100 at kickoff), the islanders held tough]</b> It’s a team that didn’t surprise me because Bermuda doesn’t play football poorly. They play really well, and if you look against Haiti, it’s the same. The other day in Costa Rica they played really well</p>

  <p><b>[Costa Rica manager Gustavo Matosas talks about current Gold Cup’s team]</b> You can talk about the economic difference or infrastructure differences, and we can’t deceive ourselves. Small countries have given us difficulty, but there they are. We’ve seen that the Caribbean teams are coming along really well</p>

  <p><b>[Gustavo Matosas knows Mexican football well - very well in fact. The Uruguayan has two Liga MX titles with Leon and also win the 2014-15 Concacaf Champions League at the helm of Club America]</b> I don’t think it’s an advantage. There are a lot of new players and the manager’s style is always going to change. I think when Juan Carlos Osorio was there, I knew a bit more. Now Martino it’s just what I’ve seen. I don’t think knowing the players has a lot do with it. What it does have to do with, for me, from my point of view, is all the years I lived in Mexico I learned the characteristics of the Mexican player. This could be an advantage. But, beyond that, a lot of times you know what a player can do but you can’t stop him.</p>

  <p><b>[Now led by Gustavo Matosas, a manager familiar with Mexican football , Costa Rica will come out to push El Tri with an attacking style]</b> I feel very good. This is the soccer that I like. It’s good to be able to go blow-by-blow with Mexico.<br /><br />We’ve got to adapt to any situation or style of play the opponent presents. Our idea always is to control the game, not to wait and see what the opposition does. If we can put down our idea, surely we’ll play a closer game to the one we want. It’s true that this opponent has some big-time players and it could be that during some times we may not be able to implement what we want, but in general terms I don’t think we need to adjust ourselves to the rival. What we need is to find answers for any opponent we find in front of use, whether it be a friendly match or an official game</p>

  <p><b>[Costa Rica counterpart Gustavo Matosas intends for his side to bounce back after their loss against Haiti in an aggressive, attacking manner, doubtless aware that Mexico have kept only one clean sheet in Martino’s seven games]</b> We’ll give it everything.<br /><br /><b>[He is a man who knows Mexican football inside out]</b> I don’t think it’s an advantage. There are a lot of new players and the manager’s style is always going to change. I think when Juan Carlos Osorio was there, I knew a bit more. Now Martino it’s just what I’ve seen. I don’t think knowing the players has a lot do with it.

  <p><b>[Ochoa diving to deny a kick from the spot from Keysher Fuller. That gave Mexico the 5-4 win in penalties. Gustavo Matosas congratulated Mexico on its win but also hinted that he felt his side may have been the better team over the long-haul]</b> You’re asking a question that doesn’t matter in football. In football, you can’t talk about justice. The one who scores, wins</p>

  <p><b>[Gustavo Matosas quits ‘boring’ Costa Rica job ahead of likely Liga MX return]</b> I didn’t know that being manager of a national team was so boring. The chance to go to a team where I have expectations. Above all else, it’s difficult to manage a national team when you don’t have the day to day with the players. I don’t feel productive. Sometimes I think I’m on vacation<br /><br />I get the players one week every two months. I thought it wouldn’t be so tough, however I feel like I miss that day to day to work on everything I’d like to see from the players on the field. In the national team, I don’t feel productive. I don’t have that day-in, day-out routine so I end up killing myself watching film and games. That’s not what I like. I tried it, and it’s not what I like</p>
