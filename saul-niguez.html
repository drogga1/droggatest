  <p><b>[Saul Niguez dreams of being the future for Spain and Atletico Madrid]</b> Thank God, I have always lived positive situations. With my work, I have managed to achieve what I wanted, and in the end my feelings have always been positive. If they are not, then you may have to work in another way - looking for help outside: a professional, your family. Whenever I have had hard times, my family has been there and it is they who have been able to guide and advise me. For me, the circle that you have closest is very important: family, friends … It is the most important thing to keep you stable. Knowing that in football one day you are <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi, and the next day nobody wants you. You have to know who you are, have confidence in yourself and have the emotional stability to face all the situations that come to you.<br /><br />You have to have a lot of personality. Great players always have a great personality. Look at the best in the world: Messi, <b>[Cristiano]</b> Ronaldo, Neymar, <b>[Antoine]</b> Griezmann … It’s their personality and nobody changes them. They have worked to get to where they are and everyone has to be clear about what you do, why you do it and have your own personality<br /><br />I talk about those three players because they are very intelligent. They are able to read the game very well. This is very important. If you are very good with the ball or in the one-against-one but you do not know how to read the game, in the end you will find yourself in front of two defenders, you will try to dribble past them and you won’t manage it. Even if you are a very good player. But those players know how to read the game. When two players come to them, they play fast and they give time to their team-mates so that they can take advantage of the situation in another part of the field. That’s why I named those three. Many times I have named them because they play in my position and I look at them to improve. Iniesta has that last pass and that association with the attackers that I would love to have; another one, the Busquets intelligence; and Koke’s intelligence and physique … In the end, with those three players you would have a spectacular midfield<br /><br />This World Cup, whatever happens, will be very useful for Spain. Young players can learn from the people who made history and made us champions of everything, that made us all feel proud. It is very important that we can learn from them, and not only in football but on a personal level. How they have dealt with those experiences, all those kind of things that happen in a big tournament. They transmit it to us and then when we are the veterans, if we work well and we have the consistency that we must have in order to be here for many years, we will be able to transmit the lessons of these champions to those who reach the team. Thus, Spain has a great future. And if that’s in the hands of Asensio and myself, that would be a dream for me</p>

  <p><b>[Saul Niguez claims it would be impossible for him to leave Atletico Madrid for Real Madrid]</b> Joining Real Madrid would for me be unthinkable … it would be very, very difficult, almost impossible<br /><br />I do not know what is going to happen, I have a contract until 2026. I signed it knowing what there is here and I am very happy<br /><br />They did not call me personally. There was a time when it might have been close, but before I got an offer Atletico put a renewal to me and I said ‘okay’. I never negotiated with anybody else</p>

It is always special, it is the first that is played outside Europe, it makes us very excited to compete tomorrow. The really important thing is to prepare for the first official match, but we are going to play as if it were an official match, as if it were a final, because every time you wear the shirt of <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> it is to give everything</p>

We played well since the first minute and we’ve proven that we’re a team, we’re all together and that’s very positive. When you wear Atletico de Madrid’s colours, you always have to give it your all. The new players have settled in very well and worked very hard</p>

  <p><b>[Saul Niguez has praised Hector Herrera’s attitude but acknowledged he has work to do to earn a starting place at <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>]</b> I think he’s amazing. People are surprised that he hasn’t been getting game time but, at the end of the day, you have to earn it. We saw the other day when he played in a different position. We have always set an example for him, because he keeps training very well and, as I said, he wants to listen and to learn. And despite the fact he’s an experienced player, he’s open-minded. In the dressing room, he’s a very good guy.<br /><br /><b>[Saul also gave a positive assessment of Atletico’s other new arrivals for 2019-20, including forward Ivan Saponjic, who joined the club from <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> in July but is yet to feature]</b> Renan Lodi and <a href="kieran-trippier.html">Kieran Trippier</a>, they’re great at getting up and down the wing. They’re top players and they pose a real threat because they’re excellent at crossing. As for <a href="felipe.html">Felipe</a> and Mario Hermoso, both of them are very experienced and top-class centre-backs, but their most salient and important feature - as with the rest of the signings - is that they have a willingness to learn and to listen, regardless of how experienced they may be. <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a> is getting more playing time than Saponjic but the same goes for him as the other lads. He’s always working hard in training, he’s a very strong guy when it comes to holding off defenders and creating space, and he has great movement in the box</p>

  <p><b>[Saul Niguez has told former <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> team-mate <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Antoine Griezmann</a> that he can succeed anywhere]</b> player of his level can succeed anywhere. He has to feel comfortable, important, happy, the only thing he’s after is enjoying football and if he’s not enjoying the position he’s playing or whatever, he won’t be at his best. He doesn’t just contribute on the pitch, at least not at Atletico. He’s happy, positive. He’s one of the players that is always good to have<br /><br />Everyone will look for the best solution. He works hard, does his best for the team and if the coach decides if he should play on the left, he will do, and he will adapt to be one of the best on the left flank. He’s really good, he always sacrifices himself for the good of the team and I only have super positive things to say about Antoine<br /><br /><b>[On adapting to new surroundings]</b> It happens at all teams. You don’t know the mechanisms, your team-mates, if a player wants it to feet or in space… they’re details that come in time. You can be happier because of the weather, the city, the family, but at the end of the day these are the things you have to adjust to and <b>[<a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a>]</b> will be more and more happy in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> all the time<br /><br /><b>[Portuguese starlet <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a> was the man they turned to, with Saul impressed by a teenage forward snapped up for €126 million from <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a>]</b> He has something different. Don’t forget he’s only 18, very young, but he’s won me over with his desire to learn, to improve, to learn and to contribute to the team. He’s adapting still and when he’s 100 per cent, you can demand more. Now he’s giving everything on the pitch, doing well for the team. Every time he gets the ball, he looks to the goal. He’s one of those different players<br /><br /><b>[Saul added to <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>’s official website on the <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Rojiblancos</a> new boys]</b> The two full-backs Renan Lodi and <a href="kieran-trippier.html">Kieran Trippier</a>, they’re great at getting up and down the wing, they’re top players and they pose a real threat because they’re excellent at crossing. They’re also adept at coming in from the flanks, so I think they’re real all-rounders.

I think it’s very positive that they’ve settled into the squad very well, as from the very first moment they’ve tried to adapt to things here.<br /><br />Last but not least, there’s <b>[Ivan]</b> Saponjic and <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a>. <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a> is getting more playing time than Saponjic, but the same goes for him as the other lads - he’s always working hard in training, he’s a very strong guy when it comes to holding off defenders and creating space, and he has great movement in the box. I think we’ve signed players across the whole pitch, who aside from being talented footballers are great people who bring a lot to the dressing room. This is especially important given that over the summer a lot of veterans who were important to the squad moved on</p>

Because he is the one who gets it. Ter Stegen has managed to get a couple of balls, fortunately, although another has been with great quality.

We have played a great game, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> has not had many chances, but when it appears Leo is able to do what he does with terrible ease, that’s why he is the best.

  <p><b>[Saul Niguez admits concern about the way <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> too often start matches slowly]</b> We struggled a lot at the start. They created three chances and got the goal from the third. There have been many times this season when we haven’t started games well. I think the end of the first half and the beginning of the second were good, but they defended well. We didn’t manage to create clear chances despite getting to the byline several times. After the good run we were on, it’s a tough blow</p>

  <p><b>[Saul Niguez believes <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> are capable of hurting <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s animals]</b> You break them. There’s no memory in football: what you did yesterday is no use. We had a good run before Christmas then we fell away and it was hard. People wanted to kill us. Do I think it’s unfair? Honestly, yes. But it’s life. People whistle <a href="diego-simeone.html">Cholo</a> <b>[<a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a>]</b>, important players; the fans are demanding. If we win two or three games, it’ll change again. We know how we can hurt <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, their strengths and weaknesses, and we always compete against big teams. We have to make the most of the home game. There will be an incredible atmosphere, more than ever<br /><br />They have those perros de presa <b>[hunting dogs]</b> in the middle who run, press. It’s not just running for the sake of running: they do things that aren’t normal and it looks disordered but it’s ordered, mechanised. One comes out here and you think: ‘That’s mad, why’s he there?’ But the other man knows and comes from here.<br /><br /><a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> said they play with their heart, but it’s planned too. One breaks out to press, wild, but they follow. It’s very hard to escape when they come at you like that. It’s incredible: they press like animals, because they know that even if they get turned there will be seven of them running like mad to get back. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are very complete, a great team in every area <b>[but]</b> they find it hardest when you’re deep because they’re very, very, very good in transition. I watched them against <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> and if it wasn’t for <b>[Sadio]</b> Mané’s extraordinary control, they don’t win. They’ve won lots of games they could have drawn or lost, which tells you something about what they have inside. It’s not luck. It’s work, sacrifice, not giving up a single ball for lost</p>

To be honest, it wasn’t the game in which I suffered the most. I didn’t feel we weren’t playing well. For instance, I remember when we faced <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> in Germany <b>[in 2016]</b>. I really suffered in that one, I thought to myself we wouldn’t come out alive! Whereas at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, I had a lot of confidence in the team, I thought we were doing things well<br /><br />It’s true they had a lot of chances an Jan was exceptional as always, and it’s true that at first we didn’t have as many chances as we would have wanted. But when they scored their first goal, we saw that they really came at us and left spaces at the back, which we could attack. Marcos Llorente, the hero of the day along with Jan, came on with fresh legs and was able to help <a href="alvaro-morata.html">Morata</a>, who was also fresh, and the whole team. We needed them to hurt <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> on the break. I think that speaks volumes about the team, because it’s not only the starters who make the difference, it’s also the players coming on from the bench. We thought about the group, not about ourselves individually, which is maybe what sets us apart</p>

I have a long-term contract, which I signed because I want to stay here. I don’t have any problem staying here because my family are here, it’s my home. People say, ‘come out and deny it’, but then if you deny it and something happens, you look bad.
