  <p><b>[St. Louis, Charlotte bids make presentations to MLS in push for expansion]</b> Today the ownership group representing St. Louis’ Major League Soccer expansion bid made a formal presentation to the MLS expansion committee and league executives in New York City. We had a productive meeting with the St. Louis group and look forward to continuing our discussions with them<br /><br />In addition <b>[to the St. Louis visit]</b>, representatives from Charlotte’s MLS expansion bid visited MLS’s offices today to provide an update. Major League Soccer also continues to work closely with the ownership group representing Sacramento’s expansion bid, and we expect to meet again soon. The ownership groups from Charlotte, Las Vegas, Sacramento, St. Louis and other potential expansion markets are scheduled to attend MLS All-Star week festivities later this month in Orlando.</p>

We’re confident our proposal puts St. Louis in the best position to bring MLS to America’s first soccer capital</p>

  <p><b>[Major League Soccer has awarded an expansion franchise to St. Louis, Missouri, the league announced on Tuesday]</b> It is with great pride that we welcome St. Louis to Major League Soccer. St. Louis is a city with a rich soccer tradition, and it is a market we have considered since the league’s inception. Our league becomes stronger today with the addition of the city’s deeply dedicated soccer fans, and the committed and innovative local ownership group led by Carolyn Kindle Betz, the Taylor family, and Jim Kavanaugh.</p>

  <p><b>[Enterprise Holdings Foundation president Kindle Betz and six other female members of the Taylor family will make the St. Louis franchise the first female majority-owned club in MLS history]</b> It’s an incredible feeling to now be able to say, St. Louis is home to the first official majority female-led ownership group in MLS. Our MLS team and stadium will only add to St. Louis’ renaissance currently underway and will provide us with a great opportunity to bring together many different segments of the community, uniting people in their love for the game</p>
