  <p><b>[Crew try to maintain consistency to clear championship hurdle]</b> It’s been a great experience. This coaching staff has really been teaching me a lot. I’ve been learning different tactics defensively and offensively. I’m still trying to understand which players like the ball at their feet and which players like the ball in space, but other than that, it’s a great group of guys. They’re constantly communicating with me on the field and off the field and that’s really helping me a lot.</p>

  <p><b>[Zardes ready to deliver on promise as Columbus Crew’s new No. 9]</b> With Galaxy, I played numerous positions on a week to week basis. I could get messed up in the head. Am I winger this game? Am I a striker?.<br /><br />With this team <b>[Columbus Crew]</b> I’m a center forward, I’m a striker<br /><br />I’ve been extremely impressed by how clear the coaching staff has made my role on the team. It’s crystal clear what they expect of me offensively and defensively<br /><br />To have an opportunity to live in a different state with different cultures and play for a different team, you know I was excited about that<br /><br />So far, <b>[the system]</b> fits me perfectly. I have played four games and have four goals. As a striker, that’s pretty good</p>
