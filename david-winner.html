<blockquote>
  <p><b>[David Winner In his book ‘Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football’]</b> <a href="gerd-muller.html">Gred Muller</a> was short, squat, awkward-looking and not notably fast; he never fit the conventional idea of a great footballer, but he had lethal acceleration over short distances, a remarkable aerial game, and uncanny goal scoring instincts. His short legs gave him a strangely low center of gravity, so he could turn quickly and with perfect balance in spaces and at speeds that would cause other players to fall over. He also had a knack of scoring in unlikely situations</p>

  <p><b>[The Church of Cruyff: Forever Spreading the Football Gospel]</b> The Netherlands <b>[until the early 1960s]</b> was a third-rate footballing nation, its tactics and facilities stuck in the 1930s. Yet within a decade, the club and country had become the most important and admired in the world. <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> was the man who made it happen<br /><br /><b>[…]</b> <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> has had many enemies and critics over the years. He has been accused of being too idealistic, too stubborn, insufficiently interested in defending and simply too difficult a personality. He loves an argument, and his conflict-model method of working can be bruising.</p>
