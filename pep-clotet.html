  <p><b>[Birmingham City head coach Pep Clotet urged teenage sensation Jude Bellingham to ignore interest from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and Borussia Dortmund]</b> I always thought he is very mature and very focused - but he has to be. Because he cannot be thinking about other things than <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham City</a> - and I am sure he is only thinking about <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham City</a>. That’s the feeling I get from him, when I speak to him and work with him</p>

  <p><b>[Birmingham manager Pep Clotet stressed earlier in March that Jude Bellingham remains focused on the club he’s currently contracted to]</b> I always thought he is very mature and very focused - but he has to be.

  <p><b>[Pep Clotet says with the coronavirus outbreak expected to have some impact on transfer dealings]</b> What I’m very happy about now is that Jude is here with us and all the players are here with us as well. We focus on that really, but I understand there’s going to be more speculation when the games do come back. As a head coach, I don’t deal with transfers, it’s the club. But I can imagine the situation has all the clubs very worried about how to finish this season and what impact this season has into next season. That can change a lot of the future of the clubs. Possibly it’s going to be a busy summer, possibly it’s going to be less busy, we still don’t know what impact it will have.<br /><br />It’s a lot up to what work every club is doing and how they’re structured and organised, but I’m pretty sure that will always happen in the Championship, League One and League Two. We are talking a lot about how to finish this season, but we’re forgetting that next season is only a month or two months after and the situation will have a huge impact. The season tickets will not be there because you can’t access the stadium, so this will have an impact on the clubs. I do believe the football in England is healthy, the structure of the league and the support across the pyramid is strong - it’s a trademark of English football - but in this moment in difficult times, football is feeling threatened as are all walks of life but it’s important to stay together and find solutions especially when it comes to next season</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Gardner scored twice to rescue a point for <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a> and deny Hull after the visitors led twice in a 3-3 draw at St Andrew’s]</b> We were dead and buried in the first half. We were in the ITU and we were gone. But that’s the beauty of this game - we recognised what was wrong and we knew what we needed to do to come back and try to win the game<br /><br />They understood that perfectly and put their hearts into it. It just shows the huge pride that the team has and the determination to fight to the end</p>

  <p><b>[Dominant <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a> grabbed a huge survival lifeline after an impressive 3-0 win at Birmingham]</b> We didn’t like the game or the result. We have to put our hands up and take it as a bad game as that’s what it was and <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a> were better than us in most things. We have to bounce back and get points on the board. We’re not happy, we’ve spoken to the players and they are committed 100 per cent to bouncing back<br /><br />We need to make sure our focus is there from the start. As a team we always need a strong start. I have a good relationship with all the players, I respect them and trust them 100 per cent. All the players are fully focused on doing their best. It’s not like they are not trying</p>

  <p><b>[Josh Onomah struck deep into added time to keep Fulham’s automatic promotion hopes alive with a 1-0 win over Birmingham]</b> I’m devastated. Devastated for the players, for the club and for the fans. I thought the result was completely unfair. We had the most chances. We had two good chances in the first half and possibly a penalty. If we had scored those chances it would have been a completely different games<br /><br />It’s unfair but that happens. We deserve a point and could have had three. Unfortunately we lost the point we worked so hard to get. But I am pretty sure the performances will get better. I am not looking over my shoulder. We want to finish as high as possible</p>

  <p><b>[Pep Clotet leaves <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham City</a> before end of season]</b> <a href="pep-clotet.html">Pep Clotet</a> has this evening left his position as head coach. He was due to step down at the season’s end but it was mutually agreed that he should relinquish the role immediately. The board would like to place on record its sincere thanks to Pep for his efforts during the past two years. We will be making no further comment at this time</p>
