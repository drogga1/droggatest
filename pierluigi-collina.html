  <p><b>[Pierluigi Collina believes additional assistant referees <b>[AARs]</b> will still have a place in Uefa competitions if goal-line technology is introduced]</b> The penalty area is the most crucial zone of the field. Actions there have a decisive influence on matches. The density of players, especially in situations like free-kicks and corner-kicks, makes it impossible for a single pair of eyes to take control of all that happens on the numerous set-piece plays every match.<br /><br />The aim of implementing the AARs has simply been to give the referees support in controlling the most important incidents on the field of play. Many people in the media and general public may not appreciate all that AARs do during the game, because these officials do not have a flag or a whistle, but it is a fact that they have been crucial in helping make the right decisions at the right time during our matches<br /><br />Regarding the specific timing, we are comfortable for the Executive Committee to make the decision now because our review of the process has just concluded, and we also feel that with Uefa Euro 2016 around the corner it is a good opportunity for Uefa to introduce GLT at a big tournament</p>

  <p><b>[Euro 2016 &amp; Champions League to utilise goal-line technology]</b> It’s not a decision taken quickly. We went through a long consultation after president Michel Platini told us, one-and-a-half years ago, to investigate whether additional assistant referees and goal-line technology together would have been worth it. We implemented the additional assistant referees quite a long time ago and the reason why was to improve the control of the match official on each single incident. Monitoring the goal-line was not the main task of the additional referees, they were to control what was going on, particularly inside and around the penalty area.<br /><br />Certainly goal-line incidents were part of their job, but they were not often involved and, talking to our referees, the feedback we got was for them to be focused on goal-line incidents they had to be ready well before the ball arrives. This meant they would lose control of what happened when the ball was kicked and the possible goal-line incident. This reduced the possibility for the additional referee to really support the referees in controlling what was going on inside the penalty area.<br /><br />So we were convinced that implementing the GLT would have been a further step in better control of the match. We are happy with the outcome of the additional referee’s job although we know from outside their contribution is not always appreciated or understood. Unfortunately they are like ducks, very relaxed above the water and paddling like hell underneath. Even if they don’t show any gestures, as they are not allowed to, they are making decisions and communicating them to the referee.</p>

  <p><b>[IFAB confirms Women’s World Cup goalkeepers will not be booked if they move off their line during a penalty shoot-out]</b> We discussed this matter with players and coaches and eventually decided to help goalkeepers by allowing them to have only one foot on the goal line instead of two. Since that change their job is definitely easier than before, and it is also easier for them to respect the current law than the previous version. Then, if a law exists, referees must enforce it. For factual decisions, the number of centimetres doesn’t matter. If a ball is over the goal line by few centimetres, a goal must be still awarded. And if a foul is committed within the penalty area by few centimetres, a penalty kick must be given</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> defends VAR with statistics despite Women’s World Cup controversy]</b> VAR cannot be blind, cannot ignore. If you have a tool that offers you the possibility to check, you have to check. We are not experimenting. We are simply implementing the laws of the game</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> referees chief Pierluigi Collina says The Women’s World Cup is not being used as an experiment for new laws]</b> The only issue so far has concerned penalty kicks, and honestly we have been a bit surprised. If we have a tool that can show clearly without any doubt that there is an offside position and a goal is scored by the player who was in an offside position, it doesn’t matter if it was two centimetres or 20 metres. There is not a small or a big offside, there is an offside. We have technology which was well received by the entire world, goal-line technology, which allows us to see if the ball crossed the line by 0.5cm, so if the ball is over the line by 0.5cm, it is a goal. If a goalkeeper moves both feet off the goal-line before the penalty kick is taken, we have no choice but to order the penalty kick to be retaken. I repeat, it is not a matter of a small encroachment or big encroachment, it is a matter of encroachment, and this is what we can do by using technology.<br /><br />We didn’t consider the Women’s World Cup - which is our flagship tournament in 2019 as a World Cup - as an experiment. I want only to remind you that the new version of the laws of the game have been implemented in Poland for the Under-20 World Cup for the men, it has been implemented in the Copa America, it has been implemented in AFCON, and also here. The laws are the same all over the world. What is written in the laws of the game has to be enforced in every one of the countries that belong to <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> and in every one of the competitions arranged by the member associations of <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[While VAR was trialled in the Confederations Cup before bringing it to the men’s World Cup, this summer has been the first use of it in the women’s game. Pierluigi Collina argued otherwise at a media briefing last week]</b> We didn’t consider the Women’s World Cup, which is our flagship tournament in 2019, as a World Cup, we cannot consider this competition as an experiment<br /><br /><b>[The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> will not enforce the encroachment rule next season, something that shocked and seemed to anger Collina]</b> The rules of the game must be enforced in every country and competition. You cannot decide how to enforce the rules of the game. If you don’t like something, you need to respect the laws of the game; that is what we are enforcing here in France</p>

  <p><b>[Legendary referee Pierluigi Collina thinks fans should be thinking about the future with VAR - and says that it actually brings more excitement to the game]</b> Even if it feels like VAR has been around forever, it was only thought up five years ago. In principle, it was meant to be a simple visual aid for the referee. One of the biggest problems was in reliability, but the reaction time of the technology has advanced light years. What takes one minute today took five minutes in 2014 during our first tests. We are working constantly and the technology we’ll have in five years could be totally different to the one we see now<br /><br /><b>[The time taken to make decisions has also been an issue for many fans]</b> Of course, nobody likes to wait. But a big step forward would be if we create a programme using artificial intelligence to immediately select at most 20 different camera angles. I don’t think VAR kills the excitement of a goal celebration, if anything it increases the level of excitement. You get to celebrate twice, when scoring and when it’s confirmed</p>

  <p><b>[VAR: Pierluigi Collina calls for more use of pitchside monitors]</b> Another thing to be considered (is) a sort of wrong idea of solidarity. If you belong to a team, you always try to protect your team-mates. If your team-mate made a mistake, you try to find everything to say ‘No, no, no, he was correct’. It’s a sort of friendship I would say. Referees must understand the solidarity and the friendship that they want to show is to tell their colleague ‘Be careful, you might have made a mistake’.<br /><br />It’s better that you have another chance watching the incident on a monitor, you have assessed probably wrongly,’ so that finally you can avoid a mistake. A wrong decision taken in an important match, a key decision, from our experiences in the past can really kill a referee’s career. (VAR) is a very important safety net for referees.<br /><br /><b>[Collina would not comment on specific competitions]</b> What we are trying to do is to have consistent assessment, to have uniformity, to have consistent decisions taken by video assistant referees suggesting referees to review something or not on the pitchside monitor. It might be very complicated to switch from what you are used to doing when you play domestically into a different way when you play internationally. Offside can occur anywhere in 55-60 metres of the outfield, so it’s much more complicated to have the same kind of approach goal-line technology<br /><br />We are working. VAR is only five years old. He is a young boy, who is learning and certainly will improve. I had two experiences in my life as an assistant referee - and they were two nightmares. It is more than probable that in the future we will have specialised video match officials</p>
