  <p><b>[IFAB confirms Women’s World Cup goalkeepers will not be booked if they move off their line during a penalty shoot-out]</b> We discussed this matter with players and coaches and eventually decided to help goalkeepers by allowing them to have only one foot on the goal line instead of two. Since that change their job is definitely easier than before, and it is also easier for them to respect the current law than the previous version. Then, if a law exists, referees must enforce it. For factual decisions, the number of centimetres doesn’t matter. If a ball is over the goal line by few centimetres, a goal must be still awarded. And if a foul is committed within the penalty area by few centimetres, a penalty kick must be given</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> referees chief Pierluigi Collina says The Women’s World Cup is not being used as an experiment for new laws]</b> The only issue so far has concerned penalty kicks, and honestly we have been a bit surprised. If we have a tool that can show clearly without any doubt that there is an offside position and a goal is scored by the player who was in an offside position, it doesn’t matter if it was two centimetres or 20 metres. There is not a small or a big offside, there is an offside. We have technology which was well received by the entire world, goal-line technology, which allows us to see if the ball crossed the line by 0.5cm, so if the ball is over the line by 0.5cm, it is a goal. If a goalkeeper moves both feet off the goal-line before the penalty kick is taken, we have no choice but to order the penalty kick to be retaken. I repeat, it is not a matter of a small encroachment or big encroachment, it is a matter of encroachment, and this is what we can do by using technology.<br /><br />We didn’t consider the Women’s World Cup - which is our flagship tournament in 2019 as a World Cup - as an experiment. I want only to remind you that the new version of the laws of the game have been implemented in Poland for the Under-20 World Cup for the men, it has been implemented in the Copa America, it has been implemented in AFCON, and also here. The laws are the same all over the world. What is written in the laws of the game has to be enforced in every one of the countries that belong to <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> and in every one of the competitions arranged by the member associations of <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[While VAR was trialled in the Confederations Cup before bringing it to the men’s World Cup, this summer has been the first use of it in the women’s game. Pierluigi Collina argued otherwise at a media briefing last week]</b> We didn’t consider the Women’s World Cup, which is our flagship tournament in 2019, as a World Cup, we cannot consider this competition as an experiment<br /><br /><b>[The Premier League will not enforce the encroachment rule next season, something that shocked and seemed to anger Collina]</b> The rules of the game must be enforced in every country and competition. You cannot decide how to enforce the rules of the game. If you don’t like something, you need to respect the laws of the game; that is what we are enforcing here in France</p>

  <p><b>[Legendary referee Pierluigi Collina thinks fans should be thinking about the future with VAR - and says that it actually brings more excitement to the game]</b> Even if it feels like VAR has been around forever, it was only thought up five years ago. In principle, it was meant to be a simple visual aid for the referee. One of the biggest problems was in reliability, but the reaction time of the technology has advanced light years. What takes one minute today took five minutes in 2014 during our first tests. We are working constantly and the technology we’ll have in five years could be totally different to the one we see now<br /><br /><b>[The time taken to make decisions has also been an issue for many fans]</b> Of course, nobody likes to wait. But a big step forward would be if we create a programme using artificial intelligence to immediately select at most 20 different camera angles. I don’t think VAR kills the excitement of a goal celebration, if anything it increases the level of excitement. You get to celebrate twice, when scoring and when it’s confirmed</p>

  <p><b>[VAR: Pierluigi Collina calls for more use of pitchside monitors]</b> Another thing to be considered (is) a sort of wrong idea of solidarity. If you belong to a team, you always try to protect your team-mates. If your team-mate made a mistake, you try to find everything to say ‘No, no, no, he was correct’. It’s a sort of friendship I would say. Referees must understand the solidarity and the friendship that they want to show is to tell their colleague ‘Be careful, you might have made a mistake’.<br /><br />It’s better that you have another chance watching the incident on a monitor, you have assessed probably wrongly,’ so that finally you can avoid a mistake. A wrong decision taken in an important match, a key decision, from our experiences in the past can really kill a referee’s career. (VAR) is a very important safety net for referees.<br /><br /><b>[Collina would not comment on specific competitions]</b> What we are trying to do is to have consistent assessment, to have uniformity, to have consistent decisions taken by video assistant referees suggesting referees to review something or not on the pitchside monitor. It might be very complicated to switch from what you are used to doing when you play domestically into a different way when you play internationally. Offside can occur anywhere in 55-60 metres of the outfield, so it’s much more complicated to have the same kind of approach goal-line technology<br /><br />We are working. VAR is only five years old. He is a young boy, who is learning and certainly will improve. I had two experiences in my life as an assistant referee - and they were two nightmares. It is more than probable that in the future we will have specialised video match officials</p>
