  <p><b>[Ajax prospect Daishawn Redan is set to snub interest from Manchester United and sign a new contract at the Dutch club]</b> My parents take care of my business. The trust I have in them is the highest, so I don’t have an agent, but I let them take care of it. The club knows what I want and that is to get in the first team. I want to be the first-choice striker of Ajax. There is a contract coming my way here and I will definitely sign it.<br /><br />If you know a club like Man United is interested, that only gives you confidence and you will do everything you can to get better. I know when I heard about the interest, I was sick that week and was in my bed. Then I saw a lot of rumours on Instagram and other media</p>

  <p><b>[Ajax youngster Daishawn Redan has hinted that a move to Manchester United could be made in the near future]</b> I hear a lot of rumours around me and I will not deny that there are clubs that are interested. Manchester United is a very nice and good club of course and I must admit that I am interested in an adventure like that.<br /><br />If you know a club like Man United is interested, that only gives you confidence and you will do everything you can to get better</p>

  <p><b>[Daishawn Redan caused when he fled Ajax’s famous youth academy to join Chelsea in 2017 suggested the Amsterdam side had lost a special talent]</b> If I play a game now, I feel like I can run for the whole game, that’s not normal. I learned a lot at Ajax, technique, tactical insight, everything actually. I look back on it with a positive feeling, but at Chelsea I can develop even further to the level I want to reach. I want to develop myself into one of the best strikers in the world.</p>
