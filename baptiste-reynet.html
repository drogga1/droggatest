  <p><b>[Dijon goalkeeper Baptiste Reynet is another looking forward to pitting himself against Neymar]</b> Even if I’m a goalkeeper and at risk of him giving me all kinds of trouble, it’s great news for Ligue 1.</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar’s €222 million transfer and Kylian Mbappe’s switch to Paris Saint-Germain are great for Ligue 1]</b> It’s very positive. We all know Neymar, he is one of the three best players in the world. We are happy that players like this are coming into our league. It highlights the division and generates more talk of Ligue 1. I thought it <b>[the Neymar deal]</b> was a very good thing, as was the fact that Mbappe stayed. It’s great for Ligue 1.<br /><br />Falcao has made me miserable a few times. Last year he scored a goal from free-kick, after the first goal of Monaco came after a free-kick from him hit the bar. This year he put three past me. He is an outstanding striker who is very skilful in front of goal. And there are of course the three Parisians,<b>[Edinson]</b> Cavani , Mbappe and Neymar, who will turn a lot of heads this year</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Balotelli was booked after complaining to the referee about racist abuse from supporters in Saturday’s 3-2 defeat to Dijon]</b> I told Mario I didn’t hear any racist chanting but he said there were some. Apparently two or three supporters provoked him.</p>
