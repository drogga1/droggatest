  <p><b>[Pavel Pardo optimistic about Mexico’s World Cup chances]</b> I think Mexico has a lot of potential. The most important thing for me is the mentality that you have to have in World Cups. It’s another level. You want to get into the fifth game, but you have to think that first you have a lot of possibilities to get into second place. Then you probably have to play against Brazil because of the draw. But I think the most important thing right now is the mind of every player on the national team. Of course the coach will have to prepare for all the games in the first phase, but the most important game is the one against Germany on June 17.<br /><br />Juan Carlos Osorio is a very meticulous coach. He prepares every detail. I think Mexico has a lot more to win than to lose. On paper, you can say against Germany you probably can lose, but a better result against Germany, a tie or you can win, you have to play with no doubts and have a lot of confidence. You have to have 100 percent of your mentality on that game and you have to play a perfect game. That means no mistakes on anything. If you have one opportunity, on that opportunity you have to score the goal because in that kind of game you have to play it with all your focus on the game, 100 percent concentration and no mistakes<br /><br />In the first game, Mexico has to prepare very well, with a good mentality, because Germany, for me, is the best team in the world in that part, the mentality. They have a winning mentality. Mexico has to prepare very, very well and they have at least seven months to start that game. It’s their most important game at the World Cup<br /><br />Then, Korea and Sweden. Every nation, every team in the World Cup, you always have one dream. That is, of course, to go to the final and be the champion. There are favorites like Germany, Brazil, France, Spain, Argentina, but when we’re talking especially about Mexico I think Mexico has good players, a good squad, most of the players are playing in Europe. There are two players playing in Germany as well. So let’s see. In the beginning it looks hard, of course. It’s not easy. You’re playing the first game against Germany. But everything is possible in soccer</p>
