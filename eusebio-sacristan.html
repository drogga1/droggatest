  <p><b>[Girona boss <a href="eusebio.html">Eusebio</a> Sacristan defended out-of-sorts <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> defender <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> as an institution after his side’s historic <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> win against <a href="real-madrid.html">Los Blancos</a> at the Santiago Bernabeu]</b> I respect the rival players a lot and someone like <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> is an institution. Portu plays on the right and generates a lot of problems, but this time he did on the left. Pere Pons was forced <b>[to come off]</b>, he was dizzy and it was a big risk to continue in the field after the blow he suffered. We were subdued and with <b>[Anthony]</b> Lozano we gained more depth, we thought we could create more problems.<br /><br /><b>[The coach was reportedly close to the sack with Girona having lost six games in a row in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> to slip towards the relegation zone, but their upset victory sees them move to 15th in the table]</b> They could have made us more goals in the first half, but in the second half we had more control. We made them less comfortable and the match was indicating that we were better. Their advantage was minimal and in the second half we were superior, we scored two goals and that’s why we deserved to win. They dominated in the first half, but being 1-0 only made us believe and we tried to take the initiative away from them, we wanted to make them run with the ball, they are three very important points, and achieving the goal depends on us. It’s a very happy day, we have won the prize for the work that is done every day. The prize did not arrive and it has arrived today. Very happy because they are three important points, we must continue working with that spirit</p>

  <p><b>[Eusebio Sacristan says <a href="adama-traore.html">Adama Traore</a> ‘ready for top <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> club’ after long journey from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> I used to tell him he had to make the right decisions. If he had a one-on-one, he had to face it with no doubt in his mind but if there were two or more defenders, he had to make the right decision, because he couldn’t beat them all the time. Making the right decision when he had the advantage, and looking for a team-mate when he didn’t<br /><br />My first memory of him is when I was told - while I was the B team coach - that there was a very young player in the Juvenil team who had incredible skills and a great future. He was giving amazing performances with his team, and the club thought he had great potential. So, we went to watch him and decided to promote him to the B team to see how he responded at a higher level. He responded very well because he was very physically powerful, which allowed him to compete with experienced professional players<br /><br />When they start so young and look like a brilliant player so soon, it looks like their development gets stopped but it doesn’t. All players need to reach a point of maturity. He is in a great moment now, but he kept improving himself and his qualities to reach his best possible level. I think he is ready for the jump to a big <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> club, but I am convinced as well that he needed to take this road, this process, to reach that level</p>
