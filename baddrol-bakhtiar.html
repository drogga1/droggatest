  <p><b>[Malaysia midfielder Baddrol Bakhtiar admitted that JDT have a strong squad]</b> During the pre-season, we tried plenty of combinations and we got positive results so I hope we can do the same for tomorrow. JDT are strong in every department. Despite the fact that they have new players, they still have plenty of national players in their squad so they are still a strong team.</p>

  <p><b>[Baddrol Bakhtiar believes that the win was due to the great teamwork among the players and he dedicated the win to Kedah’s faithful fans]</b> Before we took to the pitch, the coach told us to keep our focus and because we know coming here and to get a win was not easy. Tonight we played well as a team, and the combination that we practised since last year worked very well and this win is for all players and our faithful fans.<br /><br />We always play with short passing and fast attacking game and luckily, tonight we managed to do well in both aspects. JDT put up a good fight up until the end but we showed great determination to get the win</p>

  <p><b>[The first leg FA Cup semi-final encounter against Terengganu]</b> Terengganu are consistent this season, so we will pay extra attention to the match as we want to be in the final.</p>

  <p><b>[Baddrol Bakhtiar wants his teammates to use their FA Cup semi-final tie against Terengganu as a chance to bounce back from their previous two defeats]</b> The two defeats must serve as a wake up call to all my teammates so that we will improve and play to our real abilities like we did before. We want to bounce back.. with spirit, and the opportunity to qualify to the semi-finals of the FA Cup should boost our motivation, and we must take advantage of this opportunity to the fullest.<br /><br />I hope we will be more clinical in front of the goal, and we certainly need to be more focused and concentrate harder, as the FA Cup semi-final match will definitely be a lot closer. The chemistry shown by the forwards has given us confidence as they’ve made many attempts, although they could not convert them. My teammates have also played with more passion last Wednesday against Perak, as compared to before</p>

  <p><b>[Terengganu will square off against out-of-sorts Kedah in the first leg of their FA Cup semi-final tie]</b> I hope we will be more clinical in front of the goal, and we certainly need to be more focused and concentrate harder, as the FA Cup semi-final match will definitely be a lot closer. There are no favourites when it comes to the FA Cup. We are going on equal terms and if we can get an away goal then we should be in the driver’s seat for the return leg in Kuala Terengganu. We have been doing well and should give our Super League opponents a run for their money.</p>
