  <p><b>[NBA star Larry Nance Jr believes that Zlatan Ibrahimovic is a bigger star in world sport than basketball legend LeBron James]</b> In America, it’s LeBron and for the world, it’s Zlatan. Zlatan’s proven that he’s back from his injury. But he’s proven that he’s head and shoulders above the competition in that league.<br /><br />Each one was huge in its own regard, but I think Cristiano Ronaldo going to Juventus was probably bigger. I feel that was more of a shock than LeBron going to the Lakers<br /><br />I think it could happen more often. I think it would be a fairer way for clubs to compete and exchange players as opposed to throwing money at each other<br /><br />Messi. Ronaldo to me is a machine. He’s like a soccer robot. Everything is almost too perfect, whereas Messi has his flaws, but he’s so skilled he makes up for them. I almost think that brings a humanness to Messi compared to Ronaldo</p>

  <p><b>[Basketball star Larry Nance Jr has chosen the football players he believes could make it in the NBA]</b> Either Zlatan or Thibaut. They’re both 6’6 or 6’7. Thibaut Courtois has sent me a couple of videos of him shooting, him dunking around, so he’s talented with a basketball, but I also think Zlatan with his height would do well.<br /><br />Russell Westbrook would be a terrific soccer player. He’s got the speed, the strength, the athleticism. He’s got the size for it. He’d be a great build for a soccer player<br /><br /><b>[He is also a big fan of the USMNT]</b> I played it for about 15 years. I’m not allowed to play now, it’s basketball and basketball only for me now. But whenever I get the chance to watch, I’m all in. I think the USMNT had a rough year. In the US, we prioritise baseball, basketball and American Football compared to European countries which prioritise soccer first. We’re behind right now, but hopefully the more soccer grows in the US, the more we can start kids at a younger age and start to compete at a higher level. I can’t wait for 2026. I wanted to go this year but our season ran long so I couldn’t make it. I’m really looking forward to it and I’ll be at as many matches as I can possibly make.</p>

  <p><b>[NBA star Larry Nance Jr believes that Jose Mourinho is wasting Manchester United’s talent]</b> As a typical Chelsea fan, Jose Mourinho is not my favourite to put it nicely. He certainly has the talent at Manchester United, if he can’t put it together and figure out how to utilise all the talent they have on that roster, then that falls on his shoulders.<br /><br />Embrace your team-mates. You’re in a whole new place, a whole new city, a whole new environment. Only your team-mates know what you’re going through and only your team-mates can help you through that. For me, it was key to having really supportive team-mates. I know Morata can have a good season. He’s such a good talent. I’m just hoping under Sarri, he can flourish<br /><br /><b>[Nance flourished at Cleveland in his first season]</b> All 30 teams should be aiming to make the playoffs and win the championships. Going into this year, that’s what we would like to do, make it to the playoffs and compete for a title again. We got so close that we were close enough to almost taste it, but it got taken away from us. Any time that happens, you get another level of appreciation for it makes you want to win so much more</p>
