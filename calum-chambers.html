  <p><b>[Calum Chambers is adamant the arrival of David Luiz at Arsenal is a good thing for him]</b> That’s how it should be. There should be competition for places as it keeps players on the top of their game. He <b>[Luiz]</b> seems like a great guy. He is a great player too, we all know that. Competition is good for everyone and it will bring the best out of people. At a club like Arsenal that is how it should be<br /><br /><b>[Emery’s side coped well with the awful weather conditions on Tyneside]</b> As a defender it is always nice to get a clean sheet so we were very happy with that. I think as a team we defended well, everyone put in the effort that was needed. It was the first game of the season and we knew they were going to be at it, so we had to be at it. We had to be sharp in our minds and put everything into it, I think we did that. We ground out the clean sheet, which is very pleasing, and it was a great start<br /><br />We went into the game with a game plan. We knew what their strengths were and we worked on that in the week. We knew where they were dangerous and what their outlets were. I think we managed to nullify that and deal with it well. It was about putting what we were doing in training into the game. I think we did that<br /><br /><b>[Chambers, who insists he always thought he would come back to Arsenal, has benefitted from Laurent Koscielny’s shock exit]</b> Last season was always going to give me more experience. I played in a different position and it made me appreciate the midfield role a lot more. So as I said, it was more experience for me and something I could bring back here with me and add to my game in training every day. It was always my aim to come back to Arsenal. When I was there I did what I did when I was at Middlesbrough - I was fully focused on giving everything for that club in every game and training session. I didn’t think about the future, but before I went the plan was to go, gain experience, and come back</p>

  <p><b>[Calum Chambers admits <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> cannot keep relying on <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> to bail them out every week]</b> Of course. But when you have players like that obviously it does help as well. We know as a team, and we know as a defensive unit, that we have to be solid, that we have to shut the door and be stronger. We’re working every day in training and working on what we need to do and we’ll just keep going<br /><br /><b>[The former Southampton man made a big impact, scoring his first <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> goal in three years to make it 2-2 nine minutes from full-time. <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> netted the winner just three minutes later]</b> It was a bit of a rollercoaster of emotions for me. I felt like I needed to do something after their second goal. I said it came from me, my touch was poor, so I felt like I had to get my head right and bring the team back into it. Luckily I did that. To get a goal myself was quite nice. It is my first for a while and it is always nice to get it<br /><br /><b>[Chambers admits the players are aware that they are giving the opposition far too many opportunities on a weekly basis]</b> We recognise that and we are working on that. We are working every day at the training ground on our philosophy and the way we want to play. It was one of those where it didn’t help that we went down to 10 men. Obviously they (Villa) are going to have chances, they are going to dominate parts of the game and that happened. I think it was all about spirit, digging in deep and doing anything we could to get the result - and that’s what we did. I thought the whole team put in a shift and at the end of the day it was a good result<br /><br />Obviously it was disappointing. But I respect the manager and I respect his decisions. He spoke to me and I spoke to him. As I said, I respect his decision and I work hard in training every day to get an opportunity again and to prove myself</p>

  <p><b>[Calum Chambers has hailed the influence of <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> following the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> defender’s match-winning performance against Bournemouth]</b> David has been brilliant. He has come in and no-one in the club has a bad word to say about him. He is one of the nicest guys I have met, he talks to you, gives you advice and makes everyone feel like he is giving you his undivided attention. Obviously he was won things and I haven’t won as many things as he has so there are things I can learn from him, it is always good to have experience like that in the team. Off the pitch, he is a great guy and on the pitch he brings his qualities and is playing well at the moment<br /><br /><b>[Chambers says there is a sense within the changing room that momentum is building despite some underwhelming performances]</b> We were speaking before the <b>[Bournemouth]</b> game, about building up momentum. Our away form has been okay so we have just got to keep working hard. We have a couple of weeks <b>[now]</b> to knuckle down with the players that will be here and to keep learning what the manager wants us to do and take that onto the pitch. We have got a really strong squad, with a lot of quality players. We know we have got quality and we can see that, we have just got to keep working hard and believing in ourselves and the results will keep on coming<br /><br /><b>[And it is a role he is enjoying, although one that will soon bring added competition with the return to full fitness of Hector Bellerin]</b> It has been good, obviously I have played there before in the past. It is about taking things I learned then and bringing it into my game now, I’m literally taking every game as it comes and I’m enjoying it. I’m enjoying playing, I’m enjoying everything I can do for the team and for the boys so we will see what happens. I’m just taking it game by game and giving in 100 per cent, that is all I can do</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal defender Calum Chambers insists the ailing Gunners must continue to believe in <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a>’s footballing philosophy]</b> It was certainly a tough night, it was a new system for us today but I think there are positives to take from it. We worked hard as a team, we kept them out for a while and we had chances of our own and on another day we would have put a couple of those chances in. I think we had a bit more control and defensively we were a bit more solid.<br /><br />We knew <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> are good team and they would create chances but I think we all put in 100 per cent effort today and the difference was that they took their chances and they scored a good first goal. We’ve just got to keep believing and stay positive. I think now it is important for us to keep positive, keep believing, keep working hard and we now have a bit of time to get together and work hard on the training ground and it’s important for us to do that. I think we have to keep believing until the very end and things can change very quickly in football matches so it’s important during a game that if you go behind, you have to keep believing, keep playing and doing the things that we’ve been told to do and keep believing in the philosophy that we’re doing<br /><br /><b>[Chambers insists the mood within the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> camp is a positive one]</b> We’re all together. Everyone in that dressing room and at the club is all together. There is a good spirit in the dressing room, all the lads are together and we need to keep going, fighting and giving it all our all in every game and things will change. With the squad we’ve got and the amount of quality we have, we can turn things around</p>

  <p><b>[Calum Chambers always knew <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> would go on to become a top coach]</b> When I first came here he was one of the senior players. He helped me and gave me advice on positional play. He was a very intelligent player, you could always tell he had that side to him. I’m excited, everyone’s excited to learn his philosophy. We just need to get our identity back. I know he wants to do that. It will take time but I know he can get that out of us. The message is we’re all excited to start working with him<br /><br /><b>[Arteta travelled up to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> on the morning of the match and spoke in the changing room before kick-off]</b> He said that we put into play what he wanted from us. The message before the game was be brave, take responsibility and work hard for each other. We did that on the pitch. He said afterwards it was a good start and there’s things to work on. He was proud of the way we worked. We’re all excited to work with him, that’s the main feeling around the camp. We all showed good spirit and are excited to go in and start working with him next week<br /><br /><b>[The clean sheet at Goodison Park was <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s first in 15 games]</b> It’s a good feeling. I felt we deserved the clean sheet, everybody worked really hard as a team. Obviously we were a bit disappointed we didn’t get the win but there was a lot of good things to come out of that game. It’s a good building block for us</p>
