  <p><b>[Radja Nainggolan has admitted he despises Juventus]</b> I am one who has always been against Juventus. I hate Juve, always. At Cagliari I’d have given my balls to beat Juve - at the Juventus Stadium I always drew with Cagliari against them. They won the Scudetto against us when we were <b>[temporarily playing home games]</b> in Trieste. I hate them because they always win with a penalty or a free-kick. I came to Roma to win something against Juventus. If we don’t win the Scudetto we’ll win the Coppa Italia, I tell you that. Against Lazio in the semi-finals we’ll win both <b>[legs]</b>, trust me.</p>

Sometimes you make choices for money, other times it’s for quality of life, which is important for me. Also if I went to England I’d have to start from scratch and I’m very happy at Roma. China? Not now, but you can never rule anything out. I’d have to see at the time.<br /><br /><b>[Nainggolan has been criticised before for being a known cigarette smoker]</b> I’ve never hidden before. I know, I myself have children and I have to set an example, but it has always been important to me that people give their opinions about what someone is doing on the field, his job. I am footballer, that’s what I need to do and that’s what I love. I’m not hiding it. It is true, I cannot continue to ignore it. I am not ashamed of it</p>

I prefer to stay where I feel good. If money were my only motivation, I would have changed clubs many times and my salary would have grown, but my first priority is to live well. You need to live well and be happy playing where you are and I have both of those things here. Everything is perfect; my family is happy in Rome. There are lots of good restaurants and it’s a good place to go shopping. When friends or family come to visit, you can send them almost anywhere. I’m liked at the club and the supporters are behind me. I’ve given a lot on the field and I get a lot of respect for that. As a footballer, that’s one of the best things you can get. I grew up in Antwerp, but I became a man in Italy. As things stand, I can see myself living in Rome in later life.</p>

  <p><b>[Radja Nainggolan says he would be a liar if he claimed he was not interested in money]</b> There was a little something, nothing serious. I’d be a liar if I said money didn’t interest me, I’m 30 … But the truth is that in the past I rejected important offers, two years ago I could have gone to Chelsea and earned more, but for me there is not only the economic aspect. Let me explain, one thing is to say: ‘I’m going to have a good time in China and get the money’. There are people willing to do anything, even to wash their clothes with their hands, just to go and get all that money. Another question is if I have to stay on the same level, is it better to change city and lifestyle so often? I don’t have this thought yet. I’m fine here and that’s it..<br /><br />There was interest from them because the coach rates me and vice versa, even if you wrote a thousand stories about it … but forget it. I have always had a good relationship with Spalletti, he put me in the best condition to express myself. But, in the end, in the summer there was no chance that I would leave Roma. It’s not that I didn’t want to go there. There was interest but nothing concrete. There was no offer, yet it was claimed ‘Spalletti’s bringing Nainggolan, Strootman etc with him’. It was mostly paper talk.</p>

It’s not that they have more quality than Real Madrid or Bayern, but they put a lot of hard work in and have nothing to lose. Real and Bayern might’ve underestimated Roma, but Liverpool are warriors, a bit like us.<br /><br />I spoke to Salah and he couldn’t believe we’d beaten Barcelona either! He was joking on Instagram that we’ll never hear the end of Kostas Manolas saying he scored the winning goal.<br /><br />It’ll be nice to see Momo again, we had a good rapport. He’s a good guy, sweet and respectful, as well as being an excellent player. I am not surprised by his success at Liverpool, as he always had the quality. The only difference now is perhaps he’s got more opportunities and also learned to keep a cool head in front of goal. I’m a fan of his</p>

  <p><b>[Nainggolan reveals how British weather cost Chelsea possible transfer]</b> My focus is Roma. People seem to have written something about me every day for the past 10 years, but I’m still in here. Let them talk. I have a very good life here. I have everything I need. My family live well here, so everything is on a good level for me. Chelsea? Yes, that was something. It wasn’t done, but they were interested in me. Last season, when they won the Premier League, it was the beginning of that season. But at the end of the day, the choice wasn’t that difficult for me. I like English football, I love to watch the English games too, but I’m almost 30 now. Starting over again? It’s difficult even to think about that. And I hate the rain. We were in Liverpool two days and it didn’t stop raining. It was cold too. You see the difference to here?.<br /><br />I didn’t stay here because I knew we’d get to the Champions League semi-final, but because I feel that winning here would be unforgettable. That’s the way I am - I always prefer to go for the tougher route. I’ll be here for years to come. I don’t like the idea of leaving a place where I’m happy - that’s just the way I am</p>

It’s so incomprehensible that I can already laugh at it. I’ve had enough, my farewell with the Red Devils is fixed, I’m not going to keep fighting. I had already planned in advance to stop if I was not allowed to join the World Cup squad.

I said that if I don’t go to the World Cup, I’ll quit, and I’m a man of my word. I play my football here <b>[at Inter]</b>, with lots of love for what I do, but I have a different life outside of here. If they change the coach tomorrow and he says: ‘Come on, come on’ - it’s still no. Because when I make up my mind, I stick to it. It’s not like I say I’m not interested while this coach is in charge - for me, when I say it’s over, it’s over because I’ve thought it through well. Each time there’s an international break now, I get four or five days off and I’m happy as I can concentrate on Inter and other things. It was a great experience, I had a great European Championship and that’s enough. They were great experiences on a personal level. I’m a fan of my national team-mates - I like them all and have a great relationship with all of the players, it’s just there are some things I cannot accept, some decisions made about me.<br /><br />I was really, really disappointed with the fact that I’d played a great European Championship and then I was discarded for nothing. I see things differently: in Belgium, there were players who were not playing at club level and they were getting called up. I was playing 50 games and was still being left out. I was never demanding that I had to play, I just deserved to be there in place of some other players. Then there were the excuses, but they were all pathetic. Why was I playing 50 games for Roma if I was leading the same life <b>[I was being criticised for]</b>? I think it’s wrong when people say things without speaking to me first. You’ve got to say things to my face, we can have a talk and then we shake hands and you don’t call me up again but I’ve got more respect for you than somebody who doesn’t do that</p>

I am the kind of person who above all needs to live well and be at a club which plays to win, or where I am happy with my life. There are lots of components – lots to evaluate. I stayed in Italy, with Roma, because I wanted to end in the best way possible There was Manchester too. There were many things that I was not interested in at all. Of course you are flattered by the interest, but this is how it is. In Italy, you live really well – I like the culture and way of life here. Chelsea offered me more money and they are a big club, yes.<br /><br />I think if you want a spectacle, you need to watch English football. In terms of the fans, the stadiums being full, the pitches being perfect – and it seems like the action is in fast-forward. The rhythm is so high, but it’s not as tactical as it is in Italy. If you were to ask me which league I’d like to play in, maybe I’d say England for the spectacle, but I’ve been here for so long now that I’m perfectly happy here and I don’t need to change anything<br /><br /><b>[The Belgian outlined his belief that Inter Milan was on the path to great success]</b> I’ve come to a club who are looking to build something big, so I think I’m in the right place</p>

I have a strong bond with my twin sister, she is homosexual and happy and that is enough for me<br /><br />I am very proud of my origins even if they did not allow me to have an easy life.

  <p><b>[Radja Nainggolan admits he took a degree of satisfaction from scoring the goal that earned <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> a 1-1 draw at Inter after being ‘treated like a toy’ by his parent club]</b> I have a lot of respect for the Inter fans and for my former team-mates. But I felt treated like a toy. On one hand I’m happy for the goal, on the other I’m not as I wish my ex-team-mates the best.<br /><br />Who knows <b>[what will happen in the future]</b>. I’m concentrating on each game as it comes. I’m having fun, I have some excellent team-mates and we’re playing for something special.</p>

  <p><b>[Exiled Inter star Nainggolan says ‘door is always open’ for Roma return]</b> I would go back to Roma. If the conditions are right, I would go back. The door is always open. I lived beautiful years there, where they love me, where I always gave everything.<br /><br />It was my choice to go to Inter. They had <a href="luciano-spalletti.html">Spalletti</a>, with whom I had a good time at Roma. My choice was easy. <a href="luciano-spalletti.html">Spalletti</a>, for me, is the best coach I have ever had. But if you asked me if I was happier to have arrived at Inter or sadder to have left Roma, I would have told you the latter. Maybe I wasn’t myself, maybe a little because of guilt or maybe other things. I can’t explain it. I could give more. Then Inter dumped me, even though I went to China on tour. I already knew that I would not play the friendlies, but I left the same.</p>
