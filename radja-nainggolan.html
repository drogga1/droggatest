  <p><b>[Radja Nainggolan speaks about his team-mate <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a>’s qualities]</b> I think he has the capacity to win it because, for me, he is a very talented player, a very good player, a decisive player. He makes a difference on the pitch, but the only difference between him and, let’s say, <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, is that they score much more than him. So, I think that is the most important thing and it’s the only difference between them, because for me <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a> is, let’s say, is in world’s top five</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a> star Radja Nainggolan has dismissed reports he could be ready to leave <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a> after just a single season]</b> I am not talking about the transfer market, I have always been on a team for many years and it would be strange if I left Inter after just one season. I have a three-year contract so I am calm. Inter are a club that wanted me and they are trying to grow. I would like to grow with them, let’s see how it goes. I have always been happy where I have been.<br /><br /><b>[Nainggolan is looking forward to working under <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a>]</b> In my career I have had many good coaches and many good people, but also less talented people and less good coaches. I am someone who wants to win, so the club obviously decided to change the manager to improve. The management told me all about how good <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> is</p>

  <p><b>[Nainggolan leaves Inter on <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> loan]</b> I am happy, there is great enthusiasm. I always wanted to return but I did not think the return would come this year, but I am happy that is has happened. It was not hard to choose <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> although I did have other offers<br /><br />I spoke with some other managers but it was right to come back here and I must first thank the president <b>[Tomasso Giulini]</b>. After our first call, he completely convinced me right away, he made promises and he has kept them. sThings have gone the way I would have liked them to have gone and it was easy to reach an agreement</p>

  <p><b>[Nainggolan reveals reason for snubbing <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> &amp; opens Inter door for <a href="nicolo-barella.html">Barella</a>]</b> The matches against <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> have always been special to me, because in the past they’ve tried to sign me but nothing ever happened. This is because I’d rather challenge the ‘best teams’ and try to win against them. This has always been my philosophy<br /><br />The desire to win, even if that sounds strange as I’ve never won anything. I’ve always wanted to win something. And that is something that has been missing for a while at Inter too.<br /><br />So winning a trophy here would mean a lot to the whole fanbase. They’ve been waiting a long time for it, as they’ve had that period where they were used to winning.<br /><br />Therefore we need to get back to being that team that is talked about worldwide, which Inter haven’t been for a bit now<br /><br /><b>[Former <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> man Nainggolan is a big fan of a 22-year-old following in his footsteps and admits to being able to see some of himself in <a href="nicolo-barella.html">Barella</a>’s game]</b> Yes, especially in the way he plays, because he’s the type of player who always gives everything he has on the pitch. He might not make a difference with goals or assists, but he’s a vital player for a team, someone who helps the others elevate their game. That type of player might draw less attention to himself, but is vital to the success of the team<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether the pair could play in the same team]</b> Why not? Playing with great players is always nice. I joined Inter and it’s been nice to play alongside some great players. As all the players who were in Serie B before will tell you: ‘When you start playing for a better team, everything becomes easier.’ Which is true, because the team is stronger and your team-mates as well. I think that with <a href="nicolo-barella.html">Barella</a>, it could be a great ‘battle’, even with both on the same side</p>

  <p><b>[Radja Nainggolan admits he took a degree of satisfaction from scoring the goal that earned <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> a 1-1 draw at Inter after being ‘treated like a toy’ by his parent club]</b> I have a lot of respect for the Inter fans and for my former team-mates. But I felt treated like a toy. On one hand I’m happy for the goal, on the other I’m not as I wish my ex-team-mates the best.<br /><br />Who knows <b>[what will happen in the future]</b>. I’m concentrating on each game as it comes. I’m having fun, I have some excellent team-mates and we’re playing for something special.</p>

  <p><b>[Exiled Inter star Nainggolan says ‘door is always open’ for Roma return]</b> I would go back to Roma. If the conditions are right, I would go back. The door is always open. I lived beautiful years there, where they love me, where I always gave everything.<br /><br />It was my choice to go to Inter. They had <a href="luciano-spalletti.html">Spalletti</a>, with whom I had a good time at Roma. My choice was easy. <a href="luciano-spalletti.html">Spalletti</a>, for me, is the best coach I have ever had. But if you asked me if I was happier to have arrived at Inter or sadder to have left Roma, I would have told you the latter. Maybe I wasn’t myself, maybe a little because of guilt or maybe other things. I can’t explain it. I could give more. Then Inter dumped me, even though I went to China on tour. I already knew that I would not play the friendlies, but I left the same.</p>
