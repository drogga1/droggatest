  <p><b>[Zinedine Zidane on <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>]</b> He’s a player that I really thought a lot of, I had a lot of time for him and rated him. I can’t say that about everyone. Why did I like him so much? Perhaps there was something about him that reminded me a little bit of myself. He made a lot of noise out there on the field but was quiet off it, meaning that he was someone down to earth and grounded away from the game who just said what needed to be said. He preferred to do his talking on the field, using his voice, his combative spirit and above all his ability on the ball that could make the difference in a game. I would have really liked to have played alongside him. But he has always remained loyal to his own club, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, the club of his heart. That also is another characteristic that is particular to him, I don’t think there are too many players who have spent their entire career playing for just one club. That is a great strength of his too. It was never possible, because of course he stayed with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, but I would have loved to play with a guy like him. It’s simply that he’s one of the few players, and I must come back to his combative spirit here, who is a superb technician, who is great on the ball, but who mixed in those fighting qualities with everything he did</p>

  <p><b>[Zinedine Zidane believes only a lack of a winning mentality prevented the England teams he faced from winning a major tournament]</b> The mental factor can play a big part in football. Spain couldn’t make it further than the quarter-finals for years; when they did manage to they went and dominated football in a way that hadn’t been done before. Some of those England teams I played against with players like Scholes, Gerrard and Beckham were more than capable of winning tournaments, so maybe mentality played a part<br /><br /><b>[Harry]</b> Kane and <b>[Raheem]</b> Sterling are two exciting players for England. This summer in France will be a real opportunity for the rest of Europe to see how good they are. I don’t think they are favourites but they still have some very good players.

It’s a very important victory for us after a difficult few days. It was a very complete match against a very complicated team to face. It was very important for us to have kept a clean sheet. In addition to that, results have favoured us. We must thank the Bernabeu. Sometimes the whistles affect us, but today they were very good and together we’ve achieved something important. We went to press at the start of the game, but we made a bit of a mess of it. I wasn’t happy, so in the second half we changed. We dropped a little deeper and came out more on the counterattack. Eusebio is right, sometimes possession isnt everything.<br /><br />The first goal, for example, we worked on it a lot, with Karim, Cristiano and Kovacic coming from behind. This makes me happy. It was a fair scoreline, we didn’t give many chances away and that’s very important. Defensively we were very solid. Although in the first half we dealt with the pressure poorly, we rectified it in the second and it is what it is. It’s motivating, of course, when you see your opponents drop points, they make you want to do better<br /><br />Ronaldo?

But I’m angry with the robbery accusations. People are upset with our achievements. There are people who are anti-Real Madrid. But nobody is going to change the history of the biggest club in the world. They can say or write what they want. It’s not normal, all this debate around the penalty. It’s all too much.<br /><br />Well, everybody can defend their business. But you can’t talk about a robbery. There’s a kind of negative obsession with us. We can’t be the best after the Juventus home game and then be the ones who robbed them<br /><br />Bayern are better this season. This season it will be harder than ever against them. James Rodriguez will come with an extra motivation. He’s having a great season. Our chances of knocking out Bayern is 50/50</p>

  <p><b>[Confirmation of <a href="nacho-fernandez.html">Nacho Fernandez</a>’s injury came after Zinedine Zidane’s Madrid came from two goals down to salvage a draw against the Belgian visitors]</b> The truth is that we produced a poor first-half display, we made a really bad start in the first five minutes and they made life difficult for us straightaway. We weren’t in control of any aspect of the game and the second half was a different story and we changed the complexion of the game. What I take away with me is the reaction from the players because they’re the ones who changed the game. That’s what I take away with me, that and the point. The opposition can make life difficult for you. We knew all about the three quick players they had up top, but the problem is that when they score, that gives them a boost. It was the first time that they’d played here and they were charging around from corner to corner and up and down. In football you’ve got to be focused from the first whistle and we didn’t get off to a good start. In the second half everything changed, we showed some heart, commitment and played in the opposition’s half. I don’t think that Ruud Vormer’s dismissal changed things, I don’t know how long they played with 10 men for, it was eight or 10 minutes, no more than that</p>

When he is fit we want him to come back and be in good shape. It is a shame. He is not happy because he wants to be training with the side</p>

I was so excited and shocked that I didn’t even want to tell my friends from the neighbourhood where I was going. When I came back home, my friends saw me and said, ‘Kylian, where were you last week?’. I said, ‘I was in London with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.’ They said, ‘Pfff, no it’s impossible.’ I said, ‘No, I swear, I even met Drogba’. They said, ‘Pfff, you’re lying. <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> doesn’t meet kids from Bondy. It is not possible!’<br /><br />Right before my 14th birthday, I got an incredible surprise. My father received a call from someone at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, inviting me to come to Spain for a training session over the holiday break. It was a shock, because they actually told my father, ‘Zidane would like to see your son.’ At the time, Zizou was the sporting director. Of course, I was over the moon. I was desperate to go. But it was not so simple, actually, because scouts were starting to come to our matches (Mbappe’s local team AS Bondy), and I was getting some attention from the media.<br /><br />When you’re 13 years old, you don’t know how to handle it. There was a lot of pressure, and my family wanted to protect me. But it was actually my 14th birthday that week, and what I didn’t know is that my parents were organising everything with the club so that they could take me to Madrid as a present. Quite a surprise for me! And believe it or not, we didn’t tell anyone where we were going. I didn’t even tell my closest friends, because I was too nervous. If things didn’t go well, I didn’t want to come back to my neighbourhood and disappoint them.<br /><br />I will never forget the moment that we arrived at the training centre from the airport. Zidane met us in the parking lot by his car, and it was a really nice car, of course. We said ‘hello’, and then he offered to drive me over to the field for training. He was pointing at the front seat, like, ‘Go on, get in.’ But I just froze and I asked, ‘Should I take off my shoes?’ Hahaha! I don’t know why I said that. But it was Zizou’s car! He thought that was really funny. He said, ‘Of course not, come on, get in.’<br /><br />He drove me to the training pitch, and I was just thinking to myself, I am in Zizou’s car. I am Kylian from Bondy. This is not real. I must still be sleeping on the airplane. Sometimes, even when you are really living something, it feels like a dream</p>

He <b>[<a href="vinicius-junior.html">Vinicius</a>]</b> is 19 years old, he must learn many things safely, tactically, et cetera, but he’s a boy who wants to work and that’s what he’s doing. He did great the other day, not just offensively. The good thing is that we have a very good player for the present and the future of Real Madrid</p>

  <p><b>[Zidane wants <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Ramos</a> to retire at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> Sergio belongs here as a player. He’s been here for years and he should retire here. It’s what I think and I’ll stand by it<br /><br />We need to have the ball. The setup isn’t the most important thing for me, it’s more about what we do on the pitch with the ball. We can do better, but I’m satisfied with what I saw and what these players are doing is not at all easy. That’s four wins in a row, but the standout feature for us today was our defensive solidity all round. We can get better going forward and that’s what we’ll try to do.<br /><br />We were a bit tired by the end today but that’s not just <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, the same goes for all the teams. It’s a strange situation, we’re back training after 60 days and with the heat and everything. But we have to keep going and all we can do is be more alert with the players, we want to keep moving forward strong. We’re all more or less in the same boat. The important thing is that it’s four wins for us, but that’s a credit to the players. We’re training well and we always want more. The players’ attitude has been phenomenal, so too has that of the players who are not playing as much, and this is what makes the difference in the dressing room. We have seven finals left, the players have to recover well and continue with what we are doing, we haven’t won anything<br /><br /><b>[<a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>, despite working hard, largely failed to impress against relegation-threatened Mallorca]</b> We’re happy with what we’re doing and Gareth is an important player, he’s always shown that. The important thing is to play like we’re playing. The players change, but the important thing is that the dynamic doesn’t change. As always, there are players who are going to have more minutes, but that has been the case all along and it’s not going to change.</p>

  <p><b>[When asked if he thought <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Ramos</a> would become a club icon when he played alongside the centre-back]</b> It was clear that he could achieve what he is achieving, because he already had quality and above all personality. He always wanted to win and make history in this club. I am not surprised by what Sergio is doing. We are lucky to have him in Madrid and I hope that continues until the end of his career. I am not going to coach another 20 years, I am going to retire sooner. Anything can happen<br /><br />I was a better footballer than a coach, but there were better footballers than me as well, although I’m happy with what I’ve done. I’m not going to coach for 20 years, I don’t know how many. I don’t plan anything, what encourages me is the day-to-day. Then I will do other things. In my head I have always been a footballer, I had 18 or 19 years as a player and when I was asked if I was going to coach, I would say no. In the end I was, but it’s demanding - I don’t think I’ll be here for another 20 years<br /><br /><b>[he was eager to assure fans that he is in no rush to leave, adamant he is still happy]</b> No one should interpret what I say. The reality is I’m managing the best club in the world and I’m happy, regardless of what happens here. But I know that when we lose the press will be out, the knives will be out, that won’t change. We are winning now, but like I said, today we’ve yet to win the title. We must continue working, training hard. Everyone is going in same direction. We cannot control external matters, only what we can control. We shouldn’t worry about what goes on outside <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and I think my future is the least of concerns at the moment</p>

You can, you have the right to ask, but everyone here is united. We all think the same way, Gareth, James (Rodriguez), everyone here. We all want the same thing.</p>

I am not talking about what’s going to happen next season or the following year. I have a contract, I am happy here, and I am happy with what I am doing but you never know what will happen in football. That’s why I feel so relaxed with my future because in the world of football things could change overnight. I don’t know what’s going to happen in the future.

The first leg was already complicated, so it is going to be pretty much the same in the second leg. It doesn’t change what we want to do. We are going to fight until the last minute, the last second of the tie, don’t have doubts about it. Then, nobody knows how it will end</p>
