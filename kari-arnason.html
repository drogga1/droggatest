  <p><b>[Ronaldo’s Portugal freeze as Iceland start melting hearts at Euro 2016]</b> I think we were a bit unlucky not to steal the win at the end with Finbogason’s chance. The second half played into our hands. We didn’t have the ball much, obviously, but we were solid and we can always catch people on the counter. There’s not many people who want to play against our forwards in the form they were in today.<br /><br /><b>[On Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> We didn’t pay any extra attention to him. Obviously everyone knows how good he is so you have to know where he is at every given moment but there was nothing in our game plan to specifically close him down. We just knew we had to be close to him at every given moment and and it worked perfectly</p>

  <p><b>[Iceland hero Kari Arnason hit back at sore loser Cristiano Ronaldo after the Portugal captain complained that their Group F opponents had a small mentality following their 1-1 draw at Euro 2016]</b> He’s just a sore loser. He didn’t want to lose the game. What does he expect - for us to play like Barcelona against him? He fannies about and dives around. Obviously we were the underdog, we played like the underdog and we were unlucky not to win the game<br /><br />It’s amazing. I mean we knew we could do it. I think we were a bit unlucky not to steal the win at the end with <b>[Alfred]</b> Finnbogason’s chance. The second half played into our hands. We didn’t have the ball much, obviously, but we were solid and we can always catch people on the counter. There’s not many people who want to play against our forwards in the form they were in today</p>
