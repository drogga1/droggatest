<blockquote>
  <p>[Transfer bargain Balotelli in the best form of his career] He is exceptional on the field. He is changing his style of football and improving. But I don’t know if he’ll remain with us next season, as it depends on results.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="2018-02-11-retrieve">2018 02 11 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>[Mario Balotelli was booked after complaining to the referee about racist abuse from supporters in Saturday’s 3-2 defeat to Dijon] It’s a scandal. It’s been four consecutive games that we have the feeling of playing at 11 against 12. The differences of officiating from one match to the other are incomprehensible.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="2018-03-15-retrieve">2018 03 15 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>[Mario Balotelli might be out of contract at the end of the season but he will not leave Nice for free] It will be difficult to keep him. He has had two good seasons with us and has matured between the first and second. He’s a player who certainly wants to move on. The probability is more towards a departure than him staying, but we’ve not opened talks with Mario or his agent yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="2018-03-18-retrieve">2018 03 18 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>[On Mario Balotelli and Hatem Ben Arfa] It’s likely that Mario will go to explore other horizons. I don’t think it’s possible. Hatem had a great story with us, and our fans still love Ben Arfa. We tried to sign him at the end of the last transfer market. It didn’t happen and I understand his reasons.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="2018-09-15-retrieve">2018 09 15 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>[On Mario Balotelli] Mario will have a great season because we’ll put him in the best condition and because he’s a great player. However, Nice don’t have the habit of treating certain players differently</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="2018-12-06-retrieve">2018 12 06 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>[Mario Balotelli is unlikely to return to Nice next season as the club is not prepared to offer him a contract extension] Mario, for us, was leaving [last summer] so he missed his preparation. I think every player that misses his preparation suffers for the first part of the season. Now he has recovered his physical aptitude, but he’s not in luck (in front of goal). So the poor guy is frustrated. But Mario didn’t lose his talent (overnight). The day one goes in, then the goals will keep piling up. Let’s not have any regret.<br /><br />An extension? No I think it will be over</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="2019-03-07-retrieve">2019 03 07 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>[On Hatem Ben Arfa] It’s a gamble for us and for him. He is not expected to lead us as a messiah but as an element that will integrate into our squad.</p>
