  <p><b>[Nice president Jean-Pierre Rivere insists the club have no regrets at having snapped up Mario Balotelli last summer]</b> There are periods like this in the life of any player. He made a very good start to the season. At the moment things are not as good but I hope he will soon be back to the Mario that we saw at the beginning of the season. Overall we are very happy. He is in a good frame of mind and we do not regret having Mario with us.</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Balotelli wants to stay with Nice]</b> I will only say two or three things on Mario. The first is that the player wants to stay in Nice. Afterwards, he’s ready to make financial efforts to continue to work with us.</p>

  <p><b>[What next for Balotelli as Nice admit they cannot afford him?]</b> Without Europe, it’ll be difficult to keep hold of Balotelli. He is exceptional on the field, he is changing his style of football and improving. I don’t know if he’ll remain with us next season, as it depends on results. Balotelli commands a salary of a certain level and we cannot afford that without European competition, even if we’ll do everything we can to keep him.</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Balotelli was booked after complaining to the referee about racist abuse from supporters in Saturday’s 3-2 defeat to Dijon]</b> It’s a scandal. It’s been four consecutive games that we have the feeling of playing at 11 against 12. The differences of officiating from one match to the other are incomprehensible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Mario Balotelli might be out of contract at the end of the season but he will not leave Nice for free]</b> It will be difficult to keep him. He has had two good seasons with us and has matured between the first and second. He’s a player who certainly wants to move on. The probability is more towards a departure than him staying, but we’ve not opened talks with Mario or his agent yet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On Mario Balotelli and Hatem Ben Arfa]</b> It’s likely that Mario will go to explore other horizons. I don’t think it’s possible. Hatem had a great story with us, and our fans still love Ben Arfa. We tried to sign him at the end of the last transfer market. It didn’t happen and I understand his reasons.</p>

  <p><b>[On Mario Balotelli]</b> Mario will have a great season because we’ll put him in the best condition and because he’s a great player. However, Nice don’t have the habit of treating certain players differently</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Mario Balotelli is unlikely to return to Nice next season as the club is not prepared to offer him a contract extension]</b> Mario, for us, was leaving <b>[last summer]</b> so he missed his preparation. I think every player that misses his preparation suffers for the first part of the season. Now he has recovered his physical aptitude, but he’s not in luck (in front of goal). So the poor guy is frustrated. But Mario didn’t lose his talent (overnight). The day one goes in, then the goals will keep piling up. Let’s not have any regret.<br /><br />An extension? No I think it will be over</p>

  <p><b>[On Hatem Ben Arfa]</b> It’s a gamble for us and for him. He is not expected to lead us as a messiah but as an element that will integrate into our squad.</p>
