  <p><b>[How much do 2018 World Cup Panini stickers cost?]</b> I can still recall the joy of finally completing my first Panini album as a young boy for the 1982 World Cup in Spain. I must have used an awful lot of pocket money to do this, as well as having generous grandparents handing over bundles of packets of stickers, coupled with tense negotiations of swapping duplicates with friends in the school playground. Filling an album has become progressively more expensive over the years since then, not just because there are typically more teams competing now, but because Panini have become more creative about allocating spaces.</p>

  <p><b>[Panini World Cup stickers: How much will it cost to fill Russia 2018 album?]</b> The first sticker you buy is absolutely guaranteed not to be a duplicate. The second sticker you get has a 681/682 <b>[99.85 per cent]</b> chance of being a new sticker. The third sticker you get has a 680/682 <b>[99.7%]</b> chance of being a new sticker, and so on. What is interesting is that to collect just the last 19 stickers for the book, you would still be required to buy 483 packets of stickers, or half the total number of expected packets. Put another way, you are only halfway through when you have just 19 stickers left to collect.</p>

  <p><b>[How to fill your Panini World Cup 2018 book without spending a fortune]</b> If you have difficulty swapping, you can send off to Panini for your missing stickers. The theoretical cost calculated by the academics assumes that the collector is in a bubble with no one to swap with or no access to the internet to send off to our missing stickers service.</p>
