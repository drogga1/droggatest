He has a concept of football that could have left something permanent and sustainable if we had continued to work with him. I think he failed because he neglected that - at the expense of the attractiveness of the game. Titles are derived from a stable defence. He looks like a man who is willing to incorporate little of others’ viewpoints in his decisions. Thus the problems arose with <a href="uli-hoeness.html">Uli Hoeness</a>.

We have the highest average attendance in Europe, superb stadiums and soon will have a fourth Champions League place. But we do not play the most successful football.

  <p><b>[Oliver Kahn is less complimentary of the Bayern coach]</b> <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> has definitely not reinvented football. He clearly has two major qualities. For starters, he can analyse a game incredibly well. Plus he is capable of making changes during a game that can be decisive. However, coaches should also praise their players every now and then. You cannot be critical of your players all the time after a successful game. At some stage, the players will not take it seriously any more</p>

For me, in 2006, after the World Cup third-place playoff match, it was very clear that it was time to leave the national team.

I would not overreact to what happened. <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a>’s career is not rated on this red card or because he did not win the Champions League.

I didn’t mind that though. For me it was a challenge and also what drove me on.

Ter Stegen is within his rights to talk about wanting to play, but I currently see no reason to change goalkeepers<br /><br /><b>[Kahn said of Alexander Nubel]</b> His development has been very fast and impressive. Not only has he delivered top performances at Schalke, but he is already now captain at the age of 23. I think it’s important at a young age to learn what it means to take on that sort of responsibility, and to both maintain performances and take on the captaincy is a real challenge for a young player. He has the quality and perspective, but at the moment we have an absolutely top-class goalkeeper with the experienced <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Manuel Neuer</a>, and with <a href="marc-andre-ter-stegen.html">Marc-Andre ter Stegen</a> also a quality goalkeeper who performs excellently at Barcelona</p>
