  <p><b>[Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson can be considered to have topped Bayern Munich star Manuel Neuer in the global pecking order]</b> At the moment it’s Alisson. He showed at the World Cup that he is a world-class keeper. Neuer did not manage to play as good as he did before since returning from his injury. I think two things broke his rhythm a little bit: the early exit from the World Cup and his injury. It is not easy when you know as a player: ‘If something happens to my foot again that might be it for my career’. Those are psychological aspects that play a role. He must find perfect confidence in his body and then he will find his old level again soon.<br /><br />For FC Bayern this is absolutely perfect. This is what they need. They want to challenge the best and in Bundesliga they have suffered enough over the last months. Bayern always has the quality to win the Champions League. Nevertheless Jurgen Klopp reached the final with Liverpool last season. They have many good and quick players for Klopp’s system with high pressing and quick transition. It is no coincidence they’re leaders in the Premier League. That is one of the toughest opponents for Bayern<br /><br />But to win the Champions League you need more than just a squad that is worth 1.5 billion. You need to have that experience it takes to win this trophy in the end. And the players must be in their best shape when it is the most important. We have seen it with Bayern under Pep Guardiola - they played fantastic football, but in the semi-finals it was over. Similar to PSG. If they learned from it, they should be ready<br /><br />And Juventus. A very strong team in defence with many players that make you uncomfortable to play against. And they have <b>[Cristiano]</b> Ronaldo, who brought a special atmosphere to this club. His presence alone lifts the other players. Of course we have to mention Barcelona. I don’t think Real Madrid can do it again. If they win it for the fourth time in a row I’d be speechless. Bayern has proved they are capable of anything in the Champions League. But of course that depends now on the matches against Liverpool</p>

He could have missed out on a lot - the World Cup with Italy or the events in Madrid on Wednesday, for example - if he was not driven by ever new records and also the dream of necessarily winning the Champions League. If you can not make that step into retirement in time, then it will hurt someday. Philipp Lahm, for example, has made the jump very well. For me, in 2006, after the World Cup third-place playoff match, it was very clear that it was time to leave the national team. And in 2008 I could have hung on for another two or three years, but for what? At some point, it’s time to decide to jump. I would not overreact to what happened. Buffon’s career is not rated on this red card or because he did not win the Champions League. He was a world champion and world-class goalkeeper. These are the things that count.</p>

  <p><b>[Germany legend Oliver Kahn has highlighted England’s Jordan Pickford as one of the standout goalkeepers of the World Cup]</b> The young Englishman, Jordan Pickford plays is the closest to a goalkeeper, like I described him after the final. In addition to his strong reflexes, I especially noticed his excellent opening. In the semi-final against Croatia he played fewer passes than his counterpart Danijel Subasic, but was more than twice as often adapted by his teammates and used as a back-up defender. Pickford can use both feet and despite his lack of experience, for a long time he has been the first safe No.1 in the England goal. He also proves with his 1.85 metre height that the size of a goalkeeper only plays a minor role. But also for Pickford, as happens with so many goalkeepers, he is not used in the best way! The improved footwork of goalkeepers over the last 25 years has almost no influence on the game, unless they are also used accordingly as a goalkeeper and still get more involved in their team’s possession. In my view, the involvement of the player who is currently least integrated into the game plan, but could be the most obvious and logical option to make a variety of game situations superior and create a clear advantage. Here I see the greatest potential.<br /><br />Hugo Lloris is one of the best keepers in the world on the line and convinces with an excellent presence and a courageous, offensive positional play. Thibaut Courtois is exceptionally strong in one-on-one and control. Danijel Subasic was able to build his self-confidence by the many penalties he saved, show experience and radiate enormous security</p>

  <p><b>[Oliver Kahn believes Niko Kovac can be satisfied with the job he has done as Bayern Munich head coach]</b> Kovac got into a very difficult situation. Some players like Robben and Ribery were already at a certain age. Then there was a catastrophic World Cup in Russia with the German preliminary round knockout, after which no national player had the desire for football. There were also injuries and another coach. Such a situation is not easy to handle. The fact that Kovac has managed to become German champion and can also win the DFB Pokal, that is - if you can see the net result - anything but bad<br /><br />He’s <b>[Robben]</b> a Bayern legend. He has scored many important goals and played a large part in the fact that Bayern Munich has managed to achieve something unique, namely to win the championship seven times in a row. And of course in 2013 the Champions League as well as countless other titles. He <b>[Ribery]</b> basically has exactly the same qualities as Robben. Maybe a bit more playful, but technically a bit better. I think the two will be missed by Bayern. Not only their quality, but also as characters<br /><br />The same goes for Coman. If you always have two top players such as Robben and Ribery in front of you, sometimes it’s not so easy to establish yourself in their slipstream. With both now stopping, Gnabry and Coman feel more responsibility. This can lead them to take another step forward</p>

Of course, like other <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> players, <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> is a good player who can strengthen any team. We will discuss everything at the right time. He is a great talent with enormous characteristics. <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> have a very, very good player there<br /><br />I don’t like to talk about players who are under contract to other clubs. I can say that <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> has a high quality but in the end he also suits <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> very, very well. He is a great talent and has enormous qualities. That’s why you simply have to acknowledge that <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> has a very good player there.<br /><br />It bleeds your heart that there are no spectators for such a game. It is very unusual, but it is the case. The team that best accepts this will have advantages</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> director Oliver Kahn ‘sceptical’ about <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> transfer talk amid <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> and Sane rumours]</b> At the moment there are completely different things to be managed. If the market starts up at all, I’m rather sceptical. We’re looking at everything at the moment, like many European clubs. I have not found that the clubs are ready to make large transfers<br /><br /><b>[Kahn added on <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>’s interest in <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> and Sane]</b> Of course <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> is a top talent, a great player, but that doesn’t mean that <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> are interested in all these good players. He has an ongoing contract until 2022. Sane has an injury behind him, trying to find a connection bit by bit. I think it’s difficult today to talk about players who have a valid employment contract.<br /><br />We are in discussion with all players, whether it is Thiago or <a href="david-alaba.html">Alaba</a>. <a href="david-alaba.html">Alaba</a> has been developing, especially in the past few months, as a boss. As he leads the team loudly, we are all very, very happy with him. <a href="david-alaba.html">Alaba</a> has been playing at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> for a very, very long time. Thiago is also in the 7th year. It is clear that they sometimes worry, but I think, as <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, we have very, very good arguments, if you look at it in a European context, that the players know what they have with us</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>’s signing of <a href="alexander-nubel.html">Nubel</a> defended by Kahn as he denies keeper will be loaned out]</b> It was a sensible decision at the time. It is a path he is taking - to accept the situation with <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Manuel Neuer</a> and to line up behind <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Manuel Neuer</a> and gradually become number one<br /><br />Nobody thinks about a loan here, we are all happy that Alex comes to us. There is nothing better than having two excellent goalkeepers.<br /><br /><b>[Kahn added on <a href="alexander-nubel.html">Nubel</a>’s choice to swap guaranteed football at Schalke for a place among <a href="hansi-flick.html">Hansi Flick</a>’s substitutes]</b> To judge him at the present time is very, very early. <a href="alexander-nubel.html">Nubel</a> should first arrive in Munich and acclimatise. Everything else will be seen then. It is anything but an easy situation for the boy</p>

  <p><b>[club legend Oliver Kahn has warned <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> must be careful when it comes to making a move for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> winger <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a> this summer]</b> He still has a year contract with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, and there is nothing more to say about it now. We will then talk about transfers, about player commitments, if they have actually taken place. Possibly also in the next season, I think it is a time when you have to act very carefully, especially economically<br /><br />Of course, a competition like the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> lives very much for the tension, especially the tension around the championship title, but we can’t go and say: ‘yes, we’ll play a little bit worse now’. Of course, the competition is also required to make the best of their means. There have actually been chances for the competition to attack and knock us off the throne but this team has an incredible mentality, an incredible will. They were absolutely deserved champions</p>
