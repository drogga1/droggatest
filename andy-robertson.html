My God, he’s been unbelievable this season. <b>[Against Spurs]</b>, it was an absolute joke the way he made the saves. He was different class. It’s down to him that we kept a clean sheet</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool left-back Andy Robertson has been treated for an infected hand]</b> Andy Robertson has undergone a minor procedure on his hand after picking up an infection. The defender reported back for pre-season training on Saturday morning but will be temporarily delayed in participating in the usual tests and drills, with the club’s medical team continuing to monitor his rehabilitation from the surgery. Robertson will travel to the United States for the Reds’ pre-season tour next week</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool’s Andy Robertson has taken aim at Steve Bruce’s detractors, with many viewing Newcastle United’s appointment of the veteran manager as a step back for a club already struggling to keep pace with fellow Premier League sides]</b> There has been a lot of negativity around it and I think that is really unfair for a man who has achieved what he has. I hope he gets the backing he deserves. He was a huge reason in my going to Hull City <b>[from Dundee United in 2014]</b>. Before I spoke to Steve I did not want to go to Hull, to be honest. My agent will tell you that. I did not think I was ready after only a year in full-time football with Dundee and felt it would be better to wait, but I spoke to Steve for 15 or 20 minutes and he convinced me I was good enough for that level. For the two-and-a-half years I was with him he was a different class and helped make me the player I am today. So personally, I am delighted for him. Newcastle is a huge club and I hope he does well – not against us, obviously – but in every other game.</p>

  <p><b>[Andy Robertson says Liverpool are determined to build on their Champions League triumph and land more major silverware in 2019-20]</b> We have got massive games from the off: Manchester City at Wembley in the Community Shield. Of course it’s the game just before the season starts but you’re still playing in a massive stadium against one of your biggest rivals. Then we’ve got Chelsea in the Super Cup. The biggest one is Norwich for getting the Premier League off to a good start in front of our home fans for the first time since we won the Champions League. That’s what we’ve got to use as motivation now – the winning feeling we had. Last season was completely different, we used the disappointment and heartbreak of losing as motivation to not be in that position again. That’s probably why we had so many last-minute winners, big comebacks and things like that. This season we need to use that feeling of being on that bus and lifting that trophy to drive us forward. We want more of that feeling. That’ll be in all our minds for the season ahead<br /><br /><b>[Robertson added when asked if the pair will be staging another assist competition]</b> We’ve had a brief discussion over it. We’ll set it up again. Probably too much was made of it but for me and Trent it brought the best out of us, the numbers we both produced. Near the back end of the season he was unbelievable with the numbers he produced. I feel it brought the best out of both of us. If we can do that and get similar numbers this season, of course it helps the team. That’s what both of us want to do. But first and foremost we want to just put in the same performances we put in last season and try to kick on even further</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool’s Andy Robertson has lavished praise on team-mate Trent Alexander-Arnold]</b> Trent was outstanding all last season but he took it to another level at the end of it and became the best right-back in the world. He almost became our main man in the last 10 games of the season. What was it <b>[last season]</b>? Mid to high-20s contributing goals <b>[between us]</b>? It is going to be hard to replicate it, but if we get close it helps the team. But the clean sheets were as important for us. As a pair, I felt our Champions League final performance was as mature a performance as we put in. Once we had the lead we were thinking, ‘clean sheet and we win the game’, and we did that.<br /><br />Near the back end of the season we noticed the emphasis on trying to stop me and Trent doing what we try to do. It is up to us to adapt to that, but if someone is dedicating time to try and stop me and Trent, that is going to create a lot of space for other players. The quality we have got shows it is very difficult for anyone to focus on just one or two players. Someone else will pop up<br /><br />Nowadays there seems to be a lot of big money being spent on full-backs. I am not sure if you would have seen that 10 years ago. The position has changed a lot. When I was growing up and watching football there were outstanding full-backs, but more as part of the back four, there to help keep the clean sheet and let the others do their job. Slowly but surely the role started to evolve, with Ashley Cole one of the main reasons for that – how he played for Arsenal and Chelsea</p>

  <p><b>[Andy Robertson believes he has kicked on at Liverpool]</b> There has been a lot happening in a relatively short period of time but I’ve loved every minute of it. Of course at the start it was a lot tougher, there was still a big learning curve for me at the time to realise the standard I had to get up to and how much I had to improve to play at this level. Luckily, I feel I made that step and I’ve kicked on from there. But I still feel I can improve a lot more and that’s what I aim to do season to season. Last season was a big season for me because there was a bit more expectation on me at the start because of the six months I had previously; I feel I managed to deal with that. This season there’ll probably be even more. I just look to add to it, keep putting in good performances and keep contributing to the team, like the manager and coaching staff want me to do<br /><br />When I signed, Mo and Chambo had come in, so there was a lot more said about them and rightly so. I kind of went under the radar but it probably made it a bit harder for me because I wanted to get games under my belt to try to prove to the manager and my teammates, and the fans, that I could play at this level. At the start it didn’t quite get to that, so maybe people from the outside were thinking I couldn’t quite make that standard, which was probably one of my biggest worries at that point because I knew if I got my chance at least I could try to take it. I was delighted. Obviously the circumstances when Alberto <b>[Moreno]</b> got injured was bad timing for him, but I knew it was good timing for me, that I would have at least five or six games of being able to get up to speed. It took me maybe one or two games to get up to sharpness but once I did I felt as if I belonged in the team and could really contribute; luckily I started to show that and obviously everyone came on board and was happy I was at the club</p>

  <p><b>[Andrew Robertson is hopeful that Liverpool will return to full-strength quickly after a comprehensive pre-season friendly defeat against Napoli]</b> The lads coming back, even if they don’t play, it gives you a lift when they train and with the way they go about their business. It doesn’t matter if they play on Wednesday or not, that’s completely up to the manager three days in, but that’s irrelevant: if they’re back in training and back around the place then it makes a difference. Mo and Bobby are two of our main men and Alisson was magnificent last season. They are huge characters in the changing room as well so that’ll be massive for us, and then Sadio will come back the following week. Once we get the whole team back together, and I think Shaq and Naby aren’t far off too, they’re players that are familiar around the set-up and around the system and that’s what we need. The quicker we get all of us back together then hopefully the better. But it’s not anyone else’s fault, the young lads or whatever who have come in, we’ve all not been good enough and maybe Bobby and Mo and people like that will give us the lift that we need. Hopefully, that does happen.<br /><br />They’ve been great <b>[throughout pre-season]</b> and when young kids come in it’s a breath of fresh air sometimes. Harvey Elliott only signed this morning and he’s come on and done magnificently for 15 minutes. He’s only 16 years old and I think people forget that. Rhian’s had a great pre-season, Harry Wilson looked good when he came on today. Look, we need these players to push us and they need to push us in every single position and if they do that then the gaffer will give them the chance. Fair play to them, when they came on and we were all off then it did look better. I was watching and it looked a lot better than we felt in the first half so credit to them. But now it’s up to us to put in the performances, we’ve got one more game before it gets competitive and we need to get up to speed now</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool left-back Andy Robertson is ready to forget about his side’s Champions League triumph last season, as he turns his attention towards more trophies in 2019-20]</b> The day we came back it wore off for us. For us the first day we came back it’s really forgotten about until we retire. Then we can sit back and say, ‘OK, we won the Champions League’, that’s a real achievement in a career. The focus now needs to be on winning more trophies, because that Champions League is now in the past. We don’t want to be the team that only won one trophy – of course it’s a big one, but we want to be a team that wins a host of trophies<br /><br /><b>[Robertson, though, isn’t getting concerned at a lack of spending by his side]</b> The same got said about Tottenham last season, that they wouldn’t kick on without signings, but they went on and had a more successful season. For us, the most important thing was keeping all our players, and we’ve managed to do that. Of course we lost a couple who were out of contract, but the others have all stayed together, and that’s a big thing<br /><br /><b>[The Reds will kick off their season on Sunday when they take on Man City in the Community Shield, a match Robertson is eagerly anticipating]</b> We will look forward, next week is the start of the season against Man City and we look forward to it. We know how hard this season is going to be, but it’s one we look forward to, and one that we need to build on for the coming season</p>

  <p><b>[Andy Robertson thinks the chasing pack in the Premier League title race will pose Liverpool more of a threat in the 2018-19 season]</b> We know the season did come down to that game at the Etihad really. But it’s over 38 games and that’s what it will come down to again. Look, we know we are a good team and we know we are here to stay. We need to prove that again. But like I said, the other teams that were quite a bit behind us last season will pose a better threat than they did last season and Man City will definitely be here to stay. So it will be an interesting league but it’s one where we can definitely compete in<br /><br /><b>[Liverpool are the team to get the ball rolling in the Premier League as they welcome newly-promoted Norwich City to Anfield]</b> Whether we won or whether we lost today, we weren’t going to look too much into it. That was my opinion anyway because it’s a one-off game. Friday is a big one, nobody has hidden away from that as it’s the start of the Premier League and everyone looks to get off to a good start. Norwich City had a fantastic season in the Championship, I watched quite a bit of them and they are a very good team. So they will be coming here full of confidence after their promotion. I know how that feels and they will be looking to get their season off to a good start, so we know the threats that they will bring. But I hope that they know ours as well and we will be a lot better for today’s game going into Friday. It’s just about getting the performance right, which I’m sure we will do</p>

I think the teams behind us have improved in the market.

People will say there are better strikers, but for me what he does is so important to our team. We’d be lost without him. He’s world class<br /><br /><b>[Asked to expand on what makes <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> so special]</b> He does everything, and that’s the beauty of Bobby. He can do it all. He’s our first line of defence, and I’ve not seen anybody better at doing that. He presses the defenders and doesn’t give them a minute. He comes back and nicks the ball in midfield for us. He’s so important defensively for us, then he goes up the park and scores goals and makes assists. That’s what we need him to do. The work he puts in during games is probably more than any other striker in the world<br /><br /><b>[Liverpool’s win at <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> was their 13th in a row in the league, a club record]</b> It means nothing because we’ve only got four wins this season. Of course it’s nice to be in the record books and if that’s another box we’ve ticked off then great, but it’s not about that. It’s about four wins from four and top of the league going into the first international break. We had the aim to win the games we needed to win, luckily we’ve done that. Now we’ll have the break, come back and we’ve got another tough run<br /><br />It’s not often you come to <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> and get a performance like that. I thought we were different class. You know what you’re going to get here, they’ve been doing it for a number of years and they’re very good at it. I think that’s the easiest win we’ve had, certainly since I’ve been here. A pleasing night all round. <b>[The clean sheet]</b> was massive for us. We’ve been comfortable in all the games so far this season but we’ve given away stupid goals at daft times, so it was important we kept concentrated and we did that well.

We’re all buzzing with that<br /><br /><b>[Robertson also had some words of praise for <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, who continued his own fine start to the season with another goal]</b> Sadio is a naturally fit boy. He didn’t want rest, he wanted to come back and hit the ground running in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, which he’s done. His goal was great, his all-round play got better as the game went on. I’ve got a good relationship with him on the left and hopefully that continues for many games and many years. He’s a fantastic player and I love playing with him. As long as he keeps doing what he’s doing, he’ll keep producing the numbers. They <b>[the front three]</b> are world-class players, and the goal doesn’t move. They know where the goal is, and they’re finding it at the moment. All three of them were fantastic today, and hopefully that continues because we need them</p>

We need to try to get a result because, if we don’t, I think it’ll leave us too much to do. We need to go out and play with no fear and try and enjoy it, because I don’t feel as if we look as if we’re enjoying it as much as we probably should be. We’re representing our country</p>

Don’t get me wrong, it’s lovely to be five points clear but there are going to be twists and turns this season, as there were last season. We’ve got off to a good start but it’s about keeping that going and keeping the momentum. If we keep winning our games, that’s all that matters.

Even when I came to the club <b>[in 2017]</b> he was amazing but maybe did not have as much composure as he does now in front of goal. Now every time he is front of goal you don’t think he will miss. The one he had at the start of the second half when <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Hendo</a> put him in, we were surprised he didn’t score. That is the type of player he is. You expect him to score and that is a good thing. He has popped up with another crucial goal. <br /><br />It has been a fantastic year for him and let’s hope he can keep going for a full season instead of a calendar year. That would help. The others are pitching in as well but it’s a fantastic year for him and he has taken his game to another level. Does he belong in the top bracket? I would say so. People are giving him more credit and that is deserved. Our front three gets talked about quite a lot. Maybe Bobby <b>[Firmino]</b> does not score as many as the other two but his work-rate is second to none and if he didn’t do what he does, Sadio and Mo <b>[Salah]</b> would not do what they do. Hopefully all three can keep going as we are not even halfway through the season and we need them to keep going<br /><br /><b>[Robertson himself had been a doubt for the Palace game due to an ongoing ankle issue]</b> It is still painful but you know … It is something that I gave time for it to improve. Keeping it moving will help it, and hopefully in time it will be better. I was desperate to play and the gaffer asked me if I was okay, I believed I was and luckily I got through the game. Me and Mo were in the same position. Mo was desperate to play as well, but the manager made the decision and Mo was fine and accepted it. You don’t want to miss any games but if it means him missing one game rather than six, this is a big difference. Sometimes you need to be a bit clever. I have come through, Mo was not needed although he was stripped and ready, then Bobby scored and he sat back down! Hopefully that will give him more time to settle and hopefully he will be fine for midweek<br /><br /><b>[Reflecting on yet another late victory, Robertson delivered a wry smile]</b> Scoring late is good and enjoyable but we would much rather be 2-0 or 3-0 up and see out the game! We cannot keep relying on it but it is good we have that mentality and we didn’t panic because we have been in this position so many times. I think that is why we took control of the game and scored the winner. We are 30 games unbeaten <b>[in the league]</b> but I would rather it was 30 this season rather than split over two seasons! But people can talk all they want. We know how tough this league is. Every time you go to an away ground they want to beat you. They know how long the record is at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> and they want to beat us there as well. Everyone wants to beat us. We are top of the league and everyone wants to catch us.

Maybe sometimes we’ve made it look easy but believe me, it’s not – it’s so hard to perform against every team that wants to beat you. The longer the run goes on, the more everyone wants to beat you – ‘we beat Liverpool’ or whatever. We don’t take anything for granted. We are not celebrating in there that we are champions. We are just celebrating a nice win just now. Long may that continue and then in May maybe we can start to celebrate</p>

We keep going, we are on a good run just now, we are confident, seven clean sheets on the bounce is massive and long may that continue. We will let other people say that <b>[the title is won]</b> but I don’t think anyone in that dressing room is believing that just yet.

  <p><b>[Andy Robertson claims to be free of pain at Liverpool]</b> For a few of us, definitely – people were maybe playing with knocks or injuries and it has given them a whole week to kind of clear them up. I know mine feels better, I feel closer to 100 per cent in terms of my body, which is always a positive. Being in training pain-free is always a nice thing, which maybe hasn’t happened in a couple of weeks leading up to that. To clear up any of that is a positive, for a week to just let your body recover. Hopefully we now have a strong finish to the season and we can see that the week was beneficial, and hopefully the results follow. But even if the worst-case scenario <b>[with results]</b>, in terms of injuries it has managed to get some lads back fit, which is so important for us<br /><br />To be honest, my body felt fine. I didn’t feel tired and it wasn’t tiredness. It was more the pain I was playing in at times. I pulled out of the Scotland squad in November with an injury and it probably continued on, then I took another knock on it and it probably got worse.<br /><br />A lot of us play through pain at times, that’s part and parcel of being a footballer. You need to be out there on a Saturday if you can. Where there’s a will there’s a way. A lot of us have showed that at times.<br /><br />For me, it was on my left foot, which is never the best. If it was on my right foot it probably wouldn’t even have been an injury. Being on your strong foot, it’s tough when you’re passing the ball and it’s sending pain up your leg.<br /><br />It’s hopefully a thing of the past, there’s been time to clear that up. I don’t feel I needed a rest physically, I felt as if I could still run for 90 minutes and do it at a good level. Those stats, I’m happy with them. I like to play games, I get paid to play games and it probably shows I’ve been doing a couple of things right if I’ve played that many games! I’m happy with the amount of games I’ve played and hopefully that continues for the next two seasons and so on. But when you get a week off you’ve got to take it.</p>

  <p><b>[Andy Robertson is already planning to spend the rest of his career at Liverpool]</b> That’s my plan. Whether I’m good enough at 33 or 34 to continue to do that, we’ll wait and see. But I don’t want to go anywhere, this club is so special to me in a short space of time. My family love it, I love it and I don’t want to go anywhere else. There’s no better team in the world just now than <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, and why would any of us want to leave? We’ve got a young squad and we’ve got to be looking at the next five years to try and add more and more trophies. To start with the big two is always good and it gives us the freedom to go and add to it now, because the feeling of being champions is amazing and we don’t want it to be a one-off, we want that all the time. That’s what will drive us forward next season and the seasons after. It’s been an incredible journey for me, but I’m always one who looks forward and not back, so I’m looking to add more trophies at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Hopefully next season we can win a couple more.<br /><br /><b>[Liverpool snapped Robertson up from <a href="hull-city-fc.html">Hull City</a> for just £8 million ($10m) in the summer of 2017, with the flying full-back one of several players to have flourished under the guidance of Klopp]</b> He’s like a father figure. He is the dad to all of us when we’re away. We can have a laugh with him but he knows when to get the lads going, he knows when to motivate us and how to motivate us</p>

  <p><b>[Jordan Henderson has captained <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to the title]</b> When you play with him, you train with him and see the way he acts off the field, it’s an absolute pleasure for him to be our captain</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool defender Andrew Robertson has criticised recent VAR decisions in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and says it has put footballers in limbo]</b> Over the last week, for me there has been four or five decisions that I think should have gone the other away, and I think many footballing people think they should have gone the other way too. I believe that the referees are relying on VAR, but then VAR isn’t overturning any decisions, so we are stuck in limbo. I’d prefer not to have it and just let the referee call it. If the referee called it, you’d say ‘OK, he’s seen it differently’. But the fact we have about 40 cameras and 40 different angles, I believe the decisions should be right<br /><br />Obviously I’ve seen the video circulate since, and I shouldn’t have used the language that I did, but we were in a high-pressured game and emotions were on the line. I spoke to the referee and the officials in the tunnel after, and he explained what he thought he had seen - I respected that, not all referees do that - so fair play to him but I still thought he was in the wrong and that it was a penalty. That’s what we believe VAR was brought in to do <b>[to change the decision]</b>. For me, how that’s not a penalty, I still scratch my head over it</p>
