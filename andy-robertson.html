  <p><b>[Andrew Robertson says referee Mark Clattenburg apologised to the Hull City players at half-time after he’d controversially allowed Alexis Sanchez’s opening goal to stand as Arsenal won 2-0]</b> Yeah it was handball. When we came out at half-time, the referee’s apologised to us. He said it was a handball, so he’s obviously looked at it at half-time and seen he was in the wrong. It happens so quick that it’s a tough one for the ref, you’ve got to kind of feel sorry for him. At the end of the day, these decisions don’t really go your way when you come to these big stadiums and that’s killed us. If you go in 0-0 at half-time, you seen the way we played in the second-half, we could’ve came away with some points<br /><br />He <b>[Clattenburg]</b> says he wasn’t 100 per cent sure whether <b>[if it was a handball]</b>. Obviously we can argue that he shouldn’t have given the goal if he wasn’t sure, but I think he argued it the other way, that if he wasn’t sure he had to give the goal. That’s the explanation he gave us. Obviously not many referees can admit they’re wrong, so it’s good, but it doesn’t make it any better</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool’s Sadio Mane credits self-belief for hat-trick feat]</b> Mo <b>[Salah]</b> and Bobby <b>[Roberto Firmino]</b> have stolen the headlines in the last couple of weeks. But Sadio is on my side of the pitch and he is a workhorse. He took the limelight and got his three goals.<br /><br />I said to him after the last game <b>[the 3-0 win at St Mary’s]</b> ‘finally you’re back’ immediately after when we talked on the pitch. He showed it again at Porto what a fantastic player he is. He was always important, he was always fantastic for us, even in his not-that-good moments. That’s a real quality - if you are not 100 per cent and still scoring, maybe not that often but involved in goals - then that’s really important. They will come if you keep on working really hard like he did, then there can be a moment like this. The first one was a little bit lucky I think, but then the other two were being in the right place, the second one and using your fantastic skills for the last one. Good, really good, and I am happy about it</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah can emulate Lionel Messi and become one of the best players in the world]</b> Messi has been doing it for years. Mo has had a great career but I think now he is really hitting his peak and he has still got youth on his side. Hopefully if he can keep doing it he will be in that bracket but I don’t think you can argue that there probably isn’t anyone better in the world than him just now. He needs to keep going and next season will be big for him because everybody will be expecting it. If he can kick on from here then I think he will be <b>[unquestionably regarded as]</b> one of the best players in the world.<br /><br />He’s easier to play with than against. That’s for sure! In training, I think everyone dreads it <b>[coming up against him]</b> but just now, I think he’s one of the best in the business and nobody can deny that. I thought on Saturday he was unplayable. I thought he was unbelievable and I think that could have arguably have been his best game so far. To top it off with four goals was just ridiculous but it all comes from all of us working so hard. Mo gets in those positions all the time and just now he’s putting everything away. He’s not missing any chances and that’s a good thing for us. Hopefully that continues because we’ve got a big run-in until the end of the season and if the front three can keep scoring the goals then hopefully that can be enough for us to reach our objectives</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah is capable of emulating Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo by delivering for Liverpool over a number of years]</b> The amount of goals he scores is incredible, but the amount of chances he has … I think I spoke to him a couple of weeks ago about his goals and stuff, and he said to me: ‘It should have been a lot more’. He’s had some unbelievable chances so credit to him for getting in the positions, and that’s why he’s confident of scoring all the time, because he’s getting in the positions. It’s the way the gaffer wants him to play, so hopefully he can continue and really build on it and become among Messi and Ronaldo. They’ve done it for six or seven seasons and he’s just done it one. But I’ve got no doubt Salah can build on it and do it over that period of time.<br /><br />You want the world-class players playing at the World Cup, and you want them to do themselves justice. Hopefully he can get back fit and really do it because the whole country of Egypt is relying on him. Hopefully he can do himself justice. It wouldn’t surprise me if he’s fit. Obviously, he rushed off to get a scan and he was devastated after the final, and I think a part of him was probably worried about the World Cup. So I hope he can make it, and I think one of the club physios is with him doing all his rehab. He might not be able to make the first games, but hopefully he can play a big part</p>

  <p><b>[From Kiev to Homebase - How Andy Robertson put Liverpool’s Champions League heartache behind him]</b> I sat up and spent some time with my little one. He can’t speak yet, which I was quite happy about! I didn’t speak to anyone for a while, to be honest. The day after the final, all my family were flying back and coming to the house. I had over 20 people at the final and they were all flying in at different times and all trying to catch some sleep. It was a bit manic. You put so much into the whole day, so much adrenaline, and then you have a massive come down afterwards. That hit me.<br /><br /><b>[Fortunately for Robertson his father, Brian, was on hand with the ideal solution]</b> We had to go and buy a barbecue because everyone was coming round! So, yeah, the day after the Champions League final I’m in Homebase in Formby buying a barbecue! But it just got me out the house to be honest! My dad is quite good in those kind of situations. He’ll talk about everything but football, so I went with him and then me, him and my missus’ dad took care of the barbecue! By about three o’clock when everyone had arrived, I was just happy to have my family round me. I could see how proud they were of me and it was good to be surrounded by them. It was a good comfort<br /><br />I don’t like watching games with people around to be honest, so I watched it on my own. It was a tough watch. I watched the first half an hour and even then I was thinking ‘we’ve got them here!’ but obviously things started going wrong after that. I honestly think the second goal took the wind out of our sails, and we didn’t know how to bounce back from it. Watching the game back, I think you can tell we weren’t really going to get back into it. Sadio <b>[Mane]</b> hit the post but <b>[Luka]</b> Modric started coming into his own, calmed the whole game down and it was a real struggle for us. They won comfortably in the end<br /><br /><b>[Disappointment in Robertson’s voice is clear]</b> You get noticed a bit more. That’s natural if you’re playing for a club like this. The first couple of months I wasn’t really anywhere to be seen, there was no big deal about it and that was probably what I wanted at the time. Now I feel more established in the squad. It’s small things really. I’ve never been to America before, for example, so to see the fans on the tour and hear them shouting your name is mad. You’d maybe think they’d be here just to see Liverpool, but they know all the players, they’re clued up! You get noticed more on holiday and things like that, but I only went to Portugal so it was full of Scousers and Glaswegians anyway! And anyway, it’s good to be noticed, because it means you’re playing and doing something right<br /><br />Yeah of course. As soon as you put in one good performance for a club like this there’s pressure, because the next week fans expect it again. Last season, nobody put pressure on me really. I think for some fans, anything I did was a bonus! This season, obviously, there’s more expectation but I have to use that to my advantage. I like pressure, I put in on myself and I think I get the best out of myself by doing that. I just can’t wait for the season to start now, hopefully we can hit the ground running and keep the confidence from the back end of last season<br /><br /><b>[Enough to close the gap to those above?]</b> Hopefully! Last season, City just blew everyone away really. Even if you see Man United’s points total, usually that’s not too far away from winning it, but last season it was miles away because of the way City had done it. The first part of the season was crucial, and they were too far away from us from quite early on really. But hopefully the gaffer’s identified players who he thinks can come in and make a difference. There’s no doubting their quality. We look forward to playing with them, it gives certain positions added competition but that’s what we need. Last season we were doing well with injuries then it all sort of hit us at once. We struggled near the back end of the season with that. This year, we’ve got a stronger squad and the competition is there. If there’s competition in training then the training is intense, and then you have the pressure of a weekend that if you don’t put in good performances then your place is maybe up for grabs</p>

  <p><b>[Andy Robertson has fired a warning to Liverpool’s Premier League rivals]</b> I think there’s a lot more <b>[to come]</b>. The last three games, we’ve probably not been at our best so we’re still a work in progress and if we can keep getting better it’ll be exciting to see what can happen. We’ve got a few big games when we come back but I think all the lads are just excited to go away with their international teams now. Some will get a break and we’ll come back and we’ve obviously got a big game against Tottenham.<br /><br />Of course. I think we started off really well, I thought first 20 minutes they couldn’t quite deal with us and we could have probably been two or three up then. But, after that, we struggled a wee bit, I think they pressed a bit higher and we couldn’t get our foot on the ball. It was similar to Palace and Brighton last week at Anfield. It’s important that we win these games and at Leicester we had some really good things but some not so good things. But it’s all about the three points - 12 points from 12, we can’t ask for much better. We knew it was going to be tough here, Leicester are a really good team and have got off to a flying start, so we knew it was going to be hard. Luckily, we took our chances at the right times in the first half and the second half was just about digging deep and luckily we managed that<br /><br />I think there are a couple of mistakes before then, we maybe could have played the ball in behind maybe two or three times instead of going back. Then he’s been put under pressure and obviously tried a Cruyff but it’s not quite worked. But I think he learned his lesson after that and he wasn’t taking any chances. He’s a confident lad and even today he made two or three great saves, so we’ll concentrate on that and it’s only a small blip. He’s adapting to the Premier League as well, so as long as he keeps making the saves, we’ll be happy<br /><br />I think we all stood up to it. The last couple of free-kicks, big Harry <b>[Maguire]</b> was offside twice because we held our line and we weren’t scared to stay high and I think that’s key because we know how good Harry is in the air. The lads did brilliantly. As long as we’re in the background doing our work, we’re quite happy with that. We’d have obviously liked a clean sheet but it’s the first goal we’ve conceded. We would have taken that realistically at the start of the season, only conceding one in the first four games. Twelve points and now we can go into the international break and look forward to coming back</p>

I spoke to Darren Fletcher when he wasn’t playing, near the end, and that was his biggest disappointment - that he hadn’t managed to get us back to a World Cup or a Euros. I don’t want that to be me. I want us to manage to get to a championship and lead the boys out. We’ve got a great chance here. Hopefully we can do it at the first time of asking.<br /><br />When the announcement was made, you see all the names that have captained this country. For me to go on that list - it’s a special list and I hope by the end of my captaincy that I’m in the same breath as them. Technically I am just now, but I haven’t achieved anything that they have. There is still a long way to go but I’m hopeful that, when the time comes to hang up my boots, I can be in the same sentence as some of the names that were on that <b>[list]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool defender Andy Robertson insists that he is more worried about Neymar’s talents on the ball]</b> How will Neymar be received at Anfield? That’s not up to me, it’s the fans. What I do know is that he’s a world-class player and we need to be wary of him. His skills speak for themselves. Yeah, people say he goes down too easily, but that’s not up to us. It’s up to the referee to decide. We’ll stay away from that. For us, we’ve got to concentrate on the qualities. Unfortunately for us, he has a lot of them. It’s one player that we’ll have to be wary of. The bad thing for us is that they’ve got quite a lot of players that we’ll have to be wary of. On the other hand, a good thing for us is that we’ve got a lot of players that can cause them problems.<br /><br /><b>[Saturday’s 2-1 victory over Tottenham]</b> We played well against West Ham and the next three weren’t our best but we managed to get results. And that’s what you need to do in this league. I thought today we’ve come to a place where we’ve struggled last season and <b>[against]</b> a team that finished above us. I think it’s still too early for a <b>[title]</b> statement or whatever. But we’ve just got to keep doing what we’re doing, winning games that are put in front of us. <b>[The Spurs match]</b> was a tough task for us, coming back from international breaks when all the lads have traveled the world. So to come back and put a performance like that is very pleasing, especially when it’s the first game of the weekend. Now we can sit back and watch the rest of them.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool showed they are title challengers]</b> We weren’t at our best but these are the games you have to win if you want to challenge and we’ll play a lot better. Yes of course, there’s a bit of relief. It was a tough game against a very good side. It’s important you come to these places and you win the game. Luckily we managed to get our noses in front and we’ve seen it out from there. We can play a lot better, but they made it hard.<br /><br />We weren’t surprised by Huddersfield at all. We did our analysis and in our meetings, the analysis team and our manager were saying they were a better team than the points suggest and I think they proved that. They played very well and they’re probably a wee bit unfortunate to be where they are in the table. I think they will have a positive season. They just need to get up and running and hopefully they will do that, but for us it was about getting the three points</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool defender Andrew Robertson has admitted he has been forced to keep his attacking tendencies in check]</b> Last season there were some games when we were 2-0 up and I was bombing forward and James Milner had to cover me. He wasn’t happy about it and still goes on about it! So maybe I’ve listened to James a bit more. Hendo gave me a mouthful about that in one of the games, too. When we were 1-0 up against Brighton earlier this season - when it was not the best of games - it was about defending. Yes you want to contribute to attack but I was not going to push on and risk losing the ball. Maybe we have got the level of control now where we are prepared to see out the game a lot more. So far that has worked. The manager is always on at me to be more involved. He wants the full-backs up and down. At times I may be in the wrong position, but he wants me to keep showing for the ball.<br /><br />We want to keep a clean sheet every week, that is why there was so much disappointment. If you are gutted when you concede goals, and hungry not to, it can only work well for the team. There has been a lot of talk about the defence at the start of the season, but we need to continue. If we do win games 4-3, we’ll still be happy. Winning is most important, no matter how you did it. 3-0 every week is the ideal situation. It’s a bit more difficult than that</p>

I said: ‘Gaffer, thanks very much for everything you’ve done, I’m going to be Scotland captain, I hope it can be a success’ - all that sort of stuff. And then he just texted back in big capital letters: ‘You are the real Scottish Braveheart now!’ I gave him a thumb emoji and he gave me the wee dance emoji. Brilliant. That sums him up.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool left-back Andy Robertson claims he very nearly joined Stoke City instead of Jurgen Klopp’s side]</b> Stoke were quite interested in me. Mark Hughes had liked me and I think there was a wee bit of chat with them. So I was thinking they were a really good option; I think they finished top 10 that season and I was trying to get my head on a move to Stoke. I was thinking they were really keen, and at that point under Mark Hughes they were playing good football. They had Erik Pieters; I wasn’t sure if I was going in as back-up to him as he was flying that season.<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether his struggle to initially get into the team was because of fitness problems]</b> I don’t think it was down to fitness. It was down to my understanding. It took me a while to get used to the way he <b>[Klopp]</b> was playing. I played my first game against Crystal Palace and I got Man of the Match. But even when I look back on that now, the way I played that game is completely different to the way he wanted me to play. He was happy with me that game, I walked off the pitch thinking ‘I’ve just done well there’, but now when I look at the way I play and the way he wants me to play, that game I didn’t do it</p>

  <p><b>[Andy Robertson believes Will Hughes should have been booked for diving]</b> No, I’ve watched it back and I still don’t think I made contact with him. I think he was looking for it. He went down quite easily and I don’t know why the referee didn’t book him having not given the penalty. I’ve seen them given but I’ve not touched him. It would have been very harsh and I think the referee made the right call. A lot of players try to buy penalties and sometimes defenders can’t do a lot about it. But I played on and tried to get the ball straightaway because in my eyes it wasn’t a penalty. My conscience was clear. The only thing I would say is that he probably should have booked him.<br /><br />We defend as a team, but yeah that stat is special for the defence. But we need to use it and keep building on it. There’s not much point breaking records if in the end it doesn’t mean anything. We haven’t achieved anything yet this season but we’re doing well. We’re keeping more clean sheets and looking solid at the back and we’re still scoring goals. It’s a long season and we need to keep it going. We need to keep that defensive form up because keeping clean sheets is half the battle<br /><br /><b>[Pep Guardiola’s side, the reigning champions, look in ominous form]</b> It doesn’t take the edge off anything. The only Man City result we can control is when we play them, we can’t control anything else. As long as we keep winning, you could ask the same thing to them. Of course they are two points clear but they want us off their tails. We can only focus on what we’re doing. If you take one eye off it and think about who Man City are playing then we might slip up. As long as we keep winning games, we’ll be in the hunt for it. Let’s just see where it takes us<br /><br />If we go there and win then we know that’s likely to be us qualified. That’s been the aim since the start of the campaign and we need to achieve that against either PSG or Napoli. It’s another big game and I’m sure we’ll all be ready to go. It’s all about recovering properly and being ready for the challenge ahead because there’s no doubt that they’re a world class team. It’s about dealing with their threats but also posing our own in the game<br /><br />Last season when I first came in, rightly or wrongly, nobody expected anything, apart from the manager and the players around me. But I knew this season there would be more expectation on me after a good second half to last season. Over the summer those were the questions I was asking myself: ‘Can I do it? Can I keep it going?’ I am really happy with how I’ve started the season but I need to keep it going. Playing in this team makes it easy. I set myself high standards and when I drop below them I’m not happy about it. I’ve done that a few times this season but I am playing with real confidence just now and long may that continue</p>

It’s all part and parcel of his game and we needed to deal with that. We didn’t quite control our aggression. Of course it was frustrating. But when you play against PSG you know it is something you are going to come up against, especially with him. It wasn’t something we quite dealt with.<br /><br />We know we just go and try to win the game. I am sure everyone else will clear it up for us - I am sure the gaffer will know exactly what we need to do. It is at Anfield. I am sure we will have another special night, the fans can create a special atmosphere and hopefully get the result that we need. We have been good at home and we need to continue that. Napoli got the better of us over there. It was a good performance by them. But I am sure we will watch the match back and see what we did wrong because it wasn’t a good performance.

I got a bit of space, particularly second half and the gaffer is always banging on to me and Trent <b>[Alexander-Arnold]</b>, more so this season, that we have to be more involved and I just tried to do that.<br /><br />Special mention goes to Clyney <b>[Nathaniel Clyne]</b>, being out for so long and my God, he has done brilliantly. He has had his struggles with injury but he put in a first-class performance and that just sums up our squad at the minute<br /><br />Of course. You look at the bench and there is probably a few people disappointed not to start, rightly so, and we have all got positions to fight for and that is the beauty of having a good squad. Shaq comes on and shows everyone what he can do and scores the two goals, and he will take the headlines, but the other subs that came on, Hendo came on and shored up the midfield, won every tackle, I think, and never lost a header against Fellaini, which is always tough. These guys were disappointed not to play before kick-off but they come on and make such a difference for us. It was a real all-round performance<br /><br /><b>[On Shaqiri’s impact]</b> He is seizing his chance and good on him. You can use it to your advantage because you might go under the radar a wee bit and there might not be as big a deal made about your signing. But it gives you time to get your feet under the table and Shaq has hit the ground running, quicker than I did, so credit to him. He has learned the way to play and he has been fantastic all season and a real threat for us, and his stats this season are very good, so long may that continue<br /><br /><b>[Liverpool back to the top of the Premier League table]</b> Of course we do. We are in December, we know how tough this period is but we are top of the league. We have just got to keep this period going. We know how good Man City are, we have a bit of a gap that has opened up now <b>[to third]</b>, the two of us close to each other but we believe we can stay top. But, there is a long way to go and we still have to play big games, starting on Friday night and we hopefully move on from there. It has been a huge few weeks, people maybe looked at the fixtures and thought ‘Everton, it’s a derby, always tough, Bournemouth, always tough, Napoli was a must-win and Man Utd speaks for itself’ and we have come out unscathed but we need to move on from that. We can’t just rest on that and say, four games we have played well and take our eye off the ball. We need to stay focused 100 per cent and look forward to the challenge at Wolves who have done well this season so, we prepare, we rest and get ready for another big one</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool defender Andy Robertson has joked that he is getting bored of speaking about how good Virgil van Dijk is]</b> I’m getting bored speaking about how good he is! No, I’m only joking. He was fantastic. We knew when we saw <b>[Adama]</b> Traore up top that he has got great pace. His pace and direction are a big threat and big Virgil did so well with him. We knew on the counter-attack they were dangerous. I’m sure he will be disappointed he has not scored more goals but it was a clean sheet and his first Premier League goal - pretty much a perfect day for him. He’s been brilliant <b>[since joining Liverpool]</b>. I’ve had the pleasure of working alongside him for the majority of time on the left-hand side of the defence. He’s just a great lad to have next to you - I’m not sure he will say the same about me! I think we have had a good relationship, we work together. The whole back four does, whoever plays, his impact on the club has been good. I look forward to it continuing.<br /><br />We have a fantastic captain in Hendo <b>[Jordan Henderson]</b>. This <b>[Wolves]</b> was his 300th game for the club and that’s a great achievement. We’ve got Milly <b>[James Milner]</b> behind him as well and he’s a top pro, everyone looks up to him. Virgil is captain for his country so there are plenty of leaders on the park. I’m including Dejan <b>[Lovren]</b> in that as well. The more leaders we have got on the park the better as far as I’m concerned. There were a couple of arguments out there against Wolves - a couple of things that needed to be said and they were said. We all have the attitude that if someone says something to you, you have to take it on the chin. If you don’t agree with it, you deal with it at full-time or half-time and speak to one another. We have spoken together as a team. We do discuss things <b>[and]</b> have said that’s it’s about having that honesty between us. I think that’s something the lads have done really well since the start of the season. It shows the respect between us</p>

  <p><b>[Robertson sees no extra nerves ahead of Man City clash]</b> Of course it’s a huge game. If we win then we’re 10 points clear of them and of course that’s huge. But on the flip side they’ll be thinking they can close the gap to four points which isn’t as big. Look it’s a massive game, of course it is. It’s two good teams going at it and we look forward to it.<br /><br />We play the way that the game tells us to play. Arsenal were quite open and we took advantage of that. The way we played was attacking and we scored the goals. In any game you can play like that, but obviously every game is different and we need to wait and see how the game is going to be. The difference in the Champions League <b>[second leg]</b> game is they <b>[City]</b> obviously had to win by four goals or whatever so they had to come out. They only need to win by one on Thursday. Look they’re a fantastic team, a very experienced team and they’ve been in this position before. They’ve won the title. It’s something that we’ve never had. They’re probably more experienced than us in this position but we look forward to it. We’re in a good moment just now and they’ll be looking to bounce back and then go full throttle into us. We’ll be wary of that but we need to be at our best and if we can, we can cause any team problems<br /><br />You need to ask other teams about that!. We spoke about City last season and I’m sure every other team. did. They were very hard to beat. Of course we did it here in the league and the Champions League but in the league, not many people could touch them. But the thing is, they completed it and they’ve got their winners’ medal and the trophy. Just now, we have nothing and that’s why at the end of the season, hopefully we can talk about it<br /><br />Of course we hope that we win it but we know how hard it is and we know two teams, probably even more, are right behind us and causing us all sorts of problems. We know they’ll be right on our tails so we keep our feet on the ground and hopefully by then we’ll be celebrating. But we take it game by game<br /><br />I think there is pressure always playing for this club. Fans demand it and we demand it so in terms of different pressures, we are top of the league and we need to keep on going. To come through December with the fixtures we had unscathed is a good achievement but nothing is achieved in December so we kick on now and go into 2019 full of momentum and it is about using that properly and if we can, hopefully it is a good year for us all</p>

  <p><b>[Andy Robertson is adamant Liverpool are not feeling the tension of the Premier League title race]</b> I wouldn’t say that nerves are showing. Did anyone say that about City when they lost to Palace and Leicester? I don’t think they did. It’s no different for us. People talk about pressure because we haven’t been in this position before. But it’s February and everyone just needs to relax and try to enjoy the run-in. Nerves aren’t showing in the dressing room, it’s just been two poor results and two poor performances. It happens during a long season. We might look back on it as a good point but we don’t know that just now. We just need to get back to playing better football.<br /><br />It doesn’t make a difference to us. They’ve done well to reach the final of the League Cup and with that final at the end of the month that’s why their game with Everton has been moved forward. It’s most likely that City will go top of the league and that’s something we just have to deal with. Even if they do, we’ll still have a game in hand. It’s about us. We need to get back on track by winning games and playing better football, we can’t worry about them. City are in a good moment and we’re in a wee blip. We just need to get over the line in a few games. Divock <b>[Origi]</b> had a chance late on and if that had gone in we would be talking very differently. We’ll keep going, we’ll dust ourselves down. There’s still a long way to go. The run-in will be exciting and we have to enjoy it</p>

  <p><b>[Andy Robertson hailed fantastic Naby Keita’s performance in Liverpool’s 3-0 win over Bournemouth]</b> They were different class. On my side, I thought that Naby was excellent. He has taken a wee bit of time to settle in but today was probably his best performance in a Liverpool shirt. I’m sure he can take a lot of confidence from that, which he will. Gini has been magnificent this season and he pops up with a goal and, to be fair to him, it’s a great finish. Fabinho just goes about his business and won the ball back for us so many times. So, the midfield won their battles and that set us off and everyone followed suit. I don’t think we lost many battles all over the field.<br /><br />He’s young and he’s had to take time. But if you look at all of us, Fabinho had to take time, me, <a href="alex-oxlade-chamberlain.html">Chambo</a>. There’s a kind of pattern emerging that you need to settle in and you need to learn the way to play and things like that. I think everyone forgets how young Naby is - 24 tomorrow, he’s only a young boy. He’s a fantastic player and the more he shows it the more people will start talking about him. I thought today he was a different class. I’m sure his confidence will be sky high after today</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool defender Andrew Robertson says he does not fear Manchester City]</b> My attitude when I go onto the pitch has always been fearless. I’ve never gone into a game fearing anything or anyone. My upbringing probably does have a bit to do with it. I try to enjoy every minute and give 100 per cent. I’m realistic - every game, not all of us can play to the highest of our ability. Mistakes happen in this game, it’s how you deal with it. Some days not everything comes off, but if I’ve given everything, you’ll criticise yourself in terms of performance, but you’ll know you’ve made it hard for your opponent.

But we believe we can cause any teams problems and we have to be at our best.<br /><br />I think that’s what all good teams do <b>[maximise home advantage]</b>. We had a good run last season and especially in the Champions League I think it helped massively. Everyone knows how special nights here are in the Champions League. We feed off each other. Players feed off the fans and the fans feed off the players because it’s up to us to get them to have something to shout about. But it also helps when they’re getting behind us and it can maybe give you that extra percentage or whatever in the game. That’s what home fans are for. Every club’s got it and it’s all about making the most of it</p>

  <p><b>[Andy Robertson says Liverpool have already forgotten about their Champions League last-16 tie with Bayern Munich]</b> It’s <b>[the second leg on March 13th]</b> a long way away and it needs to be put to the back of the mind because we have some big Premier League games coming up, so Bayern is forgotten about for now. A clean sheet at home in the Champions League is so crucial because we know when we go over there and if we can grab one it means they have to score two. These are all things that come into play and if we can be a bit more clinical I think we can score over there. We back ourselves to win any game, whether it is home or away, which is why we are disappointed. Going over there is a new challenge but there’s probably a bit more pressure on them than us because they are at home and their fans will start demanding things. We can try to play our game, try to create the chances we need and try to get goals and if that happens then it puts us in the driving seat.<br /><br /><b>[interim boss <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> has won 11 of his 13 games]</b> Another huge game. I think it will be a bit of a different game than when we faced them last time. Obviously there was a lot going on at the club at that time and it ended up being their manager’s last game. But under this new manager they have picked up and are a very different team, especially at home, and it will be a tough task. We need to bring our ‘A’ game and if we can do that then hopefully it will be enough to win</p>

  <p><b>[Andrew Robertson is looking for Liverpool to take heart from sides setting up to contain them]</b> I thought we started really well and we had the momentum, we were driving forward, but we just didn’t create great chances. We had one or two but we could have had a lot more and then the second half was disappointing for both teams, with not really many chances created and a lot of sloppy passes. We kept going right until the end. In the last five to 10 minutes we were the side trying to win it and trying to get the three points - but a point at Old Trafford is never a bad result. It could have been more and we are not hiding away from that, but we got a point and go back top of the Premier League. We came for a win, of course we did, but we definitely didn’t want to get beat and we wanted to take something away, and we have managed that.<br /><br />It’s a sign of respect but as a team I think we need to start respecting ourselves. Big teams like Bayern and Manchester United are full of world-class stars and they changed their way of playing to try to stop us. We need to take that as a mark of respect and not shy away from it, stand up to that and show them why there is respect. Maybe we’ve been a bit guilty of that, even more so in midweek. I think we played better <b>[against United]</b> than in midweek. These big teams are showing us respect but maybe we need to start respecting ourselves<br /><br />It’s a bit sore so we’ll see what happens. It feels OK.

  <p><b>[Liverpool star Robertson sends warning to title rivals Man City]</b> Sometimes my passes don’t find people, but I do try and create. It’s good to get two assists but if I get two, I expect Trent to get three - and he’s outshone me again today! Fair play to him. Our delivery was good.<br /><br />A lot of people have been saying that we lost our spark. You can kind of agree, we had one shot on target against <b>[Manchester]</b> United and it was <b>[Daniel]</b> Sturridge’s shot from 45 yards which trickled into <b>[David]</b> De Gea’s arms. We didn’t create enough and we have to look at that. But <b>[against Watford]</b> it could have been more than five. Maybe it was the spark that we’ve been needing - maybe it will be the spark that gives the lads the confidence in front of goal again, I’m sure it will<br /><br />The teams that have been successful against them this season have used their full-backs well. We looked at the clips and we knew we’d get a bit of space. The first half, Trent’s delivery was a joke if I’m honest! Each one he put in was right on the money and he probably could have had four assists alone before half time. Credit to him, he was full of confidence today. We need to step up all over the pitch- with goals as well. Big Virgil has finally got his head on the ball so fair play to him! We all need to chip in with goals and assists. It’s not just the front three. It’s not just the defence that keeps clean sheets either. It’s a team game<br /><br /><b>[On PFA Player of the Year]</b> If the season ended tonight, I would give him it personally. There’s still 10 games to go, so somebody can step up from another team. But Virgil can take it to a whole new level, I reckon. He makes my life easier, that’s for sure! To have him next to me it makes everything so much easier. When somebody is running at you and you know Virgil is inside - he’s rarely out of position, if ever. For me, he’s the best centre back just now in the world. That’s the way he’s playing and the confidence he’s got. And he’s still young enough that he can get even better. He’s so consistent as well. If he puts the performances in during the last 10 games as he has done, there’s no reason why he shouldn’t have that trophy. The attacking players are usually in the running because they take all the goals and the headlines but this season Virgil has been fantastic and he’s getting all the plaudits that he deserved. It will be close if he doesn’t win it</p>

We had hard times in the second half and we had to push through that but we knew if we got a chance we have the players in the positions.

Even when we were going through the tough times in the second half, we still believed we were going to win the game and that’s the mentality we have. It maybe didn’t look likely at times but three points at the end of the day and looking at the league table that’s all that matters.

I want to keep producing and hopefully get more assists and maybe pitch in with a goal or two - but that doesn’t look likely!

Six games to go, hopefully I can get a couple more<br /><br /><b>[The manager]</b> wants me and Trent or whoever it is to create and the full-backs to be involved in attack.

At times it has not been there this season, my decision-making, Trent’s decision-making, but when we do make the right decision our balls in are usually pretty good and it’s all about the strikers taking it. Bobby’s header was fantastic and obviously I’m delighted for him as well<br /><br />Of course we’re all buzzing and probably still all are.

Manchester City had the advantage of going first this week and maybe they were hoping Tottenham could come here and get something and it looked that way for long periods of the second half. Who knows what that will do to them but I know for us it is just a big three points for us and it pushes on for the next six games</p>

A lot of teams might shy away from that and not have as good a season because of the knock-on effect, but I think we’ve done the complete opposite. That was our benchmark and we’ve taken it to a new level this season. Whether we end up with a trophy or not is yet to be seen, but the way our season has gone so far has been very positive</p>

Leicester City are a good team but Manchester City are unbelievable, they’ve had eight days to recover from a heavy schedule, so we are expecting City to get off to a good start so hopefully Leicester can hold on. We won’t expect anything but all we can do is take it down to the last game. We’ve done that so we’ll look forward to next Sunday.<br /><br />That’s us down to a tee this season. How many times have we done it? How many times have we been written off and people think ‘OK, this isn’t going to be our game’ or whatever? We just keep on coming back and we keep on scoring goals. I can’t explain it. But if we don’t do it next Sunday and City are crowned champions, we can be proud of what we’ve done, everyone. So we are in there, we’ve stuck together and hopefully we get 97 points</p>

Now he’s come back and he’s been doing well in training and scoring goals for the U23s. If he is involved or whatever then it’ll be incredible for him. He’s a confident lad and he’s got no doubt in his ability and neither does anyone at Melwood. When he gets his chance, it’s about showing it to everyone else because we know how good a player he is. Let’s see if he gets his chance. But, if not, then his chance is coming sooner rather than later.<br /><br />They’ve been fit and carried this squad obviously with the disappointment of not playing. But they’ve used it in the right way by putting 100 per cent in training and pushing the lads that are playing to their absolute maximum. That’s why I think the boys on the pitch have played so well this season - because we get pushed by the people off it. But people on the outside don’t really see that and the lads won’t get the credit they deserve, but the whole squad have been magnificent</p>

  <p><b>[Andy Robertson has embraced the pressure lumped on him at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> Up to this point, I’ve been happy with how the season’s gone. Probably at the start of the season <b>[there was]</b> a bit more pressure on me this time. I came in December time last season and just kind of managed to hit the ground running and didn’t really think about it. But people expected it of me this season and it’s up to them to decide. But I hope that I’ve not let them down and I’ve produced similar performances, which I think I have. Numbers - like clean sheets and assists - are a lot higher probably than last season and they’re the key numbers for me. Obviously next season when it comes to looking at that, I’ll be hoping to add more clean sheets and more assists because that means it’s part of a successful team. But we can worry about that another time and I just hope that I’ve got one more clean sheet and hopefully a couple more assists in me for the final of course. Let’s see.<br /><br />I believed it was possible, but it was all about how we used the disappointment of getting beat in the final. Luckily we used it to our advantage. We used that as motivation. We used it as motivation in pre-season - more so to get all the fitness in our legs, so we’re ready and the determination to get off to a good start in the season. Luckily we did that. I think teams can go one or two ways if they have that disappointment - it can easily set them back and they can struggle. Luckily we’ve not done that whatever happens in the final. But obviously we hope that we don’t have that feeling anymore because I still remember how I felt for even days after the cup final. It wasn’t a nice feeling but you want to be on the winning side - of course you do. We’ll be doing everything to not have that feeling again this year<br /><br />This team has been tested all season and people have questioned whether we can keep up with City, keep going with our title charge and keep going in the Champions League - ‘Should we concentrate on one of them?’. Of course we just fell short in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but we did keep up with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>. We took them right until the last day and they won it by a point. I think I said after the game, credit goes to them but we did push them and we had a hell of a season and, of course, disappointment. But <b>[it’s]</b> one we can look back on with pride when the time comes. Now we need to try to go and get a trophy because we feel that <b>[with]</b> everything we’ve put in this season then it would be amazing to cap it off like that. The way the fans have conducted themselves this season as well, they deserve a trophy after the disappointment of last season and obviously the last day of this season. We hope that we can do that for them and we hope we can do it for the club. That’s got to be our motivation</p>

  <p><b>[Andy Robertson says he is frustrated by the narrative that his career is a football fairytale]</b> Not many things bug me, but if there’s one thing that does, it’s the idea that my story is a football fairytale. I know when people say I’m some sort of Cinderella Man that it’s meant as a compliment. I appreciate that, but to be totally honest, it doesn’t feel like one, because it isn’t true. No magic wands have been waved in my direction, I didn’t win some kind of lottery to land a spot at one of the biggest clubs in the world. The reason why I’m a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> player is the same reason why I’m captain of my country: I’ve worked my bollocks off to get where I am, and by doing that, I’ve been able to make the most of whatever talent I have.<br /><br />Take <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a>, for example, the best centre-back in the world. How many coaches and scouts looked at him and thought he wasn’t destined for the top? He’ll tell you himself that there were plenty. <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>, one of the best finishers in the game today, was once discarded as not being good enough for a top <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> side. <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> must have lost count of the times he has had his ability questioned - although never by anyone who has been fortunate enough to work with him - and here he is on the brink of captaining <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in a second successive Champions League final.<br /><br />I could go on and on, I really could. If these were all fairy tales, we’d have more than Hans Christian Andersen. They’re not, though. They are all examples of hard work and commitment making the difference. The same applies to us as a team and to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as a club. We are where we are because of our work ethic and our belief that pretty much anything is possible. That’s the reason we were able to come back from 3-0 down against a great <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> team. We didn’t wait for fate to play its hand and hope that it would go in our favour, we forced fate to go our way and not even <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>, the best player I have ever set eyes on, could stop that<br /><br /><b>[It represents another chance at glory for Robertson and Co., and the defender says the entire dressing room knows what’s at stake]</b> It feels good to have another crack at this final. Nobody deserves it more than our supporters, who have backed us through the good times and the heartbreak. But like us, they will know that we are up against a top side in <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>. <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> and his players will be just as determined as we are to do something special in a final like this. The thing that matters most is that our fate is in our hands. We know that. And if there’s one thing I can guarantee about this team, about this group of players, it’s that we will stop at nothing to try to make our supporters’ dream come true. If that does happen, it won’t be a fairy tale. It’ll be because we deserve it</p>

  <p><b>[Andy Robertson revealed that his first day at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> didn’t exactly go to plan]</b> When I got the chance to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> with <a href="hull-city-fc.html">Hull City</a> in 2014, I had lived a lot of real life. My ambitions were always to be a solid SPL player. When I was landscaping and emptying the bins, I didn’t think I’d ever be playing Champions League football, especially for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. It’s funny, actually … a few clubs called when I was in preseason with Hull in 2017, but I wasn’t really that interested. My missus was pregnant, and we were in the process of getting everything ready for our big arrival - that was our top priority, like any expectant parents. Then I heard <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> wanted me. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. When you hear <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> want you, you call your agent back in about five seconds. I couldn’t sign the contract fast enough, to be honest.<br /><br /><b>[It was <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> who gave him that confidence, he said, even after the defender vomited on his first day as a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> player]</b> The medical took two days, and it was brutal. My diet was weird because the medical staff had to do so many tests to make sure I was fit and was going to stay fit. After I passed those tests, I had to go to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a> to do a lactate test. I was running it with Danny Ings, and after a few laps around the pitch, I felt something going on with my stomach. I knew things were going to get bad, but what can you do? I just kept running. A few minutes later, I’m on my knees, puking my guts out on the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a> pitch.<br /><br />This hallowed ground. This place where all these legends have trained. King Kenny. Rushie. <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Stevie Gerrard</a>. And here I am, some wee lad from Glasgow, spewing up in front of the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> medical staff. If first appearances count, God knows what they thought about me. The next day, I met the manager and I heard his laugh from a mile away. He’d obviously heard about my test. I turn around and he’s walking toward me, rubbing his belly and pointing at me. The staff behind him are having a laugh, too. Then he gave me a big hug. After that, I relaxed a bit</p>

A lot of people would say 97 points deserves <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, but it didn’t because <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> got 98. They were that little bit better than us in the end. We deserve nothing, only what we put into the game and what we get out. If we have 100 per cent effort and have a good game, play to our best, then we’ll deserve it. But we aren’t going into the game thinking we deserve it because we’ve had a good season and got 97 points. Never. That’d be stupid of us<br /><br /><b>[Robertson speaks with the kind of determination associated with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> heroes of the past]</b> Well we had that last season as well, remember, and we fell short. We let other people think about that once we’ve won it, and if they want to put our name next to them then so be it. We just think we need to win trophies to be a successful team. Whether that’s on Saturday or next season or the season after, we won’t stop trying. This club, the size of it, and these fans, deserve trophies. We know how hard it is to produce, we’ve found that out this season, but hopefully we can get over that final step and get the first trophy for the squad and the manager. It’s massive for all of us. The manager wants a trophy of course, because that’s the only way he’ll say he’s been successful. But we want trophies as well. It’s for everybody. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is a family and we’ll try and win it for everyone<br /><br />We’ve been ruthless this season, and we need to be ruthless again. But I’ve watched <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> over the last three or four years under <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> and they’re a ruthless team as well. They beat us last season and if they perform like that then we’ll be in for a hell of a game. At the top end of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, you have to be ruthless. Even just to get in the top four is hard. If we can take that into our game, I believe we have enough to win it, but we have to prove it.

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s Andy Robertson has lavished praise on team-mate <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a>]</b> Trent was outstanding all last season but he took it to another level at the end of it and became the best right-back in the world. He almost became our main man in the last 10 games of the season. What was it <b>[last season]</b>? Mid to high-20s contributing goals <b>[between us]</b>? It is going to be hard to replicate it, but if we get close it helps the team. But the clean sheets were as important for us. As a pair, I felt our Champions League final performance was as mature a performance as we put in. Once we had the lead we were thinking, ‘clean sheet and we win the game’, and we did that.<br /><br />Near the back end of the season we noticed the emphasis on trying to stop me and Trent doing what we try to do. It is up to us to adapt to that, but if someone is dedicating time to try and stop me and Trent, that is going to create a lot of space for other players. The quality we have got shows it is very difficult for anyone to focus on just one or two players. Someone else will pop up<br /><br />Nowadays there seems to be a lot of big money being spent on full-backs. I am not sure if you would have seen that 10 years ago. The position has changed a lot. When I was growing up and watching football there were outstanding full-backs, but more as part of the back four, there to help keep the clean sheet and let the others do their job. Slowly but surely the role started to evolve, with <a href="ashley-cole.html">Ashley Cole</a> one of the main reasons for that - how he played for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and Chelsea</p>

  <p><b>[Andy Robertson believes he has kicked on at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> There has been a lot happening in a relatively short period of time but I’ve loved every minute of it. Of course at the start it was a lot tougher, there was still a big learning curve for me at the time to realise the standard I had to get up to and how much I had to improve to play at this level. Luckily, I feel I made that step and I’ve kicked on from there. But I still feel I can improve a lot more and that’s what I aim to do season to season. Last season was a big season for me because there was a bit more expectation on me at the start because of the six months I had previously; I feel I managed to deal with that. This season there’ll probably be even more. I just look to add to it, keep putting in good performances and keep contributing to the team, like the manager and coaching staff want me to do<br /><br />When I signed, Mo and <a href="alex-oxlade-chamberlain.html">Chambo</a> had come in, so there was a lot more said about them and rightly so. I kind of went under the radar but it probably made it a bit harder for me because I wanted to get games under my belt to try to prove to the manager and my teammates, and the fans, that I could play at this level. At the start it didn’t quite get to that, so maybe people from the outside were thinking I couldn’t quite make that standard, which was probably one of my biggest worries at that point because I knew if I got my chance at least I could try to take it. I was delighted. Obviously the circumstances when Alberto <b>[Moreno]</b> got injured was bad timing for him, but I knew it was good timing for me, that I would have at least five or six games of being able to get up to speed. It took me maybe one or two games to get up to sharpness but once I did I felt as if I belonged in the team and could really contribute; luckily I started to show that and obviously everyone came on board and was happy I was at the club</p>

  <p><b>[Andrew Robertson is hopeful that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will return to full-strength quickly after a comprehensive pre-season friendly defeat against <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>]</b> The lads coming back, even if they don’t play, it gives you a lift when they train and with the way they go about their business. It doesn’t matter if they play on Wednesday or not, that’s completely up to the manager three days in, but that’s irrelevant: if they’re back in training and back around the place then it makes a difference. Mo and Bobby are two of our main men and Alisson was magnificent last season. They are huge characters in the changing room as well so that’ll be massive for us, and then Sadio will come back the following week. Once we get the whole team back together, and I think Shaq and Naby aren’t far off too, they’re players that are familiar around the set-up and around the system and that’s what we need. The quicker we get all of us back together then hopefully the better. But it’s not anyone else’s fault, the young lads or whatever who have come in, we’ve all not been good enough and maybe Bobby and Mo and people like that will give us the lift that we need. Hopefully, that does happen.<br /><br />They’ve been great <b>[throughout pre-season]</b> and when young kids come in it’s a breath of fresh air sometimes. <a href="harvey-elliott.html">Harvey Elliott</a> only signed this morning and he’s come on and done magnificently for 15 minutes. He’s only 16 years old and I think people forget that. Rhian’s had a great pre-season, <a href="harry-wilson.html">Harry Wilson</a> looked good when he came on today. Look, we need these players to push us and they need to push us in every single position and if they do that then the gaffer will give them the chance. Fair play to them, when they came on and we were all off then it did look better. I was watching and it looked a lot better than we felt in the first half so credit to them. But now it’s up to us to put in the performances, we’ve got one more game before it gets competitive and we need to get up to speed now</p>

Even when I came to the club <b>[in 2017]</b> he was amazing but maybe did not have as much composure as he does now in front of goal. Now every time he is front of goal you don’t think he will miss. The one he had at the start of the second half when <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Hendo</a> put him in, we were surprised he didn’t score. That is the type of player he is. You expect him to score and that is a good thing. He has popped up with another crucial goal.<br /><br />It has been a fantastic year for him and let’s hope he can keep going for a full season instead of a calendar year. That would help. The others are pitching in as well but it’s a fantastic year for him and he has taken his game to another level. Does he belong in the top bracket? I would say so. People are giving him more credit and that is deserved. Our front three gets talked about quite a lot. Maybe Bobby <b>[<a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>]</b> does not score as many as the other two but his work-rate is second to none and if he didn’t do what he does, Sadio and Mo <b>[<a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>]</b> would not do what they do. Hopefully all three can keep going as we are not even halfway through the season and we need them to keep going<br /><br /><b>[Robertson himself had been a doubt for the Palace game due to an ongoing ankle issue]</b> It is still painful but you know … It is something that I gave time for it to improve. Keeping it moving will help it, and hopefully in time it will be better. I was desperate to play and the gaffer asked me if I was okay, I believed I was and luckily I got through the game. Me and Mo were in the same position. Mo was desperate to play as well, but the manager made the decision and Mo was fine and accepted it. You don’t want to miss any games but if it means him missing one game rather than six, this is a big difference. Sometimes you need to be a bit clever. I have come through, Mo was not needed although he was stripped and ready, then Bobby scored and he sat back down! Hopefully that will give him more time to settle and hopefully he will be fine for midweek<br /><br /><b>[Reflecting on yet another late victory, Robertson delivered a wry smile]</b> Scoring late is good and enjoyable but we would much rather be 2-0 or 3-0 up and see out the game! We cannot keep relying on it but it is good we have that mentality and we didn’t panic because we have been in this position so many times. I think that is why we took control of the game and scored the winner. We are 30 games unbeaten <b>[in the league]</b> but I would rather it was 30 this season rather than split over two seasons! But people can talk all they want. We know how tough this league is. Every time you go to an away ground they want to beat you.

  <p><b>[Andy Robertson claims to be free of pain at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> For a few of us, definitely - people were maybe playing with knocks or injuries and it has given them a whole week to kind of clear them up. I know mine feels better, I feel closer to 100 per cent in terms of my body, which is always a positive. Being in training pain-free is always a nice thing, which maybe hasn’t happened in a couple of weeks leading up to that. To clear up any of that is a positive, for a week to just let your body recover. Hopefully we now have a strong finish to the season and we can see that the week was beneficial, and hopefully the results follow. But even if the worst-case scenario <b>[with results]</b>, in terms of injuries it has managed to get some lads back fit, which is so important for us<br /><br />To be honest, my body felt fine. I didn’t feel tired and it wasn’t tiredness. It was more the pain I was playing in at times. I pulled out of the Scotland squad in November with an injury and it probably continued on, then I took another knock on it and it probably got worse.<br /><br />A lot of us play through pain at times, that’s part and parcel of being a footballer. You need to be out there on a Saturday if you can. Where there’s a will there’s a way. A lot of us have showed that at times.<br /><br />For me, it was on my left foot, which is never the best. If it was on my right foot it probably wouldn’t even have been an injury. Being on your strong foot, it’s tough when you’re passing the ball and it’s sending pain up your leg.<br /><br />It’s hopefully a thing of the past, there’s been time to clear that up. I don’t feel I needed a rest physically, I felt as if I could still run for 90 minutes and do it at a good level. Those stats, I’m happy with them. I like to play games, I get paid to play games and it probably shows I’ve been doing a couple of things right if I’ve played that many games! I’m happy with the amount of games I’ve played and hopefully that continues for the next two seasons and so on. But when you get a week off you’ve got to take it.</p>

I believe that the referees are relying on VAR, but then VAR isn’t overturning any decisions, so we are stuck in limbo. I’d prefer not to have it and just let the referee call it. If the referee called it, you’d say ‘OK, he’s seen it differently’. But the fact we have about 40 cameras and 40 different angles, I believe the decisions should be right<br /><br />Obviously I’ve seen the video circulate since, and I shouldn’t have used the language that I did, but we were in a high-pressured game and emotions were on the line. I spoke to the referee and the officials in the tunnel after, and he explained what he thought he had seen - I respected that, not all referees do that - so fair play to him but I still thought he was in the wrong and that it was a penalty. That’s what we believe VAR was brought in to do <b>[to change the decision]</b>. For me, how that’s not a penalty, I still scratch my head over it</p>
