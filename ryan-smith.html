<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Ryan Smith pay tribute to departing manager Arsene Wenger]</b> He’s made the club what it is today. There’s been a lot of disgruntled fans and unhappiness around recent years. To transition from the Invincibles to now where we haven’t won the league since 2004 is obviously a frustrating situation, but at the same time we can’t just choose to remember him for the recent years. He has helped to get the club where it is today. As a man, he has tremendous knowledge of the game. You look at his track record with the players he has moulded into world class stars, Vieira, Henry and so on. The guy is a genius. My personal experiences with him are that he gave me my debut. I have everything to be thankful for because without that debut I probably wouldn’t be where I am today. It’s a sad time for me. It’s a decision some will be happy with and a lot people won’t. What I would urge is let’s not forget what he has done for this club. The new stadium is built off the success of the early years where he won the league and the double - I’m really sad to see him go.</p>
