  <p><b>[For the past 13 years, Chad Marshall and Drew Moor have shared a steady bond]</b> Back in the day, <b>[Moor]</b> was the same player he is now - just a hard-nosed defender, put in the work, great organizer. He’s going to give you an honest effort every single time he plays, and that’s all you want out of a teammate. I respect the way he approaches the game and the way he handles himself.<br /><br /><b>[Like Moor, Marshall is happy to be an MLS lifer holding down the fort for a squad filled with big names]</b> That was the most important reason going to Seattle - they were a team that never missed the playoffs and are always looking to make acquisitions to make their team better and play in big games. That was a huge factor in me wanting to come here</p>

  <p><b>[Stefan Frei makes save for the ages to help Sounders clinch title]</b> I thought it was in. I thought there was no way that <b>[Frei]</b> was getting to it, and somehow he gets a paw on it. It was ridiculous. The best save I’ve ever seen live.</p>

  <p><b>[Seattle Sounders center back Chad Marshall has announced his retirement midway through the 2019 MLS season]</b> After more than 15 years of living my childhood dream, the time has come for me to hang up the boots. I’d like to thank everyone that has played a part in my career. To my teammates, support staff and coaches: you’ve been my second family. The locker room is what I’ll miss the most. Thank you to the fans of Seattle and Columbus for supporting me throughout the years, as well as the Sounders FC and Columbus Crew SC organizations for giving me a chance to represent them on the field. Most importantly, I’d like to thank my family. I’m forever indebted to them for the sacrifices they’ve made in allowing me to pursue this dream. From heartbreaking losses to MLS Cup wins, own goals to cartwheels, it’s been a blast.</p>
