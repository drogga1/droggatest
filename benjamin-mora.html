  <p><b>[The new head coach of Johor Darul Ta’zim Benjamin Mora stated that he won’t be making any major changes ahead of their Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Cup clash against Kedah]</b> For now my focus is on the mentality. Trying to feel what it’s like to feel as a player going into the game and give them the moral support. The players know that this is the final. There won’t be any major changes. This team are ready and they will give their 100%.<br /><br />This team have been playing a lot under Gomez. He has left a legacy in this team but Mario and I are only here as guidance. The players are the ones who fight for the team. I only give them support. Maybe I would give two or three options to strengthen the team, but it’s the players that are most important<br /><br />Kedah are a good team. I know them because JDT II played against them last year. They like to play with the ball and they have some changes in the team so let’s see tomorrow. We know that every team wants to beat JDT because we are the champions. But I think Kedah need to know that we will give our best, especially since we are playing at our home ground</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Mora believes his players already gave their best to find the winner]</b> The condition of the game saw Kunanlan receive the two yellow cards but we fought hard and we tried to fix the situation in the second half, but we were up against a good Kedah side. But playing 45, 47 minutes with 10 men was not easy. My team did the best they could. We managed to hold on to the game. But this is what happened when it comes to penalty. It was difficult for both teams and Kedah took their chance to win.</p>

  <p><b>[Head coach of Johor Darul Ta’zim, Benjamin Mora is delighted that the Southern Tigers are through to the next round of the FA Cup]</b> Felda United was a tough team. They are a very good team. They have good management of the ball and good transition. But I think we did better than them. We showed that today. We were very good, especially in the first 20 minutes. We knew how to defend, and in the second half, we were better and the substitutions were very good. I am proud with my players.<br /><br />I always want to see my team winning the game. It was a different strategy from the game against Selangor but we are on the right path. If we continue to have the ball all the time, we are closer to winning. We have improved in set pieces and we are going to keep working hard and continue in doing this</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Mora is defiant that it is still a long way to go in the league season after JDT suffered their first loss in the Super League]</b> This is the way it is. I am occupied, I’m working what we need to work on. I know some players can upgrade their levels very fast. Also we had an injury in the first half that changed our plans. No pressure. I only want to work every day so that we can reclaim our title. It’s a long way to go yet.<br /><br />The result went wrong. We wanted to play from the outside and it was a little bit quite difficult. The pitch didn’t help very much. We couldn’t convert the two or three that we had. That’s the way it is. But this team Perak did a very good job. They fought, they press very good. We have possession of the ball most of the time but they were aggressive in their attacking phase. They were fast and play good football</p>

With tough games like these, fortunately we knew what to do. We did it well and the three points are good for us.<br /><br />The three wins in a row are very important. Every time we win, every time we played good, we gained confidence and teamwork</p>

We can score 2-0, 3-0, 3-1. We have won 3-1 there, so we can repeat the story. It doesn’t worry me that we now have to go back to Larkin and win.<br /><br />We need to fix the mistakes, but you get mistakes in these kinds of games, and they cost us the match. …Those mistakes are possible in these kinds of games, because everything factors in; the people, the pitch, the tension, the pressure on the players. We need to fix some individual mistakes, individual performances, and the team performance also<br /><br />We’re going to try to win at Larkin, and go to the semi-finals. This is only 90 minutes from 180. So this is half-time only!</p>

  <p><b>[JDT head coach Benjamin Mora is confident that his side will retain their top spot in the Super League]</b> …they didn’t have an attacking style of play, they were missing two important strikers, Safee <b>[Sali]</b> and Ronaldinho <b>[Patrick Wleh]</b>. That made it hard for them to cause us problems. Even so, they were a strong team; they pushed, they tackled, they fought, they had nothing to lose.<br /><br />That was their style, the two lines of four. They were very tucked in, they were very compact. It was difficult to break the line from the middle. So we needed to use Kunalan <b>[Subramaniam]</b>, Azrif Nasrulhaq, to create 2-versus-1 situations on the outside and move their team from side to side so maybe we can have opportunities, which was not something easy<br /><br />We made a mistake in not being aggressive enough to challenge for some of the balls, and they <b>[PKNS]</b> were agressive enough and kept pushing. We conceded a simple goal, but we knew that by having the ball and sticking to our style we would have opportunities<br /><br />I think we did well. The objective was to add points to our standings, to add more goals, and to leave Kedah and Pahang behind. That was our target and we succeeded. We are ahead and we’re not coming back. We’re going to be there for a long time, we’re going to work on things that we need to work on, and I’m very happy with my players</p>

  <p><b>[Safawi Rasid had a bad day in the office against PKNS]</b> He’s a 20 year old boy and he needs confidence. He hasn’t had a lot of minutes. He’s lacking the rhythm, timing and pace - that is not easy in football when playing with team mates that play the ball very fast. If we have a style to play long balls, long balls to Safawi, then it would easy for Safawi. But Safawi needs to connect with the other players. I don’t blame Safawi, it’s very fair and normal. He will play again. I love his style of play - very strong and willing. And I’m still confident he can perform.<br /><br />Maybe he’ll have minutes in Cambodia. He’s 85 - 90% ready</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Mora is planning to rotate his players to ensure that they will get maximum results from Boeung Ket and against Pahang]</b> We have to recover the players. We’re going with a full squad but I’m going to give some rest to the some of the players that I’m going to need for Pahang.<br /><br />I’m going to try to be intelligent in the strategy. The preparations is always continuous. We had a little change of tactical against Kelantan because we put two holding central midfielders and it worked for us. Because when we play away, others teams are stronger because of their pitch, people and country. So we’re going to be cautious and we’re going to be orderly. We’re not going there to defend but I think we need to be careful because we need the three points. We’re like to play good football but at this time, unnecessary for us<br /><br />I don’t worry about other teams. We don’t worry about Global. We need one point to qualify but we want three. Not only three but we want six but Magwe FC at home</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Mora hails JDT’s versatile squad members]</b> There is no such thing as ‘team A’ and ‘team B’ at JDT because every player is committed to the club. Each player we have now has shown that they are very committed. It was proven when Safawi and a few players were able to play as strikers in last night’s match because we didn’t have strikers since both strikers <b>[Brian <b>[Cabrera]</b> and Hazwan <b>[Bakri]</b>]</b> were injured. All JDT players are responsible enough and a hundred percent ready to play at any time.</p>

  <p><b>[JDT boss Benjamin Mora slams the referee for allegedly denying his side two clear penalties in their FA Cup match against Pahang]</b> You cannot fight with a team that wanted to win, against the referees. There were two clear fouls. We didn’t get the first one. But the second was as clear as blue sky. I never talked about referees. I respect them but today, it was clear that we should have received two penalties. For me it was a very bad call and it affected the game.<br /><br />That <b>[referee’s decision]</b> brought our spirit down but the players fought all the way throughout the whole game. If we play like this every single game, we are going to win the league. We pressed, we won all challenges and the second balls, we scored quickly and were unlucky that we didn’t score the third goal<br /><br />Whatever it is, I’m responsible and I think the players gave 100% but it is our fault because when we went for the away game we didn’t take full advantage for that. At the end of the day, it is our fault</p>

After we still controlled the game at the end and we managed to take three points from here.<br /><br />Yes, absolutely <b>[to rotating squad]</b>. We have 29 players who’s willing to fight for JDT.

The players gave their 120% and always tried to dominate the game from the start. Unfortunately, I feel we started with too much confidence until the opponents took advantage to score a goal in the second minute. To make a comeback after the opponents scored was not easy but we successfully dominated the game. The most important thing was the players did not let go of the chance to do their best and they worked hard until the end. I’m happy that they didn’t give up, and knew how important the victory was. And finally, we got the three points to ensure we progress to the next round</p>

  <p><b>[JDT’s Benjamin Mora rues dropped points but remains relatively happy with increased lead despite a 1-1 with Melaka United]</b> Of course <b>[points dropped]</b>. We had 3 points in our the pocket. Slight mistake in our concentration, we concede a goal that gives us only one point. Still we add points to our standings because Pahang lost. At one side good because we added one point. But the game at the end, not very good.<br /><br />You can analyse a lot of things in the game. Maybe if Gabby scored the one that hit the post, we win 3-0. We don’t really know. If we go back every second into the game, a lot of things can change. The thing is, we need to learn how to close the games when we’re winning. It happened to us over versus Pahang in the FA Cup. Last 3 minutes, they managed to score and we conceded and went out of the cup. This is a issue that we need to work on and need to fix. These things happen in football<br /><br />No <b>[not at fault]</b>. Dominic did a great game. He’s 19 years old, he’s learning. Of course playing for JDT at this level is not easy. You need to have the mindset. You need to have training. Normally defenders at some point in the game, make some mistakes. It’s normal in football. I don’t think it is Dominic’s mistake. You can analyse all the goals, come from things we didn’t do well before. I don’t blame nobody. I have to see the video again then I can make a better judgement to fix. But Dominic for me is a great player and a great prospect for JDT. He did a great job<br /><br />We’re doing ok. We’re doing fine. We’re top of the league with 6 points, it means 2 games. But we’re not going to sit back. We’re not going to hold back. We’re going hold the advantage with skills, with mindset and fight</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Mora claims emotions took over in the furor surrounding the post-match actions in the match against Melaka United]</b> With all due respect, I would like to express that I am a young coach with a lot to learn, with much hunger to win and to work day by day. I have well defined dreams, goals and objectives that I would very much like to pursue alongside JDT.<br /><br />I would like to say to Coach Williams that I respect him greatly and I have a lot to learn from him, a coach with experience that has obviously won more things than I have; I only feel respect and admiration for him<br /><br />I don’t understand why such a small matter was brought up to the media by Mr Williams. It was something between us only. We do not have to involve any party<br /><br />Mr Williams said whoever coaching JDT can easily win. The statement is accurate because JDT’s success since the Fandi Ahmad era until today is all thanks to HRH Crown Prince of Johor. The financial support given by His Royal Highness and His Royal Highness’ plans played huge roles. HRH Crown Prince of Johor is the individual behind every plan and infrastructure development of the club including signing all the players at JDT. In reality it has been the success of HRH Crown Prince of Johor as the leader alongside the management and players. JDT coaches only need to put in a little effort because most of the work is done by the management to achieve success. I am very lucky to be at a club like JDT<br /><br />As a young coach, I try to encourage to follow winning ideas with will, certainty and confidence in ourselves, but I know we still have a long way to go and grow as a team, step by step we are making our best effort. I wish to move forward with humility and hard work towards our goals and give many joys to the fans of Johor, they deserve the best</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Mora admits that the formation against Ceres left JDT slightly exposed but it was a necessary risk to take]</b> This was a very tough game. Ceres is a good team. In their offensive block, they play good football. They are fast. They are good individuals and they shape very well when they lose the ball. It was not easy for us but we fought every minute. Over there we must be very patient and very order because we lead 3-2. The away two goals may affect us if we are not concentrated to manage the game we want but we will work on it.<br /><br />We’re going be intelligent and open minded about how this team can affect us if we are too open. But we’re not going to be defensive, we’re not a defensive team, that is not our asset. We can mix and vary our team with good defence and organisation. We’re going to go minute by minute.<br /><br />Maybe <b>[too offensive XI]</b>. But I think if we are not an offensive in our home ground, what is there expect when we go away. Our style is to attack and to dominate the game by having the ball. Afiq is a great player and one of the best with the ball. Maybe we were too offensive but if you analyse - the goals were only counters and mistakes, we were not always under attack. But this team is quality and with one or two chances, they can take it<br /><br />I know the difficulties about not being 100% in the nutrition. But it’s also important for the boys to respect their religion and culture. We will make an effort to do the best we can so that it will not be such a problem</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Mora reacted to a change of tactics from PKNS, to ensure that JDT keep hold of their 6-point lead at the top]</b> This was not the formation we expected. They went with a 5-3-1-1 or a 5-3-2. At the beginning, the flanks were making some problems. Because we had a 4-2-3-1, very settled - hoping that we can have superiority on the flanks. Then we changed to a diamond four and that helped us to get a little strengthen in midfield. Gonzalo <b>[Cabrera]</b>, I put him inside to try to play behind number 11 <b>[Nazrin Syamsul]</b>, with Gabby <b>[Gabriel Guerra]</b> and <b>[Mohammed]</b> Ghaddar as the two strikers versus the right and left centre back. So yes, there was a little bit of surprise.<br /><br />I think the problem was not really there because PKNS style was not really for progressive attacks, just long balls to the sides behind our flanks. They make it difficult because they made our centre backs go out to the sides and then crossing for Patrick <b>[Ronaldinho Wleh]</b> and Matias <b>[Hadwa]</b> because they are strong and tall.<br /><br />PKNS always fight a lot. It seems a little bit odd that they are int he position that they are because they fight a lot and play not very bad. They managed to hold 0-0 but it wasn’t the best in terms of sharpness of the finishing. It’s normal, sometimes we can and sometimes we cannot. We need to manage and be patient to the moment<br /><br />Well, there’s two things. One is that Safiq a very intelligent player. An attacking midfielder who always gives very good passes to our strikers like Hazwan <b>[Bakri]</b>, Gabby and Gonzalo. They already know how to play because they play together in a lot of games. Now with Ghaddar inside and Safiq outside, it’s two changes. One is new and one is not there. It’s not an excuse because Ghaddar had 2 or 3 opportunities to score. That means we create the opportunities. At some point, we broke the lines, the difficulties of PKNS. Unfortunately, it was not the night of sharpness for Ghddar but that’s ok. He’s going to adapt as soon as possible to his team mates and he’s still a good striker. He will score goals</p>

  <p><b>[Tough start for Mohammed Ghaddar in life as JDT player]</b> I do not measure my players by if they score or if they save. That is something that he might have to do because he’s a striker. But he tried and he ran. He went into the box and he shoot 2 - 3 times. Of course as a striker to not score, it’s a little frustrating for them. But I’m satisfied because he gave his best. He was a little bit upset about not being very sharp but I’m totally satisfied with Ghaddar.</p>

I’m very sad because I want a victory of course. These kind of games when you lose in the minute 92 for any reason, it hurts a lot because you have the game almost there.<br /><br />We JDT invest a lot of money in this team.
