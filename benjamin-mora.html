<blockquote>
  <p>[The new head coach of Johor Darul Ta’zim Benjamin Mora stated that he won’t be making any major changes ahead of their Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Cup clash against Kedah] For now my focus is on the mentality. Trying to feel what it’s like to feel as a player going into the game and give them the moral support. The players know that this is the final. There won’t be any major changes. This team are ready and they will give their 100%.<br /><br />This team have been playing a lot under Gomez. He has left a legacy in this team but Mario and I are only here as guidance. The players are the ones who fight for the team. I only give them support. Maybe I would give two or three options to strengthen the team, but it’s the players that are most important<br /><br />Kedah are a good team. I know them because JDT II played against them last year. They like to play with the ball and they have some changes in the team so let’s see tomorrow. We know that every team wants to beat JDT because we are the champions. But I think Kedah need to know that we will give our best, especially since we are playing at our home ground</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Benjamin Mora believes his players already gave their best to find the winner] The condition of the game saw Kunanlan receive the two yellow cards but we fought hard and we tried to fix the situation in the second half, but we were up against a good Kedah side. But playing 45, 47 minutes with 10 men was not easy. My team did the best they could. We managed to hold on to the game. But this is what happened when it comes to penalty. It was difficult for both teams and Kedah took their chance to win.</p>
