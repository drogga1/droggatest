  <p><b>[The new head coach of Johor Darul Ta’zim Benjamin Mora stated that he won’t be making any major changes ahead of their Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Cup clash against Kedah]</b> For now my focus is on the mentality. Trying to feel what it’s like to feel as a player going into the game and give them the moral support. The players know that this is the final. There won’t be any major changes. This team are ready and they will give their 100%.<br /><br />This team have been playing a lot under Gomez. He has left a legacy in this team but Mario and I are only here as guidance. The players are the ones who fight for the team. I only give them support. Maybe I would give two or three options to strengthen the team, but it’s the players that are most important<br /><br />Kedah are a good team. I know them because JDT II played against them last year. They like to play with the ball and they have some changes in the team so let’s see tomorrow. We know that every team wants to beat JDT because we are the champions. But I think Kedah need to know that we will give our best, especially since we are playing at our home ground</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Mora believes his players already gave their best to find the winner]</b> The condition of the game saw Kunanlan receive the two yellow cards but we fought hard and we tried to fix the situation in the second half, but we were up against a good Kedah side. But playing 45, 47 minutes with 10 men was not easy. My team did the best they could. We managed to hold on to the game. But this is what happened when it comes to penalty. It was difficult for both teams and Kedah took their chance to win.</p>

  <p><b>[Head coach of Johor Darul Ta’zim, Benjamin Mora is delighted that the Southern Tigers are through to the next round of the FA Cup]</b> Felda United was a tough team. They are a very good team. They have good management of the ball and good transition. But I think we did better than them. We showed that today. We were very good, especially in the first 20 minutes. We knew how to defend, and in the second half, we were better and the substitutions were very good. I am proud with my players.<br /><br />I always want to see my team winning the game. It was a different strategy from the game against Selangor but we are on the right path. If we continue to have the ball all the time, we are closer to winning. We have improved in set pieces and we are going to keep working hard and continue in doing this</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Mora is defiant that it is still a long way to go in the league season after JDT suffered their first loss in the Super League]</b> This is the way it is. I am occupied, I’m working what we need to work on. I know some players can upgrade their levels very fast. Also we had an injury in the first half that changed our plans. No pressure. I only want to work every day so that we can reclaim our title. It’s a long way to go yet.<br /><br />The result went wrong. We wanted to play from the outside and it was a little bit quite difficult. The pitch didn’t help very much. We couldn’t convert the two or three that we had. That’s the way it is. But this team Perak did a very good job. They fought, they press very good. We have possession of the ball most of the time but they were aggressive in their attacking phase. They were fast and play good football</p>

  <p><b>[Head coach of Johor Darul Ta’zim <b>[JDT]</b>, Benjamin Mora believed that his team did really well in overcoming league leaders Pahang]</b> Pahang is a good team, but I think we are better than them and we showed that on the pitch. With tough games like these, fortunately we knew what to do. We did it well and the three points are good for us.<br /><br />The three wins in a row are very important. Every time we win, every time we played good, we gained confidence and teamwork</p>

  <p><b>[Johor Darul Ta’zim head coach Benjamin Mora is unperturbed by his side’s 3-1 defeat to Pahang in the first leg of their quarter-final FA Cup tie]</b> The scoreline <b>[margin]</b> seems a little big, but at home we are very good. We can score 2-0, 3-0, 3-1. We have won 3-1 there, so we can repeat the story. It doesn’t worry me that we now have to go back to Larkin and win.<br /><br />We need to fix the mistakes, but you get mistakes in these kinds of games, and they cost us the match. …Those mistakes are possible in these kinds of games, because everything factors in; the people, the pitch, the tension, the pressure on the players. We need to fix some individual mistakes, individual performances, and the team performance also<br /><br />We’re going to try to win at Larkin, and go to the semi-finals. This is only 90 minutes from 180. So this is half-time only!</p>

  <p><b>[JDT head coach Benjamin Mora is confident that his side will retain their top spot in the Super League]</b> …they didn’t have an attacking style of play, they were missing two important strikers, Safee <b>[Sali]</b> and Ronaldinho <b>[Patrick Wleh]</b>. That made it hard for them to cause us problems. Even so, they were a strong team; they pushed, they tackled, they fought, they had nothing to lose.<br /><br />That was their style, the two lines of four. They were very tucked in, they were very compact. It was difficult to break the line from the middle. So we needed to use Kunalan <b>[Subramaniam]</b>, Azrif Nasrulhaq, to create 2-versus-1 situations on the outside and move their team from side to side so maybe we can have opportunities, which was not something easy<br /><br />We made a mistake in not being aggressive enough to challenge for some of the balls, and they <b>[PKNS]</b> were agressive enough and kept pushing. We conceded a simple goal, but we knew that by having the ball and sticking to our style we would have opportunities<br /><br />I think we did well. The objective was to add points to our standings, to add more goals, and to leave Kedah and Pahang behind. That was our target and we succeeded. We are ahead and we’re not coming back. We’re going to be there for a long time, we’re going to work on things that we need to work on, and I’m very happy with my players</p>

  <p><b>[Safawi Rasid had a bad day in the office against PKNS]</b> He’s a 20 year old boy and he needs confidence. He hasn’t had a lot of minutes. He’s lacking the rhythm, timing and pace - that is not easy in football when playing with team mates that play the ball very fast. If we have a style to play long balls, long balls to Safawi, then it would easy for Safawi. But Safawi needs to connect with the other players. I don’t blame Safawi, it’s very fair and normal. He will play again. I love his style of play - very strong and willing. And I’m still confident he can perform.<br /><br />Maybe he’ll have minutes in Cambodia. He’s 85 - 90% ready</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Mora is planning to rotate his players to ensure that they will get maximum results from Boeung Ket and against Pahang]</b> We have to recover the players. We’re going with a full squad but I’m going to give some rest to the some of the players that I’m going to need for Pahang.<br /><br />I’m going to try to be intelligent in the strategy. The preparations is always continuous. We had a little change of tactical against Kelantan because we put two holding central midfielders and it worked for us. Because when we play away, others teams are stronger because of their pitch, people and country. So we’re going to be cautious and we’re going to be orderly. We’re not going there to defend but I think we need to be careful because we need the three points. We’re like to play good football but at this time, unnecessary for us<br /><br />I don’t worry about other teams. We don’t worry about Global. We need one point to qualify but we want three. Not only three but we want six but Magwe FC at home</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Mora hails JDT’s versatile squad members]</b> There is no such thing as ‘team A’ and ‘team B’ at JDT because every player is committed to the club. Each player we have now has shown that they are very committed. It was proven when Safawi and a few players were able to play as strikers in last night’s match because we didn’t have strikers since both strikers <b>[Brian <b>[Cabrera]</b> and Hazwan <b>[Bakri]</b>]</b> were injured. All JDT players are responsible enough and a hundred percent ready to play at any time.</p>

  <p><b>[JDT boss Benjamin Mora slams the referee for allegedly denying his side two clear penalties in their FA Cup match against Pahang]</b> You cannot fight with a team that wanted to win, against the referees. There were two clear fouls. We didn’t get the first one. But the second was as clear as blue sky. I never talked about referees. I respect them but today, it was clear that we should have received two penalties. For me it was a very bad call and it affected the game.<br /><br />That <b>[referee’s decision]</b> brought our spirit down but the players fought all the way throughout the whole game. If we play like this every single game, we are going to win the league. We pressed, we won all challenges and the second balls, we scored quickly and were unlucky that we didn’t score the third goal<br /><br />Whatever it is, I’m responsible and I think the players gave 100% but it is our fault because when we went for the away game we didn’t take full advantage for that. At the end of the day, it is our fault</p>
