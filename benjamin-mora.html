  <p>[The new head coach of Johor Darul Ta’zim Benjamin Mora stated that he won’t be making any major changes ahead of their Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Cup clash against Kedah] For now my focus is on the mentality. Trying to feel what it’s like to feel as a player going into the game and give them the moral support. The players know that this is the final. There won’t be any major changes. This team are ready and they will give their 100%.<br /><br />This team have been playing a lot under Gomez. He has left a legacy in this team but Mario and I are only here as guidance. The players are the ones who fight for the team. I only give them support. Maybe I would give two or three options to strengthen the team, but it’s the players that are most important<br /><br />Kedah are a good team. I know them because JDT II played against them last year. They like to play with the ball and they have some changes in the team so let’s see tomorrow. We know that every team wants to beat JDT because we are the champions. But I think Kedah need to know that we will give our best, especially since we are playing at our home ground</p>

  <p>[Benjamin Mora believes his players already gave their best to find the winner] The condition of the game saw Kunanlan receive the two yellow cards but we fought hard and we tried to fix the situation in the second half, but we were up against a good Kedah side. But playing 45, 47 minutes with 10 men was not easy. My team did the best they could. We managed to hold on to the game. But this is what happened when it comes to penalty. It was difficult for both teams and Kedah took their chance to win.</p>

  <p>[Head coach of Johor Darul Ta’zim, Benjamin Mora is delighted that the Southern Tigers are through to the next round of the FA Cup] Felda United was a tough team. They are a very good team. They have good management of the ball and good transition. But I think we did better than them. We showed that today. We were very good, especially in the first 20 minutes. We knew how to defend, and in the second half, we were better and the substitutions were very good. I am proud with my players.<br /><br />I always want to see my team winning the game. It was a different strategy from the game against Selangor but we are on the right path. If we continue to have the ball all the time, we are closer to winning. We have improved in set pieces and we are going to keep working hard and continue in doing this</p>

  <p>[Benjamin Mora is defiant that it is still a long way to go in the league season after JDT suffered their first loss in the Super League] This is the way it is. I am occupied, I’m working what we need to work on. I know some players can upgrade their levels very fast. Also we had an injury in the first half that changed our plans. No pressure. I only want to work every day so that we can reclaim our title. It’s a long way to go yet.<br /><br />The result went wrong. We wanted to play from the outside and it was a little bit quite difficult. The pitch didn’t help very much. We couldn’t convert the two or three that we had. That’s the way it is. But this team Perak did a very good job. They fought, they press very good. We have possession of the ball most of the time but they were aggressive in their attacking phase. They were fast and play good football</p>

  <p>[Head coach of Johor Darul Ta’zim [JDT], Benjamin Mora believed that his team did really well in overcoming league leaders Pahang] Pahang is a good team, but I think we are better than them and we showed that on the pitch. With tough games like these, fortunately we knew what to do. We did it well and the three points are good for us.<br /><br />The three wins in a row are very important. Every time we win, every time we played good, we gained confidence and teamwork</p>
