  <p>[Aizawl FC are on a good run of form, having bagged 7 points from a possible 9 in the I-League so far] I’m very happy because my boys never lost their concentration [after the penalty]. They played positive football and I’m happy with it. We deserve the 3 points today. We played to our best and we won. I’m already looking forward to the next match. All our players are playing well. Albino Gomes’ anticipation was good for the first penalty. He almost saved 2nd penalty too. Lalruatthara kept running up and down. Jayesh [Rane] played well. [Mahmoud] Al-Amenah too.<br /><br />I thought the first one was a penalty and the second one, I couldn’t see. I think the referee knows better. He is closer to the incident. As we’ve won the game, we do not have any problem<br /><br />[On Kamo Stephane Bayi] He was present in the final team practice [before the game] but he was not perfect. He was 50-50 with respect to participating in the match. In the warm-ps, he felt some pain again and I did not want to take a chance<br /><br />Definitely [It is an advantage]. I’m going there to get 3 points for Aizawl FC</p>

  <p>[Aizawl FC registered their fifth 1-0 victory this season as they downed Chennai City FC on Saturday evening at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium] We [Aizawl FC] have won the match and that’s the most important thing. All the credit go to the boys who worked very hard and played as a unit. They tried hard and got the goal.<br /><br />I never said I’m looking for a replacement for Kamo [Bayi]. The journalist stated that you can add one more striker and I liked the idea. I said that I’ll think about it. So, maybe I will look for an Indian striker or maybe a local boy. Maybe, he [the recruit] could support Kamo [Bayi]. It’s a good idea and I liked his opinion. I haven’t confirmed it but I’ll consider it. And talking about Kamo [Bayi], I am satisfied with how he plays. He created many chances versus Chennai City<br /><br />The fans’ support is unbelievable. They support every player and because of them the players are playing. I thank the crowd for their support<br /><br />[Why his team weren’t able to convert a superior ball possession over the opponent into goals] We need the final touch on good deliveries</p>

  <p>[Aizawl FC’s Khalid Jamil - ‘The players were aware of East Bengal’s result’] They played better just like the last time we played them. All the credit is for the boys. In the half-time, there was a bit of belief in the team as they were aware of East Bengal’s score. They wanted to do something. I’m not thinking about wining the league. We’re only thinking about the next game. Still, there is a long way to go. We are playing Minerva next, it will be a tough game. The players are working very hard and have a good rapport with each other. We are getting support everywhere and they want to do something for the fans.</p>
