  <p><b>[Aizawl FC are on a good run of form, having bagged 7 points from a possible 9 in the I-League so far]</b> I’m very happy because my boys never lost their concentration <b>[after the penalty]</b>. They played positive football and I’m happy with it. We deserve the 3 points today. We played to our best and we won. I’m already looking forward to the next match. All our players are playing well. Albino Gomes’ anticipation was good for the first penalty. He almost saved 2nd penalty too. Lalruatthara kept running up and down. Jayesh <b>[Rane]</b> played well. <b>[Mahmoud]</b> Al-Amenah too.<br /><br />I thought the first one was a penalty and the second one, I couldn’t see. I think the referee knows better. He is closer to the incident. As we’ve won the game, we do not have any problem<br /><br /><b>[On Kamo Stephane Bayi]</b> He was present in the final team practice <b>[before the game]</b> but he was not perfect. He was 50-50 with respect to participating in the match. In the warm-ps, he felt some pain again and I did not want to take a chance<br /><br />Definitely <b>[It is an advantage]</b>. I’m going there to get 3 points for Aizawl FC</p>

  <p><b>[Aizawl FC registered their fifth 1-0 victory this season as they downed Chennai City FC on Saturday evening at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium]</b> We <b>[Aizawl FC]</b> have won the match and that’s the most important thing. All the credit go to the boys who worked very hard and played as a unit. They tried hard and got the goal.<br /><br />I never said I’m looking for a replacement for Kamo <b>[Bayi]</b>. The journalist stated that you can add one more striker and I liked the idea. I said that I’ll think about it. So, maybe I will look for an Indian striker or maybe a local boy. Maybe, he <b>[the recruit]</b> could support Kamo <b>[Bayi]</b>. It’s a good idea and I liked his opinion. I haven’t confirmed it but I’ll consider it. And talking about Kamo <b>[Bayi]</b>, I am satisfied with how he plays. He created many chances versus Chennai City<br /><br />The fans’ support is unbelievable. They support every player and because of them the players are playing. I thank the crowd for their support<br /><br /><b>[Why his team weren’t able to convert a superior ball possession over the opponent into goals]</b> We need the final touch on good deliveries</p>

  <p><b>[Aizawl FC’s Khalid Jamil - ‘The players were aware of East Bengal’s result’]</b> They played better just like the last time we played them. All the credit is for the boys. In the half-time, there was a bit of belief in the team as they were aware of East Bengal’s score. They wanted to do something. I’m not thinking about wining the league. We’re only thinking about the next game. Still, there is a long way to go. We are playing Minerva next, it will be a tough game. The players are working very hard and have a good rapport with each other. We are getting support everywhere and they want to do something for the fans.</p>

  <p><b>[Aizawl FC boss Khalid Jamil, who has just turned 40, presented an optimistic picture ahead of the game]</b> I feel good. We have to play well tomorrow. We’re playing a good side. The players have done well. The credit for our season goes to all the players. There is pressure for Mohun Bagan also right. They also have to give everything. We cannot take this match lightly too. We need everybody to support us 100%. We have the home advantage also.</p>

  <p><b>[Khalid Jamil says Aizawl FC still have one match to go]</b> We still have one match to go. That is a very important match. Shillong Lajong are a difficult opponent to face.<br /><br />It was good. We are very happy with the support our fans have shown and this win was for them. But now we need their support in the next match also. I asked the supporters to give their hundred per cent, and they delivered<br /><br />Shillong are a good side. But at the same time, Mohun Bagan play Chennai City FC and they’re also a very good side. So let’s wait till the final matchday to see what happens<br /><br />The boys are working very hard. Focussing in the training. Giving their all in the matches. And they’re enjoying every moment. Everybody was playing with great intent today. From Albino <b>[Gomes]</b>, Ashutosh <b>[Mehta]</b> to Kamo <b>[Bayi]</b>, goalscorer Zotea <b>[Zohmingliana Ralte]</b>, everyone gave their all<br /><br /><b>[Sanjoy Sen had remarked that his Mohun Bagan side were better than Aizawl]</b> I don’t have any comments about it, but they are a very good side and there’s no doubt about it<br /><br /><b>[When asked if a title charge was on their minds when the season began]</b> No, we never had that in mind. But as the games went on, we realized it could be possible. But the credit goes to the players who have given their all this season<br /><br /><b>[On fighting for the title instead of for survival]</b> It is a huge difference. And it also feels very good!<br /><br /><b>[Before closing up, he was asked about the champions tag associated to his side already]</b> Let’s see after the next match</p>

  <p><b>[Aizawl FC manager Khalid Jamil - There is obviously pressure to perform but as a coach you need to be in control]</b> It is always difficult to play against Thangboi’s Lajong. I always find it very difficult to beat Lajong or play against Lajong because it is very difficult. Difficult means it is very tough for us specially to play in their home. They play very compact, defensively they are very strong and when you come to play here attacking wise they are very good again and looking at their striker he’s done a good job; Dicka high scorer of the League. That’s why I say it is very tough, always. Most of the time when I play against him; not successful. Maybe I’ve won once but only once<br /><br /><b>[Jamil said that there had been no change in preparation particularly for this encounter]</b> There has been no change in the preparation. No changes from how we prepared for the first match. Just go, give your best and just keep in your match this is the last match, finish should be good because you are going to play with a solid good team. It is always very difficult, it will be very difficult so you have to be 100 % and not take things very lightly<br /><br />I must say that pressure is there but as a coach you must be in control. If you go out of control everything will go out of control too so pressure is there no doubt. As I said we are playing a good team, it will not be an easy match so in preparation term you cannot change anything</p>

  <p><b>[Aizawl FC’s Khalid Jamil says It was my dream to win the I-League]</b> It is my dream. Every time I start a season it is my dream to win the I-League. First I was thinking it will take me two-to-three-or-possibly even six years because it was not realistic to win right away. I will stay. I love Aizawl.<br /><br />It is all because of the players and the good support of the fans. I have only one word, ‘Thank You for supporting us’. They give their hundred per cent and always supported us from the first to the 90th minute. Whether at home or away. In all the away fans too, I’ve seen many fans. Thats why I say first the players then the fans<br /><br />Yes, I was a little bit nervous. We worked hard and all the players did a good job. I was thinking if we could make it or not<br /><br />Only one thing which is ‘You will not get another 45 minutes. This is the last 45 minutes. Just go there and do extra <b>[bit of work]</b>.’ Okay you are playing good but extra should be there. Not from only one player but from all the players that are playing. So when you think about it, we can do it. That was all I said<br /><br />I just give the credit all to the boys. Really it is not about me, all the boys who played continuously for 15-to-16 matches. Alfred <b>[Jaryan]</b> missed this match <b>[due to suspension]</b> otherwise he plays all the games. All the credit goes to the boys only<br /><br /><b>[There is a good chance that Aizawl may not be included in next season’s top division league]</b> We haven’t thought about it yet but wherever we play, we will play well</p>

  <p><b>[New East Bengal gaffer Khalid Jamil is not pleased by the fact that most players are preferring to play the Indian Super League rather than the I-League in the upcoming season]</b> It’s not a good trend. Teams like East Bengal and Mohun Bagan are big clubs with rich legacy. Somehow we have to find a way where we can get the star players. Otherwise the fans will not come to watch East Bengal or Mohun Bagan play. It’s a challenging time for the I-League clubs.<br /><br />I am excited to be part of East Bengal and a bit nervous too. Yes, expectations are high but when I decided to take the East Bengal offer I knew that there will enormous pressure on me to deliver. I am ready to face that.<br /><br />I had a meeting with the players on Sunday. The first week will be vital. And I will get all foreigners by July 27. As of now we will be practicing at the club ground. I was thinking about a residential camp in Kalyani. May be in the second week, when the foreign recruits also join</p>
