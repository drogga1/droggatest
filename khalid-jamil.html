  <p><b>[Aizawl FC are on a good run of form, having bagged 7 points from a possible 9 in the I-League so far]</b> I’m very happy because my boys never lost their concentration <b>[after the penalty]</b>. They played positive football and I’m happy with it. We deserve the 3 points today. We played to our best and we won. I’m already looking forward to the next match. All our players are playing well. Albino Gomes’ anticipation was good for the first penalty. He almost saved 2nd penalty too. Lalruatthara kept running up and down. Jayesh <b>[Rane]</b> played well. <b>[Mahmoud]</b> Al-Amenah too.<br /><br />I thought the first one was a penalty and the second one, I couldn’t see. I think the referee knows better. He is closer to the incident. As we’ve won the game, we do not have any problem<br /><br /><b>[On Kamo Stephane Bayi]</b> He was present in the final team practice <b>[before the game]</b> but he was not perfect. He was 50-50 with respect to participating in the match. In the warm-ps, he felt some pain again and I did not want to take a chance<br /><br />Definitely <b>[It is an advantage]</b>. I’m going there to get 3 points for Aizawl FC</p>

  <p><b>[Aizawl FC registered their fifth 1-0 victory this season as they downed Chennai City FC on Saturday evening at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium]</b> We <b>[Aizawl FC]</b> have won the match and that’s the most important thing. All the credit go to the boys who worked very hard and played as a unit. They tried hard and got the goal.<br /><br />I never said I’m looking for a replacement for Kamo <b>[Bayi]</b>. The journalist stated that you can add one more striker and I liked the idea. I said that I’ll think about it. So, maybe I will look for an Indian striker or maybe a local boy. Maybe, he <b>[the recruit]</b> could support Kamo <b>[Bayi]</b>. It’s a good idea and I liked his opinion. I haven’t confirmed it but I’ll consider it. And talking about Kamo <b>[Bayi]</b>, I am satisfied with how he plays. He created many chances versus Chennai City<br /><br />The fans’ support is unbelievable. They support every player and because of them the players are playing. I thank the crowd for their support<br /><br /><b>[Why his team weren’t able to convert a superior ball possession over the opponent into goals]</b> We need the final touch on good deliveries</p>

  <p><b>[Aizawl FC’s Khalid Jamil - ‘The players were aware of East Bengal’s result’]</b> They played better just like the last time we played them. All the credit is for the boys. In the half-time, there was a bit of belief in the team as they were aware of East Bengal’s score. They wanted to do something. I’m not thinking about wining the league. We’re only thinking about the next game. Still, there is a long way to go. We are playing Minerva next, it will be a tough game. The players are working very hard and have a good rapport with each other. We are getting support everywhere and they want to do something for the fans.</p>

  <p><b>[Aizawl FC boss Khalid Jamil, who has just turned 40, presented an optimistic picture ahead of the game]</b> I feel good. We have to play well tomorrow. We’re playing a good side. The players have done well. The credit for our season goes to all the players. There is pressure for Mohun Bagan also right. They also have to give everything. We cannot take this match lightly too. We need everybody to support us 100%. We have the home advantage also.</p>

  <p><b>[Khalid Jamil says Aizawl FC still have one match to go]</b> We still have one match to go. That is a very important match. Shillong Lajong are a difficult opponent to face.<br /><br />It was good. We are very happy with the support our fans have shown and this win was for them. But now we need their support in the next match also. I asked the supporters to give their hundred per cent, and they delivered<br /><br />Shillong are a good side. But at the same time, Mohun Bagan play Chennai City FC and they’re also a very good side. So let’s wait till the final matchday to see what happens<br /><br />The boys are working very hard. Focussing in the training. Giving their all in the matches. And they’re enjoying every moment. Everybody was playing with great intent today. From Albino <b>[Gomes]</b>, Ashutosh <b>[Mehta]</b> to Kamo <b>[Bayi]</b>, goalscorer Zotea <b>[Zohmingliana Ralte]</b>, everyone gave their all<br /><br /><b>[Sanjoy Sen had remarked that his Mohun Bagan side were better than Aizawl]</b> I don’t have any comments about it, but they are a very good side and there’s no doubt about it<br /><br /><b>[When asked if a title charge was on their minds when the season began]</b> No, we never had that in mind. But as the games went on, we realized it could be possible. But the credit goes to the players who have given their all this season<br /><br /><b>[On fighting for the title instead of for survival]</b> It is a huge difference. And it also feels very good!<br /><br /><b>[Before closing up, he was asked about the champions tag associated to his side already]</b> Let’s see after the next match</p>
