<blockquote>
  <p>[Aizawl FC are on a good run of form, having bagged 7 points from a possible 9 in the I-League so far] I’m very happy because my boys never lost their concentration [after the penalty]. They played positive football and I’m happy with it. We deserve the 3 points today. We played to our best and we won. I’m already looking forward to the next match. All our players are playing well. Albino Gomes’ anticipation was good for the first penalty. He almost saved 2nd penalty too. Lalruatthara kept running up and down. Jayesh [Rane] played well. [Mahmoud] Al-Amenah too.<br /><br />I thought the first one was a penalty and the second one, I couldn’t see. I think the referee knows better. He is closer to the incident. As we’ve won the game, we do not have any problem<br /><br />[On Kamo Stephane Bayi] He was present in the final team practice [before the game] but he was not perfect. He was 50-50 with respect to participating in the match. In the warm-ps, he felt some pain again and I did not want to take a chance<br /><br />Definitely [It is an advantage]. I’m going there to get 3 points for Aizawl FC</p>
