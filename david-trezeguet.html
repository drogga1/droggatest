  <p><b>[David Trezeguet has announced that he has reconsidered and will certainly not be turning out for les Bleus again]</b> During my time out injured, I took time to reflect. I analysed the last four years with <b>[French head coach Raymond]</b> <a href="raymond-domenech.html">Domenech</a> as well as what happened before and after the Euros. I am not someone who forgets things and changes his way of thinking. The FFF decided to continue with <a href="raymond-domenech.html">Domenech</a>, too bad for them! I am not in harmony with the functioning of the French team</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus striker David Trezeguet talked about equalling Omar Sivori’s goalscoring record in tonight’s 5-2 win away to Atalanta]</b> I’m very happy, I’ve achieved a very important personal target, reaching Omar Sivori is not something I expected when I arrived at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>. But the most important thing is that we played a fine game, we showed we have found back the desire and that we are tough. We’re happy, a bit tired too because the pitch was a bit heavy, but in the end we managed to win a very important match<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he expected to be the team’s top scorer at this point of the season, with six goals]</b> During the summer I prepared well, I worked a lot, unfortunately my team mates suffered some injuries, I also had the faith of the coach. I’m working a lot, I’m happy, it’s a revenge after what happened last year, first the injury, then the choices of the coach who left me out of the team. For me this is a year of vengeance and I’m very glad because I feel good, the team are doing well, we have a very strong group and if I’ve arrived at this point I have to thank my team mates. The Scudetto? We believe in it, first we have to find consistency, we have 15 days to work, with the return of a few injured players, then an important phase starts for us. The most important thing is that today we showed we are back</p>

  <p><b>[Perhaps the defining image of Euro 2000 is the joy and wonder on David Trezeguet’s face after he had scored the Golden Goal that won the trophy for France]</b> At first I was happy for my team-mates; then I was happy for my family; and then I was happy for me. We had dreamed of being champions of the world and Europe. It gave me enormous satisfaction at the time and it’s a satisfaction I still feel. It had been a difficult championship for me because I had hoped to play a greater part. I think Italy were more affected by fatigue than we were and, on top of that, they had to face a mental challenge after not winning a match they practically had in the bag. We knew we had to concentrate on playing to our qualities and strengths – and we took our chance. It started with a great move by <a href="robert-pires.html">Robert Pires</a> on our left. He dribbled past <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Fabio Cannavaro</a> and got to the byline. Then he put in a cross that was fairly difficult, but I was on the penalty spot and I hit the ball as it dropped. It went in and we became the first team to win the European Championship after winning the World Cup. It was a great thing for our country.</p>

He needs to be given time. He enjoys it, he’s happy, he’s proud. At his age, that’s something unique. People are talking a lot about his future. Personally, I hope he’ll stay at Monaco to continue showing his qualities, but above all establish himself as a player. We mustn’t forget he’s just 18 years old. He has time to get to know the top level, even if he’s at a club of a very high level. Everyone wants to play for Real, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a>, <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> with time</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> Star David Trezeguet Talks His Favourite Teammates, Hardest Opponents]</b> At <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, I learned to always want to win and be a protagonist. The Italian one is the toughest league of all for the attackers. I was impressed to see many players of the highest level, such as <a href="alessandro-del-piero.html">Del Piero</a>, <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>, stopping after training to improve<br /><br />In <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> there were people like <b>[Paolo]</b> <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Maldini</a> and <b>[Alessandro]</b> <a href="alessandro-costacurta.html">Costacurta</a>, who were certainly very aggressive defenders, but the worst pair was that of Lazio with Fernando Couto and <b>[Sinisa]</b> Mihajlovic<br /><br />I worked a lot on the mental approach of the defenders, I was talking so much with <b>[Ciro]</b> <a href="ciro-ferrara.html">Ferrara</a>, <b>[Paolo]</b> Montero and <b>[Mark]</b> Iuliano. They told me where the defenders could be wrong and their suggestions fueled my growth<br /><br />Until then, it had not been a very fun World Cup for me. This is the year when <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> was relegated to Serie B<br /><br />I took my responsibilities. Each penalty has its own story. The one against <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a>, I hit it well, but unfortunately, that’s how it was. These difficulties made me stronger, more mentally strong</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Juventus Striker David Trezeguet says <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> Should Keep Inter Owned Mauro Icardi]</b> The Parisians should redeem him. First of all for his age, at 27 he is still a young player. There are very few strikers around at his level available on the market with those statistics. Although he played less in the match before the stop due to Coronavirus, he showed he has adapted to <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> and demonstrated his qualities. It is always better to have him play for you than against you<br /><br />I understand why <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> are interested in him and their interest does not go back to just yesterday. We are talking about a unique striker who has formidable efficiency</p>
