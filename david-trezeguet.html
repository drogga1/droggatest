  <p><b>[David Trezeguet has announced that he has reconsidered and will certainly not be turning out for les Bleus again]</b> During my time out injured, I took time to reflect. I analysed the last four years with <b>[French head coach Raymond]</b> <a href="raymond-domenech.html">Domenech</a> as well as what happened before and after the Euros. I am not someone who forgets things and changes his way of thinking. The FFF decided to continue with <a href="raymond-domenech.html">Domenech</a>, too bad for them! I am not in harmony with the functioning of the French team</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> striker David Trezeguet talked about equalling Omar Sivori’s goalscoring record in tonight’s 5-2 win away to Atalanta]</b> I’m very happy, I’ve achieved a very important personal target, reaching Omar Sivori is not something I expected when I arrived at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>. But the most important thing is that we played a fine game, we showed we have found back the desire and that we are tough. We’re happy, a bit tired too because the pitch was a bit heavy, but in the end we managed to win a very important match<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he expected to be the team’s top scorer at this point of the season, with six goals]</b> During the summer I prepared well, I worked a lot, unfortunately my team mates suffered some injuries, I also had the faith of the coach. I’m working a lot, I’m happy, it’s a revenge after what happened last year, first the injury, then the choices of the coach who left me out of the team. For me this is a year of vengeance and I’m very glad because I feel good, the team are doing well, we have a very strong group and if I’ve arrived at this point I have to thank my team mates. The Scudetto? We believe in it, first we have to find consistency, we have 15 days to work, with the return of a few injured players, then an important phase starts for us. The most important thing is that today we showed we are back</p>

  <p><b>[Karim Benzema has received further backing for his inclusion in France’s squad for Euro 2016 from David Trezeguet]</b> Yes. At team level, for the show. There is talk of a single player, <b>[who is]</b> exceptional compared to the competition and its national team. That is the sport side. After that, it is not for me to decide. But I hope, personally, they will find a solution and that Benzema will be included with France. We are all aware that this is a very important player for the team of France.</p>

  <p><b>[Perhaps the defining image of Euro 2000 is the joy and wonder on David Trezeguet’s face after he had scored the Golden Goal that won the trophy for France]</b> At first I was happy for my team-mates; then I was happy for my family; and then I was happy for me. We had dreamed of being champions of the world and Europe. It gave me enormous satisfaction at the time and it’s a satisfaction I still feel. It had been a difficult championship for me because I had hoped to play a greater part. I think Italy were more affected by fatigue than we were and, on top of that, they had to face a mental challenge after not winning a match they practically had in the bag. We knew we had to concentrate on playing to our qualities and strengths - and we took our chance. It started with a great move by <a href="robert-pires.html">Robert Pires</a> on our left. He dribbled past <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Fabio Cannavaro</a> and got to the byline. Then he put in a cross that was fairly difficult, but I was on the penalty spot and I hit the ball as it dropped. It went in and we became the first team to win the European Championship after winning the World Cup. It was a great thing for our country.</p>

  <p><b>[David Trezeguet talks up Edinson Cavani and PSG’s Champions League chances]</b> This season, he is back playing in his favourite position. He is showing a lot of drive and enthusiasm and works hard to make himself available to his team-mates. He is also showing a lot of power. He’s an exceptional player!<br /><br /><b>[4-0 drubbing of Barcelona in the last-16 of the Champions League]</b> It was an exceptional match! Paris Saint-Germain got the win with a high-level performance. The team showed their quality and posed Barcelona a lot of problems - 4-0 is pretty amazing! Even though there is still a return leg to play, Paris are all but qualified for the quarter-finals. The Champions League is the most important competition. There are high-level teams with extremely good players. Paris are one of the sides who are aiming to win the trophy</p>

  <p><b>[On his european departure]</b> My objective was to go to France, and I didn’t think about what I had in Argentina. When you’ve got enough enthusiasm, and don’t overthink, things turn out well. It was a unique experience for me over there <b>[in France]</b>.<br /><br />When Jean Tigana took me on at Monaco he didn’t know much about me but he gave me a chance, and then he was very patient and allowed me to develop. Under him, I became braver<br /><br />France gave me so much. But I’ve always been Argentinian at heart. When the opportunity to come here appeared, I did not think twice. I want to form part of the history of this club. He did that, with another swing of that left foot, striking the two goals that secured an immediate return to the top flight at the end of his firsrt season. It was special. It’s even bigger than the goal at Euro 2000</p>

  <p><b>[Former Monaco and Juventus striker David Trezeguet sees Kylian Mbappe as a potential successor to legendary countryman Thierry Henry]</b> Mbappe is the player that Juventus will have to keep an eye on since he is very dynamic. I think he can become Henry’s successor, he has it all. Time will tell in his case but I like him very much so. Falcao? He is a very good striker too, if you don’t give him the respect he deserves he can punish you.<br /><br />Juve’s main strength is their defensive solidity, they are very hard to score on. <b>[Gianluigi]</b> Buffon seems like a youngster, he is a superstar keeper. Alongside <b>[Fabien]</b> Barthez, they are the two best keepers I have ever played with. <b>[Leonardo]</b> Bonucci is the leader of <b>[Max]</b> Allegri’s defence and he also starts up the play well too. <b>[Giorgio]</b> Chiellini is also really solid, he does more of the dirty work. Dani Alves and Alex Sandro adapted perfectly to their new team, they are hard to beat</p>

Personally, I hope he’ll stay at <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> to continue showing his qualities, but above all establish himself as a player. We mustn’t forget he’s just 18 years old. He has time to get to know the top level, even if he’s at a club of a very high level.

  <p><b>[Paulo Dybala is a future Ballon d’Or winner]</b> Dybala can win the Ballon d’Or, as I think he’s showing the right kind of character. I often hear of comparisons between Dybala and Leo Messi, but I think that is important for him and can help him to grow.<br /><br />As for Higuain, he has been very consistent over his career and you can tell a champion during his most difficult moments. He’s seemed better physically of late and this means he still wants to train hard and show what he can do. It’s likely that some time on the bench did him good, but now Juventus need to improve as a team.</p>
