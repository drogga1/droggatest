<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On Sean Johnson]</b> One of his real strengths, not just as a player, but as a person, is that he always looks forward. I’m sure deep down it hurt a little bit, and he knows it was a bad mistake, but overall it’s just his personality to look forward and not dwell on things.<br /><br />In 2012 it was difficult to deal with, but it was pretty quick that I put it behind me. After that summer of 2012 hit, Aron and I just sat down and talked about it to put everything behind me and press on. When I think back on that moment it was an experience that made me stronger<br /><br />It doesn’t really surprise me that he’s doing well with that part of the game because he always had good feet. He’s comfortable with both feet and I think now people can see what he brings to that part of the game<br /><br />I’m in a lot better place than I was in 2012 as far as playing-wise, experience, things like that, so now the task at hand is the Gold Cup. I’ve played in a Gold Cup before, I’ve won a Gold Cup before. Now it’s about continuing to play well, and show that I belong on the national team, and I’m going to be around for a while</p>
