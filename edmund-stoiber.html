  <p><b>[Bayern Munich have warned Manchester United that they will not allow Thomas Muller to follow in the footsteps of Bastian Schweinsteiger and move to Old Trafford]</b> t should not be happening that someone like Thomas Muller plays for Manchester United. The fans were already a bit unhappy when Schweinsteiger left us for Manchester United. But he was already 32 and wanted a new challenge. But our fans and members would never forgive us if we sold Muller. He is the opposite of someone like Cristiano Ronaldo. He is much more than just a great player. Muller is part of our DNA. He represents key values for us and is someone the fans love.</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern might think twice if Manchester United were to return with another big-money offer for the World Cup winner. However, supervisory board member Edmund Stoiber dismissed the idea out of hand]</b> The fans were already a bit unhappy when Schweinsteiger left us for Manchester United but he was already 32 and wanted a new challenge.

  <p><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> won’t rule out fresh move for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> star <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a>]</b> There were discussions over <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a>. The unfortunate injury and the surgery he required for it broke the deal up. We’ll see how things develop. As chairman of the advisory board and a member of the supervisory board, I have great faith in the sporting leadership. If they propose a transfer of this magnitude, that is justified<br /><br />We knew what was required and that the fee was being pushed upwards. But financial stability is the responsibility of our chief financial officer Jan-Christian Dreesen.</p>
