  <p>[<a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> have completed the signing of <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> midfielder Pablo Fornals for a reported fee of £24 million] I’m very happy to be part of <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>. I feel very good, very happy and very grateful for the opportunity that has been provided to me. I want the club to continue betting on young and ambitious people, people who want to do well for the long term. I know about the loyal fans and the stadium, which is a beautiful stadium. The fans fill the stadium every weekend and that is something admirable, especially with the passion with which football is lived there. I think it is important to play with the support of your fans at home.<br /><br />I have worked with <a href="mario-husillos.html">Mario Husillos</a> [<a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>’s sporting director] before - I know him from when I was in Malaga. With <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Manuel Pellegrini</a>, only when I saw him and admired him on TV. Of course, Manuel was a big influence because in the end he is one of the best coaches in the world and who doesn’t want to work with people like that?!</p>

  <p>[New <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> signing Pablo Fornals has hailed manager <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Manuel Pellegrini</a> as ‘one of the best coaches in the world’ following his arrival from <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a>] Obviously, of course Manuel was a big influence because in the end he is one of the best coaches in the world. Who doesn’t like to work with people like that? I have worked more with <a href="mario-husillos.html">Mario Husillos</a>, I know him from when I was in Malaga. With Manuel I saw him and admired him on TV.<br /><br />[The midfielder reveal his excitement at playing in the opinion-splitting London Stadium] I knew about the fans, and about the stadium, which is beautiful. The fans fill every weekend a stadium that can fit 60,000 people and I think it is important to play with the support of your fans at home. Every match for me is going to be new, every team is going to be different. I’ve never played against any team [in England] so for that reason I’m really motivated and with the ambition to win as most matches as possible</p>
