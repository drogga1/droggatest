  <p><b>[Chivas manager Matias Almeyda hoped to sign three players to improve the squad in the offseason]</b> Obviously you always have the desire to bring in players. Sometimes you can’t because they cost a lot and the institution can’t invest. I have to accept that. I have two choices: Accept it or go. I decided to stay. I wanted three players, the directors knew that and we couldn’t <b>[sign them]</b>. I don’t get involved with the finances and even less so in a business that I don’t have any idea about. I’m at Chivas and when I ask for a water carrier they tell me if it’s possible or if it’s not possible.<br /><br />There’s patience because the team is very reduced, very short and you have to take the best, giving confidence and showing the players where they can improve. It’s coming along and I definitely think it’s going to end well<br /><br /><b>[On Oswaldo Alanis]</b> We talked with him the last game and decided it would be good for him to play with the Under-20s. He finished the match a bit tired. I thought he looked good and he’s training well. He hasn’t played since November 4 and that’s a lot of time not to play</p>

  <p><b>[Chivas-Monterrey pits two Argentine managers who have taken to Mexico]</b> We look at their grades because the club rewards those who get the best grades and pays for their schooling. If you have bad grades, you have to pay for your education. The player who doesn’t go to university isn’t going to play with me.<br /><br />We don’t think we’re better or worse than them. It’s 11 vs. 11. We’ve played Monterrey a lot, so it’s a great game a game that we can enjoy that the fans will enjoy and hopefully we have the quality to compete equally with them</p>

  <p><b>[Is there time for grandes Cruz Azul and Chivas to get in gear?]</b> It’s a happy feeling. I think we were missing a victory, the players gave everything and I’m always really grateful to them. It was really important to get the three points, keeping in mind that we have a ‘final’ on Wednesday. This is obviously a prize for the effort, but obviously have to keep going. We’re very far back in the tournament, so the only way forward is working and trying to advance.</p>

  <p><b>[Chivas have no choice but to go all out in CONCACAF Champions League]</b> We’re on our way in this tournament. The first goal is to get to the final, and we’re after that knowing that we’re facing a great opponent. The tournament deserves teams facing off against other teams with lots of footballing history, like New York in this case. This gives the competition something more positive and above all that it can take you to a Club World Cup. We’re convinced we can do it.<br /><br />I think the tie depends a lot on how the first match goes. We have to be smart and have to score goals, but also we’re always the home team when we’re in the U.S., so it’s the same. We feel at home in a lot of places, that’s the reality, but we must take advantage of Wednesday’s match<br /><br /><b>[Balancing the league-CCL-league grind]</b> has been and will continue being difficult. We’re not making excuses. There’s a reality I’ve mentioned that the squad is small, but it’s created the chance for a lot of young players to play and they’ve taken advantage of the opportunity, every one playing their role to raise the level of the group and get results</p>

  <p><b>[Pride on the line for Liga MX teams in CONCACAF Champions League second legs]</b> We’re ready, we’ve got a great squad with very motivated players, players who have the desire to break through and to carry the Mexican flag the highest possible. In this sense, as a manager, they make me very calm and give me confidence.</p>

  <p><b>[Matias Almeyda works around Chivas’ limitations to deliver first-leg win over Toronto]</b> I try to live in the present. I’m happy about the game, the result obviously, because we came here and we’re concentrated. We’re going home to be with our families, but we quickly have to think about the Clasico coming and we can’t just stay with today’s result because there’s another match left. If God wants it to happen, obviously I’ll be very happy, but there’s still a match so we can’t get ahead of ourselves.</p>

  <p><b>[Why Chivas’ season hinges on CONCACAF Champions League final]</b> It’s a topic we always talk about in the locker room. I’ll talk about it in particular once everything is finished. Today we’re very focused on this game that’s so important, in this hope that we have, this dream, so we’re talking about soccer and nothing else.</p>

  <p><b>[Matias Almeyda announces Chivas departure]</b> We had different ideas about how to reinforce the team, the squad we wanted to have, that we wouldn’t start the season with debts - the players are owed money as are we - about the preseason. These are some of the things that meant we couldn’t come to an agreement. Also bringing players, we wanted for Pizarro not to go, we knew Alanis was out because of the contracts, but keeping Cota and they told me they couldn’t, that they didn’t have the money. We wanted to reinforce the team.<br /><br />We want the best for our players and the fans. I’m going to stay and live in Guadalajara. I’m going to ask for a season ticket to come and see the team<br /><br />In 10 or 15 minutes when I sign, I’ll be free and I’ll listen to offers. Someone will have to want me. I had a clause to leave for the Argentine or Mexican national team. They said I left to wait and manage Mexico, but it isn’t true</p>

  <p><b>[Matias Almeyda returns to Red Bull Arena]</b> They’re a very tough team, a group that has played together a long time, with a system of play that’s very important. With respect to pressuring, and counterattacking, and the aerial game. They also have a lot of options on the bench, so we’ll see what team we face, but it’s a tough rival.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Almeyda’s growing pains with the Earthquakes continue]</b> The reality is I knew what I was getting into. I came into a project with a long-term approach, a team that only won four games last year, very few. We have to change not only the style of play, but also being able to change the mentality of every player. The first half we benefited from what we’ve been training, but the second half I didn’t like at all. In the first half we had two clear chances and if we had been effective the game would have been over. When they had that chance, they hurt us<br /><br />That’s work, that’s mentality, it can also be concentration or lack of concentration. Of the nine goals we’ve given up I haven’t found one that the opponent has scored by their own virtue but by our own errors. That says we need to keep working to find what we’re looking for<br /><br /><b>[Almeyda is realistic]</b> It’s not easy to change a style of play when a team is used to another style. We want to be protagonists and playing the way we played in the first half I think we can do that. And when we can do that for longer I believe we can get out of this hole that we’re in<br /><br />For now we’re good. I’m doing a real deep analysis of the team in the middle of the season. For the moment we’ll try to give these players confidence<br /><br />We played two games in one, the first was excellent, and the second was very bad, against a rival that doesn’t forgive you. A rival that has been working on its project for five years, that has their style of play installed. We’re looking for all that. Looking for wins, looking for a style of play, looking to change a mentality and it’s going to take time</p>

  <p><b>[Matias Almeyda has spearheaded a turnaround in his first season as head coach of San Jose Earthquakes]</b> The kind of football I’ve always liked and will always want to implement is the same as when I was a five-year-old - playing in a way that puts a smile on your face. And how does this come about? By enjoying having the ball. I want my players to keep it on the deck and move the ball about. I think that they enjoy playing this way rather than sitting back and trying to win games that way</p>
