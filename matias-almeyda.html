  <p><b>[Matias Almeyda happy coaching Chivas but still dreams of leading Argentina]</b> Perhaps. Here they gave me a five-year contract and I’m very happy. Right now, I’m not thinking about anything else.<br /><br />I’d like to have a similar career to the one I had as a player, winning things, managing in Europe, one day the national team. In the meantime, one must work, demonstrate what you are, grow and be self-critical<br /><br />We’re going ot have a great game. Since they took away the possibility of the Copa Libertadores, we want the players to have international competition, and being Boca it’s an even bigger task. We’re going to give it the significance that it deserves</p>

  <p><b>[On his team]</b> I’m happy for everyone, but also there’s the reality that we still haven’t gotten anything yet. We’re doing well, we’ve worked for this and that work is bearing fruit that we always wanted to pick, but we’re in the middle of the tournament, we’re all together. The other day we were sad because we lost the game, but we’ve played in a similar way in all the games and this shows that we’re doing well. Still, we’re aware that there’s still a lot going forward.</p>

  <p><b>[Chivas definitely showed something by fighting back from two goals down to find a 3-2 victory]</b> The second half was spectacular because, even when we were a man down, the opponent kept trying to play on the counterattack and we were getting them farther back. Their best player before the last mistake was Campestrini with everything he had kept out, but in the second half the team kept pushing, it didn’t lose hope. Still, there are things to improve on, most of all the first half.</p>

  <p><b>[For the sixth consecutive Liga MX match Chivas failed to get a victory, falling 1-0 Thursday to rival Atlas in the first leg of the Clausura quarterfinals]</b> I think Guadalajara found the footballing level that characterized us at times during the tournament, especially in the second half. We had a lot more scoring opportunities, in the second half I don’t remember any from the opposition. They played their game at 1-0 but the series is still open.</p>

We were the team that had the ball more. Hopefully we can rediscover this fluidness, but the reality is the other teams are scoring more goals than us, so they’re the candidates <b>[to win the league]</b>.</p>

The game plan was bearing its fruits in the result, but we came up against ‘a crack’ who touched the ball twice and scored two goals. It’s down to his ability. The second goal is the kind a different kind of player scores. There were a few mistakes on that second goal, but his finishing was impeccable. His finishing was really impeccable.</p>

  <p><b>[Chivas lacking more than Alan Pulido]</b> In the first half, apart from being much worse than the opponent, we were very far from the level this team once showed. That’s to say we were imprecise, without dynamic play, very erratic. That’s why they were better than us. I think the opponent could’ve scored another goal on us in the first half.</p>

  <p><b>[Matias Almeyda seems to be feeling less worried than he probably should for a man who is coaching Chivas]</b> My suitcases are well stored in my house. I’ve got four years on my contract. I’m the same person I was the first day I arrived here. I’m not changing the person I am because of a result that goes our way or one that goes against us. I’ve continued being the same person in success or in defeat and that’s how I’m going to be.</p>

  <p><b>[Chivas manager Matias Almeyda hoped to sign three players to improve the squad in the offseason]</b> Obviously you always have the desire to bring in players. Sometimes you can’t because they cost a lot and the institution can’t invest. I have to accept that. I have two choices: Accept it or go. I decided to stay. I wanted three players, the directors knew that and we couldn’t <b>[sign them]</b>. I don’t get involved with the finances and even less so in a business that I don’t have any idea about. I’m at Chivas and when I ask for a water carrier they tell me if it’s possible or if it’s not possible.<br /><br />There’s patience because the team is very reduced, very short and you have to take the best, giving confidence and showing the players where they can improve. It’s coming along and I definitely think it’s going to end well<br /><br /><b>[On Oswaldo Alanis]</b> We talked with him the last game and decided it would be good for him to play with the Under-20s. He finished the match a bit tired. I thought he looked good and he’s training well. He hasn’t played since November 4 and that’s a lot of time not to play</p>

  <p><b>[Chivas-Monterrey pits two Argentine managers who have taken to Mexico]</b> We look at their grades because the club rewards those who get the best grades and pays for their schooling. If you have bad grades, you have to pay for your education. The player who doesn’t go to university isn’t going to play with me.<br /><br />We don’t think we’re better or worse than them. It’s 11 vs. 11. We’ve played Monterrey a lot, so it’s a great game a game that we can enjoy that the fans will enjoy and hopefully we have the quality to compete equally with them</p>

  <p><b>[Is there time for grandes Cruz Azul and Chivas to get in gear?]</b> It’s a happy feeling. I think we were missing a victory, the players gave everything and I’m always really grateful to them. It was really important to get the three points, keeping in mind that we have a ‘final’ on Wednesday. This is obviously a prize for the effort, but obviously have to keep going. We’re very far back in the tournament, so the only way forward is working and trying to advance.</p>

  <p><b>[Chivas have no choice but to go all out in CONCACAF Champions League]</b> We’re on our way in this tournament. The first goal is to get to the final, and we’re after that knowing that we’re facing a great opponent. The tournament deserves teams facing off against other teams with lots of footballing history, like New York in this case. This gives the competition something more positive and above all that it can take you to a Club World Cup. We’re convinced we can do it.<br /><br />I think the tie depends a lot on how the first match goes. We have to be smart and have to score goals, but also we’re always the home team when we’re in the U.S., so it’s the same. We feel at home in a lot of places, that’s the reality, but we must take advantage of Wednesday’s match<br /><br /><b>[Balancing the league-CCL-league grind]</b> has been and will continue being difficult. We’re not making excuses. There’s a reality I’ve mentioned that the squad is small, but it’s created the chance for a lot of young players to play and they’ve taken advantage of the opportunity, every one playing their role to raise the level of the group and get results</p>

I’m happy about the game, the result obviously, because we came here and we’re concentrated. We’re going home to be with our families, but we quickly have to think about the Clasico coming and we can’t just stay with today’s result because there’s another match left. If God wants it to happen, obviously I’ll be very happy, but there’s still a match so we can’t get ahead of ourselves.</p>

Today we’re very focused on this game that’s so important, in this hope that we have, this dream, so we’re talking about soccer and nothing else.</p>

  <p><b>[Matias Almeyda announces Chivas departure]</b> We had different ideas about how to reinforce the team, the squad we wanted to have, that we wouldn’t start the season with debts - the players are owed money as are we - about the preseason. These are some of the things that meant we couldn’t come to an agreement. Also bringing players, we wanted for Pizarro not to go, we knew Alanis was out because of the contracts, but keeping Cota and they told me they couldn’t, that they didn’t have the money. We wanted to reinforce the team.<br /><br />We want the best for our players and the fans. I’m going to stay and live in Guadalajara. I’m going to ask for a season ticket to come and see the team<br /><br />In 10 or 15 minutes when I sign, I’ll be free and I’ll listen to offers. Someone will have to want me. I had a clause to leave for the Argentine or Mexican national team. They said I left to wait and manage Mexico, but it isn’t true</p>

  <p><b>[Matias Almeyda returns to Red Bull Arena]</b> They’re a very tough team, a group that has played together a long time, with a system of play that’s very important. With respect to pressuring, and counterattacking, and the aerial game. They also have a lot of options on the bench, so we’ll see what team we face, but it’s a tough rival.</p>

<h4 id="2019-03-17-retrieve">2019 03 17 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Almeyda’s growing pains with the Earthquakes continue]</b> The reality is I knew what I was getting into. I came into a project with a long-term approach, a team that only won four games last year, very few. We have to change not only the style of play, but also being able to change the mentality of every player. The first half we benefited from what we’ve been training, but the second half I didn’t like at all. In the first half we had two clear chances and if we had been effective the game would have been over. When they had that chance, they hurt us<br /><br />That’s work, that’s mentality, it can also be concentration or lack of concentration. Of the nine goals we’ve given up I haven’t found one that the opponent has scored by their own virtue but by our own errors. That says we need to keep working to find what we’re looking for<br /><br /><b>[Almeyda is realistic]</b> It’s not easy to change a style of play when a team is used to another style. We want to be protagonists and playing the way we played in the first half I think we can do that. And when we can do that for longer I believe we can get out of this hole that we’re in<br /><br />For now we’re good. I’m doing a real deep analysis of the team in the middle of the season. For the moment we’ll try to give these players confidence<br /><br />We played two games in one, the first was excellent, and the second was very bad, against a rival that doesn’t forgive you. A rival that has been working on its project for five years, that has their style of play installed. We’re looking for all that. Looking for wins, looking for a style of play, looking to change a mentality and it’s going to take time</p>

And how does this come about? By enjoying having the ball. I want my players to keep it on the deck and move the ball about. I think that they enjoy playing this way rather than sitting back and trying to win games that way</p>
