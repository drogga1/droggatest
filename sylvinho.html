  <p><b>[Sylvinho Says No To Captaincy]</b> I think we’ve got enough. I don’t want to be a captain. I’m very clear about my role in the squad and I’ll carry it out no problem. Football goes beyond the 90 minutes. For matches to go well, the management of the group, the changing room, the daily work etc are all very important. With the experience I have in football and in the Club I believe I can help my team-mates. I feel a responsibility to help the squad. As the coach said, we’ll give everything we’ve got in every match. So I’m sure we’ll have the support of the fans and, with a strong <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a>, we’ll be a much better team</p>

  <p><b>[How Leo grew to become a global phenomenon]</b> When I met <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, I was 30 and he was only 16 or 17 - he was virtually half my age. I was one of the oldest players in the squad and he was the youngest<br /><br />We had a great friendship. We had a lot of fun back then, we laughed a lot, we played a lot. Maybe that helped him, but it was normal because we were a lot older and Leo is a great person. He has a great relationship with everyone, he is a great guy, he is laid-back - and on the pitch he is a phenomenon<br /><br /><b>[Sylvinho signed off in style in what was his last game as a <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> player]</b> I had five great years at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. We won two Champions Leagues, three leagues, a Copa del Rey - and I played with some of the best players in the world - players like <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a>, <a href="samuel-eto-o.html">Samuel Eto’o</a>, <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a>, <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Andres Iniesta</a>, <a href="carles-puyol.html">Carles Puyol</a>, <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Sergio Busquets</a> - and of course <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. What can I say? It was a great time of my life and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> for me is still the best player in the world - he is at such a high level. Players like Leo are phenomenons and the greatest in the world. They always need to be scoring important goals like the one in the 2009 final. That was a special moment for me in my last game for the club - and a special moment for <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> as well</p>

  <p><b>[Sylvinho says <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> ace <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> could return to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> over the course of the summer transfer window]</b> He can play with whoever he wants. Who can say that he will not return to <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> or switch to another team. The only one who can do anything is him. The individual quality of the player is … mamma mia! He’s a great player.<br /><br />There are many factors that might influence my decision. I would like to coach in Spain. I did my coaching badges there when I was still playing.I’m a coach who works on all aspects of the game. But, first and foremost, my team must have a spirit and that must be evident on the field</p>

I don’t know if <a href="memphis-depay.html">Depay</a> will be able to return, but if he succeeds, it could make a real difference. He is strong physically and technically and he has character. I like him so much. If he is able then <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> will have an advantage</p>

  <p><b>[Lyon boss Sylvinho confirmed Nabil Fekir is in negotiations for a transfer as rumours of the club captain’s impending move to Real Betis gather momentum]</b> We don’t control the situation. He is negotiating his transfer, we don’t know when it will be resolved but, for him and for the club, it would be best that it happens as quickly as possible. Of course we will miss him if he leaves. Nabil is a wonderful player, his technical level is exemplary, and it’s beautiful to watch him play</p>

Okay?<br /><br /><b>[Meanwhile, <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> have already lost one key attacker during the close season, captain Nabil Fekir having moved to <a href="real-betis.html">Real Betis</a>, and they could be tempted to dip back into the transfer market]</b> It’s a possibility. We could also recruit another defender. We’ll see. It’s not an easy thing to replace Nabil, an important player with extraordinary technical quality. We need to see whether someone can really help. It’s a matter of opportunity</p>
