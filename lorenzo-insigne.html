  <p><b>[Lorenzo Insigne writes about his football idol]</b> And now I get to walk out on the pitch in my hometown, and I always get goosebumps because I think, ‘This is where the greatest player in the world played. This is where <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> played’. With all due respect to <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, now that I am older, and I know my history, I have to repent and say that <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> is the greatest who ever lived. Mr. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, you had great boots. You were a genius. You were my inspiration. But I am a Neapolitan, and so I have to say that there is only one king, and his name is Diego Maradona.</p>

Napoli have hit out at media reports claiming Carlo Ancelotti has agreed to the sales of Allan and Lorenzo Insigne.</p>

  <p><b>[Lorenzo Insigne is not actively pushing for a transfer]</b> Right now, in this phase, I am not even thinking about it. However, I know full well that there are those around who appreciate me. But there are no clubs, no approaches, no shows of interest. It is my duty to think, without being immodest, that over the years at Napoli I’ve shown what I can do. I know people think I hired Mino Raiola because I was looking for a move, but that is not true, and you are free to think that. I hired Raiola because I consider him to be, along with Jorge Mendes, the best around and a real authority. As long as I am at Napoli, I will always give 110 per cent and I want to stay here for a long time.</p>

  <p><b>[Napoli star Lorenzo Insigne reiterated that Maurizio Sarri betrayed the club by joining Serie A champions Juventus]</b> I said it and I say it again, for us Neapolitans, that was a betrayal. And it will be forever. Now we have to focus on ourselves and try to beat him at all costs. Now that he’s gone to Juve, I don’t want to talk about him anymore. The Scudetto is a dream for all of us and we will try once more<br /><br /><b>[Insigne has been linked to Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool previously, and when asked if he could move abroad]</b> No, I never thought of leaving Napoli. I’m still young, I’m happy in Naples and want to stay here for the rest of my career<br /><br /><b>[The winger reflected on a favourite moment of his career so far - when he struck against Real Madrid in the second round of the Champions League in 2017]</b> Scoring that goal against Real Madrid gave me such strong sensations and I hope other young Neapolitan lads can feel the same way in future. It is the dream of all Neapolitan boys and I am very proud to be in this position</p>

  <p><b>[Lorenzo Insigne believes James Rodriguez would flourish at Napoli if he chooses to join the Serie A club]</b> The doors are open for strong players, we welcome them all. James Rodriguez is a true number 10, he has quality and together with us he would be great. Those choices, however, are up to the coach and the club<br /><br /><b>[Carlo Ancelotti’s men are continuing to aim high]</b> The Scudetto is everyone’s dream. In the past few years we have come close and we have been disappointed. I’m convinced that if we all play with this determination we can cause trouble for anyone. We know we have a great competitor like Juve in front of us, but things could change this season with the new coach <b>[at Juve, former Napoli boss Maurizio Sarri]</b>. I think we are getting stronger, but we have to start off on the right foot because we have the potential to fight at the top</p>

  <p><b>[Lorenzo Insigne says he does not always see eye-to-eye with <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> coach <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> but has underlined his commitment to delivering success this season]</b> My rapport with <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a> is a bit odd, as at times we have had rows, but that’s all down to our respective personalities. There is a difference of character between us. We happen to squabble, but Carlo remains a great coach and I hope to win with him. He has not imposed a role on me I did not want since he took over at <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>. Sometimes, when I get over-tired or anxious at training, it can happen that I respond to his observations, but these are things that end there. I often joke with the coach<br /><br /><b>[Insigne also sent a message to any <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> fans doubting his commitment to his hometown club]</b> Some <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> fans haven’t understood me, as they consider me arrogant, as if they have a different image of how I am in reality. I hope that they can change their minds and stand by me, because I’d get myself killed for the <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> jersey. The time has come for <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> to win. We’ve been waiting too long now</p>

  <p><b>[Insigne admitted this week he does not always see eye-to-eye with his coach, though <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a> has talked up the forward’s importance]</b> The situation with Lorenzo is not at all complicated. He made an excellent start to the season then he had a dip in form and I decided to rest him. He’s a key player when he’s relaxed, happy and able to fire up the team as he does so well. He’s less effective when he’s on edge because he’s not able to express his full potential. I didn’t think he looked sharp in training and decided that it was best <b>[to leave him out against Genk]</b> - a strong decision perhaps but it’s all cleared up. I repeat, Insigne is a hugely important player for us</p>

We’re grateful to him and we all want to perform well for him. He helps us so much and he deserves success. We must look forward and think positive. Everything is in our hands and we’re determined to wrap up qualification in our two remaining games<br /><br /><b>[Napoli are a point behind leaders <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in Group E and four ahead of third-placed Salzburg, who were on the back foot for much of Tuesday’s match]</b> We deserved to win the game - we created loads of chances but needed to be more clinical with our finishing.
