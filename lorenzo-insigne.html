  <p><b>[Lorenzo Insigne writes about his football idol]</b> And now I get to walk out on the pitch in my hometown, and I always get goosebumps because I think, ‘This is where the greatest player in the world played. This is where <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> played’. With all due respect to <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, now that I am older, and I know my history, I have to repent and say that <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> is the greatest who ever lived. Mr. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, you had great boots. You were a genius. You were my inspiration. But I am a Neapolitan, and so I have to say that there is only one king, and his name is <a href="diego-maradona.html">Diego Maradona</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo can’t win games for Juventus by himself]</b> CR7? Welcome to him, but I’m curious to see how he’ll adapt to our league. He won’t be able to win games by himself. Personally I prefer Messi for what he represents for football, but the talent of the Portuguese is not in question. If he’s won five Ballons d’Or it means something. Italian defences are very strong though, even if he proved against Juventus that he’s a phenomenon. In a longer tournament we’ll see … Maybe Ronaldo will save himself to aim for the Champions League, which is his big objective. Then in the Champions League last 16 two years ago he didn’t score against us. We hope to repeat that.<br /><br />I’m convinced that we’ll succeed with Ancelotti, his numbers in the Champions League are fabulous. His approach to Napoli has been excellent and he transmits serenity to the whole environment. He’s very simple in his gestures, he showers with us and takes advantage of every moment in the dressing room or around the table to talk, to form the group. For example, to help the new ones integrate he forced them to get on a chair and sing next to him, to share everything. Even the president <b>[Aurelio De Laurentiis]</b> has been more serene since he’s been here. Are we still Juve’s main challengers? Yes, because as the president says Ancelotti is our best signing. Don’t forget that this is a very strong group that has already done well. The club and the coach will know where and how to reinforce this team, the only regret is that in doing so people forget the good things done over the past few years</p>

  <p><b>[Lorenzo Insigne’s goal, a neat finish after skipping past Andreas Samaris on the break, was his first for his country in more than a year]</b> I needed a goal, as scoring with this jersey is special. Above all, we needed the three points and now we have to recover our energy, as there is another battle on Tuesday. I think winning that game can be a big step forward towards the Euros, but it’ll be intense, and they need points. If we play the way we did <b>[against Greece]</b>, we’ll achieve our objective. It’s not just me, as many other players are all working together with the right intensity both in a match situation and in training. The coach is drilling that mentality into us. I am happy with the goal, but we’re a good group here and if we are to go far, we need everyone</p>

  <p><b>[Lorenzo Insigne is not actively pushing for a transfer]</b> Right now, in this phase, I am not even thinking about it. However, I know full well that there are those around who appreciate me. But there are no clubs, no approaches, no shows of interest. It is my duty to think, without being immodest, that over the years at <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> I’ve shown what I can do. I know people think I hired <a href="mino-raiola.html">Mino Raiola</a> because I was looking for a move, but that is not true, and you are free to think that. I hired <a href="mino-raiola.html">Raiola</a> because I consider him to be, along with <a href="jorge-mendes.html">Jorge Mendes</a>, the best around and a real authority.

  <p><b>[Insigne admitted this week he does not always see eye-to-eye with his coach, though <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a> has talked up the forward’s importance]</b> The situation with Lorenzo is not at all complicated. He made an excellent start to the season then he had a dip in form and I decided to rest him. He’s a key player when he’s relaxed, happy and able to fire up the team as he does so well. He’s less effective when he’s on edge because he’s not able to express his full potential. I didn’t think he looked sharp in training and decided that it was best <b>[to leave him out against Genk]</b> - a strong decision perhaps but it’s all cleared up. I repeat, Insigne is a hugely important player for us</p>
