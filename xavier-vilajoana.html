  <p><b>[Barcelona director Xavier Vilajoana said the <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> champions have no intention of selling <a href="ansu-fati.html">Ansu Fati</a> amid links to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, denying talks over a possible transfer]</b> For us, there’s no story with Ansu, we have never spoken about selling him. I think he’s happy. He will be an important player in the coming years. I think that Ansu is a boy that is emerging, that we all know that has great potential. You have to understand that you have to give him peace of mind and confidence to exploit what he has inside. Apart from the two goals, what I give credit is the work he has done in defence. He has worked hard. He has given us solutions</p>
