  <p><b>[Adam Lallana has boldly declared that there is ‘absolutely no question’ he will be staying at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I’ve got a year left on my contract. I’ll be back, I’ll be training through the summer. I am as eager as ever to get fit because I know when I’m fit I’ve got a lot to give and I can get in this team.<br /><br /><b>[He added when asked if he will be staying put]</b> Yeah. Absolutely no question about it. I couldn’t be happier here, winning Champions Leagues. I know my ability and I know what I can give. And the gaffer and his staff and the recruitment guys have all made it clear they know I have a big part to play with what’s to come next, so I’m buzzing with that. No question my future is here and I can’t wait for what’s next<br /><br /><b>[He admits to having endured a tough time, but is pleased to have seen <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> respond positively to defeat in the 2018 Champions League final and Premier League title race to secure a first piece of silverware in seven years]</b> We’ve hurt a lot this year. Every player will have their own story. I’ve obviously not played, but this means more to me than anything. I’ve had a lot of setbacks this season. I’ve worked so hard to get there and then I’ll obviously have another setback. <b>[Alex]</b> <a href="alex-oxlade-chamberlain.html">Oxlade-Chamberlain</a>, unfortunately, he missed out last year and he’s fought back, so it will mean so much to him for different reasons. It means so much to my best mate <b>[<a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a>]</b> for different reasons. I am just so happy to be out there among it with the team and feel that cohesion. That’s what’s brought us here</p>

  <p><b>[Adam Lallana is relishing relearning his trade in a new deeper role at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> It’s nice. I found myself playing there a few times this pre-season and I’m happy to play anywhere. I’ve enjoyed it, obviously getting on the ball. There are still aspects of the game I need to improve on and I’m sure I’ll learn the more I play there. I’m delighted to get some more minutes and build my fitness. <b>[The manager]</b> has mentioned I can play there, that I’ve got the ability to play there. There’s not been any formal chat but I’m happy playing there. I see a lot of the ball and I’m the type of player that wants to be on the ball; I feel I can get us moving, get us out of tight situations and bring a different aspect to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. As long as I can stay fit - and I’ve been working hard on my fitness - then I think I can bring quality to this <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team.<br /><br /><b>[Lallana played the first hour in this deeper role in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s final friendly of pre-season, a 3-1 win after coming from behind against Ligue 1 side Lyon in Geneva]</b> It was obviously nice to get back to winning ways. It’s not the be-all and end-all in pre-season but it’s good to get into good habits. I thought all round everyone played a good part and it was a good runout for us. It was a little bit of a dodgy start but a good reaction. We’re going to go behind in games this season, I’m sure, so I thought the boys showed good character to get back into it against a good Lyon side. The young lads played well as well when they came on. <b>[It was]</b> a different format, some changes after half an hour. The manager said he wanted to use this game to get everyone up to scratch and give everyone the minutes they needed to have depending on what level they’re at, and I thought we coped with that really well as well</p>

  <p><b>[Lallana told of a testing period in his career]</b> It has been a difficult 18 months to two years for me with injuries, but hopefully that’s behind me now. I just want to keep working hard and contribute to what will be an exciting end to the season. It helps when you can be fit consistently, I’ve not had that over the last couple of years. It was a good game and I enjoyed being out there</p>

It was odd but I’m happy we held our nerve.<br /><br />The way <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> play is difficult and they are fighting for every point, but I thought we were convincing winners in the end.

I’m still waiting to get a chance there. That may, or may not, come, but it definitely interests me. I find it very stimulating because I get more of the ball than I have ever had in my career before. Sometimes as a No. 8 you are making decoy runs, or you are offering and you don’t get the ball.<br /><br />I have not gone into it too deeply. Jordan <b>[Henderson]</b> told me I need to watch <b>[Barcelona’s]</b> <a href="frenkie-de-jong.html">Frenkie de Jong</a>. The way he plays it, he kind of dribbles a little bit more than other sixes would, which obviously brings a bit of risk but that is in my game. I do watch the six more so now than what the eight does because I know that reasonably well. What are their movements like? I’ve found myself focusing on <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a> a little bit in our first games and he has played it outstandingly well</p>

  <p><b>[Adam Lallana is not worried about his expiring contract at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> but acknowledges that he has to prove himself deserving of an extended stay]</b> Worry is the wrong word. Of course, you think ahead and like to plan to a degree. I love it here. But I’m not obsessing about my future. Being as fit as I can, and working as hard as I can, is at the forefront of my mind. The rest will take care of itself. I feel happy. I feel fit and strong. If I want to be part of this team, the best team in Europe, I need to keep improving and developing and that is what I have found difficult over the last two years because I have not been able to show that. I can’t be the same player, I need to be better because the team is better.<br /><br />I didn’t make the squad for the first game of the season <b>[against <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> City]</b> and that was a bit of an eye-opener. I didn’t see that happening. I hadn’t experienced that since I was growing up at <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>. But it is a 60-game season and I look at my last couple of seasons and think just be patient, be persistent and eventually my chance will come. If I am fit, I am sure I will contribute in a big way<br /><br /><b>[Lallana admits to having experienced some dark days during his time on the treatment table]</b> It got to the point where I said to the medical team to make my schedule opposite to the rest of the boys, so I didn’t need to act as if everything was ok in front of them anymore. If they came in in the morning, I did afternoon sessions. I felt I was going to be back for the business end of the season <b>[in 2018-19]</b>: semi-finals, going for the league. The rotation for matches was there. So that was a big, big blow.<br /><br />There were loads of periods during last season when I was sad and angry, not at anyone in particular, just at the situation. I was continually battling to contribute, to be dependable to my team-mates because when you get injured, it is almost, not a sign of weakness, but you are not able to do your job fundamentally. At times, my insecurities were real. How am I going to get back into the team? I felt like I was climbing a ladder that was never-ending at times. Sometimes I was taking a step back but the team was taking two forward</p>

If we want to win the title we will need the squad not just a starting XI. Form goes out the window in these games.<br /><br />I felt that we controlled the game when I was on, certainly after the first 10 minutes and at the end I thought we were the only team who would go on and get all three points. We have come to <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> and got a point. We would probably have taken that at the beginning of the season and we are still unbeaten.

  <p><b>[Adam Lallana says he is ready to play a big role in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s quest for silverware]</b> I think it was against Middlesbrough, wasn’t it? I’ve scored plenty in the back garden against my lad since then - didn’t feel half as good, though!<br /><br />I’m delighted. It’s obviously nice to contribute. I feel like I’ve been fit for a good year now, especially since coming back from pre-season. But we’re European champions, we’ve got a top squad, so I’ve had to be patient for my chance but delighted to come on and make an impact like that.<br /><br />It’s a long old season. We’ve got the Club World Cup to come. We’ve got the Carabao Cup next week, the Champions League this week, <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at the weekend. Just because I’ve not started any of the first nine <b>[league]</b> games, I don’t think that means I am not going to play a big part in this team. Football’s a funny game. I think the last couple of years, we’ve got the Champions League final with a maximum of four really fit central midfielders. It’s about just staying fit, staying strong and staying ready. I feel that’s where my focus will be<br /><br /><b>[Lallana admitted that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> left <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> as probably the happier team as they extended their unbeaten start to the campaign]</b> We could have won it. You know, another five, 10 minutes. I thought we were controlling the game, we were dictating the game. The last 15 minutes, when I was on the pitch you could feel that, you could feel that we got that little bit of confidence, that little bit of arrogance that we needed. We were calmer on the ball and we didn’t really have that in the first half. But these games are funny. It’s not a bad point<br /><br />Listen, everyone probably expected us to win but we knew it was going to be tough here today. We knew if we weren’t at our very best, we wouldn’t win. We weren’t at our best, we didn’t win but we ground out a point. And if you can do that when you don’t play your best, I think you’ve got a good chance of being successful throughout the season and that’s what we’ve shown today</p>

We were poor first half and it was important we gave a reaction in the second half. I thought we did.

I just take it; another good training week, train hard and train strong, look to perform there and hopefully start at the weekend</p>
