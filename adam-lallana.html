  <p><b>[Adam Lallana is eager to impress England manager Roy Hodgson if given the chance against San Marino on Thursday]</b> Being a fresh campaign, I’m always looking to impress. As there is a lot of competition out there, I’m hungry to impress.<br /><br /><b>[On Nathaniel Clyne]</b> Nathaniel Clyne has come on a lot over the last few years, and throughly deserved his England call-up. He’s a top-drawer player<br /><br />We’re not looking past the next two games, we want to get the job done. We’ve been working on how we want to play in training. We are preparing as normal and the three points is what we want. Players will want to fill their boots. But that’s the same in any game</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana has been named as the Vauxhall England Player of the Year 2016]</b> This award is a huge honour. The last three winners were Rooney <b>[2015]</b>, Rooney <b>[2014]</b> and Steven Gerrard <b>[2012]</b> so that just goes to show what a great achievement this is. Things have been going well this season for my club so that always helps. When you’re playing well for your club then hopefully you can transmit your form into the national team and help out. That’s what has been happening but I don’t want that to be for just one season - I want to continue that for as long as possible. Off the back of a disappointing year for England as a whole, I’ll be looking to definitely improve in 2017 and hopefully we can build on how it has started under Gareth Southgate, as there have been plenty of positives.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool emerged from a players-only meeting organised by captain Jordan Henderson with an us against the world attitude]</b> It was the team captain who got us together, but it wasn’t just him who spoke. Everybody spoke and it was refreshing. We came out of it with an ‘us against the world’ attitude. I came out of it knowing that everyone was intent on turning things around as quickly as possible.<br /><br />Every now and again, it doesn’t hurt to utter some home truths as long as it is not personal, just purely professional. There is no harm in reminding each other of what we need to do and what we want from each other. It doesn’t hurt to hear a few home truths</p>

  <p><b>[Adam Lallana signs new £110k-a-week Liverpool deal]</b> I’m very proud and feel quite humbled by the show of faith from the club and the manager in particular. Signing for a club like Liverpool is obviously a big thing - but to re-sign shows you’ve obviously contributed enough that the people who make the decisions want you to stay longer. This is a really good place to be at the moment and, for a player who wants to be part of something special, I can’t think of a better club to commit your future to. We have a brilliant squad of players who are only going to get better the longer we are together. We have a world-class manager and coaching staff. And because it’s Liverpool there is that added X-factor of the supporters and what success would mean to them when we achieve it here. I’m just delighted that I’m going to be part of it for even longer.</p>

  <p><b>[Adam Lallana says England team-mate Dele Alli has quickly become a magnificent player for England]</b> Del is a fantastic player. He is already a magnificent player for England. He is special. I love the way he goes about his business: No fear. He’s brave. But still people need to be patient with him. He is still a young boy and performing how he does is way above his years. He is not even 21 yet. It is important that we don’t get carried away<br /><br />That’s what makes him Dele. All players have different attitudes that make them what they are and that’s why he is unique and a special talent. I think Dele Alli is one who is psychologically strong. He’s young, but you can groom him into being England captain. He’s going to be a top player, and the armband might give him some responsibility. Dele is still growing up and learning the game, which is why he does the odd silly thing. Giving him the captaincy would help him grow up faster, and cut out a bit of the petulance. I don’t think he should be captain now - Gary Cahill is the obvious choice for the next World Cup - but one day I could see it really bringing the best out of him</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana echoed Gareth Southgate’s praise of Harry Kane]</b> Absolutely delighted for Harry. I think this season he’s demonstrated once again why he’s one of the best players in the world. His form towards the end of the season was that of one of the best players in the world. He’s still young and still has a lot of learning to do. If I’m selected it’ll be a great honour to walk out behind him. The boss wants leaders in the group. I feel like I’m a leader and there’s a lot of leaders. We need to develop more and the younger the better.</p>

  <p><b>[Adam Lallana has welcomed Liverpool’s emphasis on recruiting elite talent this summer]</b> I want the best players to be linked with Liverpool and coming to Liverpool. If you are talking about it from a personal point of view, the pressure to get better and the competition for places is healthy. That is what we need. At times last year, our bench probably wasn’t as strong as we would have liked it to be. If we are going to achieve something, we are going to need a strong bench. We need a strong squad and players need to be on their toes. It is all good. I think there are 30 players out here with the three goalkeepers and a few young lads. That is a hell of a lot of players. You only have to look at the subs that the manager makes. He is now replacing pace with pace and goals with goals.<br /><br /><b>[Lallana feels the flexibility within the squad is also beneficial to Klopp’s selection process]</b> Philippe <b>[Coutinho]</b> can play in different positions; he can play central and out wide. Sadio <b>[Mane]</b> can play on the left or the right. It is only little tweaks. It’s similar to me, I used to play out wide and I now play more central. It’s not major surgery, you’re right. We are looking good at the minute<br /><br />Studge has been absolutely brilliant in pre-season so far. He is looking really sharp and to have him firing on all cylinders would be like having two new signings if we can keep on the pitch and get him scoring goals. He is a world class player. He has come back this summer looking absolutely brilliant, so fit. He is going to be a massive player for us this season. I can feel it. You couldn’t put a price on him. Every footballer gets injuries - Jordan <b>[Henderson]</b> has had a tough couple of years. We all have to deal with it at some stage in our career. But we have got plenty of options and if we keep everyone fit, who knows what can happen?</p>

  <p><b>[Adam Lallana tips Oxlade-Chamberlain to excel after joining Liverpool]</b> I think it’s a great signing for Liverpool. Just as much as it’s good for us, I think it will be good for him as well - he wants to develop as a player. Coming to Liverpool to play with the group of lads we’ve got, and the manager we’ve got, will enhance his game and take his game to another level. It’s a great environment to be around. He can play in numerous positions as well, similar to me.<br /><br />I just think the way the team plays suits him, with his power and his speed, combined with the ability he has got. The kind of full-throttle football that the manager wants us to play, he’ll be a fantastic addition and give us options - which is something we didn’t have at stages last season. We want to progress and ultimately win something. You can’t do that with 11, 12 or 13 players, you need a squad. The squad looks big and full of quality. It’s exciting times.<br /><br />Our record is there against the top teams and it’s also fair to say we’ll fancy ourselves in the Champions League. I’ll miss the first few games but I’m sure the lads will put us into a great position. Hopefully I’ll be back for the last three of the group stages possibly</p>

  <p><b>[Lallana vows to avoid complacency as he focuses on World Cup goal]</b> I’m fully fit now. I had to manage myself probably for the first couple of days. Hence why I wasn’t involved over in Holland. But it’s been a great end to the week personally. It’s great to be back out there in an England shirt for the first time this season since last summer. I’m confident enough in my own ability and what I bring to the squad. I’m smart enough not to be complacent and to know that there’s plenty of talented players that want to make the squad, even lads who aren’t here today. I’ll go back to my club now, we’ve got Palace at the weekend then <b>[Manchester]</b> City, then the Merseyside derby, then City. So it doesn’t stop. Straight back into it tomorrow at Melwood and just keep ticking over and look to get that rhythm. At any level I’m not built with complacency. I think you see that in the way I play. The people that manage me know that, my teammates know that. I’m not built like that.<br /><br />To get that rhythm you just need minutes on the pitch. It’s not just about training, it’s about playing competitive football. And there’s plenty of time between now and the end of the season. I think the assistant said to me one of the World Cups Darren Anderton hadn’t played a competitive game until the 11th of April so that just shows you. I’m not one that sulks when he’s injured. I use it as time to learn, to pick up on things. So I studied all the England games, every one they played, I watched them closely, the Brazil, the Germany game when we changed the system, thinking when I’m back fit where do I see myself playing in that system. Me and the boss <b>[Gareth Southgate]</b> have got a great relationship. We’ve been speaking frequently throughout the season. He’s been interested to know where I’ve been on my rehab. I’ve been down to St George’s Park a couple of times. I suppose that’s where the confidence comes from. He recognises what I bring to the team. My teammates recognise that and I recognise that. So although I’ve been injured, these things happen. I feel I’m physically and mentally as fresh as anyone going into the backend of the season and for the World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[Adam Lallana is hoping to be like a new signing for Liverpool in 2018-19 after shaking off the injury issues]</b> Of course it was frustrating because I wanted to be there. It is what it is. Sometimes when you are a professional footballer, you have to deal with tough decisions. So I was just supporting them like any other fan. My best mate Jordan <b>[Henderson]</b> was there and he was one of the best players. It was great to see him do so well. The team got to a semi-final and it was a remarkable achievement.<br /><br /><b>[Lallana added on hearing Southgate brand him a key player in his plans]</b> I still feel that is the case. If I had been fit and had a half decent season in terms of availability, there is no shadow of a doubt that I would have been there. But I had a disappointing season in terms of my fitness and, you know, it just wasn’t meant to be. But that is in the past and I’m back in pre-season, three weeks down the line. The next goal is West Ham and I want to be in the best possible shape for it. I want to play good football again<br /><br />Last season was so stop-start that it was more or less written off. It probably is like having a new signing, to be fair<br /><br /><b>[On Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain]</b> He’s such a good kid. We obviously knew the full extent of the injury, more or less, when it happened. We are friends, we are team-mates and he wanted to keep it all in-house. He wanted us to focus on the Champions League final. That shows he is not just focused on himself and what is best for him. He wants what is best for the team and there are so many players with that mind-set in the squad. That is why we have been so successful. It is up to myself and the other lads to have a good season for him. It was the likes of him who had outstanding form in the Champions League and, as a result, I got to feature in the final. We are a team. When someone else is injured, they are the ones who motivate you. It’s not just for yourself - it’s for them</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool blocking out the noise of title doubters]</b> We do things off the pitch together, we fight on the pitch for each other and that’s really what is special. We’ve lost together, we’ve lost a Champions League final together, and moments like that make you stronger. It’s a marathon, not a sprint and there are always going to be little hiccups, positive moments, bad moments, injuries, illnesses and suspensions. It’s about coming through it together. Media is a big part of the world - and, of course, they have got to have things to talk about - so part of me is not surprised that it <b>[Liverpool’s form]</b> is a talking point from the outside, but there are times during the season - and in lots of walks of life - when we’ve got to block the noise out and come together. That togetherness is what keeps you fighting, keeps you focused on what needs to be done and what the important points are. That’s what we’ll be doing going into the weekend’s game<br /><br />They are two tough teams we’ve just drawn against; it’s as simple as that, really. Of course, we were expected to win both games - but we expect to win any game, whoever we’re playing against, whether we’re playing against a team who has won the Champions League or a team that are fighting against relegation. It will be no different this weekend. We have to make sure our mentality is right and go out there to try to win the game.</p>

But we’re European champions, we’ve got a top squad, so I’ve had to be patient for my chance but delighted to come on and make an impact like that.<br /><br />It’s a long old season. We’ve got the Club World Cup to come. We’ve got the Carabao Cup next week, the Champions League this week, <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at the weekend. Just because I’ve not started any of the first nine <b>[league]</b> games, I don’t think that means I am not going to play a big part in this team. Football’s a funny game. I think the last couple of years, we’ve got the Champions League final with a maximum of four really fit central midfielders. It’s about just staying fit, staying strong and staying ready. I feel that’s where my focus will be<br /><br /><b>[Lallana admitted that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> left <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> as probably the happier team as they extended their unbeaten start to the campaign]</b> We could have won it. You know, another five, 10 minutes. I thought we were controlling the game, we were dictating the game. The last 15 minutes, when I was on the pitch you could feel that, you could feel that we got that little bit of confidence, that little bit of arrogance that we needed. We were calmer on the ball and we didn’t really have that in the first half. But these games are funny. It’s not a bad point<br /><br />Listen, everyone probably expected us to win but we knew it was going to be tough here today. We knew if we weren’t at our very best, we wouldn’t win. We weren’t at our best, we didn’t win but we ground out a point. And if you can do that when you don’t play your best, I think you’ve got a good chance of being successful throughout the season and that’s what we’ve shown today</p>

We were poor first half and it was important we gave a reaction in the second half. I thought we did. I had a big chance with about 15 to go, we just needed that goal for the momentum because it can change and that is exactly what happened today. It’s almost like a sixth sense.

We’ve got a few injuries at the time being and three or four kids on the bench, it’s a great experience for them being involved and so close to what’s been a special season so far. We can’t take our foot off the gas.

We’ll look back when we analyse the game and we can do better, we can improve better mentally and physically. I think we can make life easier for us, keep the ball better.

I’m enjoying playing for the best team in the world, it’s as simple as that. Whatever my contract situation is, that will be going on in the background. There’s not a chance that that will affect my commitment to this club. I have given 110 per cent throughout my <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> career and will continue to do so, whether that finishes at the end of the season or whether that continues.

  <p><b>[Adam Lallana says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> expected to win their FA Cup third-round derby date with <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> despite naming a young and relatively inexperienced side]</b> It was good but we expected to win. We said before the game that no matter what teamsheet we had, we’re at home <b>[and]</b> we expect to win.<br /><br />I think it was important that we went out there with that mentality because it’s such a fortress, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, and the young lads are around us experienced players day in, day out in training and it’s why the level is so high because in training we give them good games, we keep them on their toes and I think that absolutely showed out there.

  <p><b>[Adam Lallana offers even more insight into the mindset which is driving <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> It’s on us to keep grounded. We have such a great group of lads for that. We’ve come back in there and after the game we are speaking about how we could have seen it out better. I’m sure it was entertaining for the neutral but we don’t want to be winning games relying on our keeper or seeing shots go past the post. It’s a great mentality that we have, we don’t want to settle for just winning games. That’s a big reason why we are in the position we are. We want to be relentless<br /><br /><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> was the 10th league game this season that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have won by a single goal]</b> I think maybe we need to adapt. There is always room for improvement, and even <b>[against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>]</b> we could have controlled the game better. Maybe we were a little bit surprised at how much time we had on the ball, but it’s about keeping the ball better, manipulating the ball and seeing games out better if we want to improve and keep this unbeaten run going. Teams are going to adapt their philosophies to play against us, and we have to try and counter that and see games out better<br /><br /><b>[Lallana himself had made a significant contribution to the victory]</b> It was eventful when I came on. I think I calmed it down for the first 10 minutes, and then the last 20 minutes it was ‘do we go for the second goal or keep possession?’ We had all this time on the ball and we maybe dwelt on it too much at times and caused our own problems. But that’s what I say, we can always improve more. We don’t ever want to be complacent, and it’s good to look back and see places you can improve. That’s a good mentality to have<br /><br /><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s fitness and medical staff believe he is currently in the best shape he has been for a number of years]</b> It’s about training harder. When you’re not playing, it’s hard to maintain your fitness levels to come back in and be able to perform in this team. So you have to train harder, train stronger and make yourself ready, keep on top of everything, so when you are called upon you can deliver performances like last week <b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>]</b>. Obviously I want to be playing as much as possible, but I understand I have a role in this team. At times it might frustrate me, but it’s all about the team. We are winning games and that’s all that matters. I just want to contribute as much as possible. At times you’ve got to be patient, and that’s it. I just take it; another good training week, train hard and train strong, look to perform there and hopefully start at the weekend</p>
