  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s vice-president Jordi Cardoner claims <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> wants to return to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. When quizzed on the links to <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>]</b> It is not the time to talk about arrivals. We are in a process of departures; it is a period that expires on the 30th of this month. The correct thing is to say that <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> wants to return to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, ​​but I do not agree that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> worry about signing <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, this is not on the table. There are many things about his departure that I did not like, many things.<br /><br />There are claims that we have signed <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>. We have not signed anyone. We have not kept in touch with him. He and many more want to play for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. It does not surprise me that <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> wants to come back, it has already happened before with others and sometimes they have returned - <a href="cesc-fabregas.html">Cesc Fabregas</a>, <a href="gerard-pique.html">Gerard Pique</a>. <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is a great player, but the circumstances of how he left also have to be evaluated to see if this can become a reality.<br /><br /><b>[A move for <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> striker <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Antoine Griezmann</a> has been mooted for some time]</b> I understand that any player has the goal of coming to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, ​​where the best players in history have been. All players can be willing to come and want to play, but we have to have a balanced budget.</p>

  <p><b>[A deal to bring <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> back to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> from <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> should be ruled out at this time]</b> As of today, there’s no <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> case, as the president said, and it’s complicated. We are passive actors. We know he’s not happy in Paris and it’s a situation that needs to be resolved in Paris. We haven’t spoken to them. There is a lot of respect between the clubs and if there is a <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> case one day, we’ll talk. Today, at this time, it’s ruled out</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> vice-president Jordi Cardoner on <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s contract]</b> We are calm and there is a lot of positivity, especially in the dressing room. Leo will do what he thinks is fit, but Leo’s contract is very special because he is who he is. It’s a concession made to him and other players who deserve it. He can enter and leave the club when he sees fit. I’d love for him to stay for as long as he wants to play for our team</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> donate <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> naming rights to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> Foundation in fight against coronavirus]</b> We are very happy to be able to drive forward this initiative that offers something as emblematic as the name of our stadium, so that institutions, organisations, businesses who wise may associate themselves with it and as such, contribute to the fight against Covid-19, given that their investment will be used to finance research projects on the illness and projects that are working to eradicate or lessen its effects. Right now, we can quantify the effects of this health crisis but what we do know is that it will require all our resources to defeat it and for that reason it is so important that we all together make a solid, firm commitment. We are facing a global crisis without precedent in our modern history and we have to assume with courage and calm the responsibility that we have. For that reason, from both the club and the Foundation, we consider it vital at this time of humanitarian crisis to use all the resources available at the organisation to fight against the coronavirus pandemic and its consequences. It forms part of our way of doing things and of being as an institution. The cause, fighting against the coronavirus, is a global one. Being the top sporting entity on a world scale implies that we take on this challenge as fully as we can and if we can serve as inspiration for other organisations involved in the battle, perhaps we can create a wave of hope for millions of people around the world who are suffering due to this pandemic</p>
