  <p><b>[Juventus (4) vs (3) <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>. <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> defender Kalidou Koulibaly was left devastated by his injury time own goal that saw his side lose 4-3 to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> on Saturday]</b> It’s an own goal that hurts me because it came after an incredible comeback. I’m sorry but I have to, we have to accept it: we are strong. We have shown that. We’re going to prove it</p>

  <p><b>[Koulibaly responds to transfer talk as <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> line up summer bid]</b> I’m used to it. So many <b>[stories]</b> come out each day, which say I’m leaving. Right now, my only objective is to win with <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>. I don’t care about the rest. Our objective remains to beat the best teams in Italy and win the Scudetto. This season is more difficult because all the teams have got stronger and <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> has become more competitive. I haven’t made the best start to the season. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> remain the team to beat. For our part, we must work even harder, improving our game to get closer to them.<br /><br />Our objective is to qualify for the Champions League knockout stage as soon as possible. We started well by beating <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> with a top performance. We regret not beating Genk, but that’s football. We must think positively and be aware that we can do well. My objective is to help the club and team win a trophy now</p>
