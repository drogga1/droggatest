  <p><b>[Koulibaly’s sending-off was the result of the defender being highly aggravated by the shameful chants]</b> I’m disappointed by the defeat, but above all at leaving my brothers. But I am proud of the colour of my skin. Proud to be French, Senegalese, Neapolitan: Man.</p>

  <p><b>[Kalidou Koulibaly is confident Maurizio Sarri will be a success at Chelsea]</b> They <b>[Chelsea]</b> can expect nice football because he is a very good coach. I’m disappointed that he leaves like this, but we have now a big coach <b>[Carlo Ancelotti]</b>. We know we can win something with him. I hope he will win something with Chelsea because he’s a nice coach. When a coach like this comes he needs time. So, I think they have to give him time because he will change the football of Chelsea, I think. At Napoli we enjoyed it very much as players and the supporters enjoyed it very much. At Chelsea I think it will be the same.</p>

  <p><b>[On Maurizio Sarri]</b> He rediscovered me, he gave me confidence. He really is a genius, he sees things others don’t see. He makes you understand how football is and isn’t unpredictable. He’s a scholar. Any question you ask him, he always has an answer, and it’s always right. He helps you to think as a team and not as an individual. When he arrived he told me: ‘Do as I say and you’ll become an important player’. I’m trying, but I know I can still improve. In short, with Sarri football is maths.</p>

Everyone’s speaking about me, but I’m only speaking about Senegal, because that’s my objective today and I want to achieve something big with Senegal.<br /><br /><b>[Koulibaly wanted to shift the focus from himself and transfer rumours to his national side]</b> I don’t want to talk about my future today, I prefer to talk about Senegal. Senegal achieved something great today. I am 200 per cent with Senegal and 200% with the 15 million Senegalese people. I’m relaxed, I want to focus on the Afcon and after that return to <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> and we’ll see what happens. The most important thing now is to win with Senegal.</p>

  <p><b>[Koulibaly says Italian authorities have to take stronger stance on racism]</b> I realised some <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> fans were making monkey noises whenever I touched the ball. It is impossible to know what you are supposed to do in this moment. There were times when I wanted to walk off the pitch to make a point, but then I told myself that this is exactly what they want. I remember thinking to myself, ‘Why do they do this? Because I am black? Is it not normal to be a black guy in this world?’. You are just playing the game you love, like you have done a thousand times before. You feel hurt. You feel insulted. Honestly, it gets to a point where you feel practically ashamed of yourself.<br /><br /><b>[The defender praised the response of referee Irrati, who consulted with Koulibaly as well as coaches and officials before allowing the game to go on. Despite <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> finishing the game at the top of <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>, Koulibaly left the pitch ‘very, very angry’, but sought out a young mascot that had asked for his shirt before kick-off. Eventually finding him in the stands, he was taken aback as the youngster apologised for the abuse Koulibaly had received during the game]</b> This really affected me a lot. This little guy was apologising for I don’t know how many grown men. And this was the first thing he thinks about - how I was feeling. This is the spirit of a child. This is what we are missing in the world right now. I know that these incidents are not just happening because of skin colour. I hear what some fans call my teammates, too. They call the Serbian players ‘gypsies,’ they call even an Italian like <a href="lorenzo-insigne.html">Lorenzo Insigne</a> ‘Neapolitan sh*t.’ We need to do better. An incident happens, the clubs make a nice statement, and then it happens again. In England, we see how much has changed. When the person is identified, they are banned from the stadium forever. I hope that one day it is the same in Italy. But I also think of the people doing this. How can you make the people change? How can you reach them in their heart? I do not have the answers for this</p>

I need you tonight, Kouli. I really need you. You can’t go’. I say, ‘This is the birth of my son, Mister. You can do whatever you want to me. Fine me, suspend me, I don’t care. I am going’. <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> looks so stressed, and he is smoking his cigarette. Smoking, smoking, thinking <b>[…]</b> then finally he says, ‘O.K., O.K., you can go to the clinic. But you have to be back for the match tonight.

But for me, this story is everything that I love about <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>. If I have to explain it, then you won’t understand. It is like trying to explain a joke.
