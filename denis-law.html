  <p><b>[on Sir Alex Ferguson]</b> It would take me a long time to sum up what Alex has done for English football during his time at United. He has turned out to be one of the greatest managers the world has ever seen, if not the greatest</p>

  <p><b>[Quote on Sir Bobby Charlton]</b> He was a beautiful player, and a lovely striker of the ball; 30 yarders into the roof of the net - I couldn’t even reach the goal from 18 yards!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Quote on Sir Bobby Charlton]</b> If he was in the center of the field and coming through, and if he was 30 yards from goal, I knew that he was going to have a shot. And I knew that if he got it on target, and the goalkeeper saved it, the chances of him holding it cleanly was very rare. Therefore, as soon as I saw him line up for a shot, I would be in on the goalkeeper. So I got a lot of my goals from Bobby, really</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Quote on Sir Bobby Charlton]</b> The game is never easy but it becomes easier when you’ve got players like that. Bobby had a bit of everything. He was a marvellous crosser of a ball and scored a tremendous amount of goals. He had a fantastic shot, it was so powerful. I knew if he was going to shoot there was a fair chance the goalkeeper wouldn’t be able to hold it, so I would follow up and invariably the guy would drop it</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Mythbuster: Denis Law relegated Manchester United]</b> I just felt depressed, and that wasn’t like me. After 19 years of trying my hardest to score goals, here was one that I almost wished hadn’t actually gone in. I was inconsolable. I didn’t want it to happen<br /><br /><b>[Even if United had won, it wouldn’t have saved them from relegation as <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a> beat <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> to ensure their survival. That was of no consolation to Law, though, particularly as the final goal of his illustrious career at the highest level became the most famous of his career. Indeed, in 2012, he was asked how long did the pain of netting against United last?]</b> How long ago was the game? There is your answer. The subject always crops up. It’s one of those things. It’s always there and I am always remembered for it. That’s a shame</p>
