  <p><b>[Memphis Depay is aiming to go on an English course when he arrives at Manchester United]</b> I want to continue to improve my English. I understand everything, I can talk, but I’m going to do a course. The fact that I can speak it now I owe to the fact I play at <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> with many foreigners. With all those guys, English is the official language</p>

  <p><b>[Memphis Depay refused to compare his wonder goal to that of former England captain <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>’s famous halfway-line effort for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> against Wimbledon in 1996]</b> I’m not <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>. I don’t compare myself to such a legend. I think it’s great for me to score a goal like this. I tried the same thing a few years ago when I played for <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> and I hit the bar. This time, I got lucky. I realised in the first half that the keeper was off his line all the time. We put on pressure, I looked at him, and as soon as we won the ball I knew where he was, so all I had to do was turn and just do it - don’t think, just shoot. I didn’t even see the ball go in, I just saw the stadium going crazy. I think I’ve scored the best goal of my life. Aside from that, I’m very happy because the team has taken an important victory</p>

  <p><b>[Memphis Depay says <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> forward <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> has been called ‘extraordinary’ and ‘an inspiration]</b> It will be hard to dethrone <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> as the best striker. He is extraordinary. I think he’s an inspiration for all the attackers and a nightmare for the defenders. As an attacker, we love to see what he does<br /><br /><b>[Depay also hit out at critics who undermine the quality of France’s top flight]</b> I think <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> is underestimated. People do not know how high the level is. Some teams produce a very physical game, but also very fast. There are also many good players who are leaving this championship. They do a good job here, and I’ve seen it since I arrived. Am I surprised to still be in <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a>? Life always takes unexpected turns. My journey has never been easy. But, of course, I am ambitious. I am aiming for the top. We’ll see how long it takes. Only God knows<br /><br />Yes, I was in contact with <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> before my departure for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. They were one of the clubs that wanted me, but I chose <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. A leader does a lot of things. I try to do as much as possible to have a positive effect on the team. I’m 25 years old and I have played a lot of matches. As a captain, I am a leader, but it has to come from the heart, from the inside</p>

  <p><b>[Memphis Depay claims <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> players were spat on by their own fans after taking offence to a donkey banner aimed at Brazilian defender Marcelo]</b> I’m upset, angry. We didn’t play our best but we’re through. We gave everything. When someone on the team’s not supported by the fans, what do you expect from the players? Who has time to make a banner like that? People have kids, they go to work. Who has time to paint a donkey? If you have time for that, you really need to have something better to do with your life. They spat on us. I’ve never seen anything like it</p>

I don’t know what to say. You know how hard it is for the team when we know that somebody on our team has troubles with the supporters? What do you expect from us? You go to the supporters and thank them and they say crazy, crazy things about somebody’s family, somebody’s kids. I’ve got no words. It doesn’t make sense. You can see on the camera, the fans spit on us. What can I say? I’ve never seen anything like this<br /><br /><b>[And while his passion was obvious, he was self-aware enough to prevent it overwhelming him as it might have done previously]</b> Frankly, I had to be a little careful. It reminds me of my past, my life. I don’t want to be that man. I’ve matured, I’m calmer</p>

Van Dijk, watch out, he strikes.<br /><br />You know, we don’t lie, Dutchman, he is fly. Van Dijk, man.

  <p><b>[Depay will play for <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> in cup final and Champions League but long-term future is uncertain]</b> He will play in the finals that await us. Unhappily, the international transfer window will last until October 13, so we’ve got until then to pick our players. There will be departures and we’re going to have to make choices because we’ve already got more than 30 players. We’ll have to let some go, loan others, and we’re going to have to find compromises to have a good team. Coming out of such a crisis, you have to aim for the top places. I’m not saying the title, but why not?</p>
