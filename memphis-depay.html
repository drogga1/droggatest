In any case, I think he has said good things about me.<br /><br />I’m known because I score goals and provide assists. But I also know the leading scorer here, Alexandre Lacazette. We have a good understanding, his movement is very good. I feel very good, in top form. My first week was good, training went very well, and little by little I’m getting back into the rhythm. Now I think I’m ready to start a game as of the next match. I’m training hard, my fitness is good. I think I can push for a starting place for the next game</p>

  <p><b>[Memphis Depay says his incredible goal against Toulouse on Sunday was the best of his career]</b> It’s great for me to score a goal like this. A few years ago, I tried the same thing when I played for PSV. I do not know who it was against. I was 10 meters away and I hit the bar. This time I was lucky. I think I scored the best goal of my life. Besides that, I’m very happy because the team got an important victory. We had to take the three points at home. From the first period, I realised that the goalkeeper was playing away from his line. I didn’t touch the ball in the middle of the field but I kept it in a corner of my mind. At the time, we pressed high and the ball was recovered. I knew where the goalkeeper was. Without thinking, I tried my luck in turning. I didn’t even see the ball go in but I saw the stadium in delirium. The other day I saw Alex Lacazette score a magnificent goal and I told him I had to do the same. As I told my colleagues, I should have scored a hat-trick..<br /><br />These two matches are very important and if we show the same qualities that we did against Toulouse this Sunday, we can do beautiful things. I think that I make progress every day in training. I’m getting to know the team and my team-mates better and better. I have more landmarks on the field, I’m starting to know where to give them the ball and where they can give me the ball… I have high hopes for the future</p>

He’s a man who has been successful in his life and has, without doubt, done many good things for children and poor people in his country. He deserves respect.<br /><br /><b>[Along with Patrick Kluivert, Arjen Robben and Lionel Messi, Depay picked the Ballon d’Or holder as someone he continues to look up to]</b> These guys are footballing legends who always want to win and who are a source of inspiration for young players<br /><br />You can call me what you want. OK, so you want to get to the bottom of it. OK!<br /><br />I spent a period of my youth that many would find it tough to understand. It was full of things that I’ve never spoken about. Maybe I’ll write a book one day about where I came from. But this story with my dad, it’s fine, it’s settled today.<br /><br />Just before the holidays, I spoke to him. I had to do it, I am now an adult. I forgave him. For a long time I told myself, ‘He’s never been there for me. Why should I wear his name on my back?’. I suffered a great deal during my childhood. But I’ve grown up and become a mature man. Everyone makes mistakes. And his was a big mistake. But if I’m not capable of forgiving him, I could never forgive myself. That’s not to say we’re going to be the best friends in the world, but it’s done and I’m happy.<br /><br />I see the benefits of everything I’ve done today. I’m 23 years old, I’m going to marry a woman who’s going to take my name, I can look after my mother, I get up every day to do a job I’ve always dreamed of and I play for a great club</p>

We’re currently going through a difficult period, we’re no longer the Dutch team of a couple of years ago. We now have many young players and need support.<br /><br />Looking at the future of Orange, I have good hope. We will have to be strong as a team, preferably with the whole country behind us. So we can go back to something beautiful.<br /><br />You know, there is often some bad talk about me. Usually, it’s about my behaviour. But what exactly is wrong with what I do? I’m a 23-year-old man, someone who is also developing as a person. We are all developing that way, right?<br /><br />Apparently, the things I do outside of the football are not taken as positives. I don’t care, but sometimes it amazes me. I’m focused on football and my career. No one really has to doubt that. Outside, I do other things that make me happy. I’m not a football player 24 hours a day. There is an idea of ​​how professional football players should live.<br /><br />If I lock myself at home after training, I become unhappy. That will eventually have a negative effect on my football. I’ve noticed it in practice. I feel blessed with my life. Happy with who I am. I hope you are, too, I hope everyone is.

I always wanted to become a professional footballer, but for a long time I did things that weren’t going to make it happen. I hope to be an example for others. Some choices keep chasing you. I lived on the edge and was lucky to get out. For others it might end up badly. I used to be on the streets at night and did things a boy that age shouldn’t do. My talent saved me, for sure. On the pitch, I always did what people expected from me.<br /><br /><b>[Depay has not always been so welcoming of reporters, and frequently ignored journalists as a young player]</b> I felt like people didn’t understand me. They wrote so many things about me that weren’t true. It struck me. I was young and didn’t know how to react to that. People looked at a certain way to me because they’ve read things that aren’t true. That’s annoying, but I know how to deal with those things now</p>

  <p><b>[Memphis Depay says <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> forward <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> has been called ‘extraordinary’ and ‘an inspiration]</b> It will be hard to dethrone <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> as the best striker. He is extraordinary. I think he’s an inspiration for all the attackers and a nightmare for the defenders. As an attacker, we love to see what he does<br /><br /><b>[Depay also hit out at critics who undermine the quality of France’s top flight]</b> I think <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> is underestimated. People do not know how high the level is. Some teams produce a very physical game, but also very fast. There are also many good players who are leaving this championship. They do a good job here, and I’ve seen it since I arrived. Am I surprised to still be in <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a>? Life always takes unexpected turns. My journey has never been easy. But, of course, I am ambitious. I am aiming for the top. We’ll see how long it takes. Only God knows<br /><br />Yes, I was in contact with <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> before my departure for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. They were one of the clubs that wanted me, but I chose <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. A leader does a lot of things. I try to do as much as possible to have a positive effect on the team. I’m 25 years old and I have played a lot of matches. As a captain, I am a leader, but it has to come from the heart, from the inside</p>

  <p><b>[Memphis Depay claims <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> players were spat on by their own fans after taking offence to a donkey banner aimed at Brazilian defender <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a>]</b> I’m upset, angry. We didn’t play our best but we’re through. We gave everything. When someone on the team’s not supported by the fans, what do you expect from the players? Who has time to make a banner like that? People have kids, they go to work. Who has time to paint a donkey? If you have time for that, you really need to have something better to do with your life. They spat on us. I’ve never seen anything like it</p>

  <p><b>[As the team went to celebrate with their supporters at the end of the match, one made his way pitchside and brandished a banner portraying a donkey with a message for centre-back <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> - who had played the last couple of minutes - telling him to Get Lost]</b> I’m upset, angry. I don’t know what to say. You know how hard it is for the team when we know that somebody on our team has troubles with the supporters? What do you expect from us? You go to the supporters and thank them and they say crazy, crazy things about somebody’s family, somebody’s kids. I’ve got no words. It doesn’t make sense. You can see on the camera, the fans spit on us. What can I say? I’ve never seen anything like this<br /><br /><b>[And while his passion was obvious, he was self-aware enough to prevent it overwhelming him as it might have done previously]</b> Frankly, I had to be a little careful. It reminds me of my past, my life. I don’t want to be that man. I’ve matured, I’m calmer</p>

  <p><b>[Memphis Depay’s rap tribute to <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a>]</b> It is on. Captain of the nation, What move will he make? And I didn’t forget, The days in the rain.

  <p><b>[Depay will play for <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> in cup final and Champions League but long-term future is uncertain]</b> He will play in the finals that await us. Unhappily, the international transfer window will last until October 13, so we’ve got until then to pick our players. There will be departures and we’re going to have to make choices because we’ve already got more than 30 players. We’ll have to let some go, loan others, and we’re going to have to find compromises to have a good team. Coming out of such a crisis, you have to aim for the top places. I’m not saying the title, but why not?</p>
