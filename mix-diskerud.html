  <p><b>[Mix Diskerud discusses the secrets behind his hairstyle]</b> I could tell you, but I’d have to kill you! There’s some different products I use and I won’t reveal that yet, but there’s different techniques to doing shampooing and conditioning</p>

  <p><b>[Former USA national team midfielder Mix Diskerud sees plenty of potential in Christian Pulisic]</b> He’s a fantastic player, I think everybody who likes soccer can see that he is. If he keeps on performing on the level that he does these days, both at club and international level, I can’t see why he shouldn’t be deserving of all kind of praise.<br /><br /><b>[Pulisic has been hailed in some American media outlets as the best player the country has ever produced, but Diskerud is not of the mind to hand him that label]</b> In my book there is no such thing as ‘greatest of all time’. From my generation, we have had Landon Donovan, Tim Howard, Clint Dempsey and Cobi Jones. I am just worthy of naming them - not of rating them. They were all pieces we needed and luckily got. And for that all sport-loving Americans should be grateful</p>

  <p><b>[Mix Diskerud: I would give every limb on my body for the USMNT]</b> I would offer every limb in my body for the U.S, national team. The USMNT concerns and excites me a whole deal. I have been, and am, one of their biggest fans. <br /><br />I feel like I’ve got some unfinished business there <b>[in MLS]</b>. Whether it comes to me playing in the States in the future, I do not know. I’ve enjoyed traveling the world, and maybe I might keep trying new continents. South America would be pretty interesting, no?<br /><br />For me, football at large is about creating memories, developing as a person and as a player, and striving to win, in that order. All those boxes were ready to be checked off for me when I chose to move to the far east and play for Ulsan Hyundai. I get messages on social media quite often from South Koreans, asking me to come back. That definitely puts a smile on my face, and shows that they appreciated me as much as I appreciated them</p>
