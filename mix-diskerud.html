  <p><b>[Mix Diskerud discusses the secrets behind his hairstyle]</b> I could tell you, but I’d have to kill you! There’s some different products I use and I won’t reveal that yet, but there’s different techniques to doing shampooing and conditioning</p>

  <p><b>[Former United States international Mix Diskerud believes the nation might have continued on an upswing if <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Jurgen Klinsmann</a> had not been fired in 2016]</b> Well, <b>[in between 2013-2016]</b>, the USMNT played a fantastic World Cup in Brazil. Getting through the group of death as they called it, and also coming close to beating a top-ranked Belgium side in the knockout stages. That was an achievement that should be counted among the many positive achievements. So, good things happened, and could have continued to happen if we didn’t switch coaches in the middle of the qualifying cycle. <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Klinsmann</a> was fired before the CONCACAF qualification was completed, and while the betting markets still had their odds strongly pointing toward a USMNT participation in Russia. In retrospect it is easy to say that that sacking was rather immature.<br /><br /><b>[Coach]</b> Berhalter, he carries credibility with me, but I have never played for him. My agents came close to signing me for his Columbus Crew a few years back. The talks I had with him back then revealed a coach with clear thoughts as well as definite strategies for how modern soccer should be played. It left me with the view of him that I still carry today - an extremely analytical coach and yet very much a ‘player’s coach’. I have had friends playing under him; and at club level, it is no doubt that he lifted their potential considerably as well as instilling valuable confidence in them<br /><br /><b>[Diskerud still expects the USMNT to be in the mix for the final]</b> USA are always favorites. At least in our mindset. That is, and should always be, the American mentality, and I love it. A final showing Mexico vs USA is always a crowd-pleaser! And especially since I’m told just to be a part of that supporting crowd for now</p>

  <p><b>[Mix Diskerud says that he believes that American soccer players have every right to express their political opinions]</b> I think every person has the right to choose their political stance and stand by it. However, if it truly is a team that is giving you your status and lets you have a platform to speak at all, you need to be very, very careful of what you say, express, and when you say it. In society, we all have roles apart from being individuals. So even if I am a firm believer in individuality, I would personally always respond positively to the honor of receiving an invitation from any U.S. President. That is as long as she or he acts as the Commander in Chief or as the unifying leader of our nation, and not behaves as a private individual when holding office.<br /><br />Alex Morgan is a fine person. She can forge and unify most of people, I think. She has proved that. I’d say she has enough grit to make the right decision no matter who tries to corrupt or persuade her. Therefore, her final decision, when she eventually has to make it, will not be criticized or critiqued by me<br /><br /><b>[The USWNT have been at the center of a legal battle with U.S. Soccer over equal pay]</b> In general I believe in both free market evaluation mechanisms and in non-discrimination. Sometimes that translates into equal pay, sometimes not. I think there are several components that in aggregate really should determine how US Soccer should reimburse or pay their national team players. And the difference in definition between payment and reimbursements are key to most discussions concerning National Team politics on remuneration worldwide, for both women and men. In the US there clearly has been times where I have thought the women have been ‘underpaid’ in relation to their actual contribution in building a market value for US Soccer, but in some other countries - not.<br /><br />When it comes to club level, I think it is most fair to let the market itself decide. But again, that opinion is based on the free-market principle between players and free-standing, independent clubs. We don’t have that balance in the US. There, we have something even less optimal<br /><br /><b>[After thrashing Thailand 13-0 in their opener, Diskerud has liked what he’s seen so far from the U.S. team]</b> They don’t have a key player, and that is a great thing. I give them a 70 per cent chance of making the final. And once there I give them an 85% chance of winning the cup. You see, the way the groups are set up - the US team’s quarter-final could be the tricky one. Thailand will be the only team that’s a walk-in-the-park</p>

  <p><b>[Former USA national team midfielder Mix Diskerud sees plenty of potential in <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a>]</b> He’s a fantastic player, I think everybody who likes soccer can see that he is. If he keeps on performing on the level that he does these days, both at club and international level, I can’t see why he shouldn’t be deserving of all kind of praise.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="christian-pulisic.html">Pulisic</a> has been hailed in some American media outlets as the best player the country has ever produced, but Diskerud is not of the mind to hand him that label]</b> In my book there is no such thing as ‘greatest of all time’. From my generation, we have had <a href="landon-donovan.html">Landon Donovan</a>, Tim Howard, Clint Dempsey and Cobi Jones. I am just worthy of naming them - not of rating them. They were all pieces we needed and luckily got. And for that all sport-loving Americans should be grateful</p>

  <p><b>[Mix Diskerud: I would give every limb on my body for the USMNT]</b> I would offer every limb in my body for the U.S, national team. The USMNT concerns and excites me a whole deal. I have been, and am, one of their biggest fans.<br /><br />I feel like I’ve got some unfinished business there <b>[in MLS]</b>. Whether it comes to me playing in the States in the future, I do not know. I’ve enjoyed traveling the world, and maybe I might keep trying new continents. South America would be pretty interesting, no?<br /><br />For me, football at large is about creating memories, developing as a person and as a player, and striving to win, in that order. All those boxes were ready to be checked off for me when I chose to move to the far east and play for Ulsan Hyundai. I get messages on social media quite often from South Koreans, asking me to come back. That definitely puts a smile on my face, and shows that they appreciated me as much as I appreciated them</p>
