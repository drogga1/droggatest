  <p><b>[Marc Wilmots on his influence in Belgium’s revival]</b> I’m nobody. I’m nothing at all. Like everyone else, I will die one day and finish up in a wooden box. I’m just happy to see that the national team is riding a new, positive wave. It’s especially fun to a squad that has struggled for ten years</p>

Even within a very strong team, Eden stands out because he has that something extra. Against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> he literally toyed with international defenders. Technically he is amazing. He is intelligent. He is hardly ever injured. His work-rate and defensive impact are huge too. The small flaws he did have, which were noted by <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> and I, are almost non-existent these days, in particular his former nonchalance. Eden is going to do what <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> have done for years</p>

  <p><b>[Marc Wilmots on <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine</a> <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>]</b> I once played a charity game with <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>. It was crazy. The ball was a part of him - nothing was impossible. I have the same feeling when I see Eden playing. But I don’t tolerate one moment of him slacking off. He has to improve his stats in the national team. Where’s he at now? He’s scored five goals, two of them penalties, in almost 50 games. That’s not enough. I wasn’t as talented as he was, but I scored 29 goals for Belgium. I love Eden, but I ask him to be more influential</p>

  <p><b>[Belgium coach Marc Wilmots has urged Eden Hazard to add more goals to his game]</b> Hazard is rising higher and higher. He was at Lille for two years and was already one of the best players in France. He won the league and the cup - so he already had success. He started early, when he was only 17 years old. I already knew him back then. And now he is 23 and a top star at Chelsea. But he has to score more goals. That goes for Chelsea and the national team. Eden keeps marching on and what he has done is amazing, considering his age.<br /><br />I prefer not to say anything about it in the media. But if Eden asks me for advice, I will talk to him<br /><br />It was difficult for Romelu at Chelsea. The competition was fierce. Now he is at Everton where he found something like a family club and in Roberto Martinez a coach who believes in him. It is important for a striker to feel this trust. In my team his rivals are Christian Benteke and Divock Origi. So it is not easy for him to be a regular here, too</p>

He will go his own way, not the way of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> or <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. When I see him, I see Zidane</p>

  <p><b>[Eden Hazard’s late winner in Belgium’s 1-0 defeat of Cyprus was not enough to spare him the wrath of coach Marc Wilmots]</b> He was the worst tonight. I thought about substituting him, but in the last 10 minutes he always the ability to do that. At the World Cup, this was the case. I obviously expect more from him, but he will grow as the season progresses.<br /><br />The contribution of Origi and Mertens in the second half was important, because I wanted quick combinations. As a result, in the last half hour we were often dangerous. Collectively, this was one of our worst performances I do not know why. Maybe because we’re still early in the season and we cannot yet play at a high enough pace. Guys like Marouane Fellaini have little rhythm in the legs<br /><br />We have to play two games in 72 hours, which is evident, especially in this heat. Moreover, everyone wants to win against us, and this also applies to Cyprus</p>

  <p><b>[Andorra vs Belgium]</b> Qualification would be a reward for the work of recent years. If we qualify Saturday, we can certainly enjoy it. But I cannot guarantee a big win. Italy only beat Malta 1-0. Even small nations are increasingly well organised and give away little space. You should not necessarily expect champagne football.<br /><br /><b>[On Jason Denayer]</b> Kompany is doing an individual program and that is going well. It is not a serious injury to Denayer, but the pain remains. The medical staff will continue to monitor him</p>

  <p><b>[Belgium manager Marc Wilmots insists that Vincent Kompany is fit to play in their final Euro 2016 qualifying match against Israel]</b> Vincent Kompany has participated fully in training and without any problems. He has worked hard in training and knows his own body well. I’ve not been in contact with Man City myself but the club are kept up to date with developments. I think it will be good for Man City if Kompany gets some match time.</p>

  <p><b>[Marc Wilmots says Belgium must approach Euro 2016 with complete confidence if they are to reach their target of a semi-final spot]</b> I’m not unhappy with the draw. We say to everyone that we must reach the semi-finals, so we must start the tournament with complete confidence. It’s a difficult group, but against Ireland and Sweden normally we can win. The first match against Italy probably will be the hardest. But the first two teams go through and, together with Italy, we’re the favourites in this group. We must play like during the World Cup, where we won all our group matches. We must start with the same intention.</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Benteke’s uninspiring maiden campaign at Liverpool could cost him a spot at Euro 2016]</b> It’s difficult. Klopp arrived at Liverpool and has made his choice. Now, Christian Benteke is full of doubt. It’s a shame for Benteke, but he still has time to show what he can do at Liverpool. He already missed the World Cup due to injury, missing the Euros would be painful for him. I will choose according to the profiles, not on the form of the last two months or anything like this. Batshuayi is a goalscorer, a penalty area player. Benteke is better with his head and in combinations. Lukaku is strong and fast</p>

  <p><b>[Marc Wilmots is expected to deploy Guillaume Gillet at right-back after Toby Alderweireld withdrew from the squad through illness]</b> Guillaume has never disappointed, he was still doing well at right-back with Anderlecht and currently plays with great confidence. So much has happened during the last days. Players could still fall sick or get injured, so we will consider the team tomorrow - and I do not want to give the opposition an advantage.<br /><br />The result is not the most important thing tomorrow, but the manner of our play. I want to see discipline, a collective block and good pressing. The solidity of the team interests me. We are missing some important players, but that’s not an excuse for us. Those who have played less have the opportunity to show themselves. We should not weep for the many injured players. If there is a problem, we find a solution. Belgium does not want to lose, Belgium wants to win<br /><br /><b>[On Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> He is a player who was once considered the best in the world. He is a player who scores 45 goals per season. He has won everything there is to win at club level; he is just missing something with the national team<br /><br />He’s one of the best players in the world, but Portugal has other good players in attack like Quaresma, Nani and Danny. There will not be anti-Ronaldo tactics</p>

That means a player has revealed the selection. And that’s serious. It came back to me from several French journalists that Papa Courtois was doing it. It means that you do not respect your homeland. I find it a shame because I have to wait an hour before the match to have the opposing line-up. And that’s terrible. The opponent is gaining time. He can prepare everything. He knows everything. And that’s really dramatic. It never happened at the World Cup in Brazil</p>
