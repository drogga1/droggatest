  <p><b>[Marc Wilmots on his influence in Belgium’s revival]</b> I’m nobody. I‘m nothing at all. Like everyone else, I will die one day and finish up in a wooden box. I’m just happy to see that the national team is riding a new, positive wave. It’s especially fun to a squad that has struggled for ten years</p>

  <p><b>[Marc Wilmots on Eden Hazard]</b> If you ask me if I want to swap him for <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> or <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, I’d keep <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>. Even within a very strong team, Eden stands out because he has that something extra. Against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> he literally toyed with international defenders. Technically he is amazing. He is intelligent. He is hardly ever injured. His work-rate and defensive impact are huge too. The small flaws he did have, which were noted by <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> and I, are almost non-existent these days, in particular his former nonchalance. Eden is going to do what <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> have done for years</p>

  <p><b>[Marc Wilmots on <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine</a> Zidane]</b> I once played a charity game with <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>. It was crazy. The ball was a part of him – nothing was impossible. I have the same feeling when I see Eden playing. But I don’t tolerate one moment of him slacking off. He has to improve his stats in the national team. Where’s he at now? He’s scored five goals, two of them penalties, in almost 50 games. That’s not enough. I wasn’t as talented as he was, but I scored 29 goals for Belgium. I love Eden, but I ask him to be more influential</p>

  <p><b>[Marc Wilmots on Eden Hazard]</b> We shouldn’t compare Eden to <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> or <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. He will go his own way, not the way of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> or <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. When I see him, I see Zidane</p>
