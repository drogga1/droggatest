  <p><b>[Moments after <a href="chris-coleman.html">Coleman</a>’s departure was confirmed on Sunday, the club said Short had agreed to sell Sunderland to an international consortium of football investors, headed by Donald, who relinquishes the ownership of non-league Eastleigh]</b> All of us involved in this believe that Sunderland represents an extraordinary opportunity</p>

  <p><b>[Stewart Donald has resigned as Sunderland chairman]</b> Holding this position has been a privilege, and not one I have given up lightly. Results and performances on the pitch have simply not been at a level befitting of Sunderland’s history and potential. I fully recognise that has caused immense hurt and, ultimately, the buck for the club starting a third successive season in League One stops with me.<br /><br />To give the club the best chance of achieving its goals, I have made the judgement that it is right for me to step back from the chairmanship. In recent months, we have assembled a strong board with relevant experience and skill-sets.<br /><br />As the majority stakeholder, my remaining responsibility is to ensure that the club has the requisite financial backing to achieve its primary objective of promotion, and I can assure supporters that the club will continue to have the highest playing budget in this division. Otherwise, my intention remains to sell SAFC to a suitable new owner, and I remain personally committed to that goal<br /><br />I would like to place on record my gratitude for the wonderful support that I have received since my arrival at the Stadium of Light. Without that support, the club would currently be facing a very uncertain future, as so many others are. Instead, starting from a position of relative financial stability, I hope that this moment will provide a springboard to the success that we all crave and SAFC fans deserve</p>
