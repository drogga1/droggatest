  <p><b>[Jonathan Walters on spitting]</b> As a player, you take anything off the ball, pinches and kicks that are meant to wind you up. But spitting is the lowest of the low. If it happened to me and someone spat at my face or towards me then I think he’d be eating his supper through a straw that night</p>

  <p><b>[Jonathan Walters insists that the Republic of Ireland still have a long way to go in their quest to secure qualification for Euro 2016]</b> Obviously we wanted to get six points this week and we did. But there’s still a long way to go towards qualifying. We have massive games next month. We’re a million miles away from qualifying yet, we have a long way to go. We have two games to go. We’ll go back to our clubs, and then come back and approach these games in the right way.<br /><br />We’re missing a couple of lads, Glenn and James, for the next game. But we have lads who can step in. We have a big squad, and someone will step in. I know Glenn from Stoke. A lot of what Glenn does it just keep us ticking away. He’ll be a loss to us, he’s a good player. James is a big loss too, but there’s other lads who can take their place<br /><br />They <b>[fans]</b> really help us win games. It’s like having an extra body on the pitch. Hopefully we can get a big crowd for Germany. It’s going to be a big game for us. But if we can get the results, hopefully we can get to the European finals</p>

  <p><b>[Jonathan Walters paid tribute to the work of manager Martin O’Neill and his assistant Roy Keane after firing Republic of Ireland to Euro 2016]</b> The whole team on the pitch are heroes, it was unbelievable from everyone. We’ve done it the hard way, but we got there. I’ve got to take it in because these moments don’t come around often. They’ve <b>[O’Neill and Keane]</b> been excellent throughout the whole campaign. It’s been a long, hard two years but finally we got there.</p>

  <p><b>[Typical Irish striker Daryl Murphy was also called from the bench as Ireland rejected modern tactics for Jack Charlton’s trademark 4-4-2. Who cares about the football as long as we get there? The points are all that matter]</b> It was a half where they were on the back foot. I think we were on the front foot since we came back out. The place was bouncing. We’re happy with the way we came back.</p>

  <p><b>[Cyrus Christie &amp; Jonathan Walters unhappy with officials as Ireland draw with Austria]</b> We should have came out with the win. It should have been an allowed goal, and possibly a penalty as well. They <b>[the officials]</b> have a hard enough job, but it was one of those games. A lot seemed to go against us. Especially the goal. The lad is what, five-foot-five, and you’ve got Duffy coming in, there’s only winner. There’s no foul. He’s got a running jump and he’s got a standing jump. There’s only one winner. We wanted three points. We didn’t get it, it wasn’t to be.</p>

  <p><b>[Burnley striker Jonathan Walters has ripped into Chelsea and Arsenal]</b> I’ll always shake hands afterwards with players, the manager, wish them the best. I always think, ‘Be graceful in defeat, don’t over-egg it when you win’. You get sore losers but then they’re at Chelsea for a reason - maybe they’re sore losers and that drives them. Arsenal are the worst for sore losers.<br /><br />Last year at the back, they <b>[Chelsea]</b> were strong, big, and horrible with <b>[Nemanja]</b> Matic sitting in front of them, a tough lad. Serbs are hard. Most of the Burnley lads were very surprised he went to <b>[Manchester]</b> United as well. They haven’t got Diego Costa upfront. Everyone hated him but you’d love to have him in the team, he’s brilliant, he’s the best at winding people up. But you could get to him in his head. Chelsea were a bit lightweight. We didn’t bully them either. I was watching our goals again, excellent goals, quick play, cross in the box, goal. It wasn’t like we lumped them in the box. Chelsea need to buck up a bit</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City have been urged to sign Declan Rice]</b> In my opinion he can go right to the top and without a shadow of a doubt he’s a target for the big teams, whether that be Manchester United or anyone else. If I was Manchester City I would be looking at him (Rice) because of the position that he plays where he can sit in front of that back four and do an unbelievable job. He’s available for the ball and right foot, left foot he deals with it. His passing is simple but he’s got a range. He covers a lot of ground and breaks up attacks. He can take players on. He is an ultimate player in that role and I’d be surprised if plenty of clubs aren’t in for him this summer.<br /><br />I know Declan pretty well because obviously I was involved in the Irish set-up with him. I spoke at length with him on his decision - both before and after - and I was desperate for him to declare for Ireland. He has gone with what he feels and you can’t argue with what someone feels. You could argue with the fact that he maybe shouldn’t have played in the first place but not with what he feels. It takes courage to make such a decision and he has made it and that doesn’t change my thoughts of him. I still think he’s a great guy and unbelievable player.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Republic of Ireland forward Jonathan Walters has hit back at criticism from pundit <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>, saying he ‘doesn’t know why people take any notice’ of the retired midfielder]</b> Listen, I know all about Jon Walters. I know all about him. Bluffer. Again, he talks a good game. Then he does the circuit, goes on the TV. How harsh he was treated by me, he’s crying on the TV, family situation, he’s the only one whose… do me a favour<br /><br />Honestly, I don’t know why people listen to what he has to say at times. In terms of the route I went down, I didn’t particularly want to go on TV and say that. It all came from a couple of years ago when I did an interview with Henry Winter and I broke down. He caught me by surprise and I broke down. It’s something I’ve never done in my career. Mentally as a player <b>[I was]</b> very tough - but he just got me to another place. And on the back of that, there were so many responses that came in. And I had a terrible year last year and someone got wind of it and I got asked to speak about it because of the responses I had previously. I went down that route and if someone wants to take it down that route, that’s fine, it’s up to them. But it doesn’t bother me one single bit what he has to say. Obviously I bother him a little bit, he doesn’t bother me one single bit. I don’t know why people take any notice most of the time</p>
