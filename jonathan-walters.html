  <p><b>[Jonathan Walters on spitting]</b> As a player, you take anything off the ball, pinches and kicks that are meant to wind you up. But spitting is the lowest of the low. If it happened to me and someone spat at my face or towards me then I think he’d be eating his supper through a straw that night</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City have been urged to sign Declan Rice]</b> In my opinion he can go right to the top and without a shadow of a doubt he’s a target for the big teams, whether that be Manchester United or anyone else. If I was Manchester City I would be looking at him (Rice) because of the position that he plays where he can sit in front of that back four and do an unbelievable job. He’s available for the ball and right foot, left foot he deals with it. His passing is simple but he’s got a range. He covers a lot of ground and breaks up attacks. He can take players on. He is an ultimate player in that role and I’d be surprised if plenty of clubs aren’t in for him this summer.<br /><br />I know Declan pretty well because obviously I was involved in the Irish set-up with him. I spoke at length with him on his decision - both before and after - and I was desperate for him to declare for Ireland. He has gone with what he feels and you can’t argue with what someone feels. You could argue with the fact that he maybe shouldn’t have played in the first place but not with what he feels. It takes courage to make such a decision and he has made it and that doesn’t change my thoughts of him. I still think he’s a great guy and unbelievable player.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Republic of Ireland forward Jonathan Walters has hit back at criticism from pundit <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>, saying he ‘doesn’t know why people take any notice’ of the retired midfielder]</b> Listen, I know all about Jon Walters. I know all about him. Bluffer. Again, he talks a good game. Then he does the circuit, goes on the TV. How harsh he was treated by me, he’s crying on the TV, family situation, he’s the only one whose… do me a favour<br /><br />Honestly, I don’t know why people listen to what he has to say at times. In terms of the route I went down, I didn’t particularly want to go on TV and say that. It all came from a couple of years ago when I did an interview with Henry Winter and I broke down. He caught me by surprise and I broke down. It’s something I’ve never done in my career. Mentally as a player <b>[I was]</b> very tough - but he just got me to another place. And on the back of that, there were so many responses that came in. And I had a terrible year last year and someone got wind of it and I got asked to speak about it because of the responses I had previously. I went down that route and if someone wants to take it down that route, that’s fine, it’s up to them. But it doesn’t bother me one single bit what he has to say. Obviously I bother him a little bit, he doesn’t bother me one single bit. I don’t know why people take any notice most of the time</p>
