<blockquote>
  <p><b>[<a href="alexander-isak.html">Isak</a> Ssewankambo left Cobham on his own terms when he was 18 after a first-team opportunity came up at NAC Breda]</b> <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> scouts came to watch my team, which was known across Gothenburg as producing great players. I played well and I went on trial before signing with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I had wanted to go abroad to develop anyway. The level was much higher, more serious and more competitive. In Sweden, you have a team with maybe four really good players but, at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, everyone was like that. So, it is not easy to play young players in a club that wants to win so much. At the same time, I felt like I was improving at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and getting a good education. I was positive that if I didn’t succeed in making it at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, then it was still a good platform to succeed somewhere else<br /><br /><b>[Ssewankambo also thinks that Colkett’s bravery will pay off]</b> Charlie didn’t know that it was going to be this competitive here. It was better than he thought. There are good players here, so English players can’t come here and automatically boss it. You need to come here and perform. Everyone knows these players come from <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, so they get instant respect. English players should look not only at Sweden but Holland and Belgium, as they have good development leagues. You don’t need to just stay in the English system. It’s great if you get a good Championship team, but if not, then look outside of England. There’s a chance to express yourself more in other leagues and the style of play in these leagues could suit certain players more. It is just that they don’t know about these leagues. It can pay to open your eyes and see some other options</p>
