  <p>In fact, <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> has lost three of the past five times he’s stepped into a ring or cage, and has developed a penchant for getting finished in recent years. For nearly a year now, <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> rejected the notion of granting the disrespectful <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> a rematch without the Irishman earning his way back into title-contention with, you know, actual wins<br /><br />The <b>[MMA as]</b> sport has worked hard over the past two and a half decades to be taken seriously outside of Brazil and Japan where it originally developed and found popularity in its earlier forms. The type of short-cash matchmaking that would make a <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> vs <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> rematch possible would continue to undermine that effort.<br /><br />Unlike other professional sports and sports leagues where title-contention is determined by preset rules and season and playoff systems, MMA title-fight matchmaking in the UFC is done completely by fiat. The promotion decides who is a champion and who isn’t, regardless of record, wins or losses. It also unilaterally decides who gets title shots<br /><br /><b>[Even]</b> boxing uses the form of independence with regards to rankings and title-shots by having ostensibly independent sanctioning bodies determine rankings and mandatory challengers. In fact, boxing is required to do this by U.S. federal law (the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act) because third-party ranking and title-fight sanctioning is seen as such a basic necessity for even an attempt at fairness and anti-corruption<br /><br />The Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act Act does not yet cover the sport of MMA, and the UFC thus sanctions itself, which is a gigantic conflict of interest. To make matters worse, the UFC’s parent company, WME, has also begun to represent some of its roster’s athletes, meaning that the UFC now hires fighters, promotes and manages them (also illegal in boxing under the Ali Act), and has no oversight when it comes to rankings and title-fight booking. So, we get abominations like this hypothetical <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> vs <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> rematch pushed. The UFC has floated the idea of this fight as an immediate rematch since right after <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> was beaten soundly by Nurmagomedov in 2018</p>
