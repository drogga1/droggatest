<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Although they are political foes, Mr O’Brien, had this to say about <a href="leo-varadkar.html">Leo Varadkar</a>, the new Taoiseach]</b> From Day One, you could see that he was very, very ambitious. There was no question about that. I don’t think he wanted to spend too long in the council to be honest with you.<br /><br />He was very dogmatic and for a young councillor, I found that he was very much cut from the old cloth of core Fine Gael type values. He was good to work with but stubborn from time to time.<br /><br />He drank lots of Diet Coke. That’s one thing I do remember. He’d come in here with bottles of Diet Coke <b>[Mr Varadkar also working long hours as a junior doctor at the time]</b>.<br /><br />We’d have a good debate back and forth and he was quite partisan. He was dogmatic in style, if he believed he was right, that was it. He was quite shy and withdrawn but not in a negative way. I worked with him and he was a decent colleague</p>
