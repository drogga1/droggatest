  <p>[Former Russia star Alexey Smertin is certain that the 2018 World Cup will pass without incident in Russia] I’m sure this World Cup will be very high level, in all areas. And what makes me confident is the last Confederations Cup, where there was not a single incident of a discriminatory nature. In Russia, people know what hospitality and respect are. So come on, I invite you to come. You will see with your own eyes. Don’t make opinions based on rumors. I sometimes meet old team-mates or players that I faced and those who have been to Russia speak to me very warmly and say only good things. And, of course, that makes me happy. Of all those who were in Russia, no one will tell you that there is not a good football atmosphere here. That’s why I’m very optimistic for the World Cup.<br /><br />There is certainly progress and that is visible. First, we introduced a surveillance system for the Russian championship, where there are the most high-risk matches. We also introduced a special course on anti-discrimination at Moscow State University. Then, we made sure that there were also lessons against discrimination in schools. Then, in cooperation with Football Against Racism in Europe [FARE], banners and advertisements were put in the stadiums. We also organized a multi-ethnic tournament at the Sochi Youth Festival. We also animate interfaith events. I am convinced that Russia will host this competition in the best conditions. Although it took place in four cities and not 11, the Confederations Cup was very revealing. I have no doubt that the World Cup will go perfectly well. That it is from the point of view material and the infrastructures: stadiums, hotels, airports. Or from the non-material point of view: the memory that will remain, especially with the younger generation. I also remember my own experience when I was 11 years old. I watched the World Cup in Mexico and I saw Maradona and that’s when I wanted to look like him in the game. I also saw Marius Tresor and Patrick Battiston, whom I then met with great pleasure in Bordeaux. For me it was very important. So I can imagine how important it is for today’s youth to see these great teams and their great players</p>

  <p>[Former Russia international star Alexei Smertin believes that World Cup 2018, hosted by his home country, has been so good that it is the greatest in history] Before the World Cup, there were so many fears on the part of foreign media, and we are glad that after arriving here all the negative stereotypes were destroyed. Everyone has seen the diversity of Russia and our hospitality.<br /><br />The FAN ID system in practice received the highest ratings, the cities perfectly prepared all infrastructure for the championship. Most importantly, this holiday has been a success. We receive exceptional reviews about this World Cup - from teams, from fans, from officials - everyone is happy that this holiday of football is here, in Russia.<br /><br />For me personally this is the best World Cup in history. In all cities, an incredible atmosphere has been created, the whole country is living this football all this month. I am sure that this is the best legacy and the most pleasant thing is that we have two whole weeks to enjoy this holiday. The most interesting part of the tournament is yet to come<br /><br />The Russian team did not surprise me with the results so far. I was waiting for the team going to the knockouts from the very beginning. There was confidence in the actions on the field, they seemed at ease, especially in the first two games. The team was able to cope with the pressure. In any case, we eventually went to knockout stage for the first time in the history of Russian national team [after the Soviet era]. Of course, Spain is the favourite on paper, but Russia have our own style which can help us to win. I’m sure that our guys will lay out without rest on the field and will be able to surprise the opponent. Yes, we have never beat Spain at this level, but once we have to start!</p>

  <p>[Why former Football Manager wonderkid Igor Akinfeev never became a superstar] This is his decision. [Francesco] Totti could also go to Real Madrid, but he chose his own club. Igor, I’m sure, had more than one proposal from top clubs, but, again, this is his decision and he must be respected. Igor is one of the most experienced players in this team. His successes are not only in the national team, but also in the club. With such a goalkeeper behind you always feel more confident. He’s a real captain. I hope that he will stay at the highest level for a long time and be an example of professionalism for all the youth of the team.</p>
