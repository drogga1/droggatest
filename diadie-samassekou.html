  <p><b>[Hoffenheim star Diadie Samassekou expects Fabian Ruiz’s stock to remain on the rise]</b> That <b>[hardest foe]</b> was Fabian Ruiz of <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, even if he is perhaps not so well known. It was incredibly difficult to defend against him because he is extremely agile and only ever needs two touches. I sometimes try to show my friends why it’s so hard to defend. I’ve played against a lot of good teams and players, but people will be talking a lot about Ruiz in the next few years<br /><br />When the war started, I was in the academy. I had nightmares for a week, but now the situation is better. The big cities in which my parents live don’t feel as much of the great suffering that the other regions are exposed to. It’s hard to hear people die in a different part of the country every day, but my family isn’t directly affected. Every country has its own problems. For example, I am helping a family that lost a father in the war and now does not have enough money to eat. That is the reality in my home. The soldiers leave their families behind and there is no security for it</p>
