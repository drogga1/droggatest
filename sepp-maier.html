  <p><b>[Bayern Munich goalkeeping legend Sepp Maier has warned the Bavarians against signing <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Manuel Neuer</a> from Schalke, saying they would just be throwing money away]</b> I really do not understand the thinking. Rensing has been as good as <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Neuer</a> for a while now. If they sign <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Neuer</a>, for me that would just be money thrown away.</p>

  <p><b>[Germany Legend Sepp Maier hope Thomas Kraft Is The New Sepp]</b> Even when Thomas was 16, 17 years old, I said: ‘He has the best assets’. My hope is that Kraft is the new Sepp. Thomas has come along very well. That pleases me like mad, he has been calm, and has a very steady, confident way of goalkeeping. The money, the millions for the transfer fee, they can save themselves. I believe that if Thomas plays well for the rest of the season, they should not get <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Neuer</a>. Why should they?</p>

  <p><b>[Sepp Maier says I would not have signed <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Neuer</a> for Bayern Munich]</b> Bayern have made a mistake in the past. I would never have let go of Rensing and Kraft. They could have prepared both of them for the spot between the sticks before <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Neuer</a>’s arrival. I would not have signed <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Neuer</a>, but Bayern always want the best players, and he is a world-class goalkeeper. However, I know Michael and Thomas, and they would both have made it at Bayern as well. It’s clear though that <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Neuer</a> is on another level.<br /><br />It’s madness that people are discussing firing him. He’s doing a good job and is a nice guy, something you can’t say of all the previous Bayern coaches. He has a good relationship with the team as well<br /><br /><b>[Maier also took the time to talk about Germany’s chances at Euro 2012]</b> They have a good chance to become European champions if they get through the group stages. Germany have been drawn in what is by far the strongest group<br /><br /><b>[The 68-year-old is not surprised with Germany’s success under head coach <a href="joachim-low.html">Joachim Low</a>, and is full of praise for the former assistant]</b> I was there when <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Jurgen Klinsmann</a> was in charge, but Low was doing all the work already back then. I knew that things would go like this when <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Klinsmann</a> left. You could already see that Low would continue the great work</p>

  <p><b>[Sepp Maier on Neuer]</b> Blind people will have decided who wins the award if <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Neuer</a> doesn’t get the Ballon d’Or this year. He was crowned world champion. He is the most perfect goalkeeper in the world. He is great with crosses, always alert rushing off his line, and has great reflexes. He can do anything. There is nothing I can criticise him for</p>

Of course, they had a small crisis as they were at the bottom of the table. But they have improved again and now under the new coach they play great football. They play aggressively - nice dynamic football - like Borussia Monchengladbach in our times</p>

  <p><b>[Sepp Maier on Silvio Gazzaniga’s <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup trophy]</b> The former trophy was more beautiful. The current trophy exists a thousand times, there are so many duplicates. Everybody’s got one. If you win it it’s special. It’s the most important thing in a footballer’s career. But I would lift a coffee cup as well if that would be the trophy. It’s all about the symbolic character, it doesn’t matter what kind of trophy you lift</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich legend Sepp Maier does not think <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Manuel Neuer</a>’s injury is as dramatic a setback as it has been portrayed in some quarters]</b> Let’s be honest, <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> won’t care who’s in Bayern’s goal. For Bayern, <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Neuer</a>’s injury isn’t that dramatic because they still have a very good goalkeeper with Ulreich. No-one on this earth is irreplaceable, at least in the short term. Over a longer period, it’s another issue, but I’m not pessimistic. Ulreich has already played well during <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Neuer</a>’s recent absence</p>

Bayern would regret it very much in the next few years. Why shouldn’t <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Neuer</a> play at top level for five years? He’s fit, the boy. There is currently no one better than <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Neuer</a> in the world and there will be none in the next five years</p>
