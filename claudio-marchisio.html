He brings so much both with his ideas and passing<br /><br />Even if the Champions League does come during a delicate time in the Serie A calendar, adrenaline gives you incredible physical and mental energy. You don’t need much to prepare for a game against Barcelona. It won’t be a chance for revenge after the 2015 Final, as that could only have been in another Final. Our objective is to reach the final in Cardiff and challenge for the cup<br /><br />We have to take it one game at a time. We’re both coming off the break for international duty, so many players have travelled long distances. Napoli vs Juve will be a wonderful clash, as Napoli are proving themselves to be a great team with important figures who play beautiful football. We are doing very well and growing game by game. We concentrate for now only on Serie A, we’ll think about the Coppa Italia later</p>

That is all I am thinking about. I still have a long contract with Juventus, but I’ve always said you never can tell in football. Even if something were to happen, I would never, ever wear another jersey in ​Serie A. I repeat, I have a long contract and am happy here. I train every day with great determination, despite having important injury problems, because I am still highly-motivated and want to win</p>

  <p><b>[Claudio Marchisio has left Serie A champions Juventus after his contract was terminated by mutual consent]</b> Today marks the end of Claudio Marchisio’s Juventus career following the agreed termination of his contract. With every battle competed, every ripple of the net and every trophy raised, his childhood dreams kept coming true. In truth, we all lived our dreams side by side with Claudio. Watching him grow and become, year after year, a man, husband and father filled all of us Bianconeri with a unique sense of gratification. Having had the opportunity to accompany him on this path, to discover a homegrown champion, day by day, was quite simply a privilege and an honour. And it will be a pleasure to keep following him, with whichever shirt he will wear in the future. For the black and white stripes, as we know, will always form an indelible part of him and his story. Thanks for everything, Claudio! We wish you the very best.</p>

Behind this phrase, which is so loved by us fans <b>[yes because even if it may seem impossible, I am one today]</b>, said by our President <a href="giampiero-boniperti.html">Giampiero Boniperti</a>, lies the deepest meaning of our way of life<br /><br />When you’re a child with a dream, a child among many, you know that for <b>[the <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>]</b> shirt, you’ll have to be the best.

  <p><b>[Claudio Marchisio wants to see Juventus star Paulo Dybala played further forward]</b> Paulo has an innate gift, it’s a shame to see him playing so far from the goal. I remember his first match with Juventus; Super Cup v Lazio, he came in and I said ‘stay in the opponent’s area’, and he scored goals.<br /><br />August 17, the adventure came to an end, but the market was closing and I thought I would stay. The club decided to terminate the contract, for me it wasn’t easy. With hindsight we could say there have been so many injuries in midfield, maybe I would have had room <b>[to play]</b>. But it would have been wrong to stay, I would not have managed another year like the last one. I was hoping for some more opportunities, but I always put the group in front of the individual. I gave so much but Juventus also gave me so much. I’ve no regrets. In football, as in life and in love, there are so many ways to end stories. In the end, I consider myself lucky for what I had. I lost two Champions League finals but I’m happy to have won seven Scudettos<br /><br />I have twice rejected offers from Milan. So many offers have always arrived, both from abroad and from Italy. For me, the most important team in Italy, besides Juve, has always been Milan. But I would never have gone to another Italian club. He <b>[Ronaldo]</b> works a lot, he takes care of every aspect of preparation. He is an example. He has an atypical physique for a soccer player, he looks more like a sprinter</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus legend Marchisio reflects on shattered dreams]</b> From what I saw of him this summer before leaving Turin, everything revolved around him because he raised the level of each player and gave us a lot of self-esteem. Having said that, a champion, no matter how big, can’t give you the certainty of winning, otherwise Ronaldo and Messi would’ve split the last 10-15 Champions Leagues. The dream shattered because this hadn’t been questioned: football isn’t an exact science.<br /><br />Gianluigi]&lt;/b&gt; Buffon was right. He told me if he knew before that football abroad was lived so differently, he would’ve gone there <b>[Paris Saint-Germain]</b> a few years earlier. You live a different life, you savour a certain kind of freedom that is lacking in Italy. You know the image of a bus arriving at a stadium? That’s the life of a footballer in Italy in a nutshell: there’s an escort everywhere you go and you don’t even notice it. Only once you live a different kind of freedom on a daily basis do you realise how thick that bubble is.</p>

  <p><b>[Mauro Icardi and Paul Pogba would make ideal transfer targets for Juventus]</b> Looking at Juventus’ team, I think it lacks a player that can help the team offensively and Pogba would be the ideal player for that. I never understood his decision to return to Manchester; he had already been there. If he wanted to improve, it would have made so much sense for him to move to Spain.<br /><br /><b>[Marchisio said he remains in close contact with Dybala and recommended Icardi as a perfect foil for the 25-year-old Juve forward]</b> I often talk to Dybala, we are close friends. He knows that he didn’t perform well this season, but that can happen to any great player. He is determined to bounce back, and I hope they find a way to play him alongside <b>[Cristiano]</b> Ronaldo, because he is insanely talented<br /><br /><b>[Marchisio compared 26-year-old Icardi to former Juve striker David Trezeguet]</b> He needs his team-mates to play his style, but of course he is an amazing player. An attacking duo featuring Icardi and Dybala would be perfect, also considering the age of the two</p>

Fortunately the coach found a system that allowed us to all play together. What a beautiful midfield, even with <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Arturo Vidal</a>!<br /><br /><b>[The midfield baton at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> has seen been passed into new hands, with Wales international aaron Ramsey forming part of <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a>’s class of 2019-20]</b> In the best hands. Ramsey is a fantastic player. The No. 8 is such a beautiful number that it had to end up on someone’s back. My preferences were two, Ramsey or an academy player who moved up to the first team<br /><br /><b>[While Ramsey has traded life in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> for that in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>, Marchisio says he was never close to heading in the opposite direction]</b> It cannot be said that I was close to any English team, but there was interest from the Manchester teams and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. But <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> has always been my priority, so real negotiations were never started<br /><br />When the coach moved my position from second striker to midfielder in the <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> youth, I began to observe the great midfielders of the football scene. Even just to try to steal secrets and understand the malice needed for the role. Without a doubt my favourites remain <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> and <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>.
