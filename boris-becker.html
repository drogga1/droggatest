  <p><b>[Football can survive without Ronaldo &amp; Messi, tennis is doomed after Federer, Nadal &amp; Djokovic. After a 19-year-old Nick Kyrgios defeated world number one Rafael Nadal at the 2014 Wimbledon Championships, it appeared that tennis had a new superstar. They met again at SW19 last week. The 33-year-old Nadal prevailed in four sets. It was an ill-tempered match, with the notoriously volatile Kyrgios deliberately trying to hit his Spanish opponent with the ball at one point, but nonetheless full of high-quality tennis]</b> I want Nick to learn from that. He’s such a fine tennis player, we want him in tennis. We maybe even need him in tennis once the big three are gone.<br /><br /><b>[The tennis authorities and its money men are bracing themselves for a dramatic drop in earnings from the presently lucrative men’s game, which has captured the imagination of the public thanks to the presence of the three all-time greats in the same era]</b> There will be a dip in popularity and then the spotlight will be on the young generation. And we’ll be saying, ‘Now, show up. Who are you? Are you good enough, can you carry the sport, or was it all a bluff?’</p>
