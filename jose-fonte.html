  <p><b>[Portugal defender Jose Fonte believes Cristiano Ronaldo will be fit to captain Portugal during this summer’s European Championships]</b> I have no worries about Ronaldo at the Euros, he is just a beast and he will be ready. You see him train and it is just incredible, he’s so fit and the way he takes care of himself is so impressive. He will be ready for Portugal and is such a key player for us.<br /><br />He is the best I’ve ever trained against. I think he will have a great competition. We are aiming to win it. We have to aim that high and I believe we are good enough. Of course there is competition from other teams, like Germany in particular, is great but I think we can do it. I want to be part of that journey and believe I can be.<br /><br /><b>[Fonte added that he marks Ronaldo in training]</b> No of course I can handle him… no It is annoying because he plays against me in training as I’m the right centre back and I have to mark him when we do our routines and training matches along with the right full back. His movement and his strength are fantastic, on the ball he is so impressive as well</p>

  <p><b>[Portugal centre-back Jose Fonte believes England can go far at Euro 2016 after seeing his side slip to a 1-0 defeat to the Three Lions at Wembley]</b> I regard England as one of good champions, obviously. When you look at the front five that they have, you look at the young talent that they have. They have players with the experience of Rooney so you have to look to England and expect something good from them. They have a lot of quality but there are other teams as well. It will be interesting, it will be a good Euro, but England definitely have the quality to go far.<br /><br />It’s disappointing. It was tough to play against 11 when we were one man down with the quality that England have. But we take the positives. I thought we defended well - compact. They didn’t create many, many chances in the second half. We actually had two good chances to nick a goal. We’re disappointed but we will take the positives and come out of this stronger</p>

  <p><b>[Renato Sanches becomes Portugal’s talisman against Croatia]</b> It’s good to have this young blood. You see how he runs on the pitch, it’s fantastic. He’s powerful, he’s full of energy. It’s good for the group that we have kids like this.</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo used to challenge team-mates to press-up competitions in the shower as a youngster]</b> He would say to everyone, ‘I will do more push-ups than you in the shower after training’. And he would. He would do more than everyone. It showed how competitive he is. He was so far ahead of everyone.<br /><br />I love <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi but Ronaldo is Ronaldo. He was only young and I saw him millions of times in the gym, after training, when everyone else had gone home trying to get stronger, trying to be quicker. His work ethic and desire to be the best is unmatchable<br /><br /><b>[Fonte also hailed Ronaldo for his ability to deal with the fame]</b> You can’t go anywhere - everyone knows him. He is recognised worldwide and attracts so many millions of people. Everyone wants a piece of him. He went through the different stages of fame. Friends who knew him before this, know what a good person he is. We know what he had to do to get to where he has and it’s great to see how well he has done in life. It’s not an easy situation to be in. People think sometimes it’s great to be Cristiano. Obviously it has its ups but also the downs. He deals with it in a great manner. It is a privilege to be sharing the dressing-room with him. He has been an inspiration to me</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo’s future may be dominating the headlines but his new haircut is earning him stick from his Portugal team-mates]</b> We are obviously used to spending time together away at tournaments, and it helps that we have a great bunch of lads and are all very close. There are a lot of jokers and it is a great atmosphere. Cristiano Ronaldo got a little bit of stick when he arrived with his new haircut, especially from Ricardo Quaresma</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo has offered enough to the Portugal cause down the years that he is allowed an off day]</b> We had an opportunity to make it 2-0, close the game out and we did not manage to score. Ronaldo scores for us so many times, so it is no problem - he is allowed an off day. He will get one in the next game. In the end, we managed to qualify, which is always the main objective, and after that we will see what comes<br /><br />This World Cup is just crazy! We are not happy with the situation, the constant stopping the game, the controversy all the time. To end the game like that is just not fair. This VAR system is not my thing. Cedric is furious. In our opinion, he is not even looking at the ball. It is impossible to not have your arms raised in that position. How can you jump with both arms next to your body, it is impossible. The ball did not even change trajectory. In the end, we could have almost lost the game - VAR is unacceptable<br /><br /><b>[Fonte is aware of the size of the challenge facing the Euro 2016 winners]</b> We have to face whoever we face. We will just take it as it comes. We are happy, how many teams have gone home? We are through and that is the main thing. We are not happy with how it went down in the last few minutes, but we were controlling the game, playing the ball out from the back, being patient, creating chances. In the end, we got done by a dubious decision and we have to move on. Sometimes you just don’t get the rub of the green</p>

  <p><b>[Lille attacker Nicolas Pepe has the capability to play for Real Madrid]</b> He can reach the highest level. He could play for a Real Madrid, a Barcelona - any team. But he has to continue to want to learn, to have his feet on the ground, continue to work and progress every day. That’s the only way he can reach and maintain a high standard of play. But it’s clear he’s got the talent<br /><br />He must continue to improve certain aspects of his game, such as his defensive work and tactical side, because going forward he’s very strong. But there’s another, defensive, aspect of the game. We work with Nicolas, coach Christophe Galtier most of all, to get him into the right defensive positions. If he gets into the right place defensively, that can help the transition into attack. These are the little things that will get him to the very top, and that where he has to be in two or three years</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Fonte’s key role in bringing the best from Lille’s young guns]</b> The Lille sporting director called me and said: ‘Listen, I need someone with your profile, I need someone with experience, leadership skills because I have a very young squad with no experience. I spoke to my national team colleagues who were playing in France at the time, Joao Moutinho, Anthony Lopez, I spoke to Eder who used to play here. They all said it was a great club, with great facilities. It made sense as Lille is an hour away from London where my wife and kids are.<br /><br />I’ve enjoyed it a lot here, I’ve never felt so confident and relaxed, I’m playing my best football<br /><br />Once you are 26 or 27 years old and have some experience, young players are inspired by you. I like helping young players and I always try to lead by example, to be a hard worker. For me, it’s natural. It’s an honour to give my best for the club and help my team-mates<br /><br />Aside from injury, he’s never missed a single training session. Not one! And if he doesn’t miss one, the young guy who’s 18 has an interest in doing the same. Some Frenchman who are his age will be inside on the bike, reading the newspaper or looking at their phone. Last year, I went mad trying to get certain players out on the training ground<br /><br />We have a lot of qualities but above all we’ve ambition, a desire to win and a very good coach. Believe me, second place in anchored in our heads. I don’t know if we’ll finish there, but we’ll do everything to make sure we give ourselves the best possible chance</p>

  <p><b>[Portugal’s Jose Fonte believes ex-team-mate <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> is in with a chance of winning this year’s Ballon d’Or]</b> I had many conversations with my international teammates, including Cedric <b>[<a href="cedric-soares.html">Soares</a>]</b>. I remember telling him ‘listen, this guy I am sure he will be one of the best defenders in the world’. It is obvious, it is not only me, everyone could see the pace he had, how strong he is, <b>[he]</b> wins every duel. It was just about improving his positioning, and that is what he did when he came to <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>, he stopped coming out with the ball too much, trying to dribble too much, playing simple.<br /><br />I have a little bit of credit but the main thing is him, he is an amazing talent. I am not surprised to see him disputing the Ballon d’Or this year, I am just pleased for him and I wish he keeps going like this. I think he has a shot to be honest. He was named <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> player of the year, winning the Champions League, why not? We always give it to the strikers because they score goals and everything, but it is about time a defender gets one, no?<br /><br /><b>[Fonte believes if there is any player in the world who can end <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a>’s incredible run of not being dribbled past then it is <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>]</b> It is not easy, but no one is unbeatable.
