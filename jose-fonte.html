  <p><b>[Portugal’s Jose Fonte believes ex-team-mate <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> is in with a chance of winning this year’s Ballon d’Or]</b> I had many conversations with my international teammates, including Cedric <b>[<a href="cedric-soares.html">Soares</a>]</b>. I remember telling him ‘listen, this guy I am sure he will be one of the best defenders in the world’. It is obvious, it is not only me, everyone could see the pace he had, how strong he is, <b>[he]</b> wins every duel. It was just about improving his positioning, and that is what he did when he came to <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>, he stopped coming out with the ball too much, trying to dribble too much, playing simple.<br /><br />I have a little bit of credit but the main thing is him, he is an amazing talent. I am not surprised to see him disputing the Ballon d’Or this year, I am just pleased for him and I wish he keeps going like this. I think he has a shot to be honest. He was named Premier League player of the year, winning the Champions League, why not? We always give it to the strikers because they score goals and everything, but it is about time a defender gets one, no?<br /><br /><b>[Fonte believes if there is any player in the world who can end Van Dijk’s incredible run of not being dribbled past then it is <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>]</b> It is not easy, but no one is unbeatable. It is an incredible stat, isn’t it? If there is someone, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> is one of them.</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Fonte, a veteran of over 150 Premier League matches with <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> and <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>, and a European Championship winner with Portugal, has said that Nicolas Pepe can mingle with the very best]</b> He could play for a Real Madrid, a Barcelona - any team. But he has to continue to want to learn, to have his feet on the ground, continue to work and progress every day. That’s the only way he can reach and maintain a high standard of play. But it’s clear he’s got the talent</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> defender Jose Fonte backed Nicolas Pepe to be a major success at the Emirates Stadium. Fonte, who played with Pepe last season at Lille said]</b> He is incredible. If he can reach the same level, which I believe he will, that he did with Lille last season then Arsenal fans will be very happy. He is super quick, he has a left foot which is silky, one vs one he is second to none. He finishes really good, he takes penalties, he takes free-kicks. He is a very, very accomplished player and I think Arsenal fans will be in for a treat, for sure</p>

He can get to a very, very high level and can be one of the best in the world, 100 per cent, I’m confident he has everything in place to get there</p>

  <p><b>[Portugal team-mate Jose Fonte says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> has left door open for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> return]</b> I know he loves Madrid, that’s for sure. It’s clear that he loves the club itself, it’s one of the biggest clubs in the world, if not the biggest. He’s left many, many friends there and he’s always left the door open. So I wouldn’t be surprised if he goes back to Real Madrid</p>
