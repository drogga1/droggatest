  <p><b>[Alan Hansen on his remark ‘You can’t win anything with kids’. How has Alan Hansen reacted since?]</b> That line pretty much made me, simply because I got it so dramatically wrong! The United souvenir shop printed the quote on a T-shirt and they sent me a couple, which was great. But despite being so dramatically wrong, if United hadn’t won the double that year, you could still say that line now.<br /><br />Even after that year, when he brought those five or six sensational kids through, Sir Alex always went for experience. And don’t forget that the spine of that team included <a href="peter-schmeichel.html">Peter Schmeichel</a>, <a href="steve-bruce.html">Steve Bruce</a>, <a href="gary-pallister.html">Gary Pallister</a> and <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a>. That team was a fantastic example of how to build a formidable spine and fill in everything else around it. The kids were great, but so were the goalkeeper, two centre-backs and the centre forward</p>
