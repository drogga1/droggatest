  <p><b>[Crystal Palace have confirmed that Wales international midfielder Joe Ledley suffered a broken leg]</b> The club can confirm that midfielder Joe Ledley sustained a leg injury in the game against Stoke City on Saturday, which saw him suffer a fracture of the fibula.<br /><br />He will be continually assessed over the next few weeks by the club’s medical staff</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Ledley says he could never have hoped to be preparing for Wales’ clash with England on Thursday without the great work of Crystal Palace physio Sean Connelly]</b> When I had the scans back and saw the fracture I thought, and the majority of the staff as well thought, it was game over. But to come back in 35 days, I’ve got to give Sean the physio at Crystal Palace and Wales the credit because without him I don’t think I’d have been here.<br /><br />I started to think I had a chance about a week after I did it. I’d worked in an oxygen chamber for the whole week, on a bike, everything, and Sean was confident as well in me and just said ‘Let’s see what happens and take it week by week’. I kept having scans and they kept getting better and better, but you can’t take anything for granted so I’ll see how I feel in the next couple of days.<br /><br />Training was completely fine. To be fair I think this is the strongest I’ve ever been physically, and I was just emotional when I was coming on because I didn’t expect to be here. So credit to the gaffer as well for picking me in his 23, it was good to come on and make an impact.<br /><br />We kick on now, we’ll have a review of their game and see what happens. I’m not sure if I will start. I’ll just see what happens in the coming days and see how I feel. I don’t want to push it too much</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Ledley says Wales must not make any knee-jerk alterations to their approach in the remainder of their European Championship campaign despite conceding a late winner to England in Lens on Thursday]</b> We’re still in a good position. There’s a game left and we’d have taken three points out of two games. We’re in a fantastic position and we’ll regroup. We can’t dwell on this because there’s a game coming up in a few days so we need to stay strong and stay together.<br /><br />We’re still new to this competition, we’ve been brilliant throughout and our fans have been brilliant, and we need to continue everything we’ve been doing on the pitch and off the pitch. Nothing changes. It was the last few seconds of a game which cost us and there’s still a lot of positives defensively and maybe we work on the ball a little bit more and then we go from there<br /><br /><b>[Ledley added that his side cannot afford to play for a draw]</b> No, definitely not. We’ll got out there and try to attack and get the three points. That’s what we need to do. We can’t just sit back and take a point because you could get a sucker punch like we did today. They’re a strong team, very organised, but we need to get a point or three to go through and that’s our aim. Hopefully we’ll get the three points</p>

  <p><b>[Wales midfielder Joe Ledley has hit out at Cristiano Ronaldo despite him playing a major role in Portugal’s semi-final victory on Wednesday]</b> He’s one of those players who frustrates you. He’s never in the game compared to Gareth <b>[Bale]</b>. He’s always in the game, always on the ball, always wanting it, always dribbling and always trying to do something. They were two crappy goals. Ronaldo’s shot was useless. Normally he hits them from there but he scuffled the cross for a tap-in. With the header, the guy can leap, but apart from that he didn’t really do anything in the game. You can’t disagree with his ability. He’s a fantastic player, one of the best in the world. But we just had one of those days where things he did came off. He’s now in the final and you wish him well.</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Ledley believes that Aaron Ramsey and Gareth Bale have helped bridge the gap between Wales and the biggest nations in international football]</b> It always helps a small nation like ourselves to have individual quality like Gareth and Aaron bring. They are two brilliant players who can win the game by themselves. I think every team needs a few special players otherwise you’re going to be struggling to get into competitions and those two have lifted the spirit and belief as well.<br /><br />We’re all together and that’s what we do: We work hard as a team and, if you ask Aaron or Gareth, then <b>[they’ll tell you]</b> without us behind them it’s not going to work. No game is going to be easy at international level so we need to roll out sleeves up and keep digging in, keep working hard - that’s what got us in the Euros</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Ledley says those suggesting that he laughed at Seamus Coleman after seeing the Republic of Ireland international suffer a broken leg need their heads testing]</b> I didn’t want to acknowledge the nonsense on here but to those who have wrongly interpreted &amp; commented…on what my thoughts were at that moment in time need their heads testing. My thoughts are with Seamus Coleman &amp; I wish him a speedy road to recovery.</p>
