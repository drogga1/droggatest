  <p><b>[uca has six goals through five matches, but only one in the last five]</b> We’re a team, and when we’re not scoring goals, all the players have a bit of the blame, whether defenders, central midfielder or attackers. We have time to change this situation. I think we’re facing a really good opponent this weekend and we have to take our chances</p>

  <p><b>[Pachuca coach Diego Alonso was calm after Friday’s game, saying Pachuca wasn’t the type of team that was going to ask for Orozco to get a long ban or miss as much time]</b> Cesar Arturo Ramos is a great person. If he made a mistake, it’s not because he’s biased and he doesn’t deserve for us to talk badly about him tonight.</p>

  <p><b>[CCL foes Pachuca and FC Dallas thrive on youthful philosophies]</b> We believe it’s the way to compete. We’re not a team that’s among the strongest teams in Mexico economically speaking. There are teams with a lot more spending power, and we’ve bet on homegrown players, because first there is ability and talent in Mexico to be able to compete. In fact, we were able to become champions</p>

  <p><b>[Pachuca can’t do everything]</b> Queretaro was better. Sometimes we play poorly but we settle things by being concentrated, with a good attitude and effort. Today that wasn’t the case. We made mistakes in the first few minutes and they scored on us in the first few minutes.</p>

  <p><b>[The perspective of Pachuca coach Diego Alonso, FCD had the opportunity to get the ball out and instead tried to keep play going, hoping to get to extra time]</b> Dallas are the ones who should send the ball out. There’s a ball there where the goalkeeper gets it and gives it to the defense and then gets it returned. If you have a teammate injured, you don’t put it into play.</p>

  <p><b>[Pachuca is into the CONCACAF Champions League final after beating FC Dallas during the week]</b> We came in playing well. Unfortunately we’ve had, for instance, the day against Queretaro, five players out. Against Puebla we also had to take care of some players who were recovering from some injury. Today we were again without Franco Jara. Taking that in mind, I’ve really liked my team’s performances. I think the biggest thing we’ve lacked this tournament is finishing. We’re not a team that finishes well.</p>

  <p><b>[Pachuca meets Tigres on Tuesday in the first leg of the CONCACAF Champions League final]</b> We’ve been getting ready for this game for practically a year. Since we won the championship and returned from vacation, we put being able to get here as the fundamental objective. We’ve gotten here because of the players’ mindset, the competitive spirit they’ve had during the season. We’ve decided to give everything to be able to get here. But time for specific preparation for Tigres, we haven’t had.</p>

  <p><b>[Despite what would seem like a pressure-packed situation, Pachuca coach Diego Alonso is keeping his cool]</b> I’m already satisfied. Beyond whether or not we win or lose, being the manager at Pachuca has me satisfied.<br /><br />For us, it’s the most important game of the year. We know what it means to get here, and we’re hoping to give everything out there. We’re going to look to control the conditions to win the title</p>

  <p><b>[Pachuca celebrates CCL title but decisions loom for directors ahead of Club World Cup]</b> How we deal with the offers that arrive is a question for the directors, and if we’re planning for the future, the best signing isn’t a player from outside, but rather keeping the base of the team together.</p>

  <p><b>[Monterrey, Pachuca out for consolation prize after December defeats]</b> What can happen is that they might have enormous pressure on them because of what happened in the last match of the final, maybe they have more pressure, but that can be channeled in a good way. It’s going to depend on us and how we’re able to make this pressure either be good or bad, so we’re going to try to make it difficult for Monterrey.</p>

Today we did that again, the team responded in a great way. Little by little we’ve recovered our identity. The team pressed hard, it was intense and dynamic and this captured the fans’ attention..</p>

  <p><b>[After Inter Miami’s <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> debut ends in defeat]</b> We had several very clear chances to get ahead on the scoreboard. It was the same after going 1-0 down as we pushed to get an equalizer. I’ll stay with that. With the heart the team showed. Surely we have to improve in football, but with this heart and with this intensity with which the team plays, we will surely win many games. Against maybe the best team in the league we gave a tremendous picture today of what we can become. With only six weeks of work, the merit is certainly from the footballers for what we have done today and the work they have done</p>

  <p><b>[How Inter Miami is staying fit and finding togetherness in coronavirus quarantine]</b> We try to communicate with them every day over the phone, and through messages to be present. And also three or four times a week through video conferences where the whole staff can be together. We try to spend time with them, talking. In addition, they have support from the league on a psychological level if they need it. Each player can make use of that tool if they feel it necessary. Logically, we try to be present permanently and try first, and most importantly, to give them affection and give them the assurance that if they have any problems not to hesitate to talk to us, talk to the club, whether on a personal or family level, or if they have any health problems, to be vigilant so we can help</p>
