  <p><b>[After Inter Miami’s <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> debut ends in defeat]</b> We had several very clear chances to get ahead on the scoreboard. It was the same after going 1-0 down as we pushed to get an equalizer. I’ll stay with that. With the heart the team showed. Surely we have to improve in football, but with this heart and with this intensity with which the team plays, we will surely win many games. Against maybe the best team in the league we gave a tremendous picture today of what we can become. With only six weeks of work, the merit is certainly from the footballers for what we have done today and the work they have done</p>

  <p><b>[How Inter Miami is staying fit and finding togetherness in coronavirus quarantine]</b> We try to communicate with them every day over the phone, and through messages to be present. And also three or four times a week through video conferences where the whole staff can be together. We try to spend time with them, talking. In addition, they have support from the league on a psychological level if they need it. Each player can make use of that tool if they feel it necessary. Logically, we try to be present permanently and try first, and most importantly, to give them affection and give them the assurance that if they have any problems not to hesitate to talk to us, talk to the club, whether on a personal or family level, or if they have any health problems, to be vigilant so we can help</p>
