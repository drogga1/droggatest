  <p><b>[Republic of Ireland coach <a href="giovanni-trapattoni.html">Giovanni Trapattoni</a> hospitalised]</b> Giovanni had been feeling unwell, suffering with nausea and vomiting. But late last night he started vomiting more. He called me at 1.45am and it was clear things had changed. I wanted more comfort in terms of where we were, so we decided to take him to the Mater where we have launched an investigation. He has had blood and urine tests, scans, x-rays and an ECG. Some tests are already known and they are already very good. But some are still pending and we may not know the results of those until tomorrow. We need to see how things go over the next 12 to 24 hours. It’s not a serious problem, but with shellfish-type food poisoning it can have a greater impact, so everything is just a precaution. At the moment he is stable. He has spoken with his wife on a couple of occasions and we are making arrangements for her to come over if she requires</p>

  <p><b>[With backing from the various local authorities, the Development Officers have volunteered to play their part in helping those in need during the COVID-19 pandemic]</b> The current COVID-19 pandemic has made such an impact on the day-to-day lives of so many. This programme will be a great benefit to those in lockdown who simply cannot get out to collect their prescriptions. I applaud Boots and the <a href="fai.html">FAI</a> for the initiative and I thank all the Development Officers who are giving their time and energy to this programme</p>
