  <p><b>[Vieira drives Gunners back to top form]</b> <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are the best side at present - just,. There is a lot of ability and pace in the team. They have a lot of confidence, a lot of skill. If they concede a corner or a free-kick near goal they bring everybody back, opponents get sucked in and then they hit you on the break. They have the pace to do this.</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>]</b> Jose was a personable young man who was nominated to look after me because of his good English and strong background in football. He was a schoolteacher and his father had been a professional goalkeeper with Vitoria Setubal <b>[Felix <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> was good enough to win international honours]</b> and then general manager of the same club. Jose was to prove a marvellous asset, covering my back and looking after me while building up a good rapport with the players of the three clubs we have been at together. Whenever I needed his support he was there, even though it often meant putting himself in the firing line</p>

As good as anything I’d received. Here he was, in his early thirties, never been a player or a coach to speak of, giving me reports that were as good as anything I ever got.</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona went to untold lengths in order to secure the signing of PSV sensation Ronaldo]</b> He was still only 19 but I told Barcelona we must have him, that we would be buying not only a wonderful player, but a player for the future. And he was much more than an alternative to our other front men: he was rare, different and exhilarating. He has different skills from other centre-forwards. He’s an incredible dribbler; he dribbles like George Best, Tom Finney and Chris Waddle. He has an an amazing ability to just plough his way through.<br /><br />I won’t lie, I was tempted to buy English players and very nearly bought Alan Shearer at Barcelona. We needed a centre-forward and the chairman asked if I knew one. I told him: ‘I know a cracker, he’s English and he’s top’. It was just after Euro 96 and I approached Ray Harford at Blackburn. Ray told me he wasn’t for sale, and could I not disturb him by letting the press know of our interest. I told him he could trust me, and a week later Alan was sold to Newcastle! We got Ronaldo instead</p>

  <p><b>[Bobby Robson was once asked by author Jimmy Burns what it was like to manage Barcelona]</b> It is the evening of a European tournament… an electric atmosphere, a hair-tingling scenario… and you know that if you lose, you’re going to get whacked, and people are going to be unhappy and the press are going to be out there waiting for you… and the tension brings the adrenaline and the excitement… The army cannot defeated<br /><br />I’ve made history. I must be the first coach to win three out of four titles in his first season at a club and not get the chance to carry on</p>
