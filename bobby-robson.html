  <p><b>[Vieira drives Gunners back to top form]</b> <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are the best side at present - just,. There is a lot of ability and pace in the team. They have a lot of confidence, a lot of skill. If they concede a corner or a free-kick near goal they bring everybody back, opponents get sucked in and then they hit you on the break. They have the pace to do this.</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>]</b> Jose was a personable young man who was nominated to look after me because of his good English and strong background in football. He was a schoolteacher and his father had been a professional goalkeeper with Vitoria Setubal <b>[Felix <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> was good enough to win international honours]</b> and then general manager of the same club. Jose was to prove a marvellous asset, covering my back and looking after me while building up a good rapport with the players of the three clubs we have been at together. Whenever I needed his support he was there, even though it often meant putting himself in the firing line</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>]</b> He’d (scout Sporting Lisbon’s upcoming opponents and) come back and hand me a dossier that was absolutely first class. As good as anything I’d received. Here he was, in his early thirties, never been a player or a coach to speak of, giving me reports that were as good as anything I ever got.</p>
