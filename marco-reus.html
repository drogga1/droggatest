I played here for many years in the youth ranks, but at first I did not have the chance to become a professional football player at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a> and to realize my dream. Afterwards I developed at Rot Weiss Ahlen and Borussia Mönchengladbach like I imagined and hoped for, and then there came the offer from <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. It has always been a dream to play for the club because I feel very connected to the fans. It is a lot of fun to play in our stadium and in particular to celebrate victories together with the fans. A childhood dream came true for me<br /><br /><b>[Now back in form, he underlined that his new contract was signed with an eye to the future]</b> I am now 28 years old, it is probably my last big contract. So I have considered carefully what I want in my last five or six years at the highest level.<br /><br />In the end two things were important to me: to send out a signal that I feel attached to this club and that I want to achieve a lot here. And I wanted to have clarity for myself, before the crucial phase with the final game of the fight for the Champions League places begins and then in the summer, of course, the World Cup in Russia on the program.<br /><br />I have little use for words like legend. Everyone does what he thinks is best and wants to get the most out of his career. It is of course sensational and also a nice sign for the fans and the club when you are at a club for as long as <b>[Francesco]</b> <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> was with Roma. But basically everyone has to decide for himself<br /><br /><b>[The star also revealed that is idol growing up was former <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> playmaker <a href="tomas-rosicky.html">Tomas Rosicky</a>, who illuminated <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a> for six memorable seasons and lifted the 2001-2002 <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> before swapping the club for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> The way he played football, the carefreeness and lightness in his actions, I loved watching him play. Unfortunately, I did not meet him personally, but I was told that Tomas was great in character too. It was always nice to see him on the field with his playful class and his scoring skills</p>

You have to say: a great compliment to the group because it is not commonplace that you score four goals against Atletico. We suffered a lot, especially in the second half. We hardly had any possession there and you need possession against that Atletico side. We only managed that again after minute 60 or 65, then you could see that we can also play football. It’s not only the result, but how we played was very convincing</p>

It is important to believe in ourselves and give a great performance. We need to find the right balance between defence and attack. We need to reach our peak and score the goals in the right moment.

I believe that it will help us in the future, which may be the positive thing about it - everyone has now gained experience. Our goal must therefore be to stay at the top of the table and then get the title. My greed has been extremely pronounced since my first day at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a>, but the closer to the end of my own career I get, the more intense it is. Since coming to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>, we’ve been close to it a few times, but in the next two or three years, things have to work out, and I’ll do anything for it.<br /><br /><b>[Reus knows Nico Schulz and <a href="julian-brandt.html">Julian Brandt</a> well from the Germany national side and is excited to link up with the pair at club level]</b> I am glad that we have two top people from the national team, which is good for us. It means even more quality and depth. Especially in the second half of the season we were lacking the necessary power due to some injuries, so I think it’s good and right that the competition gets even bigger. If you have big goals - and we do - then you need a lot of top-class players. And we will certainly get them with <b>[Schulz and <a href="julian-brandt.html">Brandt</a>]</b></p>

He told me personally that he will leave the club and take a different path. At that moment, I did not know what to think or say. I had come to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> fresh and felt that we could be a good duo. Therefore, his decision was difficult for me to understand at the moment. We had a good team for the years to come. And I actually had the feeling that it fits in between us and that we can play together even better. Was I angry? I do not want to say that, but of course you always want to play with the best. When one of the best goes, that’s difficult to understand. In the end, everyone must make his own decisions. You only have one career. And if that was the right decision for him then everybody must accept that<br /><br /><b>[And, despite his own disappointment, Reus revealed that he felt sorry for his vilified team-mate]</b> I picked up Mario before the Champions League match against <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. He was sitting in the back of the car, the fans were waiting for him. That was not an easy situation. I know how he experienced and felt that then and did not want to be in his skin. The pressure on his shoulders. Outsiders and me as a footballer cannot understand that. Mario handled the situation really well, did a great job and assisted the first goal. That’s why he deserves huge respect. We don’t need to talk about the timing and how the message got out to the public. When a top player leaves the club, you are disappointed as a fan. You always want the best players to stay in the club. But you also must understand the player and accept that he has chosen this path for the one career he has</p>

You only knew somebody like him from TV. If Jurgen sits in front of you with his aura, with his aggressiveness, which he radiates even when speaking, with his size, then that is quite impressive. Even the way he talks to you - this is rarely the case in professional business. He pulls you under his spell and will not let you go. I left the conversation with a fluttering heart. He was definitely one of the reasons why I signed for <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>.<br /><br />Before a season you can plan a lot. But so many unforeseen things can happen, such as a system change or injuries, so things can happen completely different. When a club wants to sign a player, it’s important that the coach teaches the player the philosophy and what he’s up to. That was not different with me. <a href="shinji-kagawa.html">Shinji Kagawa</a> signed for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> that year, I was the substitute.

Now it’s about getting really fit, arriving properly. It will take time, we’ll give it to him. He just gives us another input, another way we can play.

For me and other players, we have new options with <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a>, sometimes long balls. In football it’s important to be flexible and we have achieved that.

We had the discussion last year, too. The squad is put together in the way that the responsible persons had imagined it, how the coach imagined it. We have enough quality in the squad. We don’t need someone who’s an absolute b*****d. We’ll solve it our way, even if it’s not always right. So, we don’t have to worry about it.
