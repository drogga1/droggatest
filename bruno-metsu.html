  <p><b>[Bruno Metsu interested in coaching Senegal following their 2012 Afcon exit]</b> I’m interested because, sporting-wise, everyone is interested by what happens in Senegal. Now the ball is in the court of the federation and the minister of sports. My heart is in it</p>

  <p><b>[Bruno Metsu blasts Pierre Lechantre for giving up Senegal job]</b> I was not surprised that Lechantre pulled out like that. He had Qatar in mind even while negotiating in Dakar. My source at the Qatar Football Federation confirmed this to me. He has not been honest with the FSF. When you are a man you need to honour your words and promises, and that is what he didn’t do. It is very painful for Senegal, who are now without a coach ahead of the upcoming World Cup qualifiers. I love Senegal. I feel I owe this country much and I wanted to come back to coach the team. Everybody wanted me, the authorities, the fans and the media, but Lechantre was picked and now he’s gone. I don’t want people to feel I’m talking because I still want the job. I just want us to know that the behavior of my compatriot brings us bad reputation</p>
