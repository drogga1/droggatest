  <p><b>[Former Portugal international Paulo Sousa has left his position as head coach of Chinese Super League side Tianjin Quanjian]</b> After friendly consultations between the two sides, Mr. Paulo Sousa will no longer serve as the head coach of the Tianjin Quanjian football club. Since being appointed as the head coach on November 6, 2017, Mr. Paulo Sousa and his team have done a good job and led the team to the quarter-final of the 2018 AFC Champions League. It makes the club’s history, and it is the best result that Chinese Super League teams got in the same season. Tianjin Quanjian Football Club wants to express sincere gratitude to Mr. Paulo Sousa and wish him all the best.</p>
