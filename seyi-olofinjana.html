  <p><b>[Former <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> midfielder Seyi Olofinjana says <a href="adama-traore.html">Adama Traore</a> can leave the club any day, just like any other player, amid reported transfer interest from Liverpool]</b> He is a good player and we’ve all seen what he is capable of doing. His sheer pace, power, goalscoring stint, skills on the ball and also running the length of the pitch. He’s been doing it for the past few seasons, so we are very much aware of what he brings to the table. In terms of what will happen to him going forward, the league has not ended, so we need to wait for that. We can’t ignore the fact that he has done very well for the club. Anybody can leave <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>, he came from somewhere and he can leave any day. Regarding genuine transfer interest in our players, there are procedures and policies that we consider as a club, they tell us whether it is the right step for us or not.<br /><br /><b>[on Morocco defender Romain Saiss]</b> For any player to be playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, you must have something about you. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>, arguably for me, is one of the best leagues if not the best in the world in terms of the culture and marketability which makes it unique. They’re wonderful players and Saiss is also doing the business for his country too<br /><br />The work is all about finding the right opportunities for the players and also look after players on loan, making sure they get the best so that they can perform. For some, it’s about planning games regularly while others it’s learning to be in a new environment. It’s been a big learning curve even if I say so, I’m the first loan manager at the club so there wasn’t any handing over when I took over. I set up strategy on how to do things and it’s approved by the club</p>
