  <p><b>[on <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>]</b> I’d call Harry a nine and half. He can hold up the ball, back to goal as well as any. He’s very dynamic in his movement, wants to be heading towards goal every time he gets the ball. But if he needs to drop back and thicken up the midfield, play as a No10, he has football intelligence to pick up right positions. He has got in great shape. If you’d have asked me three years ago what was his drawback, I’d have said maybe he lacked a bit of pace. But you wouldn’t say that now watching him in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. He’s found a way to work. He knows where the goal is, knows what he wants to do, knows how to get there. I tell you what <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> is, he’s the thinking man’s player</p>

But he strikes ball like <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a>. Look at Alan’s goals, a lot of them are hit with pure venom. He very rarely tapped in. Harry’s like that.

  <p><b>[Tottenham might struggle to keep hold of Harry Kane if a European giant comes in for him]</b> When you have a talent like that, teams will come calling, and will Tottenham be able to resist those teams? They move into a new stadium next year. I’m sure they’d like to keep him and let Harry kick off that stadium, but it’s about who comes calling, and what they come calling with, that’s what will determine if Harry stays at Tottenham or not.</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kane is the most complete No. 9 in world football]</b> Harry Kane is up there with the best strikers in the world right now. There are very few better as he has it all - he scores with his right foot, left foot and head. He is probably the most complete No. 9 out there. If he stays free of injury then he could be the one to break Alan’s record.<br /><br /><b>[Ferdinand added on England’s chances of securing a first senior title since 1966]</b> England have done what they’ve needed to do in this World Cup so far. They will never have a better opportunity to win the World Cup in my lifetime<br /><br /><b>[On Mohamed Salah]</b> To be called a great striker you have to be able to produce performances week in, week out. Mo Salah had a fantastic season last year, repeating that this coming season will be tough but he’s more than capable. Mo has now signed a new contract at Liverpool and at this moment think this is the right move for him</p>

If he continues to have the success he’s having at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, then you could see a team like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> being the next stepping stone for him.

  <p><b>[Les Ferdinand says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> ‘naive’ not to sign <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> cover]</b> I think they tried and who they tried to get they weren’t able to. There’s not a great deal out there that you’re going to bring in to make you much better. But people probably look at that and say, ‘Why didn’t you go and buy one?’. Yes, Son was on fire at the time, so perhaps they were thinking that it wasn’t too much of a problem. But, unfortunately, he’s got injured and now it seems a little naive<br /><br />Listen, football’s changed. In the past, when I was at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> and I played with <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a>, when I went back to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and I played with Teddy <b>[<a href="teddy-sheringham.html">Sheringham</a>]</b>, most teams were playing 4-4-2. Now they’re playing with that single striker. But you need to believe in your own ability that you’re good enough to go and play. I always think if the two strikers are good enough they’re going to play anyway, you’re going to find a way to get them into the team</p>

  <p><b>[Les Ferdinand says <a href="eric-dier.html">Eric Dier</a> crowd altercation understandable]</b> It was dangerous for himself and his family. But when you see your family getting abused or something going on, you can understand. Especially if it is the younger brother. You can understand the frustrations, making sure he protects his younger brother. As a professional footballer it is not the done thing. We have not seen that on many occasions. Sometimes the red mist come up and all you think about is protecting that person in the stands. There were too many fans shouting in my time. I would probably have got beaten up if I had gone in there. Of course there are frustrations. You are meant to keep your cool. Try your best to keep your cool and sometimes now and then you see an incident like this</p>

  <p><b>[Former England striker Les Ferdinand has challenged social media giants to tackle racism on their platforms]</b> One of the things I’ve been looking at, with all this Covid situation, I’m seeing things taken down off social media where people put an opinion about what they think COVID-19’s all about, and that’s been taken down off YouTube, that’s been taken down off Facebook. All this sort of stuff has been taken down, but they allow racist abuse to float freely through their channels. Until these people decide to do something about it, this problem will remain<br /><br />You can set up a social media account with it being <b>[identifiable as]</b> you and you can racially abuse people. Let’s remember some years ago it was seen as part of parcel <b>[of football]</b> for people to go into a stadium and racially abuse people of a different background to them and it was accepted. People could do monkey chants and people could throw bananas on the pitch and then walk out at the end and that was it. This is another avenue. They can’t do it in the stadiums too freely now because you’ve got CCTV cameras and we have people who may do something about in it in the stadiums. But from sitting behind a keyboard it’s easy to throw out these things - and I continue to say racism isn’t a problem in football, it’s a problem in society.<br /><br />Football has just been a medium in the past where people go and vent it without any repercussions. So those same people that were doing it back then - okay, generations have changed, but there’s still racist people in society and they’ll find a way to be racist, and this is the easiest way to do it without any identification going back to that person</p>

  <p><b>[Les Ferdinand says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> must win trophies to keep Kane]</b> As a fan, I don’t want Harry to go anywhere. I want him to stay at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and end his career at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, but we have to be realistic. Players now earn the sort of money that life shouldn’t be a problem for them when they finish playing. So they get to a stage where they achieve that goal and they say: ‘Right, okay’. But then there’s a situation where when you finish your career, the biggest thing for me now is looking back at my career and saying: ‘Yes, I did okay, but what have I got to show for it? Where are the medals?’ And that’s what you want. Every single player is the same. If <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> can match Harry’s ambitions to want him to win most things, then he’ll stay at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> for as long as they can match those ambitions. If he feels like they can’t, and they won’t, then that’s the time I think Harry will say, ‘Look, I want to go and win things’. I don’t think people would deny him that opportunity. Let’s hope that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> can get to a stage where they’re in a position to do that, because like I said, no one wants to see him leave but I certainly would understand the situation.</p>
