  <p><b>[FMLLP urges teams to register their players on time]</b> Teams who do not complete the registration of their players will not be able to field the respective players in any M-League matches until we approve it. The grace period for the registration is 48 hours, so teams need to register them as soon as possible so the players are not barred from playing.</p>

  <p><b>[M-League organiser FMLLP has reminded Kelantan that they can only register one new foreign signing in the current transfer window, and not two]</b> The application by Kelantan received by FMLLP is only for the registration of one new foreign player. We have never received any application to register more than one foreign player by Kelantan. If there was such an application, it would not be approved as Kelantan are still facing a transfer embargo, which had been handed for the failure to settle several financial obligations.</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin Ramalingam has revealed that seven Malaysia Super League clubs are on track to procure their MSL club license, while the remaining five are not far behind]</b> Even at the moment, I have staff visiting the teams to get their documentations in order. We don’t simply issue directives that they must meet, we also go and help them make sure they meet the criteria. We are <b>[currently]</b> focused on the Super League because their licensing starts next year and they have to complete it this year. I will say within the MSL, seven teams are on track, and even the five that are not on track are not very far behind.<br /><br />We did not touch on the league format, we explained about the authorities of the congress members, the executive committee <b>[exco]</b> members, league secretariat. We made sure everyone knows and realises their roles and powers in the congress, and we selected three more club representatives in the board of directors. So now FMLLP is complete in terms of the composition of its board of directors as planned, to have team representatives in the board</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin Ramalingam said that he hopes Malaysian clubs will emulate the step taken by his organisation to reward loyal Malaysian fans]</b> Even though we knew that the number of the fans who will be able to get the priority tickets is not going to be big, we decided to at least have something that will make sure that the more ‘hardcore’ fans will get tickets to the final match.<br /><br />Our hope for this is so that in the long run, the clubs would pick up on this. FMLLP is not going to play the role of solution-provider for long. Whatever we do we hope it becomes a catalyst, and we hope that the teams can see that it works and the fans are happy about it. And when the teams follow suit, maybe there’ll be rewards for a greater number of loyal fans, using different mechanisms<br /><br />We also hope to make it better as we go along, and for people to champion this; to handle the ticketing in a better way. We’ve learnt from the past two years that even the best thought-out plans, when implemented will not be similar to what was envisioned. As we implement this we’ll be learning and improving on it. We want to hand this over to the teams in the long run, to get them to be able to reward their fans accordingly. Hopefully, the spillover effect from this will not just happen to final matches, but also league and other matches as well. We want to make a difference in tickets distribution in the long-term as well<br /><br />We expect that the number of fans who will travel to away matches will be in the range of between 200 and 300, for every match. So in the final match there should be between 400 and 600 fans with the priority tickets. This is just the start. If it works it could evolve into bigger numbers in the future. I hope it is seen for what it is; a noble initiative to put the tickets into the hands of those who deserve them</p>

  <p><b>[FMLLP unveils ‘new era’ Super League trophy]</b> The new trophy was designed to represent a new era in Malaysian football, especially the move towards privatisation. Thanks to Tunku Ismail’s contributions, finally this year we succeeded in designing a new trophy after having planned for it since 2015. From the design stage, the whole trophy took eight months to be completed.</p>

  <p><b>[KL and Terengganu now need to race against time to obtain their M-League competition licenses]</b> For Kuala Lumpur and Terengganu, they may need to attain a level of qualification <b>[that is equal to those of MSL teams’]</b>. But if the applications of Kuala Lumpur and Terengganu are insufficient, they may be given a leeway and an extension to fulfill the key requirements, including the teams’ financial status. This decision is at the discretion of FAM club licensing’s First Instance Body <b>[FIB]</b>, and the Premier League club licensing department has yet to meet</p>
