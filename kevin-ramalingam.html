  <p><b>[FMLLP urges teams to register their players on time]</b> Teams who do not complete the registration of their players will not be able to field the respective players in any M-League matches until we approve it. The grace period for the registration is 48 hours, so teams need to register them as soon as possible so the players are not barred from playing.</p>

  <p><b>[M-League organiser FMLLP has reminded Kelantan that they can only register one new foreign signing in the current transfer window, and not two]</b> The application by Kelantan received by FMLLP is only for the registration of one new foreign player. We have never received any application to register more than one foreign player by Kelantan. If there was such an application, it would not be approved as Kelantan are still facing a transfer embargo, which had been handed for the failure to settle several financial obligations.</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin Ramalingam has revealed that seven Malaysia Super League clubs are on track to procure their MSL club license, while the remaining five are not far behind]</b> Even at the moment, I have staff visiting the teams to get their documentations in order. We don’t simply issue directives that they must meet, we also go and help them make sure they meet the criteria. We are <b>[currently]</b> focused on the Super League because their licensing starts next year and they have to complete it this year. I will say within the MSL, seven teams are on track, and even the five that are not on track are not very far behind.<br /><br />We did not touch on the league format, we explained about the authorities of the congress members, the executive committee <b>[exco]</b> members, league secretariat. We made sure everyone knows and realises their roles and powers in the congress, and we selected three more club representatives in the board of directors. So now FMLLP is complete in terms of the composition of its board of directors as planned, to have team representatives in the board</p>
