  <p><b>[Atlanta United announced Wednesday it has acquired midfielder Yamil Asad on a season-long loan from Velez Sarsfield]</b> We’re thrilled to add another exciting young player to our club. He’s an attack-minded player with a very high ceiling, and we’re confident in his ability to showcase his quality in MLS.</p>

  <p><b>[Trades looming as MLS draft shapes up to be a wild one]</b> What’s funny is that the demise of the draft gets reported every year, and yet every year you find that there’s certainly in that top 10 players that can contribute. There’s a lot of people interested in moving, but we’ve got a new roster and have to weigh the potential deals on the table with actually taking a player who might be able to contribute in the first year.<br /><br />If you’re the No. 1 there’s probably a little bit more pressure to take that first pick, but we want to do the best we can to put a team together for Tata Martino for season one. We’re not going to be emotional about it. If we think it’s better to trade, we’ll trade</p>

He’ll be a welcome addition to our club.</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United has officially landed 18-year-old Ezequiel Barco from Argentina side Independiente]</b> Securing a player of Ezequiel’s caliber is another significant moment in Atlanta United history. This transfer further demonstrates the commitment of our club to bring top level, dynamic young players to Atlanta and to MLS. We are excited to welcome Ezequiel to our club and our city.</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United’s Ezequiel Barco signing the next step in MLS evolution]</b> For the bigger picture, I think this is a huge signing for the league. This is a kid who is 18 years old, who is one of the top teenagers in the world, who is being approached by European clubs, had the offer to go, but he was sold on the vision of Atlanta United. He dug his heels and he was determined to move. I think that says a lot for where MLS is going now that we can attract these type of players.<br /><br />Every club is a part of that pipeline and that sort of supply chain. So my view was you could attract top talent, and if you could then move them on then that’s good for everybody because you can reinvest those funds and get that next young player. It’s easier for us to go to other players in South America or around the world and say, ‘Look, this league, MLS, is a league that’s going places. You can come here, be a superstar for a while and then still get that move to a top club.’ Hopefully, ultimately, what we want to do is be able to retain that talent when the league goes from strength to strength and becomes one of the top three or four in the world<br /><br />MLS has to be a league that can attract that young talent. The Liga MX will be running scared, and even the big European clubs now can’t assume they can just take and cherry pick that talent from South America. We’ve shown <b>[MLS]</b> is a valuable league to develop the player. They can learn English, they can do all of those things that help de-risk a move to a European club. That’s where I see MLS’ place at the moment, but I think it’s great for us now. We’re getting talented players who excite our crowd that drives the league</p>

  <p><b>[Gerardo Martino will leave Atlanta United at the end of the season after rejecting a contract offer]</b> We are very grateful to Tata for his commitment to Atlanta United and for all he has done to help build our club during our first two years in the league. True to his reputation, he has been an incredible leader and has set us up for great success moving forward. From the beginning, his vision for Atlanta United was aligned with ours, and his level of experience, talent and leadership has been extremely valuable during this critical time. He will be missed, but we understand and appreciate his reasons for moving on to spend time with family and take on new challenges.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal was ready to make an £11 million for Miguel Almiron]</b> It would have to take at least triple that for me to even get out of bed and think about any bids for Almiron.</p>

  <p><b>[Miguel Almiron may well leave Atlanta United this winter]</b> I have seen some laughable things in the press, clearly we are never going to loan one of our players out and we are certainly not going to let them go for the chump change that I have seen in some reports. If it’s a proper, serious offer then it’s something we would consider, but not for the laughable figures that I have seen mentioned in the press.<br /><br />He has proved in these two years that he is by far and away one of the best players in the league. He is still a young player, he is a Paraguay international and it’s brilliant he can cope with the physicality of the Argentinian league with Lanus and also the MLS. He is an amazing player, he was one of the best players on the pitch in both of the All-Star games that we played against Juventus and Real Madrid. I have no doubt that when the time is right, and the offer is right, he can be a success in whatever league he goes</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United’s championship season sets lofty new standard for MLS]</b> At the end of the day, he’s the fundamental reason that we’re lifting a trophy today. Because his commitment to the city and the credibility gave us that early impulse in terms of fans that bought in because they knew it was going to be credible. I remember meeting him for the first time and my question is, is this an owner that’s really committed to soccer or is he just trying to fill the stadium that he’s building? And right from day one I knew he was ultra-serious in terms of what he wanted to do. And look, he brought me in with almost two and a half years to plan for it, so of course that runway really helped us take our time and put together the various pieces. Arthur’s support and mentorship is really the reason we’re here today celebrating.</p>

  <p><b>[Miguel Almiron has been widely linked with a move to the Premier]</b> Clearly there’s been a lot of interest, not only in the Premier League but from top clubs around Europe. I’d expect that because he he’s had a wonderful season. The reality is, and forgive me for repeating myself, he’s got three more years under contract with Atlanta United. He’s one of our top players. We’re MLS Cup champions. We have an owner in Arthur Blank who wants to win. If the right offer comes in that’s right for Miggy, right for the club and right for the league then we will consider it.<br /><br />I saw that, people keep talking about this Pity Martinez, and he mentioned it himself. We’ve certainly got some irons in the fire and we are always looking to improve the squad. When there’s something official we will announce it.</p>

  <p><b>[Miguel Almiron has been compared to Real Madrid star Gareth Bale]</b> He’s an unbelievable person as a character. He smiles all the time. From that perspective of engaging with the fans, he was an instant fan favourite because of his demeanour. In terms of his playing on the pitch, he is non-stop, perpetual motion. He is faster with the ball than without it. He reminds me very much of Gareth Bale that way. When Gareth picked the ball up, he always seemed to be quicker when he had the ball and Miggy is like that with his pace. But the big thing for him and why I think he is really suited for the Premier League is, yes he is a brilliantly exciting attacking player, particularly in transition but he works really hard in defending. For us as a club, to have our star player be the first person tackling back, and run 60 yards back to nick it out of touch, was great. So, going to Newcastle - and this was the chat we had - he is going to fit in straight away because Newcastle fans want a player who is going to wear his heart on his sleeve, and who is there doing the dirty stuff just as much as the attacking stuff. In Miggy, they get the best of both. They get a hard-working guy who’s going to be spending every bit of energy he’s got for the fans but he’s also got that touch of class where he’s going to take your breath away as he carries the ball. I think he’s going to be really successful.<br /><br />We were always pretty firm about the figure we wanted. We knew there was an interest at that level but I’d say I was sceptical, given his track record, that we would get to a figure that was acceptable. But to be fair to Newcastle, in the end, it was a good hard negotiation. Clearly, Rafa wanted the player and they had done their homework. He was someone they had thought about. They had done their due diligence and thought ‘okay, we’re going to push the button on this one’. It was important for Miggy because it was his dream. It was important for the league, too, for that type of number. It is by far and away the record transfer fee for MLS. I think we have helped to set the table for future transfers</p>

  <p><b>[Despite Atlanta United winger Ezequiel Barco’s claims, Atlanta United president Darren Eales says the club has yet to receive a formal offer]</b> Because there’s not really a lot going on at the moment, we’re going to have, I think, the most silliest of seasons. But the reality, as you know, is Ezequiel is a quality player. He’s under a long-term contract with Atlanta United and we’ve had no clubs reach out to us at the moment in terms of him</p>
