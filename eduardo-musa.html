  <p>[<a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>’s former ‘Guardian Angel’ claims his father is ruining his image. Eduardo Musa, who worked closely alongside <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> during his early years in Brazil, has watched the player’s struggles from afar and believes his entourage, led by <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> Snr, are to blame] I think he stopped doing things with his heart, that’s the trouble. <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> and his staff are now in permanent conflict. They refuse to accept criticism. He’s now reaping what they have been sowing for a long time. <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is faithful to those who have been there from the beginning, and especially his father, but it hurts him. <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> Snr can’t behave like he’s a super-pro who manages every aspect of his son’s career. He’s not prepared for that. <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is a classy guy, an adorable and generous guy, but the image he gives to the media is exactly the opposite of that. And it’s his father who is responsible.<br /><br />[On what advice he would offer <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>] I’d tell him to forget his image, drop his commercial obligations and give up the idea of becoming number one. He needs to go back to where he came from. I don’t know how much he still loves football. When I was with him, he loved it very much. Today, all this controversy will have caused damage to his love of the game. Only his heart can give an answer. His love of football is key. When you look at him on social media, <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> and his staff only talk about business. It’s photos posted in a restaurant, at the bottom of the Eiffel Tower or at parties. He no longer speaks about sport. He must quickly regain his love of the game. And he’s the only one who can do that<br /><br />[Musa is unsure whether the rumours linking him with a return to Catalunya are true] I don’t have inside information but I think so. But I don’t know if <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> will let him go. It seems like it would be better for him to go back to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. It seems he is no longer welcome at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. It’s better he goes back to where he was happy</p>
