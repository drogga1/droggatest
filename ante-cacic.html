  <p><b>[Croatia boss Ante Cacic has confirmed that Real Madrid playmaker Luka Modric was withdrawn as an injury precaution in the side’s victory over Bulgaria]</b> Luka Modric felt pain in his adductor, so we didn’t want to risk anything. That is why I substituted him at half time.</p>

  <p><b>[Ante Cacic who replaced Niko Kovac last month following the loss in Norway on September 6]</b> It’s a wonderful feeling. I have to congratulate my team, the former coach and all the people who were supporting Croatia. We played a good qualifying campaign and beside two bad results we fulfilled our expectations. Now it is time to celebrate this, there were hugs and singing after the match, we are all happy and proud. When Norway scored in Rome, I told my players at half-time that we have to concentrate on our match and that Italy would score two goals in the second half.</p>

  <p><b>[Captain Darijo Srna found out his father had passed away while he was playing in the 1-0 win against Turkey on Sunday. Goalkeeping coach Marijan Mrmic also lost his father, while Croatia boss Ante Cacic also revealed that the husband of another member of staff had suffered a stroke]</b> What can you do? It was not easy, but on the other hand it can motivate us more. The lady from our accounts office, her husband had a stroke as well, so there have lots of bad situations, but we are just focused on tomorrow’s match and on trying to play our best.</p>

  <p><b>[Croatia ‘sports terrorists’ sabotage Euro 2016 chances &amp; risk innocent lives]</b> They are hooligans. They are not supporters. It’s totally clear that this is a group of hooligans. The same thing happened in Milan against Italy, we saw some Nazi signs on the pitch. Probably they have some support from I don’t know where. But 95 per cent of fans are ashamed in front of Europe<br /><br />We knew there were threats about something like this has happened - these are not real Croatian supporters, they are sports terrorists. We have so much experience of this it hurts so much. But our country does not want to mess with these types of hooligans<br /><br />Our players are really sad. They’re so proud to wear the shirt. They play for the Croatian people. We’re sad after playing a beautiful match. We were playing great football</p>

  <p><b>[Off the market! Euro 2016’s best player Ivan Perisic is going nowhere]</b> Ivan has played at a top level for the last couple of years. He fits really well. It’s probably the atmosphere in the team - when everything works so well, players can perform at this kind of level.</p>

  <p><b>[Ivan Perisic will continue to snub interest from Manchester United as he is happy at Inter]</b> I spoke to Ivan Perisic, he is happy in Inter. The coach <b>[Luciano Spalletti]</b> appreciates him, they are preparing new contract for him.<br /><br />Luka Modric is best midfielder in the world, proud of Croatia and he never considered quitting national team</p>
