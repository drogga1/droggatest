  <p>[Croatia boss Ante Cacic has confirmed that Real Madrid playmaker Luka Modric was withdrawn as an injury precaution in the side’s victory over Bulgaria] Luka Modric felt pain in his adductor, so we didn’t want to risk anything. That is why I substituted him at half time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Ante Cacic who replaced Niko Kovac last month following the loss in Norway on September 6] It’s a wonderful feeling. I have to congratulate my team, the former coach and all the people who were supporting Croatia. We played a good qualifying campaign and beside two bad results we fulfilled our expectations. Now it is time to celebrate this, there were hugs and singing after the match, we are all happy and proud. When Norway scored in Rome, I told my players at half-time that we have to concentrate on our match and that Italy would score two goals in the second half.</p>
