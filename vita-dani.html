  <p>[Vita Dani and Abhishek Bachchan, the co-owners of the team, felt that a change was desperately needed after a disastrous 2016 season when they finished seventh during the group stage] The last three seasons have been very memorable. Last one wasn’t to our expectations and that is the reason we have John [Gregory] here. Looking at our framework, I’m sure John will add a lot of value to the club.</p>

  <p>[Chennaiyin FC sign six AIFF Elite Academy graduates] We would like to congratulate Mr Praful Patel, Mr Kushal Das and their whole team for the fantastic work they have been doing at the AIFF Elite Academy. Last year we signed five graduates from the AIFF Academy and all five have shown great improvement over the last 12 months with Jerry [Lalrinzuala] and Anirudh [Thapa] also going on to play for the India senior team. We thank AIFF and hope to continue the development of the boys in the coming years.</p>
