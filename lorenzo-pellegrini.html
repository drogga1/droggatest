<blockquote>
  <p>[Italy Under-21 midfielder Lorenzo Pellegrini has hit back at criticism by Spain] The Spanish players have to understand that there is physical contact in football. Last night, many of them were exaggerating contact. Hats off to them when talking about technical quality, but for everything else, they really ought to be learning from us<br /><br />[Pellegrini also dismissed Spain’s complaints about the penalty] I was convinced it was so clear that the referee would blow the whistle even without the need for VAR. It’s true, the foul began outside the box, but I kept going for a few more metres in the hope I could still reach Riccardo Orsolini’s cross. There are three penalty takers in the squad, it’s me and Federico Dimarco first, then Orsolini. I felt ready and so I took it<br /><br />[Pellegrini believes the Azzurrini are well placed to improve on their run to the last four at the 2017 tournament] We are certainly in better shape now at Under-21 level than we were two years ago, but if we lose tomorrow against Poland, then everything changes again, so we must remain concentrated. We are a little more confident now and it’s good that at half-time against Spain we told each other the important thing was to keep playing our football, whatever happened. It was a real step forward, but if we don’t win the next game, it’ll feel futile</p>
