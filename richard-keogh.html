  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> the manager]</b> It’s also the environment he is working in. I think the gaffer and his coaching staff are creating a very good environment. It’s been quite nice this season, because we’ve got a younger group and playing with Fik, I’m seeing him improve a lot. It’s nice that I can give a bit back now as one of the older players, which is something I enjoy</p>

  <p><b>[Richard Keogh says Talk of Frank Lampard potentially heading back to Chelsea comes as no surprise]</b> I can’t speak highly enough of the gaffer and working with him in his first season. He’s going to have a fantastic career as a manager for sure. I think naturally with the speculation that’s going on regarding Sarri, the gaffer is going to get mentioned because of the legendary status he’s got at that football club and obviously he’s doing such a good job with us.<br /><br />As far as I know he’s looking forward to next season as much as I am and it would be a shame to see him leave. But in this industry, when you’re doing a good job and you’re Frank Lampard, then you’re going to get linked with jobs. Hopefully he stays. I’ve really enjoyed working with him and he’s really improved the football club and me as a player<br /><br /><b>[Whether Frank Lampard remains in his current role or not, Richard Keogh believes Derby will build on the foundations that he has helped to maintain]</b> I think whenever you suffer a bit of heartbreak it does makes you more determined to achieve your goal the next season. I think the group we created and what the manager was creating at Derby was something special so hopefully we can regroup, get some quality additions in and attack it because the last five or six years we’ve always been challenging near the top of the league. So we’ve just got to make sure we keep our standards high and give it another opportunity</p>

  <p><b>[Derby County have confirmed that club captain Richard Keogh will miss the rest of the season after suffering a knee injury in the drink-driving incident which has cast shame over the club]</b> As a club, we cannot, and do not, condone the actions of a small group of players on Tuesday evening. The players were out as part of a scheduled team-building dinner with staff and while the majority of them acted responsibly and left at around 8pm and were not involved, a small group, including the team captain Richard Keogh, continued drinking into the night. They should have known when to stop and also ignored the opportunity to be driven home using cars laid on by the club, and chose to stay out.<br /><br />As a result of an alcohol-related incident, Richard Keogh has sustained a serious knee injury that will prevent him from playing until the end of the season. The players involved in the incident on Tuesday evening will be subject to a rigorous internal investigation under the club’s code of conduct and disciplinary procedures, but over and above any punishment they receive we will be expecting them to become involved with the excellent work the Community Trust does helping the communities we serve. We have been very clear about our attitude towards alcohol and the players know that at certain and specific times of the season they are permitted a drink together as a group in a controlled environment.<br /><br />Those involved in Tuesday’s incident know they will pay a heavy price for their actions, but also that we will support them with their rehabilitation back into the squad and team. We fully support the work of our partners at Drinkaware and the unsanctioned actions of this small group of players is totally at odds the stance that both Drinkaware and <a href="derby-county.html">Derby County</a> Football Club take regards alcohol. We will be using this situation to redouble our efforts in highlighting the dangers posed by alcohol. We would also like to thank the emergency services for their swift help</p>

  <p><b>[Derby have terminated the contract of club captain Richard Keogh over his involvement in an incident that saw two other County players, <a href="mason-bennett.html">Mason Bennett</a> and <a href="tom-lawrence.html">Tom Lawrence</a>, arrested]</b> <a href="derby-county.html">Derby County</a> Football Club has completed the disciplinary hearing regarding Richard Keogh in respect of his involvement in the events of Tuesday, September 24. As a result of that process, Mr Keogh has had his contract terminated with immediate effect for gross misconduct. He has the right of appeal within 14 days. As we have said from the outset, the club will not tolerate any of its players or staff behaving in a manner which puts themselves, their colleagues, and members of the general public at risk of injury or worse, or which brings the club into disrepute. The club will be making no further comment at this time regards this matter, until the conclusion of any potential appeal</p>
