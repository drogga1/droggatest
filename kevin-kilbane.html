  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney return to Everton a good move for Man Utd striker]</b> That’s been going around now for quite a while. Wayne Rooney will probably will leave United, yes. To go to Everton might be a good move for him because the way he left Everton didn’t quite work well for him from a personal point of view. Growing up he was a huge Everton fan.<br /><br />I think it will be a good move but his agent said that he has got offers from around the world. So it might not necessarily be to stay in the Premier League. It looks to me that he will be leaving Old Trafford. He might come to Asia, China, one of the European clubs or stay in the Premier League and go to Everton. Wherever he goes, I think he will be a valued member of that side because I still think he has the ability and can produce what he has shown in the past<br /><br />As a striker now, probably no because as a number nine you need to be running off the defenders and he probably doesn’t have the pace that he had before. Pace is something what a number nine certainly requires. He can still score goals and I think he could play as a number 10 and as a midfield player. He has the ability to do that</p>

  <p><b>[Why Man City are right to break the bank for Walker &amp; Danilo]</b> I think even from an attacking point of view, full-backs are probably the most important players because they have got to provide that width and they have to have that energy level.<br /><br />They have to be able to run for 90 minutes. Continuously running for 50-60 metres is not as if midfield players in general are doing with 20-30 metre runs trying to get around the pitch in high intensity. The high intensity runs are the 50-60 metres run which is made by a full-back now and that is why it is such a prized position and that is why the best coaches in the world are looking at the best full-backs.<br /><br />Everyone watching football or reading this now knows that one of the most important positions of the pitch, if not the most important, is the full-back from an attacking point of view</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin Kilbane has said Cesc Fabregas is a total arse on the pitch]</b> Cesc Fabregas was a total arse. He was an absolute arse on the pitch, Fabregas. So disrespectful. Just mouth. The one thing that stuck in my mind - I was playing at Huddersfield, you know, I was on loan at little Huddersfield, and we went to the Emirates. We were drawing 1-1, and Fabregas comes onto the pitch, and he was going up against Joey Gudjonsson. Do you remember Joey Gudjonsson?<br /><br />He goes up to Joey Gudjohnsen and he says, ‘You’re shit, your team-mates are shit’ and to be fair to Fabregas he scored a penalty and I was like, ‘Cesc, this is Huddersfield mate, what are you doing?’. Like Jesus Christ, come on, give me a break. Time and a place. Do it to Paul Scholes or Roy Keane, not Joey Gudjonsson</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin Kilbane says <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> dived to win the stoppage-time penalty which saw <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> snatch a dramatic 2-1 victory at home to <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>]</b> I don’t think it’s a penalty, but there was contact initially from Albrighton on Mane. But Mane pulls away and then dives. They’re not going to overturn that because that’s not a clear and obvious error because there actually was contact in the lead-up to it. But I think Mane fell over and dived to win the penalty, I really do</p>
