<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Quotes on Zlatan Ibrahimovic]</b> Wow! As a person, as an individual he is for me bigger and stronger than anyone else in the world. At <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, he was sometimes one against all, against the whole world. The team did not quite accept him, the fans were against it, but he did not bend for a centimetre! At each training session, in every public statement, he said: I am the best and he proved it by his performance.<br /><br />Once I talked to <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Ibra</a> and he said the following: ‘It is important for me to prove it to myself at every single training. If I am odd there, then later I will be odd on the field’. Do you understand? To himself! He says, ‘When I’m the best in training, I take to the pitch for the match with the feeling that I am a god!’ You should have seen how he works, it’s incredible! He cannot lose in nothing at all and just nowhere.<br /><br /><b>[…]</b><br /><br />I don’t say that he is the most skillful – in this respect there still were some cooler people. <b>[…]</b> But as a personality, <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Ibra</a> is above all!<br /><br /><b>[…]</b>
Ibra is unbelievable. The outstanding football personality. Yes, he can cause the coach problems in the changing room. But as a teammate and a football player he is the best!</p>
