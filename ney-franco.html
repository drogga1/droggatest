<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former Brazil Under-20 coach Ney Franco believes that Real Madrid star Casemiro has developed into one of the best defensive midfielders in the world]</b> In Europe, he at first had some difficulty and was loaned to Porto, but it worked well for him, because he found an easier adaptive football and was more mature emotionally. He had a good season in Porto and returned to Real Madrid with more confidence and better known both by the club and the press. This made a difference, because it created a better environment for him to play. He is a talented, technical player of great quality, but he is also very tactical. He is one of the best defensive midfielders in the world.<br /><br /><b>[on Lucas Moura]</b> Lucas had two moments at PSG, the moment of adaptation and growth, and the moment when he not play too much. He has done well to leave PSG because he has enormous potential to shine in Europe. He is in the same level of players like Philippe Coutinho and Casemiro, he is very talented<br /><br />I think Lucas has the profile of the Premier League, he is a player of speed and intensity, who likes to face opponents in one against one. The characteristics of the Premier League match with him and I think he can go back to being the Lucas that we saw in Sao Paulo and at the youth teams of the Selecao</p>
