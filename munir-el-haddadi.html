  <p><b>[<a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> forward Munir El Haddadi is among those in favour of <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> resuming from June 12]</b> Well, as far as I know they haven’t told us anything. If it has to be played, then we will play. We have to train hard to be the best we can when they say. I think it <b>[June 12]</b> is fine. Four weeks already gives you time to do things. The best thing is the sooner you open to work in a group, which is what we need. We want to play, all with caution because we have been stopped for a long time. It is not the same as being on vacation - it’s been two months locked up without being able to go out or train well. Little by little, we have to do more and safely</p>

  <p><b>[Prior to the season’s pause, Munir had struggled for first-team football at <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> this term under <a href="julen-lopetegui.html">Julen Lopetegui</a>, despite an encouraging first few months at the club]</b> It is true that from there <b>[the Copa del Rey defeat to Mirandes in January]</b> I do not play and it may seem that way, but I tell you that with the coach I get along very well and there is no problem. And if there has been a problem, it can be solved by speaking. There has been nothing, we have never discussed or anything like that. I am going to continue working, trying to grow and helping the team. Really, and I have thought about this many times - I have to return the affection that <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> is showing me. I think I can give a lot to <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> and the fans that are so spectacular. They have always supported me, whether I’m in this situation or playing</p>
