<blockquote>
  <p><b>[By this point, the move to Japan had been confirmed and the coach who gave him his debut at BEC Tero Sasana was not surprised. Englishman Andrew Ord - currently manager of the Bangladesh national side - gave an insightful glimpse into the player’s mentality]</b> He has played around 200 games at only 23 years old, so has the experience to step up He has carried the pressure of expectation over the last three years of being Thai football’s biggest star so that should help him. It will probably be tough for him and he will need the rub of the green to succeed. It’s crucial the coach and club back him and give him the chance to adapt<br /><br />He needs to have an impact off the bench as he settles in, then hopefully increase his influence as he gets used to the J League. Of all the Thai players I worked with, he had the best mentality and always tries to make a difference. He needs to get over the urge to return home where life is easier and the longer he holds out, the better his chances of success</p>
