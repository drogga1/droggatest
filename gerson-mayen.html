  <p><b>[Meet Gerson Mayen: The SoCal-born Salvadoran looking to take down the Seattle Sounders]</b> My experience in El Salvador, a lot of people think it’s really dangerous but honestly my experience down there has been great. They’ve been treating me well. I don’t take anything for granted. When I was in MLS, sometimes they don’t know what they have. When I was back in MLS, I didn’t know what I had until reality hit once I went back to El Salvador. Now, I just have to perform well and hope I get seen again.<br /><br /><b>[The 29-year-old now is wearing the captain’s armband and looking to lead a team that has talented players but lacks seasoning]</b> It’s a young team, but we also have players who have a big future. I think the tournament can help us. We’re hoping to give the fans a good performance in the CONCACAF Champions League. We want to win a game, maybe it’ll be a really tight contest, but we showed <b>[in a friendly against FC Dallas]</b> that we can compete. We need to improve on a lot of things. I’m not saying it was a great match for us, sometimes we have more possession but there are a lot of young players still lacking international experience and we’re hoping that it’ll be a little easier against Seattle with those players now having a taste of playing an MLS team.<br /><br />I think there’s always something going down in El Salvador. The federation, honestly, is a disaster. Right now we’re having problems since we don’t have a coach. I mean, I think the coach that was down there was doing a great job. We didn’t go to the semis <b>[of the Gold Cup]</b> because we played against the U.S. and honestly the U.S. has good players, really quality players. I think they had to give the coach a chance and now, I mean, I’m just concentrating on what I have to do. I don’t think about all those things just because you can lose concentration<br /><br />I always have hope. It’s hard to get back into a MLS team. I’ve had agents, but they’d always try to send me to a USL team. I’m not really looking forward to doing that. Now, I have to take a chance. In this tournament, there maybe will be scouts. You just have to perform well to be seen</p>
