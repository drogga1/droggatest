<blockquote>
  <p>[Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough has rubbished suggestions that the club are set to offer eight-time Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt a trial at the club] I didn’t know he [the chairman] picked the players, he’ll have to come down and spend ten minutes in the technical area and see how he goes. Would that be a loan or permanent? I’m not quite sure. He would certainly add some pace. As long as he doesn’t want much money I’m sure we will be OK<br /><br />I’m sure we would offer a trial, and that the manager would. He’s quick, if nothing else. He’s done great things for athletics and if you look at Adam Gemili, who was in the 4x100m relay, he played football when he was younger. We would be very interested, obviously. He’s done a tremendous amount for his sport. If he can apply the same amount of enthusiasm and dedication to soccer then who knows what might lie ahead</p>
