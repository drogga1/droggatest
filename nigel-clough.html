  <p><b>[Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough has rubbished suggestions that the club are set to offer eight-time Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt a trial at the club]</b> I didn’t know he <b>[the chairman]</b> picked the players, he’ll have to come down and spend ten minutes in the technical area and see how he goes. Would that be a loan or permanent? I’m not quite sure. He would certainly add some pace. As long as he doesn’t want much money I’m sure we will be OK<br /><br />I’m sure we would offer a trial, and that the manager would. He’s quick, if nothing else. He’s done great things for athletics and if you look at Adam Gemili, who was in the 4x100m relay, he played football when he was younger. We would be very interested, obviously. He’s done a tremendous amount for his sport. If he can apply the same amount of enthusiasm and dedication to soccer then who knows what might lie ahead</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City’s class of 2019 present Burton Albion with a tougher test than a Manchester United side which included Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo did]</b> I think this one over two legs. I think the pitch is going to be a bit better this time around, if anybody remembers the pitch against Manchester United! But we’re facing similar sorts of tasks.<br /><br />When Rooney and Ronaldo came on after 59 minutes here for Manchester United, it’s a similar sort of prospect with the likes of the quality that Manchester City have. But away from home, it’s a different thing. When they are on their own patch, as you saw against Liverpool, they’re as good and as confident as anything. That’s when they’ve come off a relatively poor period for them, they’ve lost a couple of matches recently and then they can still play like they did against Liverpool and keep the title race open. That says an awful lot about them.<br /><br />Honestly, we are just looking forward to enjoying the experience. Nobody gives us much of a chance and rightly so but it’s just about the players, everybody, talking about supporters, who have been following the club for 50-60 years never dreamt of us being in a League Cup semi-final. Let’s all everybody as one go and enjoy it. Every game you have got a chance. It’s just what degree that chance is and ours is extremely thin but there is always a chance in football</p>
