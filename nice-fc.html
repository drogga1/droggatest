We’re treated more severely than wanted criminals. If we were gangsters or thugs, I would understand these measures, but I’m a father with a job – I just want to support my club</p>

  <p><b>[Nice teenager Diaby-Fadiga sacked after stealing <a href="kasper-dolberg.html">Dolberg</a>’s €70,000 watch]</b> OGC Nice and Lamine Diaby-Fadiga parted ways on Tuesday. Following the theft of <a href="kasper-dolberg.html">Kasper Dolberg</a>’s watch from the professional first team’s changing room, and the subsequent admission of the player, the club decided to cancel its contract with the 18-year-old forward with immediate effect. Above and beyond all sporting and financial consideration, OGC Nice cannot and will not accept such behaviour that betrays the confidence that unites all the club’s employees and all the members of the Rouge et Noir family</p>

Forced to go off half an hour into the game against Metz this Saturday, the Algerian international has undergone additional examinations. The diagnosis revealed a meniscal lesion in the right knee. The 23-year-old, who will be operated on soon, will unfortunately be out of action for a long time. OGC Nice wishes him a speedy recovery</p>
