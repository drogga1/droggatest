  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Kevin Trapp has outlined just how important Neymar]</b> In Paris, Neymar is clearly missing in the team and it won’t be different for Brazil. Neymar has an incredible quality that takes every team to a higher level. His performances often make the difference.<br /><br />We’re delighted that we have him in the team and hope that he’s in Paris for a long time. Every day there’s something different about him in the papers. One day he’s moving back to Real Madrid then it’s back to Barcelona the next day. I don’t know what will happen. But we’re not annoyed<br /><br />Despite the hype, his feet are still on the ground, even if it’s often portrayed differently</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin Trapp has no regrets over his return to <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> on a permanent transfer from <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>]</b> I do not regret leaving Paris.

I still have big plans for Eintracht<br /><br /><b>[Veteran Italian keeper <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a>’s departure from Paris after one season raised the possibility that Trapp could return and re-establish himself in the first team.
