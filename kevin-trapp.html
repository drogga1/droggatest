  <p><b>[Goalkeeper Kevin Trapp has returned to Eintracht Frankfurt from Paris Saint-Germain following a successful loan spell from the French club]</b> I made it clear in the spring that I feel very comfortable in Frankfurt with Eintracht. The time in Paris was very exciting, successful and a great experience for me. Now I’m coming home completely and I want to achieve a lot here</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin Trapp has no regrets over his return to Eintracht Frankfurt on a permanent transfer from Paris Saint-Germain]</b> I do not regret leaving Paris. I had a good time, but I deliberately signed in Frankfurt for five years. The club is developing in a very positive direction. I still have big plans for Eintracht<br /><br /><b>[Veteran Italian keeper <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a>’s departure from Paris after one season raised the possibility that Trapp could return and re-establish himself in the first team. However, Trapp said that this was ruled out by PSG’s management]</b> We agreed that I returned to PSG at the end of my loan but I was still in contact with the coach and several players. Then there were discussions between leaders and it was decided that I left again</p>

  <p><b>[Eintracht Frankfurt manager Adi Hutter has issued an ultimatum to forward Ante Rebic after a poor showing in his side’s surprise 1-0 defeat to Strasbourg. Goalkeeper Kevin Trapp also expressed his exasperation after the game, though he didn’t refer to Rebic directly]</b> In the first half, not everyone was fully involved so we didn’t stand a chance</p>
