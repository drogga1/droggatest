  <p>[On his return] The move was initiated by both clubs and the president [Selangor president Datuk Seri Subahan Kamal]. He was very eager to bring me back, and he did everything in his power.<br /><br />God willing, with the help of my teammates, I will help the younger teammates to improve. I want to avoid disrupting the team, and I hope they will be even more motivated in the coming matches. That all depends on my own performance. I can’t tell for myself honestly, when the end is going to come. Only time will tell<br /><br />[Strangely enough, Amri was not sure of the details of the agreement for his transfer from Melaka to Selangor] I am not entirely sure about that, I haven’t gone through it. Plus these matters can sometimes be a sensitive issue, and even I find it hard to understand them</p>

  <p>[Malaysia captain Amri Yahyah said that the nationality of the head coach must not be made an excuse by his Harimau Malaya teammates] I can’t comment much on it, as I’m not sure myself whether I’ll be in the new national team plans, which are up to the president and the new head coach.<br /><br />[The Portuguese is the first foreign coach to lead the Harimau Malaya, since Hungarian Bertalan Bicskei left the post in 2005] If you ask me, every player has to focus [on the task], regardless of whether the head coach is a local or foreign one. We have to help the national team reach greater heights. The nationality of the head coach must not be made an excuse. Those picked to play for Malaysia must give their best for the national team<br /><br />The postponement may give the new head coach more time to get familiarised with the Malaysia players. He can then form a more formidable team</p>

  <p>[Amri Yahyah wants teammates’ help following return to Selangor] It’s a shame that we lost, we could have dominated the game. Instead we let in goals cheaply, and I hope we won’t play like today again.<br /><br />[When asked about his opinion on head coach Maniam Pachaiappan’s insistence on making him and Andik Vermansah, another recent Selangor returnee, understand his 3-4-3 system] This requires time as I’ve only returned recently, but I will work on that aspect definitely<br /><br />Everyone in the squad has been going all out in the matches. I hope my teammates can help me work harder and contribute to the team, god willing</p>

  <p>[Selangor head coach P Maniam and Amri Yahyah took the time to thank the Red Giants fans after their 3-2 win over JDT] We were playing at home tonight, thank you to the home fans for being behind us through thick and thin. Praise Allah, all of us played our best tonight.</p>
