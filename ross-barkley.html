  <p><b>[Ross Barkley on team-mate <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a>]</b> Oh God, you see him do that every day in training so you’re not surprised when you see him do it in a game like that - but what a goal. He’s one of the best players in the world and he shows it. He’s been showing it for the last five or six years and he is establishing himself in the top three players in the world. At the minute, he’s probably the best player in the world, the way he is playing</p>

  <p><b>[Ross Barkley has called on his <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> team-mates to chip in with goals to replace those lost following the summer departure of the exceptional <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a>]</b> You have to fill in. Everyone in the squad understands that he (Hazard) was a great player, but he is gone. He has new challenges now and we have to replace his goals and create the chances. We have that much quality in the squad we will all step up to the plate. Last season when Eden wasn’t playing we still won games, we still created chances. We know he is an exceptional player, but we have exceptional players in the squad. We have young ones that will step up and produce the goods as well.<br /><br />We have Callum coming back from injury and we have signed <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a>, he is an exceptional talent. We have wingers who can create from tight positions, players who can shoot from distance and strikers - young and experienced - who are hungry for goals. We have all come back from pre-season hungry, especially under the new manager. We are all working hard every day in training and doing double sessions all the time, getting ready for the new season. There is a lot we can improve on - you could see that against Reading as we conceded three goals. We scored four so there were positives, too, and I am looking forward to the season<br /><br /><b>[Barkley played with <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> for England and acknowledge that his new boss was one of his idols as he came through the <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> academy]</b> Yes, he was one of my idols as a kid. I was always watching Match of the Day as a kid, you always saw him every week scoring goals. That’s what you like to see and now he is our manager, it is brilliant for all the players in the squad. He’s got all the respect from the players for the player he was and the person he is. Every day, whether it be around the building or on the training pitch, he is speaking to everyone trying to give them tips on how to improve.<br /><br />He will help all the midfielders. He is a legend of the game, the highest goal-scoring midfielder in <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> history, so we are going to take all he has to give us and the experience he has from the past on board. We will keep improving and he will help us. It is a new manager and a new formation - we’ve had to adapt to the different systems we are going to play. <b>[It’s about being]</b> hungry for goals, just have the desire to get in the box. At the minute I have been playing a bit further forward, to think like a striker, especially as a No. 10, but try to help out defensively and work hard off the ball<br /><br /><b>[Barkley says that the new direction under the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> legend has increased competition for places during pre-season]</b> The likes of Tammy, Mason have scored goals in pre-season and you can see the hunger in them. I was the same. I went out on loan and then I got my chance at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. When you get your chance, you just have to be ready and believe that chances will come, that you are going to step forward and produce. When you have that extra bit of quality, you can see the belief. The players that are getting a chance now are really confident lads. They believe that they’re meant to be here. You can see that in the training sessions and the games. I’m sure they will get opportunities during the season and will show what they’re capable of. It’s <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and you will always have competition for places here. You have to work hard and your chances will come</p>

  <p><b>[Ross Barkley has shed some light on <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>’s man-management skills, with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s new boss having asked the England international to take more risks on the pitch]</b> As a kid at nine or 10 you get stickers of players, so to go from watching him on Match of the Day to playing with him for England and then have him as a manager… time flies! It shows anything can happen in football. He’s been saying ‘express yourself on the pitch, take risks, don’t be too safe, shoot, try to create chances’. It’s something I can do and it’s what he has been putting into me in training and the pre-season games. I’ve seen what he was capable of as a player when I played with him for England a few years ago. He has brought the work ethic that he had as a player to his management - we have been working really hard.<br /><br />You don’t want to play in your shell. You want to be playing off the cuff sometimes to take chances and make something happen. That’s what players like myself, Mason, Ruben when he’s back… that’s what we want to express on the pitch. As a player you can’t be too worried if you take a risk and whether it’s not going to come off. You have to try to make things happen and, hopefully, that’ll start happening on the pitch. I’m looking forward to taking my chances. All managers are like that but some managers like discipline as well, which I have added from previous managers. It’s about getting the right balance and knowing on the pitch when is the right time to take risks</p>

  <p><b>[Ross Barkley says he is <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s designated penalty taker and insists he will take the next one the club are awarded despite his 87th-minute miss against <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> on Tuesday]</b> When I’m on the pitch, I’ll take the penalty. Obviously I didn’t execute it right but everybody misses penalties. I didn’t score the goal but I felt confident. If there was another penalty in the game, I would have been confident to take it. You can miss penalties. It’s not the end of the world. We’ve got five more games in the group stage that we’re aiming to win but this didn’t go our way<br /><br /><b>[<a href="willian.html">Willian</a> and <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> have also taken high-profile penalties in the past and Barkley has no hard feelings over the reaction of his team-mates before he stepped up]</b> We’ve got a lot of good penalty-takers in the squad and on a sheet in the changing rooms it says I’m on penalties if I’m on the pitch. Otherwise, it’s <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a>. But as with all players, sometimes you feel confident to take them on but we can all miss one. They are confident to take the penalties as well but I practice them every day. I don’t miss them in training and in pre-season I scored penalties. I’ve missed penalties before when I was at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and it is one of those things. I’m gutted that I missed but these things happen. It <b>[the conversations with his team-mates before the penalty]</b> was more like ‘good luck with the penalty’ type of thing. They were encouraging me and would have been willing to take the penalty as well but I felt confident. It was a disappointing night all round. Our first game in the group stage, our first game at home as well, it was disappointing. Missing a penalty is not the end of the world for me. It is a disappointing result not coming away with the three points and disappointing for me not executing the penalty right. I felt confident that I would have but for me, it is to focus on the next game and to get three points at the weekend.</p>

The young lads have done really well for England and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> youth teams over the years, winning trophies. They have got the winning mentality this club needs. For them to come into the side at such a young age and do so well, it’s great times for the club, the fans and the future as well. I’m not surprised at how they’ve done, because you can see the quality they have got. Some were out on loan and proved to the manager and his assistant, <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a> who has worked with the younger lads, what they’re capable of. It’s the perfect timing for the young lads to show what they can do, and they have done that since the start of the season<br /><br /><b>[Barkley thinks <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Hudson-Odoi</a> is now ready to make an impact with 90 minutes under his belt]</b> Last season he was growing with the minutes he was getting, and the goals he was getting. The more he was on the pitch you could see he was getting better and better. He had a little setback but now he’s back and looking extra sharp. He has been putting the extra yards in in training. On Wednesday he was a bit frustrated because he could have had a hat-trick, but it was good to see him back playing the full 90 and scoring as well</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> midfielder Ross Barkley has revealed that he was forced to train with just his left foot for a number of weeks after suffering chips to two bones in his right]</b> It felt great to just be back on the pitch. I haven’t played for a while. After I injured my foot, I had a setback for a while. I was in pain until probably a couple of weeks ago when I became pain-free.<br /><br />I have put in a lot of hard work and I was grateful to get a start today and get a goal. It is tough to be on the side watching games. You want to be on the pitch. But I had trouble. I had fine chips on two parts of my bone in my foot so it was really painful. I just had to bide my time and keep working hard. I couldn’t really kick the ball with my right foot so I was training with my left. But now I feel good and I am ready to get back in the side and keep working hard.<br /><br />I was trying my hardest to pass the ball in training with my right foot but it was that painful I just had to train with my left foot. Some days I would have to come out of training because it would be really painful, but for the last two or three weeks, I have been pain-free so I have been putting in the extra yards.<br /><br />After training, I have been doing double sessions fitness-wise so I could stay on top of it with me not getting games for a while. Hopefully, I can kick on from here and get back in the side by continuing to work hard in training. Hopefully with a goal I have put that thought back in the manager’s mind.<br /><br />I have got to keep scoring with every chance I get. Last time I went away with England I scored a couple and then I came back and got a setback. So it was frustrating from that side of it. But to come back and score today is good for my confidence. I will come back into training on Tuesday ready to kick on again<br /><br /><b>[Ross Barkley is hopeful that his club form ahead of the spring internationals can see him continue in midfield for the <a href="fa.html">Three Lions</a>]</b> From the last camp I spoke with him because I got called up to the England squad. I was struggling and it wasn’t beneficial for me to go with the England squad to just get treatment and not play any games. It was more about getting myself right and I have been feeling right for the past couple of weeks now. I was back in the side today and hopefully, he will have seen I have scored - which he probably will - and then we have got a lot of games until the next England meet-up. But the main thing is to focus on helping us progress <b>[at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> and get our home form much better so we can kick on and get higher up the table</p>

You’ve got to be aware of your surroundings when you let your hair down, for any player out there. You’ve just got to be aware of what’s around you. It’s just more about being with the right company and in private.<br /><br />When you play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, you’re a high profile player, so it’s about keeping low-key and switched on. When you’re on holiday or away, you need the right people around you. I’ve made that mistake and it won’t happen again but I’m sure it’ll happen to young players in the future. We all make mistakes but it’s about being aware. It’s that 10 seconds when you’re not looking like a professional when you’ve got to let your hair down but then you can’t forget about your job.<br /><br />It was unfortunate of me to get caught in that position and it will happen many times to players over the years because you know what phones are like nowadays. I am just keeping my head down and it won’t happen again. It is <b>[a bit sad that footballers don’t have privacy]</b>. Back in the day, players wouldn’t have to think about things like that but you can’t forget people want to make you look bad.
