We have a lot of talent within the group and a lot of experienced players who help us. I really feel an important part of this squad and game by game hoping to stamp my authority on the pitch. Now our main aim to is go to Lithuania and get the job done there.</p>

  <p><b>[Ross Barkley says he was told by Antonio Conte that Chelsea’s system is perfect for him]</b> The manager said the formation the team plays is perfect for me, so now I’ve got to train well and perform well to be in the team. My main focus is to be giving it 100 per cent every day in training and our games to show him what I can do. It is a big change, I’m coming out of my comfort zone. This is all new to me, London, but I’m ready for it. I think I’m going to adjust really well. It was a big decision to leave Everton and it took me a lot of time to think over. I felt this was the right thing for me, to help me improve.<br /><br /><b>[On Paul Gascoigne and Michael Ballack]</b> I’ve got similarities to them, because I like to arrive in the box and score goals like Ballack did, and I use both my feet and like to take players on as Gazza did, but I’m not them. I’m Ross Barkley and I’ve got to create a better version of the player I am and show what I can do, not try to be like someone else. That’s part of what I hope I can achieve here, to make people aware of who I am as a player and show everyone what I can do</p>

  <p><b>[Ross Barkley says he is fitter than ever and ready to become a regular starter at Chelsea]</b> I arrived with a long-term injury, I have done everything I could perfectly. I felt strong towards the end of the season and then I went off in the off-season, worked hard, came back and all the hard work I did last season - I didn’t play many games because of a few niggles and that long-term injury - I feel really good now and I know the hard work will pay off. I relaxed for a couple of weeks, just rest, then worked hard with the strength and conditioning coach. A lot of running, a lot of ball work and just getting my body right for the season. Yes, it was tough. You know, with the type of injury that I had you do get little niggles. I had a few little injuries from recovering and getting used to working hard and getting my body right again. But I didn’t see it as a waste of time, from the time that I joined in January because I got my body feeling better than it has ever felt before. I feel like I have been here for a long time now and I get on well with all the lads. During the off-season I just got myself really fit just to give myself a head start. When you have got a new manager you have got to impress and get used to what he wants really quickly. That has been my approach.<br /><br /><b>[I want]</b> to keep learning, the new manager obviously has a different style of play to our previous manager. There will be freedom because you have three men in the midfield. Going forward, getting close to the box, having shots, trying to create, obviously we have to be disciplined and organised without the ball. Being well drilled, it’s a new style and we are all learning day-by-day. Every day just taking all the information from the manager, Gianfranco Zola as well, step by step getting a lot of game time. Scoring goals, creating goals, towards the end of the season there will hopefully be a prize at the end with a trophy or a couple of trophies. We will see how it goes, but one step at a time, I’m hoping to start the season really strong<br /><br />To earn a regular spot at Chelsea is my main focus. If I do well at Chelsea, then the national team will take care of itself. Chelsea is a massive club, you aim to win the Premier League or are challenging for trophies with the aim to win everything. It will take care of itself if you keep producing the goods on the pitch, so I am focusing on what I can do for my club right now, but one of my goals is to get back in the England set up and to keep progressing. I am working day-by-day, giving it my all and I am ready to kick on this season. It is very exciting and you see with the younger age groups that they are doing very well as well. They are winning World Cups and doing very well with developing players differently now. That approach through the younger age groups lets you see the quality and confidence that they have got to give in the future. In the next World Cup, or even next Euros, there may be even more talent mixed in with experience and going forward that’s really exciting. I kept in touch with a few of the lads and I was wishing them well. I have been seeing the progress that the team has made and I have been in one squad under Gareth Southgate and I have seen the direction that the team is going in. They have really improved in the last couple of years, you can see that it has been out with the old and in with the new. There has been a progression. Unfortunately, with my injuries and everything, I wasn’t able really to leave an impression to get back into the team but I will work hard and do what I can this season and hopefully I will be back in the set up</p>

  <p><b>[Barkley watched Napoli highlights to catch up with new Chelsea boss Sarri]</b> His style of play… for any manager I’ll play any style of play, but for the manager it’s my type of style. He’s an attacking manager, he wants exciting football, to be high up the pitch pressing, scoring goals and being exciting, scoring a lot of goals, team performances all round. Being on the side that lost, it’s not really enjoyable. We can take a lot of positives out of the game. We’re still learning and getting to know the new manager’s way of playing. Day by day we’re getting used to it in training. We can look at today as how far we’re going to come from.<br /><br />Next week the season’s starting and we’re going to go into the season really strong. For me, I played 90 minutes for the first time for a long time today. I felt really good out there and game by game I’m going to be feeling much stronger going into the season. That’s a boost. With a new manager coming in, I’ve started every pre-season game and today’s game, so that’s a positive for me. I’m just be to keep doing what I can day by day in training, giving 100 per cent, and then on game day hoping to give him performances he wants and the team want.<br /><br />I’ve watched clips <b>[of Napoli]</b> just to see the way they played, out of possession and in possession. I’ve seen how they played last season, against Manchester City last season in the Champions League, a really exciting team, one-twos all over the pitch, one and two-touch football. Goals from all around the pitch, exciting football. They were unfortunate not to win the league last season. The manager, from how the manager comes across, he’s a winner. He was disappointed with how things went today. We’ve got a long season ahead and a lot of trophies to play for.<br /><br />It’s a big season for me. Last season I signed here. I had a few injuries and I signed off with a long-term injury. But that’s behind me now. I’m feeling really strong now and I’m sure when the season starts next week I’ll be ready to go. You miss the feeling on the pitch, you miss hitting the back of the net, you miss the winning feeling. That’s what drives me. Just miss being out on the grass. As a young lad it’s been your dream to play football and you get injuries and you’ve got to respond well to them and work really hard, because it’s your dream to be on the pitch. That’s down to what the manager thinks <b>[whether I start or not]</b>. I’ve done what I can in training and in the games. I’ll keep improving with more games. Today’s my first 90 minutes in more than a year. Just game by game I’ll be feeling strong and show what I can do<br /><br />The results I’m sure will come early doors because we’re good players and we know what we’ve got to do to get three points. Unfortunately today we didn’t do what we needed to do. The manager’s style, we’re taking day by day in training. We’re working really hard and getting used to it now. If you look back to now in three months, you’ll see a big difference. You’ve just got to be patient with getting to know the new manager’s way. We’ll keep learning</p>

  <p><b>[Ross Barkley believes he is capable of delivering 20 goals a season for Chelsea]</b> He’s someone to look at with the success he achieved for the club and for himself. I’ve played with Frank and I saw what he was like around England, and how much of a top professional he was. He was an idol of mine from when I was a young lad, watching Champions League games and seeing the goals he scored. If I could achieve half of what he did here, then that would be a success<br /><br />I believe I can hit the 20 goals a season mark. It’s a lot, but it’s achievable. You see Lamps do it and Stevie G <b>[Steven Gerrard]</b>, and <b>[Paul]</b> Scholes. It’s just starting in training first, scoring goals there and practising every day</p>

He’s one of the best players in the world and he shows it. He’s been showing it for the last five or six years and he is establishing himself in the top three players in the world.

  <p><b>[Chelsea midfielder Ross Barkley has revealed his frustration at having to watch the 2018 World Cup from the sidelines]</b> It was frustrating for me because England means the world to me, to play for your country, but these things happen in football and you have to react and work hard to get your rewards, which I am doing. I was proud to see the lads do really well and see how proud the country was of the boys. After where I was at, I had had a difficult season through injuries and I had a few niggles but kept a positive mind. I had a strong pre-season and things are going well for me now<br /><br />All of the midfielders will be thinking that. It is a challenge for us to go out there and produce the goods as Gazza did when he was a player. We have a lot of talent in the squad that can produce magic at any point in the game and we have a confident bunch of lads and there is a lot of talent coming through<br /><br /><b>[Barkley was part of the 2014 World Cup squad as a 20-year-old]</b> I’m over the moon to be back, I feel like it’s been a long time coming but I feel like I have worked hard over the last couple of years and that it’s fully deserved that I am back here. I feel like I have matured as a person and understood what football is, and taken little details on as I have done now under the manager <b>[Maurizio Sarri]</b>. Things are going really well for me now and I’m fully focused on improving and kicking on</p>

  <p><b>[Ross Barkley always believed that 2018-19 would be the year he made his mark at Chelsea]</b> I’m in a totally different frame of mind this season. When I first arrived, I was excited to join a massive club, with the ambition to achieve success. But I came here with a long-term injury, so I had to focus on just getting my body right and getting back to normal. Then I had a few niggles, so it was a bit stop-start. I knew then that this season was going to be my time, and that I would be more like a new signing this summer than I was in January, just because of where I was at physically. When you first come back from a long-term injury, you’re just trying to get your body in order and trying to get back into the training and match routine. That’s why it was important for me to get a strong pre-season under my belt, because it gives you the right platform. I’m back on track and I hope I’ll continue to improve, score goals and get assists.<br /><br />It’s brilliant how the team’s started. We’ve adapted really well to the manager’s system and started the season on fire. We’re unbeaten and that shows how well we’ve adjusted and also the manager’s style of play is really exciting for the players. So, you’re looking forward to games as a chance to take what you’ve learned on the training pitch onto the big stage. We have got the players who have achieved success before and we believe we are capable of doing that</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea midfielder Ross Barkley is bracing himself for a hostile reception from Everton fans when he faces his former club]</b> I don’t think it will be the best. There might be a few who might say a few good things. I achieved my dream of playing for Everton, from a young age I always dreamed of scoring for Everton. In my living room I always used to tell my mum ‘one day I’ll score for Everton’ and when that happened it was unbelievable for me. I tried to achieve success there but sometimes these things happen in football. I’m not nervous, I’m excited to play against my former club and team-mates - I understand how some of them play, so that could be an advantage for me. On the day I might get a few nerves as it will feel a bit strange. I’m looking forward to catching up with some of the staff there who I used to get on really well with.<br /><br />Coming to Chelsea was a big challenge for me. I was approaching 25 and I felt looking back I could have improved a lot more <b>[at Everton]</b>. At Chelsea I knew I’d improve a lot quicker around better players, world-class players<br /><br />I was very young when I got my tattoos. I was 16 when I got my full sleeve - I rushed into it. Over the years I didn’t really like having them. My mum told me at the time she wasn’t sure about me getting them and that I rushed into them - and she still says that to this day. I’ve been getting them removed over the last couple of years. I’ll be 25 in a couple of weeks. I feel like I’ve matured over the last couple of years, dealing with injuries and moving to Chelsea. I’ve had to push myself and I’ve really matured</p>

  <p><b>[Eden Hazard has been hailed as magical by Chelsea team-mate Ross Barkley]</b> The way we were playing, you could see we had the belief that a goal was going to come. When Eden got that goal, he can produce magic moments like that. Credit to him and the team who got stuck in. He’s playing really well. He’s up there with the best in the world. He can produce goals like that out of nothing and to play with a player like that is fantastic. He’s relaxed, but once he’s on the training pitch he’s magical. He plays with enjoyment. He scores goals and creates goals. He’s laid-back, but on game day he’s ready to make things happen.<br /><br />Tottenham are a good side but we come into it with confidence and knowing what we need to do to reach the final. We will train really hard. That will be in the back of our minds <b>[Chelsea’s defeat at Wembley]</b> because they are our rivals and we want to beat our rivals.

Everyone in the squad understands that he (Hazard) was a great player, but he is gone. He has new challenges now and we have to replace his goals and create the chances. We have that much quality in the squad we will all step up to the plate. Last season when Eden wasn’t playing we still won games, we still created chances. We know he is an exceptional player, but we have exceptional players in the squad. We have young ones that will step up and produce the goods as well.<br /><br />We have Callum coming back from injury and we have signed <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a>, he is an exceptional talent. We have wingers who can create from tight positions, players who can shoot from distance and strikers - young and experienced - who are hungry for goals. We have all come back from pre-season hungry, especially under the new manager. We are all working hard every day in training and doing double sessions all the time, getting ready for the new season. There is a lot we can improve on - you could see that against Reading as we conceded three goals. We scored four so there were positives, too, and I am looking forward to the season<br /><br /><b>[Barkley played with <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> for England and acknowledge that his new boss was one of his idols as he came through the <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> academy]</b> Yes, he was one of my idols as a kid. I was always watching Match of the Day as a kid, you always saw him every week scoring goals. That’s what you like to see and now he is our manager, it is brilliant for all the players in the squad. He’s got all the respect from the players for the player he was and the person he is. Every day, whether it be around the building or on the training pitch, he is speaking to everyone trying to give them tips on how to improve.<br /><br />He will help all the midfielders. He is a legend of the game, the highest goal-scoring midfielder in <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> history, so we are going to take all he has to give us and the experience he has from the past on board. We will keep improving and he will help us. It is a new manager and a new formation - we’ve had to adapt to the different systems we are going to play. <b>[It’s about being]</b> hungry for goals, just have the desire to get in the box. At the minute I have been playing a bit further forward, to think like a striker, especially as a No. 10, but try to help out defensively and work hard off the ball<br /><br /><b>[Barkley says that the new direction under the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> legend has increased competition for places during pre-season]</b> The likes of Tammy, Mason have scored goals in pre-season and you can see the hunger in them. I was the same. I went out on loan and then I got my chance at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. When you get your chance, you just have to be ready and believe that chances will come, that you are going to step forward and produce. When you have that extra bit of quality, you can see the belief. The players that are getting a chance now are really confident lads. They believe that they’re meant to be here. You can see that in the training sessions and the games. I’m sure they will get opportunities during the season and will show what they’re capable of. It’s <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and you will always have competition for places here. You have to work hard and your chances will come</p>

It shows anything can happen in football. He’s been saying ‘express yourself on the pitch, take risks, don’t be too safe, shoot, try to create chances’. It’s something I can do and it’s what he has been putting into me in training and the pre-season games. I’ve seen what he was capable of as a player when I played with him for England a few years ago. He has brought the work ethic that he had as a player to his management - we have been working really hard.<br /><br />You don’t want to play in your shell. You want to be playing off the cuff sometimes to take chances and make something happen. That’s what players like myself, Mason, Ruben when he’s back… that’s what we want to express on the pitch. As a player you can’t be too worried if you take a risk and whether it’s not going to come off. You have to try to make things happen and, hopefully, that’ll start happening on the pitch. I’m looking forward to taking my chances. All managers are like that but some managers like discipline as well, which I have added from previous managers.

They are confident to take the penalties as well but I practice them every day. I don’t miss them in training and in pre-season I scored penalties. I’ve missed penalties before when I was at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and it is one of those things. I’m gutted that I missed but these things happen. It <b>[the conversations with his team-mates before the penalty]</b> was more like ‘good luck with the penalty’ type of thing. They were encouraging me and would have been willing to take the penalty as well but I felt confident. It was a disappointing night all round. Our first game in the group stage, our first game at home as well, it was disappointing. Missing a penalty is not the end of the world for me. It is a disappointing result not coming away with the three points and disappointing for me not executing the penalty right. I felt confident that I would have but for me, it is to focus on the next game and to get three points at the weekend.</p>

The young lads have done really well for England and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> youth teams over the years, winning trophies. They have got the winning mentality this club needs. For them to come into the side at such a young age and do so well, it’s great times for the club, the fans and the future as well. I’m not surprised at how they’ve done, because you can see the quality they have got. Some were out on loan and proved to the manager and his assistant, <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a> who has worked with the younger lads, what they’re capable of.

On Wednesday he was a bit frustrated because he could have had a hat-trick, but it was good to see him back playing the full 90 and scoring as well</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> midfielder Ross Barkley has revealed that he was forced to train with just his left foot for a number of weeks after suffering chips to two bones in his right]</b> It felt great to just be back on the pitch. I haven’t played for a while. After I injured my foot, I had a setback for a while. I was in pain until probably a couple of weeks ago when I became pain-free.<br /><br />I have put in a lot of hard work and I was grateful to get a start today and get a goal. It is tough to be on the side watching games. You want to be on the pitch. But I had trouble. I had fine chips on two parts of my bone in my foot so it was really painful. I just had to bide my time and keep working hard. I couldn’t really kick the ball with my right foot so I was training with my left. But now I feel good and I am ready to get back in the side and keep working hard.<br /><br />I was trying my hardest to pass the ball in training with my right foot but it was that painful I just had to train with my left foot. Some days I would have to come out of training because it would be really painful, but for the last two or three weeks, I have been pain-free so I have been putting in the extra yards.<br /><br />After training, I have been doing double sessions fitness-wise so I could stay on top of it with me not getting games for a while. Hopefully, I can kick on from here and get back in the side by continuing to work hard in training. Hopefully with a goal I have put that thought back in the manager’s mind.<br /><br />I have got to keep scoring with every chance I get. Last time I went away with England I scored a couple and then I came back and got a setback. So it was frustrating from that side of it. But to come back and score today is good for my confidence. I will come back into training on Tuesday ready to kick on again<br /><br /><b>[Ross Barkley is hopeful that his club form ahead of the spring internationals can see him continue in midfield for the <a href="fa.html">Three Lions</a>]</b> From the last camp I spoke with him because I got called up to the England squad. I was struggling and it wasn’t beneficial for me to go with the England squad to just get treatment and not play any games. It was more about getting myself right and I have been feeling right for the past couple of weeks now. I was back in the side today and hopefully, he will have seen I have scored - which he probably will - and then we have got a lot of games until the next England meet-up. But the main thing is to focus on helping us progress <b>[at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> and get our home form much better so we can kick on and get higher up the table</p>

You’ve got to be aware of your surroundings when you let your hair down, for any player out there. You’ve just got to be aware of what’s around you. It’s just more about being with the right company and in private.<br /><br />When you play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, you’re a high profile player, so it’s about keeping low-key and switched on. When you’re on holiday or away, you need the right people around you. I’ve made that mistake and it won’t happen again but I’m sure it’ll happen to young players in the future. We all make mistakes but it’s about being aware. It’s that 10 seconds when you’re not looking like a professional when you’ve got to let your hair down but then you can’t forget about your job.<br /><br />It was unfortunate of me to get caught in that position and it will happen many times to players over the years because you know what phones are like nowadays. I am just keeping my head down and it won’t happen again. It is <b>[a bit sad that footballers don’t have privacy]</b>. Back in the day, players wouldn’t have to think about things like that but you can’t forget people want to make you look bad. I am a very professional player but that 10 seconds doesn’t make you look professional. That’s just the way football is now with phones.

Yes, he definitely <b>[gets it]</b>. <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> was one of the best players in the world and I am sure when he was a player he liked to let his hair down at the right times.
