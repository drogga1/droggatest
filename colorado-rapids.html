  <p><b>[Tim Howard has picked up a three-match suspension after an incident with a fan following the Colorado Rapids’ 3-1 loss to Sporting Kansas City on April 9]</b> Tim Howard made an unfortunate and regrettable mistake for which he is being disciplined by MLS. While this is out of character for Tim, we do not condone these actions. We accept the league’s decision and look forward to moving past this.</p>

  <p><b>[The Colorado Rapids’s <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> home game against Montreal Impact will go on as scheduled on Saturday, but the post-game fireworks display has been cancelled for a rather unusual reason. In a news release issued on Friday, the Rapids explained the decision as being down to ‘the confirmed presence of plague-infested fleas affecting prairie dog colonies’ in the area surrounding Dick’s Sporting Goods Park. The Plague, known as the bubonic plague, killed an estimated 50 million people in the Middle Ages]</b> Our highest priority is the health and safety of our fans, staff, and local community. We will continue to monitor the situation in the lead up to the Rapids home game with Montreal Impact on Saturday at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park</p>
