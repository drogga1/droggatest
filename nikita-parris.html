  <p><b>[England international Nikita Parris has completed her move from Manchester City to Lyon on a free transfer]</b> I’m so excited, it’s the biggest club team in the world for women’s football. There’s no better way to kick on my career than to play for this team. I’m so excited to play with some of the best players in the world and show what I can do on the football pitch against some of the greatest teams as well. I was torn because obviously you want to make sure that you pick the right team but ultimately when Lyon come in for you it’s not a team you turn down and I knew if I was to turn it down it would be a massive regret.</p>

  <p><b>[Explaining why she held up four fingers in celebrating her strike in England’s tournament opener]</b> It was for me, <a href="mary-earps.html">Mary Earps</a>, <a href="toni-duggan.html">Toni Duggan</a> and Abbie McManus. We’re the four musketeers. We’re constantly together and they’ve helped me throughout my journey with England and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and I appreciate them so much. Moving forward I’m going to need them more than ever.<br /><br /><b>[The second half was less flair and more grit as Scotland came back into the game]</b> <b>[After half time]</b> Jennifer Beattie went deeper and the full-back got tighter, they tried to limit my running, but ultimately, I just had to try and pop in the space and that came in between the lines. As they work you out, you’ve got to try something different and that’s going to happen throughout the World Cup. I thrive off challenge. There’s so much more to come from me. I’d probably give myself a six and a half or a seven <b>[out of 10 against Scotland]</b><br /><br /><b>[Nikita Parris bragged after the Scotland game - but she wasn’t talking about her goal, or that nutmeg]</b> Did you see that out there? I’m excited what the World Cup will bring but I don’t think my individual performance will dictate whether we do well or we don’t do well in this tournament. It’s about the team and ultimately I will fight for each and every one of my team-mates</p>

  <p><b>[Nikita Parris has no doubts in herself despite missing a second consecutive penalty in England’s quarter-final win over Norway]</b> When you step up and take a penalty it’s 50/50 but you’ve got to back yourself. The keeper made a fantastic save and I think she’s done her homework on me, to be fair. I need to practise on the training pitch as I’ve got to do better on the spot. It’s two penalties and two misses - it’s not good enough in my opinion for my standards as a player. I’m disappointed in that aspect but I’m happy with my performance. I’ve got mixed emotions.<br /><br /><b>[On whether she would take the next one]</b> For sure, I’ll step up<br /><br /><b>[When asked if she would speak to the psychologist]</b> Talk to the psychologist for what? I don’t think I need to talk to a psychologist. I’m confident in myself. It’s not a case of I’ve missed a penalty and I’m down. I’ve just dominated the left-back for 80 or 90 minutes, I’m confident in myself and in my own ability<br /><br /><b>[Speaking about her partnership with <a href="lucy-bronze.html">Lucy Bronze</a>]</b> Over the years we’ve worked on it. She played for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and then she went to <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> but with England we’ve always worked with each other. I just know where she’s going to be. With Jill Scott too. We talk a lot about me and Lucy, but Jill is unbelievable. She’s the reason we’re so fluent because she allows us so much space. We know that when we go forward we’ve always got her to back us up. She’s been phenomenal this tournament. I’m so thankful to have her to the side of me, Lucy behind me, <b>[<a href="ellen-white.html">Ellen White</a>]</b> in front of me. Then I’ve also got <a href="steph-houghton.html">Steph Houghton</a>, <a href="james-milner.html">Millie</a> Bright, Demi Stokes, <a href="toni-duggan.html">Toni Duggan</a> on the other side, Beth Mead when she comes, Rach Daly, we have so much talent and strength and depth in this team. Then we’ve got <b>[<a href="karen-bardsley.html">Karen Bardsley</a>]</b>, she’s made some unbelievable saves. I’m so happy to be a part of this team<br /><br /><b>[And the winger believes it’s exactly what the Lionesses deserve for their approach]</b> Coming into this tournament we were brave enough to say we wanted to win it and we’ve put our best foot forward in every match. We’ve battled away and Norway had good possession, they could have punished us at times for our sloppy mistakes but we stuck together and we knew the game plan. I thought we executed it in every sense. It’s absolutely amazing. I actually can’t comprehend it like now. I’m absolutely buzzing</p>

  <p><b>[Nikita Parris says she has no idea of the impact England are having at home with their Women’s World Cup success - despite phonecalls from her mum]</b> I’ve tried to limit myself on social media. Just concentrate ultimately on what happens on the pitch and how the team plays. I haven’t had any sense of how it is at home. I call my mum and she says, ‘oh <b>[you]</b> are all over the TV!’. She can’t believe how much we have impacted at the World Cup and how much back at home it has been a massive influence. Long may that continue. Women’s football is one the rise and I hope young girls across the world - never mind just in England - are inspired to take up the sport, any sport in general, whatever they fall in love with. That’s all we’ve done. We’ve taken up a sport and fallen in love with it and worked hard to make sure we got to the top. Any young girl across the world can do that.<br /><br /><b>[Their performances prompted <a href="phil-neville.html">Phil Neville</a> to describe his players badass women]</b> Why shouldn’t we think we can’t be badder than <b>[the United States]</b> when we went to the She Believes and we won it? And we went toe to toe with them? You know? We beat America in the past. We beat them 1-0 under <a href="mark-sampson.html">Mark Sampson</a>. Why shouldn’t we think we can beat them? Why do we have to come to this tournament semi-final and think ‘oh it’s America?’ Nobody fears America. Nobody fears Germany. Nobody fears England. They know that on the day, no matter who you are, if you perform and get the best out of each and every player on the field of play, you’ll win the game. I don’t fear America and I don’t think my teammates do. We’ve played them in the past in She Believes. We went up against them<br /><br /><b>[Reminded of the USA’s 13-0 victory over Thailand in the group stages, Parris remained bullish]</b> No disrespect to Thailand but 13-0 is against Thailand. I don’t want to disrespect any other team you know, but that 13-0 against Thailand. They did show the ruthless part of them at times. I think Thailand struggled against them - don’t get me wrong. But we’re not Thailand</p>

  <p><b>[Nikita Parris, the England and <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> winger, talks passionately about being a role model for the people in her birthplace of Toxteth, an inner-city area of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> Many people outside of Toxteth would call it deprived but for me it was home. When I go back, I want to make sure that the young girls see an opportunity and a light. More brands will come into the women’s game and want to invest but it’s important that you don’t just sign up to any brand, but one that represents you as a person. Visa is innovative. It helps change the landscape of not just sport, but people’s lives in many areas that people might not have even heard of and in many countries that people might not have even heard of. That definitely resonates with me. It’s important that you have brands like Visa to be able to put a spotlight <b>[on the game]</b> and show that it’s our time. The time is now. It’s not in five years, six years, it’s right now. Let’s make change, now</p>

  <p><b>[Visa signed a seven-year deal with <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> to sponsor all of their women’s competitions last December]</b> Women have to feel empowered. They have to feel like they belong somewhere. Visa shows them that they matter. Visa is innovative. It helps change the landscape of not just sport, but people’s lives in many areas that might not have even heard of and in many countries that people might not have even heard of.

  <p><b>[Nikita Parris was compelled to apologise following a period of self-reflection in light of the death of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement which is encouraging people to speak out against racism]</b> It showed a lack of empathy, understanding and ignorance by singling out a voice who needed an ear to listen and a support system to help. After a lot of growth, maturity and education I am now able to understand how I have been part of the problem which I aim to fight and eradicate</p>
