  <p><b>[Real Madrid’s crisis will end if they beat Barcelona on Sunday]</b> I’ve worked with Lopetegui in Rayo Vallecano, and during this period we both improved in our professional lives. He improved as a coach, and me as a player. I was 17 at that time, but I think that he is living a different thing now. It’s hard to coach a team like Real Madrid, where there is very high pressure, very demanding fans and you need to win all the games. When you don’t get good results, everybody talks about you and say that you are not good. If Real Madrid wins against Barcelona this Sunday, all this crisis will finish. Winning a Clasico is something very important. These games can give you extra motivation and boost your self-confidence. I think that winning against Barcelona will make things better for Real Madrid, but losing that game will create much more problems for the club<br /><br /><b>[Negredo is currently playing for Al-Nasr in the United Arab Emirates]</b> I’m happy. It’s a new experience for me and my family, and it’s a new opportunity for me to know a new league and a new culture. I’m happy to be here, and glad that a club like An-Nasr showed their interest in signing me for a long period of time. I’m learning from my team-mates and from the new league<br /><br />In my first game here, the weather was so hot. In the warm up, I was sweating from everywhere, and that was the most difficult thing I’ve experienced since arriving here. It took me four games to adapt to the weather, but I’m much better and happy now. In football, I think it’s very similar to what I’ve experienced in my previous teams, but the most different thing here is the culture. I’ve seen new things here, like players praying during half time. It’s different from what I know, but I respect it. It’s the same for the other players coming from outside the country. That’s the most shocking thing I’ve experienced since arriving here, but I’m used to it now<br /><br />I didn’t know much about Al-Nasr before joining them. I was playing in Europe and we don’t talk a lot about football in UAE there. I heard some people talking about it, like Fran Yeste, although he played for our rival Al Wasl. I don’t know if there were real offers from other clubs in KSA, but the one that reached my representative is the offer from Al-Nasr. Besiktas had some financial problems, and I was chosen to leave, but it was difficult to make a decision</p>

  <p><b>[Alvaro Negredo has suggested that Fernandinho is one of Manchester City’s most important players]</b> Fernandinho is a very good friend of mine. He is a player you find everywhere in the pitch, with good quality to manage the ball. He recovers many balls for his team and that makes him a very complete player. I think that replacing him will be a real problem for the club.<br /><br /><b>[Negredo believes that Pep Guardiola’s men remain one of the favourites to win the European competition]</b> I think that they have the ability to win it this season. There are more teams showing good performances, but I think that Man City are one of the favourites to win the Champions League this season<br /><br /><b>[Manchester City were Negredo’s first club outside of Spain]</b> We are talking about very different cities. Manchester is a big city; wile Middlesbrough is smaller. Middlesbrough was a new promoted team and our target was to avoid the relegation. At Man City, things are different, we played to win the Premier League title and fight for all the trophies we are playing for. They are very different experiences, but I learnt from both</p>

  <p><b>[David Silva sits above Sergio Aguero and has cemented a standing as the best player to have ever represented Manchester City]</b> I like so much Aguero, but my preference is David Silva. People look at the goals; the striker normally draws more passion from the supporters. Aguero scores so many goals. But when you play on the pitch, the striker is important but he doesn’t play alone. For me, David is the best <b>[in City’s history]</b>. When you take one No. 10 with this quality, this vision, for a striker it’s easier. When David takes the ball, you always think ‘his pass will come, it will come to me’.<br /><br />Maybe the striker is more egotistical and it’s always ‘goal, goal, goal’, but David is the player who opens the space when the opponent is closed, always the one with the better solution. When I stayed in Manchester, David was the best. And now he continues to be.<br /><br />Guardiola is maybe in the three best coaches in the world. For the plan on the pitch, the work during the week to prepare for the game, in my opinion he is the best. I speak to the people at Manchester City, and they say he’s the best coach. The football of Guardiola is totally different: always wanting the ball, never losing the ball.<br /><br />They have 65 or 70 per cent possession, and when you recover the ball there is no energy for the counterattack. When you suddenly get the ball it’s so difficult. It was the same in Barcelona when I played them: it was impossible for a striker to run to close every position and then take the ball. For what? It was so hard</p>

  <p><b>[Alvaro Negredo says <a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a> needs assistance]</b> I’m surprised. <a href="erling-haland.html">Erling Haaland</a>’s a player I’ve seen a lot and he’s spectacular. He can strike with both feet and he’s taking advantage of every chance. He’ll keep growing<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> is what Madrid are missing]</b> He could be. He’d be a perfect fit and he could adapt well with Benzema<br /><br />He has a great defence and one of the best midfields in the world but I think the attack is costing them the most. Not <a href="karim-benzema.html">Karim Benzema</a>, <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a> isn’t performing at his expected level because of injury, nor is <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>. They don’t have a lot of goals. Because of <a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a>’s way of playing, they need someone else. He needs another forward by his side. I like him even when he’s not scoring, and I’d put someone closer to him to take advantage of things. He moves into the wings a lot and he needs someone else to arrive. More is expected from <a href="isco.html">Isco</a>, <b>[Luka]</b> <a href="luka-modric.html">Modric</a>, <b>[Toni]</b> <a href="toni-kroos.html">Kroos</a>, <b>[Fede]</b> Valverde <b>[…]</b> then there’s <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> and <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>. I hope he gets back to his best because Madrid need him and I love him<br /><br /><b>[Real thought they had landed a suitable alternative when winning the race for <a href="luka-jovic.html">Luka Jovic</a> in the summer of 2019]</b> It’s hard because he’s not getting the same minutes that he had in Germany. He came from playing all the time to only playing a few minutes. Minutes and confidence are the most important things for a striker, and five or 10 minutes here and there aren’t enough</p>
