  <p><b>[Alvaro Negredo says <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> sits above <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> and has cemented a standing as the best player to have ever represented <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> I like so much <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a>, but my preference is <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a>. People look at the goals; the striker normally draws more passion from the supporters. <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> scores so many goals. But when you play on the pitch, the striker is important but he doesn’t play alone. For me, David is the best <b>[in City’s history]</b>. When you take one No. 10 with this quality, this vision, for a striker it’s easier. When David takes the ball, you always think ‘his pass will come, it will come to me’. Maybe the striker is more egotistical and it’s always ‘goal, goal, goal’, but David is the player who opens the space when the opponent is closed, always the one with the better solution. When I stayed in Manchester, David was the best. And now he continues to be.<br /><br /><b>[The Spaniard added on a fellow countryman]</b> <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> is maybe in the three best coaches in the world. For the plan on the pitch, the work during the week to prepare for the game, in my opinion he is the best. I speak to the people at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, and they say he’s the best coach. The football of <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> is totally different: always wanting the ball, never losing the ball. They have 65 or 70 per cent possession, and when you recover the ball there is no energy for the counterattack. When you suddenly get the ball it’s so difficult. It was the same in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> when I played them: it was impossible for a striker to run to close every position and then take the ball. For what? It was so hard</p>

  <p><b>[Alvaro Negredo says <a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a> needs assistance]</b> I’m surprised. <a href="erling-haland.html">Erling Haaland</a>’s a player I’ve seen a lot and he’s spectacular. He can strike with both feet and he’s taking advantage of every chance. He’ll keep growing<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> is what Madrid are missing]</b> He could be. He’d be a perfect fit and he could adapt well with Benzema<br /><br />He has a great defence and one of the best midfields in the world but I think the attack is costing them the most. Not <a href="karim-benzema.html">Karim Benzema</a>, <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a> isn’t performing at his expected level because of injury, nor is <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>. They don’t have a lot of goals. Because of <a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a>’s way of playing, they need someone else. He needs another forward by his side. I like him even when he’s not scoring, and I’d put someone closer to him to take advantage of things. He moves into the wings a lot and he needs someone else to arrive. More is expected from <a href="isco.html">Isco</a>, <b>[Luka]</b> <a href="luka-modric.html">Modric</a>, <b>[Toni]</b> <a href="toni-kroos.html">Kroos</a>, <b>[Fede]</b> Valverde <b>[…]</b> then there’s <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> and <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>. I hope he gets back to his best because Madrid need him and I love him<br /><br /><b>[Real thought they had landed a suitable alternative when winning the race for <a href="luka-jovic.html">Luka Jovic</a> in the summer of 2019]</b> It’s hard because he’s not getting the same minutes that he had in Germany. He came from playing all the time to only playing a few minutes. Minutes and confidence are the most important things for a striker, and five or 10 minutes here and there aren’t enough</p>
