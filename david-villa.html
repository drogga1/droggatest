  <p><b>[Jose Manuel Villa, David’s father]</b> I was a miner. My parents were miners. My grandparents were miners. It’s in the genes. That was David’s destiny but he loved kicking a ball about in the street. One day I was at work and I got a call. They told me my four-year-old had had an accident. We got there and saw that terrible femur fracture. Me and his mother almost had heart attacks. The doctors said he could end up with one leg different from the other. I’d get home from a long day from work and would entertain him. I’d kick the ball to him and he would - leaning against the wall with his cast - kick it back with his other leg. We didn’t realise it at the time <b>[but that’s what helped him become so good with his left foot]</b>. That day <b>[he made his debut for Sporting Gijon]</b> was tremendously emotional for all of us. I cried like Mary Magdalene</p>

Thanks for everything, Brujo. I love you. Rest in Peace. #SiempreQuini.</p>

  <p><b>[David Villa was the first player signed by New York City FC when the club began play four seasons ago]</b> I think it’s been four very good years. I think it was an experience totally different than any before it, starting a team from zero, being the first player. I think if we look at what the team was when we began, and look at what it is today, obviously the change is significant and I feel like I played my part in that growth<br /><br />I feel a sensation that an era has ended, I’ve done everything I can do here, and now I have to look for new challenges. I’m going to try and keep playing. During these last months I’ve had an internal dialogue with my body and my heart and I believe I can play, at least one more year, at the optimal level I like to play. If not, I wouldn’t feel it and I’d go home, but I’ve decided to keep playing</p>

  <p><b>[How European mega stars are adapting to Japan &amp; the J-League]</b> They showed me from the first moment they want me in their club. After I decided to leave NYCFC, I saw that the team with more desire to sign Villa was Vissel Kobe. It’s not the only reason but it’s the most important reason for me after discussing with my family and with my people, seeing myself in Vissel, talking with friends that I have like Andres or people who were playing and living in Kobe.</p>

I’ve not seen him play a lot, but the Atleti fans will be grateful for him if he works. You can fail, but if you leave everything on the pitch, people are happy. I only had one year with Atletico, and there were ups and downs, I scored 15 goals, we won the league, and the fans still thank me<br /><br />People have commented on my retirement for years but I’m still going. I’m proud to still be playing at this level at my age. I don’t think about the future so much because everything changes so much. I have a contract until December and then I’ll see what happens. This body is responding to me, so I’ll play. When a player retires, it’s because I’ll have a body that’s no longer going. But that’s not my case and I love this sport</p>

It’s a dream to help build this football club in Queens and I couldn’t choose a better location<br /><br />Living with my family in a city with so much culture and history while playing soccer, was an amazing experience and it was exciting to be playing in a country where love of the beautiful game is growing<br /><br /><b>[QBFC plans to operate a youth academy, with Villa closely involved having previously brought his DV7 Academy to the city during his time in New York]</b> It is exciting. We’ve worked for many years on this. The opportunity to start a brand new team in a city like New York, in a borough like Queens, where the people are as passionate about soccer as I am, is huge! We’re very excited about this project and can’t wait to make it a reality.<br /><br />I’m very happy with my career. I’m very proud. I have loved this sport from the beginning of my life. I have tried to do my best to bring this sport everywhere. And the future now is Queens</p>

From then on, I will continue to enjoy football through all the projects that we’re currently developing with DV7 group.

  <p><b>[David Villa believes <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> can lead <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> to Champions League success]</b> For all the coaches and all the big clubs, it’s normal to focus on the Champions League, because it’s the best tournament you can play with a club. Pep is obviously one of the best coaches in the world and obviously the subject of his focus is to win all the trophies. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> have never won this trophy, they’ve been behind in terms of it for many years, so it’s normal they have a big obsession with this kind of trophy. It’s the best tournament you can play as a soccer player, but it’s difficult to win for everyone, not just one or two clubs. It’s very difficult to win, and obviously you need to do a lot of work to win it<br /><br />He’s a great coach. I was with him for two fantastic years at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and he helped me a lot. He will have success wherever he goes. He managed in Spain and was successful, the same in Germany, and now in England. So wherever he manages, he will be successful, because he’s such an amazing coach<br /><br /><a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a>’s amazing, a player with qualities that it’s difficult to find in any other player. He’s fast, he’s really good in one-on-ones, and this year he’s scoring a lot of goals. He’s improving year by year, which is the most important thing for a soccer player. When you’re 18, 19, 20, and playing at the highest level, for teams like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and City, the most important thing is to get better every year. It’s important to grow as a player and every year Sterling has done it. You see he’s a better player day by day, year by year, and he’s still very young.</p>

We were thinking sometimes he’s not shooting well with the right foot, then he scores amazing goals with the right foot. I think that he played as a keeper one time and he did well.
