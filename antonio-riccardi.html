<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Mbappé loved to dribble, to skate past opponents]</b> I never told him to stop. He was the best at that. Why would I have told him to stop? He was the best kid I coached. He is probably the best I will ever coach.<br /><br /><b>[With a couple of days to go before a crucial cup game, Riccardi, <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappé</a>’s former coach, has made a decision. Instead of training on the artificial turf of the Stade Léo Lagrange, where most of Bondy’s training sessions take place, his players will have a session on an uneven dirt field. The ball bounces unpredictably. The surface undulates wildly. Squalls of dust kick into the air]</b> This is where it is the hardest to play. sSo this is where they learn the most<br /><br />They all have in mind what Kylian did. Kylian is the most straightforward example for them. He is their own star: He did what they can do, he changed in the same dressing room, he trained on the same pitch. He was here just a few years ago, doing what they are doing now<br /><br /><b>[Bondy has been swamped by youngsters hoping to enroll in the years since <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappé</a> broke through, believing they can follow his path]</b> Too often, the negative perception of the banlieues acts like a brake for the ambitious youth. Kylian has helped shatter that brake<br /><br /><b>[Riccardi does not believe his job is to teach talent. It is, in part, to hone it and direct it. But it is also to imbue his players with the values they will need whether they make it or not]</b> Punctuality. Manners. Fair play. Authority. Respect for the jersey.</p>
