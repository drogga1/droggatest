  <p><b>[Juventus’ Marko Pjaca set for <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> loan switch]</b> Unfortunately he already had a knee experience and that time it was a shock for him. He has already gone through these difficulties and now I see him more relaxed and calm. Psychologically I see him well. To play with the Primavera is a <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> habit so that the players do well, in my opinion. Because it helps them regain their physical fitness and self-esteem. What moves for the future? Will he leave for sure or maybe he can do the second part of the season with the U-23s? It’s still too early, let’s see later</p>

  <p><b>[Pjaca’s agent, Marko Naletilic says Marko Pjaca hopes to return to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> after his loan spell at Anderlecht ends]</b> Marko has yet another year on loan at Anderlecht. In order to continue the <b>[good]</b> relationship there must be a mutual agreement between both parties. We have a clause that also allows him to have a say. <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> gave him advice for the future and expressed confidence in his potential. It is normal for a player in his situation to hope to return to <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, I would be amazed otherwise. If he were to return to the levels of a few years ago, he certainly could be very useful<br /><br /><a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> were interested, but in the end we chose to accept Anderlecht’s offer. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> preferred to do the boy good by loaning him out. Perhaps it could have been thought that having Pjaca on the bench could be useful given the injuries the team had from February onwards, but in the weeks preceding the situation it was very different. It was essential not to leave <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> in the summer. This was a correct decision, so the club had time to allow the boy to fully recover from his injury. He has great respect for the club that returned him to fitness and has always treated him very well. Then in January we finally found this solution. He was feeling very good at Anderlecht, he was happy to play for them. He immediately managed to get in the team and he was gradually getting more minutes. Unfortunately, in the last game he didn’t start because of a slight injury. Then the Covid-19 pandemic broke out and we all know how it turned out. I had seen him fit, both physically and mentally</p>
