  <p><b>[Velizar Popov said that the Thai Premier League relegation battlers, his new club, are run with a high degree of professionalism]</b> …the club <b>[Sisaket]</b> are ambitious and have very good conditions and facilities for work - a great new training center, a good stadium that’s always full with huge support from the fans, so there’s opportunity to improve the club in every aspect. …Sisaket are more professional in every aspect, starting with the training center, the stadium, management and what I know so far - no financial problems which can influence my work with the players<br /><br />The first target is to win the next match, and after that - to escape the relegation zone.<br /><br />There were some interests but they didn’t end in any concrete offers, so I decided to accept this huge challenge to try my best to help Sisaket FC<br /><br />…there’s a lot in common actually <b>[between Kelantan and Sisaket]</b> - great fans and huge support, which will be our weapon in our battle to escape the relegation. I had a great relationship with Kelantan players and fans - it was a huge honor and great pleasure to work with and for them. I definitely like Malaysia and I look forward to to return there someday!</p>
