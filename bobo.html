  <p><b>[Sydney FC striker Bobo believes the Sky Blues’ stunning A-League campaign won’t be complete without a championship trophy]</b> It’s been a very good season for Sydney and now in the finals we hope to seal this great campaign by winning the grand final. That’s the main goal, get to the semi-final and then become champions - not only premiers but grand final champions.</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney FC striker Bobo doesn’t fear physical football as the Sky Blues prepare to host Perth Glory in Saturday’s A-League semi-final]</b> Football is a physical game. You don’t win games by not being physical.<br /><br />I’m used to it. It doesn’t worry me because in Turkey they were pretty rough as well. It’s no different here to the way they play elsewhere in the world<br /><br />Perth have a good defence. That’s why they are in the semi-finals. But we have to stay focused on the things that have helped us to win many times this season</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney FC striker Bobo believes the team is stronger this season]</b> The motivation is to do the same as last year. We have the Champions League this year too and we are looking forward to making an impact in that. I think we are much stronger this year with the new players added, particularly Adrian - who will be very exciting to watch<br /><br />When I started to play football, I started in the street and played futsal. While playing five-a-side I learned to change direction quickly, the importance of fast movement and creating space in a small area</p>
