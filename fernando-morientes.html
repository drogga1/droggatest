  <p><b>[Former Spain striker Fernando Morientes believes head coach Vicente del Bosque should select Alvaro Morata as his starting forward at Euro 2016]</b> I think that in terms of characteristics right now, Morata is one of the clear candidates for the number nine position. For the players he has around him as well. He’s a penalty area player who plays well high up the pitch. He’s a goalscorer and a complete player. And apart from that he’s a player you can use out wide. He’s very quick and he can go past players. For me, he’s the most important player in attack for the national team. But we can’t forget Aduriz, a player who’s having an exceptional season. Alcacer is another player with very special characteristics inside the box. And Diego Costa, apart from all the other good things he has, is very important as well with his ambition and his personality. It’s very important to have that in a team too<br /><br />Whoever plays of the two will give a lot of solidity to the national team. One <b>[De Gea]</b> has the youth and talent of someone who’s being called one of the best goalkeepers in the world right now and the other <b>[Casillas]</b> has the experience of the huge challenges he’s already faced with the national team. The two European Championships he won, the World Cup, having played with Real Madrid for so many years. That gives Iker an authority that not many goalkeepers have on the world stage</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Morientes says Passion makes <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> the best league in the world]</b> Football of course is much more than what we see on the television, there is much more work done behind the scenes. If you want to improve the local teams, you have start from the grassroots and start slowly. So maybe you need a good manager and a good project rather than sending the Asian players to play in Europe<br /><br /><b>[A legend in his own right, Morientes did share the dressing room with superstars such as <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>, <a href="luis-figo.html">Luis Figo</a>, <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>, <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, and <a href="raul-gonzalez.html">Raul Gonzalez</a> during his time at the <a href="real-madrid.html">Santiago Bernabeu</a>. So, what was it like sharing the dressing room with these guys?]</b> Very normal, at least for me. Maybe you think because of the social media that they are very different but in person and in reality, they are just like you and me<br /><br />There are some things you can’t buy and passion is one of them. When you see this big space (he points to the empty green field below the terrace where we are seated), it is very strange for me as a Spanish person because if it were Spain, this ground would be full of children playing football. If you do something every day, you are naturally going to be good at it and you put a lot of passion in it which probably explains why <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> is so good.<br /><br />As you can understand, weather is a very important element for any player. That’s a major difference between playing in France, Spain, and England because the weather is very different in each of these countries. Also, passion of the people in these countries are very different. Of course, you end up playing with players of certain level who are top class anyway, so the major difference is in the passion, culture, and people of the country that you play in,<br /><br /><b>[The game however has changed since his retirement and so has the role of the striker with the likes of Carlos Bacca in <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> regularly criticized for not providing much in terms of creativity despite having an excellent conversation rate. The former Spain international however begs to differ]</b> Number nine has always been very important in any club because he is the one who scores the goal. At the end of the day, goals are the reason we play the game so it has always been important and the role of the striker will never change</p>

  <p><b>[Morientes not surprised by <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> success as <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> eye greatness]</b> It is not a surprise for me because he is a good manager. He won <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> and the Champions League last year. He also did very good work in Castilla. The most important thing is that he has very good players. That is the most important thing. It is no surprise. He was a footballer, he knows Madrid and the club very well and all the players. He has a strong mentality and is very calm. At Madrid, it is easier than another team <b>[because of the quality]</b><br /><br />When you are coach of Madrid, you are always under pressure. People now speak of <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> as a very good manager. But in the future, when he has five, 10 years of more training, we will see the best of <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>.<br /><br />To win the title two times in a row is very difficult. They would be the first ones in history. At Madrid, they have always had very good teams. The Galacticos, <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>, <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a>, <b>[Luis]</b> <a href="luis-figo.html">Figo</a>, all those players. But in this moment, Madrid have an excellent team<br /><br />Are they the best in history? It is very difficult but they have a very strong team. Madrid always have very good teams. If they won this Champions League, they would be in the best position of history. They are now legends. But if they won the title, we will always remember this team for Spanish and European football</p>

  <p><b>[Former Real Madrid striker Fernando Morientes thinks the Blancos will sign a replacement for Alvaro Morata]</b> For Morata, they might sign new player. The transfer window is open, so there should be many talks. There was a rumor about Mbappe, but he won’t leave Monaco yet, as he is young. I think he wants to gain more experience for one year.<br /><br />For Morata’s position, Cristiano <b>[Ronaldo]</b> or <b>[Karim]</b> Benzema should play. <b>[Marco]</b> Asensio is on the left so he is not the one to fill Morata’s position. What I think is <b>[Madrid manager Zinedine]</b> Zidane would have Benzema and Cristiano as the two forwards. Asensio would play more on left<br /><br /><b>[Zidane is the]</b> same as when he was a player. He is calm and has a very clear vision, and so he is showing that in management. The difference between a player and a manager is that you need to think and study more strategy and <b>[the]</b> technical side, and I think he is doing well</p>

  <p><b>[Former Real Madrid and Liverpool star Fernando Morientes has named Cristiano Ronaldo and Mohamed Salah as the key men ahead of Saturday’s Champions League final]</b> Football is a collective game, so you can have Cristiano Ronaldo, but you need a team which works with him. In my opinion, the key for Madrid in recent years is that all the players around Cristiano Ronaldo have assembled perfectly, like <b>[Luka]</b> Modric and <b>[Toni]</b> Kroos in the midfield, Sergio Ramos as a captain, Marcelo on the left, <b>[Dani]</b> Carvajal on the right … Keylor Navas as well. I think success comes from the team, not just one player, but being able to assemble all of the pieces together with a coach like Zinedine Zidane, who gives harmony to the team which is not an easy thing to do<br /><br />The strength in both teams is in their forwards. With Real Madrid, it’s clear that Ronaldo is the best player in every match and the player Liverpool will have to take into consideration, obviously not forgetting the rest of the team. Regarding Liverpool, Salah is the key man, who has been performing to a very high level this season, and I think that both of them will be the key to the game. If we have to say one thing, I would say that Cristiano and Salah are the ones who can make the difference in the final</p>

And if you don’t win whatever cup is at stake, then you will be criticised a lot. If you only win the Champions League, then people will say it is not enough. It is very difficult.<br /><br /><b>[Morientes said when quizzed on how La Roja have been affected by an untimely change in the dugout]</b> Footballers are professionals. These things can happen. In the first week, everything was like, ‘Oh what happened?’ but then you need to work hard and concentrate.<br /><br />The new coach is <a href="fernando-hierro.html">Fernando Hierro</a> and he is maybe not the same as <a href="julen-lopetegui.html">Lopetegui</a> because <a href="julen-lopetegui.html">Lopetegui</a> has done a good job for Spain in qualification. It is not a big problem for the players. In the end, you need to concentrate on your work. The philosophy remains the same.<br /><br />Maybe it could have been managed in a different way. But also, there are many things at stake. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> needed a coach and they decided it was <a href="julen-lopetegui.html">Lopetegui</a>.

  <p><b>[Fernando Morientes believes that Neymar or Kylian Mbappe should replace Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid]</b> It’s hard. There is talk of Neymar, Mbappe, Harry Kane, <b>[Eden]</b> Hazard. I think it’s a question for the coach. The coach must give the answer to what he wants on the field, how he wants to play. If you ask me, I would love to play with two centre forwards and two wingers. So, for me the key player for that would be Neymar, even Mbappe. But if you want a footballer more like what Madrid has had, like in the last five years, and a different player in the centre of the field… that could be Hazard, who is very good and assists. There are many very good players, and very expensive too - that is going to be the problem<br /><br />Cristiano Ronaldo has given his best years in Real Madrid. It may be that he has a couple of good years in Juventus, but the best football has been in Real Madrid. It will be difficult for the fans to think badly about Cristiano</p>

He’s a player that we’ll look back on years from now as someone who was on a different level, special. I’ve been lucky - or unlucky - enough to face him and I know what he’s capable of. He has the ability to break open a game, he’s the difference in an even game. Having him on the opposing team is a big handicap.<br /><br />My most special Clasico was my first.

I was lucky enough to play it very early on in my career. They’re games you don’t forget. I played a lot more over the years, and had already played big games for Real Zaragoza and Albacete, but that first Clasico was unforgettable. I was even lucky enough to score, so all good!</p>

It is true there were some <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> players who were at a spectacular level but, for me, <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a> was by far the <b>[best]</b> <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> player. The fact he came to <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>, I think he has been an extraordinary signing. It is not just because of the value added to our competition, but because he is player who created a lot of expectations. Many recognised players were supposed to come to Madrid but, at the end, <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a> is the most notable. Everyone expects he can keep last year’s level, which was extraordinary</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Morientes says <a href="keylor-navas.html">Keylor Navas</a> deserves to be recognised as a <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> legend]</b> In the end, for example, at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> I tell you that he is a legend. A player like him who has participated in great moments in Madrid must be classified as legends, without any doubt. <a href="keylor-navas.html">Keylor Navas</a> came as a substitute player for a great goalkeeper in our history as <a href="iker-casillas.html">Iker Casillas</a> was. Little by little he gained the respect of the entire public, but he was also decisive in great moments in the history of the Bernabeu</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Morientes believes Inter star <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a> could fit in at either <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> In Spain, we were lucky to enjoy great Argentine players and coaches. They have a competitive gene that is very difficult to find anywhere in the world. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> is very interested in buying him, but there has also been talk of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> although I think more about <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. He is a very interesting player for either team. He has a very good vision of the game. He is one of the best forwards in the world at the moment and I think he could fit into either team<br /><br /><b>[<a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is out of contract next year, but Morientes believes the six-time Ballon d’Or winner is destined to finish his career at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a>]</b> I don’t imagine him outside <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. He reminds me of <b>[Paolo]</b> <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Maldini</a>, <b>[Francesco]</b> <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a>, <b>[Carles]</b> <a href="carles-puyol.html">Puyol</a>, like them. He is a club player, one of those who have started and finished his career in a very powerful club. I don’t even think about it. I hope he reaches an agreement. He is the most important player in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and he will be until the end of his career.</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Morientes says <a href="james-rodriguez.html">James Rodriguez</a> is an extraordinary talent &amp; will shine with or without <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> Whatever happens in the remainder of the season, I don’t think James has gone without pain or glory. We’re talking about an extraordinary player, mythical in Colombia, for his national team. Not every player can succeed at the same level. In his first spell <b>[at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b>, James had extraordinary games and demonstrated his talent, which he put into use at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> with marvellous goals. He did have to leave and now that he’s back, he hasn’t had the involvement that surely he or the fans would’ve wanted. But succeeding at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> is very difficult because of the competition, and he himself occupies a position where there are lots players with talent and big futures. It also depends on the kind of player the coach wants. In this case, <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> is surely thinking that he has others who perform better <b>[than James]</b>. For me, James is an extraordinary player and I’m convinced that we’ll see him shine again at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> or anywhere else</p>
