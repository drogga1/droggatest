  <p><b>[Fernando Morientes says Passion makes <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> the best league in the world]</b> Football of course is much more than what we see on the television, there is much more work done behind the scenes. If you want to improve the local teams, you have start from the grassroots and start slowly. So maybe you need a good manager and a good project rather than sending the Asian players to play in Europe<br /><br /><b>[A legend in his own right, Morientes did share the dressing room with superstars such as <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>, <a href="luis-figo.html">Luis Figo</a>, <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>, <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, and <a href="raul-gonzalez.html">Raul Gonzalez</a> during his time at the <a href="real-madrid.html">Santiago Bernabeu</a>. So, what was it like sharing the dressing room with these guys?]</b> Very normal, at least for me. Maybe you think because of the social media that they are very different but in person and in reality, they are just like you and me<br /><br />There are some things you can’t buy and passion is one of them. When you see this big space (he points to the empty green field below the terrace where we are seated), it is very strange for me as a Spanish person because if it were Spain, this ground would be full of children playing football. If you do something every day, you are naturally going to be good at it and you put a lot of passion in it which probably explains why <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> is so good.<br /><br />As you can understand, weather is a very important element for any player. That’s a major difference between playing in France, Spain, and England because the weather is very different in each of these countries. Also, passion of the people in these countries are very different. Of course, you end up playing with players of certain level who are top class anyway, so the major difference is in the passion, culture, and people of the country that you play in,<br /><br /><b>[The game however has changed since his retirement and so has the role of the striker with the likes of Carlos Bacca in <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> regularly criticized for not providing much in terms of creativity despite having an excellent conversation rate. The former Spain international however begs to differ]</b> Number nine has always been very important in any club because he is the one who scores the goal. At the end of the day, goals are the reason we play the game so it has always been important and the role of the striker will never change</p>

  <p><b>[Morientes not surprised by <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> success as <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> eye greatness]</b> It is not a surprise for me because he is a good manager. He won <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> and the Champions League last year. He also did very good work in Castilla. The most important thing is that he has very good players. That is the most important thing. It is no surprise. He was a footballer, he knows Madrid and the club very well and all the players. He has a strong mentality and is very calm. At Madrid, it is easier than another team <b>[because of the quality]</b><br /><br />When you are coach of Madrid, you are always under pressure. People now speak of <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> as a very good manager. But in the future, when he has five, 10 years of more training, we will see the best of <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>.<br /><br />To win the title two times in a row is very difficult. They would be the first ones in history. At Madrid, they have always had very good teams. The Galacticos, <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>, <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a>, <b>[Luis]</b> <a href="luis-figo.html">Figo</a>, all those players. But in this moment, Madrid have an excellent team<br /><br />Are they the best in history? It is very difficult but they have a very strong team. Madrid always have very good teams. If they won this Champions League, they would be in the best position of history. They are now legends. But if they won the title, we will always remember this team for Spanish and European football</p>

  <p><b>[Morientes looking for Blancos to land <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> title]</b> Now <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s challenge will be to win the league. Because it has been too easy to win the Champions League! I know from my experience with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> that everyone demands you to win every title. And if you don’t win whatever cup is at stake, then you will be criticised a lot. If you only win the Champions League, then people will say it is not enough. It is very difficult.<br /><br /><b>[Morientes said when quizzed on how La Roja have been affected by an untimely change in the dugout]</b> Footballers are professionals. These things can happen. In the first week, everything was like, ‘Oh what happened?’ but then you need to work hard and concentrate.<br /><br />The new coach is <a href="fernando-hierro.html">Fernando Hierro</a> and he is maybe not the same as <a href="julen-lopetegui.html">Lopetegui</a> because <a href="julen-lopetegui.html">Lopetegui</a> has done a good job for Spain in qualification. It is not a big problem for the players. In the end, you need to concentrate on your work. The philosophy remains the same.<br /><br />Maybe it could have been managed in a different way. But also, there are many things at stake. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> needed a coach and they decided it was <a href="julen-lopetegui.html">Lopetegui</a>. They could have maybe held the news for until the end of the World Cup but then if Spain does not do well at the World Cup, it would have been bad for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. It <b>[this situation]</b> has no easy answer<br /><br /><b>[Morientes, who won 47 senior caps during his career, said on the calls for change]</b> We need to improve the level of the defence. But <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a> and <b>[Gerard]</b> <a href="gerard-pique.html">Pique</a> are the best, they are untouchables. The whole team need to defend<br /><br /><b>[He added on the criticism aimed at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> goalkeeper <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a> on the back of some costly mistakes]</b> It is very difficult to be a goalkeeper of a national team. When you make a mistake, everyone is in front of you. It is not easy to be a successor of <a href="iker-casillas.html">Iker Casillas</a>. De Gea is a very good goalkeeper but they need confidence.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and Spain legend Fernando Morientes advises India to train their coaches]</b> It is a mix of culture. We have a really old football culture. It is important to work hard at the grassroots level. We understand that football is not only about winning. We have to win by playing good football. It is the academies where you need to work<br /><br />Indian players going out on loan is not relevant. What’s important is to train your trainer. The base for Spanish success is that we have a great pool of coaches. That is where you should invest. Then the players will be ready to play anywhere</p>
