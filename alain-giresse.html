  <p>[Why Mali could be more crucial to Ghana’s Afcon 2017 hopes] Everyone thinks Egypt and Ghana are the favorites of our group, and Mali an outsider. That makes sense. Ghana is very good both technically and collectively, although they have had some difficulties in 2016. Egypt is strong and powerful, with Mohamed Salah one of the best African players and it is a team that concedes very few goals. But it will be very open. We have our chances, we will play them to the end. Mali finished third in 2012 and 2013? Let’s go through the first round.</p>

  <p>[Senegal vs Tunisia. Tunisia will be hoping they have hit form at the right time in this tournament] Reaching the semi-final is very special because Tunisia didn’t have this privilege for a long time. We are very confident and we will fight to beat Senegal</p>
