He deserves a standing ovation from the entire Olimpico. It must be a party, he has to have a great game.<br /><br />I hope there’s an atmosphere that Daniele deserves. I want to see the stadium filled with love for Daniele. It must be a party for him, for what he did for Roma and how he did it. For me, what makes Daniele special is how he manages to convey the passion he has for his shirt through his game. I believe that leaving was a bolt from the blue for him. I don’t know if he’ll wear a special armband, but I’m happy to pay the fine. I’m glad there’s a party for Daniele. I’ll leave Roma with an open heart, hoping to always see them be great in the future<br /><br />I feel like a European coach, so I’ll go wherever there’s a project that interests me. I think this is a good group of players, with a nice mix of young and old. Certainly we expected more from some of the young players, but it’s okay. The core of the squad is solid and healthy, and everyone wants to do well. We won’t start from scratch. We’ll start from a deficit because before we were always in the Champions League, but it won’t restart from zero. Instead, we’ll start from scratch with a new coach, with his own game and ideas.</p>

  <p><b>[Claudio Ranieri does not fear history will repeat itself after comparisons were drawn between <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a>’s predicament and the one he faced at Fulham]</b> <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a> are not Fulham. Don’t forget, Fulham were a newly promoted club with players who had never been in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. In the January transfer window, they followed the advice of algorithms. This is totally different. <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a> have played good football and are struggling, so now need the desire to fight hard. The quality towards the lower half of the table has improved significantly, which adds difficulties to us, but is also a sign that Italian football is returning to the top level.<br /><br />I’ll be honest, it was a surprise when I got the call from <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a>. I’d had surgery on my knee and wasn’t expecting this to be my medication. I am convinced this squad does not belong at the foot of the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> table. When a team is rock bottom, naturally there is a lack of self-esteem, but I want my players not to give up. I am a sportsman, so I know how to accept defeat if the opponent proves he is stronger, but he has to prove it. I am not picking the team, it is the lads who must show me who really wants to save <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a>. We need the team, the fans and myself to be as one<br /><br />I am a Roma supporter, but have always appreciated Samp. I was happy when they won the Scudetto <b>[in 1991]</b> and disappointed during the European Cup final defeat at Wembley <b>[in 1992]</b>. I respect Di Francesco and hope he finds a new role as soon as possible. As for facing Roma on my debut - and my birthday - it’s all wonderful. Naturally, when we step on to that pitch, there is no love, but only professionalism. May the best team win, we will try to give our best</p>

I don’t know if the resumption of the championship will be possible or not, but one thing is certain: the players are like Formula 1 cars, they must be pushed to the maximum.
