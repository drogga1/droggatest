  <p><b>[Claudio Ranieri told Laureus after seeing Leicester nominated for a prestigious World Breakthrough of the Year award]</b> Last season was amazing, but it was a crazy season. This season, we knew the established top teams would come back strongly and ready to fight for the title again and it would be difficult for us. So we set our target at 40 points, just as we did last season, to make sure the team is safe in the Premier League. That has always been the most important target for us this season. Last season was a fantasy season. This season is the reality<br /><br />This is Leicester’s first season in the Champions League, so our focus was on trying to win some games and, if it’s possible, to continue our European adventure - either in the Europa League or the Champions League. We managed to win our group, which was a fantastic effort from everybody and now we have a tough tie against Sevilla in the Last 16. When it comes to the Champions League, I cannot think any further ahead than that<br /><br />The respect that comes with a Laureus Award is very special. You only have to look at the big champions that have won Laureus Awards in the past to know how important they are. To many people around the world, Leicester City was an unknown team before 2016. To be nominated for a Laureus Award introduces the club to the whole world</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri feels his team have become scared after a dismal run of form that has left them just a point and a place above the relegation zone]</b> Maybe some people are scared, so it’s important for me to see every detail. It could be I bring in outside help. I have to find the solution. We’re doing everything well but we haven’t created good chances - to do that we need to be full of confidence and sometimes we haven’t got lots of confidence. Sometimes, the strikers don’t receive a good final pass. We want to show them the best solution to pass the ball, but you can only do that when you’re relaxed and full of confidence. For this reason, it’s important the players reset everything and we restart in positive way. It’s not important who scores, but it’s important somebody scores. Everything is right - the players make the right movements to score. But it’s one thing to do it in training and another in a match. For this reason I say, ‘Clear your mind’. We must be full of personality<br /><br />I’ve never been there, but I know enough about Millwall. They’re a good team, and they fight together with the fans. Sometimes the team that plays in the Premier League doesn’t take the FA Cup in the right way. I don’t know what kind of players played for Watford or Bournemouth. I don’t know because my focus is on Millwall - how they play, how they fight. But often in England the little teams arrives to fight and they can get to the final. Millwall got to the final in 2004 - I have studied them, so I know.</p>

But if we win, if we do a very good game, something inside could change. We need one match like this. We play without the pressure of the Premier League, we play light. For this reason I hope we can show our football. They are better than us, but we will fight.<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether he had earned the right to decide when he leaves]</b> I could have left last season. Nobody could have said anything - I won the title. But I wanted to stay because I knew it was a difficult year. I came here to build something good for Leicester and I’ll keep going. I’ve forgotten the title. We know we all have to work harder. Do that and chances will come. You will always get criticism. I blank it out and focus on what’s important, which is getting away from the situation we are in.</p>

I think about it often, although I partly redeemed myself at Leicester.<br /><br /><a href="eusebio-di-francesco.html">Eusebio Di Francesco</a> is one of the best young coaches we have in Italy, for reasons of financial fair play the team has been changed, three players who were the backbone of Rome have been sold. When a coach signs a contract, he’ll know his team’s philosophy. <a href="eusebio-di-francesco.html">Di Francesco</a> knew what he was signing up for. Roma have been selling their best players for years, although it’s clear no-one expected the team to perform like they have. The players seem afraid of touching the ball, as if it’s hot. The potential is there, but we must find the spark</p>

  <p><b>[Claudio Ranieri has praised Jose Mourinho]</b> José Mourinho. Great man. Great coach. Great character.<br /><br />They say that training and working is a stress, but for me it’s just the opposite. I feel like a lion in a cage. I wanted to come back, but it was right to get away for some time with another experience. Nantes was a nice opportunity. Now I’m here and I’ll give it my all to save the Fulham. The path will be hard and difficult, but I’m sure we will succeed. The team has a good base. We just have to correct some things, mainly the defensive phase and the general approach. With the players I was clear: I want people running and fighting</p>

  <p><b>[Claudio Ranieri’s side are yet to force a shut-out]</b> Arsenal have always been good going forward, it’s just the defending that needs tightening up. Attacking-wise we’re great, but we just need to have a little bit more cunning and use more experience when we’re defending. We’re giving away too many chances per game. We’ve seen Bernd Leno, and also Petr Cech when he was in, having four or five saves to make every match. That’s too many. The confidence is back in the team, though, there’s simply no doubt about that.</p>

  <p><b>[AS Roma coach Claudio Ranieri has claimed that president James Pallotta and Franco Baldini could have handled Daniele de Rossi’s departure from the club this summer differently]</b> I don’t seem to have used certain words attributed to me. To the fans that asked me who made the decisions about De Rossi, I said: ‘Those in London and America’. That’s where the president lives and who’s closest to him <b>[Baldini]</b>. That was it. I don’t know anything about Pallotta’s future plans, I haven’t talked to them about it. I end my relationship with Roma after two matches. I believe that at every football club, there are spare parts. We’ve also seen some teams lose great points of reference in Italy. But since De Rossi was our captain, a person in our history, perhaps his departure had to be handled differently so he could think it through better. That opportunity wasn’t given to him, but that’s football. The club want to change, they want other players: and like how players choose different clubs, the clubs change too.<br /><br />Given how maybe the Roma fans support the team so passionately, maybe more careful consideration was needed. I’m a coach. If I’d been asked what I wanted with regards to De Rossi, in case we were keeping him, I would’ve said that I wanted him because I know what kind of man and player he is. We always talk about leaders: there are many of them. There’s the one for the fans, social media, club, journalists. Then there are those for the coach: he’s a coach on the pitch, he reasons without an ego and for good of the team. These are the leaders we want as coaches. Baldini doesn’t affect my daily work at all. I don’t know what kind of relationship he has with the president. Here, in my work, he doesn’t affect me. Generally speaking, I don’t know what he does.<br /><br /><b>[Ranieri insists that the 35-year-old remains as committed to Roma as ever]</b> I saw he is determined as always, obviously inside he will be shaken and will not sleep at night. It is normal for those who gave everything and played well in conditions even when not 100% for the love that they have for this shirt</p>

He deserves a standing ovation from the entire Olimpico. It must be a party, he has to have a great game.<br /><br />I hope there’s an atmosphere that Daniele deserves. I want to see the stadium filled with love for Daniele. It must be a party for him, for what he did for Roma and how he did it. For me, what makes Daniele special is how he manages to convey the passion he has for his shirt through his game. I believe that leaving was a bolt from the blue for him. I don’t know if he’ll wear a special armband, but I’m happy to pay the fine. I’m glad there’s a party for Daniele. I’ll leave Roma with an open heart, hoping to always see them be great in the future<br /><br />I feel like a European coach, so I’ll go wherever there’s a project that interests me. I think this is a good group of players, with a nice mix of young and old. Certainly we expected more from some of the young players, but it’s okay. The core of the squad is solid and healthy, and everyone wants to do well. We won’t start from scratch. We’ll start from a deficit because before we were always in the Champions League, but it won’t restart from zero. Instead, we’ll start from scratch with a new coach, with his own game and ideas.</p>
