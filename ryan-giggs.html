Kante hunts the ball down. He is so quick to cover space, get to the ball and make the tackle. I have played against that kind of opponent over the years. They are a nightmare - you cannot shake them off.</p>

  <p><b>[Giggs hails Rashford potential]</b> I remember watching him the week before <b>[his debut]</b>, it may have even been three or four days before that game, training with the reserves. He obviously stood out and he looked sharp but, little did we know that three or four days later, he would be starring and ending the season so well and then going onto the Euros with England. He is an exciting prospect. He’s just so quick and direct. His best position, really, is through the middle, coming up with the goods and he is just an exciting player. I always say he is a Man United player because he is exciting, he has got a good mentality and he is tough. I think he’ll do well at United for a long, long time.<br /><br />It is important - someone who the fans see has come through the ranks, someone who is one of their own, someone who grew up in the area. It’s important and it is important at most clubs, but obviously United, when they’ve got that great history of young players coming through, there’s that added pressure as well. I think the fans always get behind the young players that come through, even if they make mistakes they still get behind them. The best thing of all is that Marcus is a good kid. He wants to improve, wants to be the best and to come through as a centre-forward at United is not easy</p>

  <p><b>[Giggs demands Man Utd fans to cut Paul Pogba some slack]</b> I have never seen a 23-year-old midfield player dominate games for a whole season. So, the £90 million that they paid is obviously what people focus on and what people talk about. He will become a brilliant midfielder, there is no doubt in that. I think he scored seven or eight goals, again, not many midfielders at 23 will do that… but because he cost so much, he is compared with that price tag when actually, he has done okay this season. Okay, not brilliant but not really bad. So yeah, I think a lot people should cut him a bit of slack</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Giggs says he would pick Anthony Martial in his Manchester United team, despite admitting he suffers from inconsistency]</b> He’s still a young player and second seasons can be really difficult. You’ve seen it with so many young players. I think he is still exciting and he can be a match winner still. He’s just been inconsistent. I like him and would pick him in my team. He will only get better.<br /><br /><b>[On Jose Mourinho]</b> I think he’s done okay. He had a slow start and it is always difficult. If you look at Jose’s career so far, he has always dealt with similar kind of teams - Porto, Chelsea, Inter. With United, he was coming into a team which was strong squad wise but I think he is still struggling a little bit to find his best XI. I think gradually he’s finding his best 11, 12 or 13. But the problem is the slow start he has had. Other teams started quickly and now he has to play catch up<br /><br />There needs to be someone at a club, be it a director of football or chief executive, who knows the club and its recruitment process. Someone who can spot an ‘Arsenal’ player or ‘Manchester United’ player because they are different. Even if the manager changes, the culture of the club shouldn’t change. I think we still have a lot to learn in respect to that. When the coaches are changed every two year or so, you need someone in the background who is going to ensure the youth system is alright like a sporting director. I think it is a good role for ex-players if they are willing to put in the hours because they have been there. Especially if they have played for the club. But I think in this atmosphere, there are no managers who are getting the time to stay for eight to 10 years at a club and build a legacy.<br /><br />I’m not looking to do the role of a sporting director but I look at Southampton and I see a couple of players at the club who look after the welfare of the club regardless of who the coach is. The coach picks the team, he delivers the training sessions but underneath that they are responsible for keeping the club running</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs says there were only two world-class Premier League players on show in the Champions League this season]</b> It has been a factor throughout the performances of English teams in the Champions League that the quality simply is not there any longer, or not as it was when English clubs had that good run in the competition from 2005 to 2012. It seems the very best players are concentrated elsewhere, and there is just a sprinkling of the leading players in the Premier League sides. Aside from Sergio Aguero and Alexis Sanchez it is hard to think of the world-class players in the English Champions League squads this season<br /><br />While Leicester have gone the furthest without <b>[a world-class player]</b>, it is striking when you consider how many there are at Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich in particular. To win the Champions League most years, and ever more so in recent times, you need three or more of those leafing players and it says something about English football that there are so few in our teams. It is not as if the money is not there to buy the best players, it just seems that the recruitment has not always been right</p>

  <p><b>[Asked what is Manchester United’s greatest problem of late]</b> They’re creating a lot of chances but we’re missing goals. It’s hard to judge now. We can do that at the end of the season. I think most United fans would be happy at the start of the season if we were getting a trophy and Champions League football. They’re still on course to do that. It will be tough to get into the top four but we have a good chance of winning the Europa League. The end of the season would be a good time to judge.<br /><br />I think, the five or six of us coming through - it doesn’t happen always. Its pretty unique. We’ve always had players coming through but it’s been the odd one every now and again. United have always had a rich history with youth players and when you’ve got players like Marcus Rashford coming through, the young kids look at him and say it is possible. Over the years, we’ve had the most young players coming through. Maybe Southampton would rival us when it comes to youngsters breaking in and then keeping the first team spots<br /><br /><b>[When queried as to why they chose to venture into business]</b><br /><br />Regarding business, football is a short career. So we started planning for after football around our early thirties. We were always planning on what we would do after football. We’re still involved in it <b>[football]</b>, yes. But business has really took over our lives, especially the hospitality business. It’s different from football but it is still the same to an extent. You need to prepare right, you need to have the right team and work hard. So, we took something from football to this and we enjoy business. It’s a big part of our lives now</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd legend Ryan Giggs admits to visiting psychiatrist as career came to a close]</b> I do not know what has affected Aaron, but I always struggled in the periods I was out the team or playing badly. I had a feeling of worthlessness. As a footballer you wonder if your team-mates are looking at you and asking the questions you are asking of yourself. Why can’t he hit a decent pass? Why’s he always injured? What’s wrong with him?.<br /><br />Institutionalised is a description I would apply to my life as a footballer at Manchester United. I had been there from the age of 14 to 42, and my life had been so distinctively shaped by the rhythm of life at Old Trafford that I realised, when it was coming to the end last year, I had to make some reparations for the change.<br /><br />Aaron Lennon’s story has made mental health of footballers an issue again and I think that for his sake and everyone else in the game it is important to be open about how we feel as professionals, and how we cope with stress. When my life as a player and then coach at United came to an end last summer…I made the decision to see a psychiatrist to learn how best to cope and some of the suggestions he made served me well in adapting to a new life outside of United</p>

He hit the crossbar like nine or 10 times for United last season. If he can turn them into goals, that’s another area he needs to improve. It’s just consistency. You never knew what you were going to get from him. But overall, I was happy with his first season. Of course he could have done better but he’s come from Juventus where they win the league every year and he’s in a team that was inconsistent throughout the season. If United hit the ground running next year, you will see a new and improved Pogba.<br /><br />Pogba today was … you’ve got to be excited if you’re a Man United fan.

It’s Jose’s second season with United. Last season they had the best squad and I think this year they’ve got the best squad again. They haven’t necessarily got the best XI, but their strength in depth is huge.<br /><br />And City; towards the end of the season away at Watford they had Gabriel Jesus, Leroy Sane, Sergio Aguero, David Silva, Kevin De Bruyne. That front five is scary … and Raheem Sterling wasn’t even on the pitch! It’s Guardiola’s second season in the Premier League, too, so they will be really strong. It’ll be interesting to see how Chelsea cope with the Champions League, but I can definitely see United and City contending for the title.</p>

He was on the way home from his milk round, stopped off, seen me playing football for my primary school, watched me play, approached my mum, and said ‘I understand you’re the mum of Ryan, does he play for a team?’<br />No, he doesn’t<br />‘Can he come down for a game on Sunday?<br />‘Yeah he’d love to’, then my mum introduced me to Dennis, picked me up, went to the game, dropped me off, and he did that for the next two-three years, looked after me, and someone that still works to this day at Deans <b>[Youth and Ladies FC]</b><br />He very often volunteers, not getting paid, and just my best mate, I met that Sunday.

So he needs to develop a thick skin, he needs to listen to the coaches, because that’s all that counts really. And if he misses a chance, the next one that comes along he needs to put it away because, as a centre-forward at United, you’re under scrutiny all the time.</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd legend Giggs makes ‘scary’ Man City title favourites]</b> I think Manchester City are the team to beat. I looked at them towards the end of last season and the forward players they’ve got is scary, with Sergio Aguero, Gabriel Jesus, Leroy Sane, Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva and Raheem Sterling. What they needed to get right was their defence and it will be interesting to see how Ederson settles in, because you don’t win the Premier League with an average goalkeeper.<br /><br />They’ve obviously invested heavily on full-backs but the question is still whether Vincent Kompany can stay fit because his influence and experience are key for them. You can’t ignore Chelsea because of their quality, but have they got the squad to balance defending the Premier League and European football? I’m not sure. Tottenham have a really exciting squad and a great manager in Mauricio Pochettino, but everybody is asking whether they can continue to match sides without signings.</p>

After Real Madrid only a couple of clubs can really compete for prestige or history. That’s why the speculation happens every year but I maintain what I’ve always said, I think he’s happy at Madrid. It’s not impossible but he’s playing at one of the biggest clubs in the world and if he’s enjoying himself and playing regularly I don’t see it happening.</p>

He showed it then and he showed it in the Euros. It didn’t quite happen for him last year for Bayern, which can happen; a young player moving country, different language, a big club and a lot of expectation, but he is a talent and the Premier League will suit him because he’s an aggressive player. He can tackle, he can get forward and he’s going to a club that play football the right way so I think he’ll be a success.<br /><br />I remember looking at him and instantly liking him. Liked the way he played and thought he would suit Premier League football. Swansea have done well to sign him - Paul Clement’s ties to Bayern and friendship with Carlo Ancelotti has got a lot to do with it, but that’s when you’ve got to capitalise on stuff like that. He’s a fantastic player and I think he will be one of the exciting players in the league. It obviously depends on how Swansea do but he is a really good player. Germany isn’t that physical so I think the Premier League will suit him because he’s physically strong, quick, aggressive, passes forward and I liked him instantly.

When he has been able to demonstrate his quality at Real Madrid, he has shown that his style of football is fundamental to winning games.

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho should play Paul Pogba on the left side of a midfield three more often if he is to get the best out of the Manchester United star]</b> Manchester United’s attacking players are, without a shadow of a doubt, capable of winning the Premier League next season. They’ve got pace, guile, goals, experience and make up a really top forward line. I would say the forward line is as good as Manchester City’s, but the difference is the way of playing, with Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva behind consistently finding the front three for City. United have Paul Pogba who could potentially be as good as them, but then Nemanja Matic is more defensive, so it is just that creative area where City have got the upper hand. One of the best games Pogba had was the Everton game <b>[2-0 win on January 1]</b>, when he was on the left of Matic - in a similar position to the one he played at Juventus - and Ander Herrera was on the right. I think that position where he’s on the left of a midfield three is where he’s at his best. He’s a brilliant crosser of the ball and I don’t think he’s as effective when he’s having to do more defensive work in central areas. I would like to see him in a 4-3-3 with Matic sitting, Herrera to the right and Pogba to the left, with a selection of the front three thriving off more creativity behind them.<br /><br /><b>[On Marcus Rashford]</b> If I was in the position of Marcus Rashford or Anthony Martial I would think it would force you to raise your game and that it is only healthy for competition in the team. Jose is finding out who can play where. Sanchez played on the right for Barcelona so I don’t think it is set in stone that he’ll play on the left every game. I also think Jose has different options for different games. When you need a counter-attacking team then you go with Lukaku, Martial and Rashford, but then Juan Mata plays when United need his creativity to break teams down. The main problem for Rashford is his best position is as a striker and it doesn’t look as though he’s going to get in ahead of Lukaku. He was very good in that position against Yeovil but ultimately he’s not going to get as many goals over a season as Lukaku. However, I can’t see Rashford looking at his future at the moment. He’ll get enough games across the four competitions, but the issues are when he isn’t involved in the big games</p>

It is important and Manchester United is all about winning trophies. Once you get to cup finals, a club like Manchester United is under pressure to win it.

It’s about who turns up on the day. It will define the two clubs’ seasons so there is a lot of pressure on the game. If you can keep Eden Hazard quiet then I always think you have a great chance against Chelsea. Of course, Willian is a special player as well, so if you can keep both them quiet then you have a chance. United have some special players as well.

But Gareth has shown his qualities in big games and that he can handle anything that is thrown at him.<br /><br />He has started this season on fire. But there’s never really a time when he is not playing well. I think always the problem with Gareth is that when he has been injured, he’s then had to come back and get more game time.

He can play anywhere across the front, he played on the right for Barcelona and upfront in his better days for Arsenal. I’ve seen him just off the left the most for United so it just depends who he’s playing with and who they’re playing against.

He’s played at the top with Arsenal and has been there for 10 years. Then there’s all the games he’s played for Wales. He’s a goalscoring midfielder who, if he plays 40-45 games a season, is going to score 15 goals. They don’t grow on trees. He’s also a good character, has a good personality, and is a good professional. So if he does go, somebody is getting a very good player<br /><br />We have to weigh it up and it’s something for us to assess. Obviously we are at home for the first game. That’s a plus, but we are just monitoring the situation. I’ve not spoken to him about it yet. I don’t like talking to players going into a weekend before they have a game. I want them to concentrate on that, but I will be in touch with him after that</p>

  <p><b>[Why Chelsea can’t take Man Utd lightly]</b> There’s lots being spoken about Manchester United and Jose Mourinho, but if you go back to the last game against Newcastle then them coming back like that you’d hope would give them massive confidence. This is the period that United need to be getting up for the games and I wouldn’t be surprised if they come through this period pretty well because they are capable of playing against and matching the good teams. With the attacking ability they’ve got they’ve always got a chance.<br /><br />For example, Anthony Martial didn’t play well in the first half but in the second he came out flying and that’s nothing to do with the manager, that’s the player doing it for themselves, so sometimes you can’t put everything on the manager. They got three goals in the last game so obviously the attacking threats are there, obviously you’d like to get that attacking intent for 90 minutes but if you play like that against Chelsea and go 1-0 down it’s a long way back - you can possibly get away with it against so-called lesser teams.</p>

  <p><b>[Aaron Ramsey can play anywhere in Europe]</b> He won’t be short of offers as he’s a talented player. He’s one of those players that, if he plays a full season, will get 10-15 goals from midfield and that’s a very attractive player to have in any side. He’s friends with Gareth Bale so obviously he’ll be able to tell him what it’s like to play abroad and Aaron’s certainly got the talent to play anywhere in Europe but that will totally be his decision. As long as he’s playing regular football, that’s all I really care about.<br /><br /><b>[Giggs is hopeful he will be able to break back into the Gunners first team]</b> Of course you want your players settled but from my point of view it’s just a case of him playing regularly, that’s all you want as an international manager. Wherever that may be is obviously out of my hands but I just want him playing. I’ve been asked a lot about Aaron Ramsey leaving Arsenal next summer and all I can say is that when he comes to camp with us he’s always ready, he’s a great professional and this contract situation has never affected him so far</p>

In football, and in sport in general, people are not recognised or recognised too late. This is a chance for not only a great player, but an iconic player and top goalscorer. He’s gone ahead of Gary Lineker and Bobby Charlton, over 50 goals. It gives him a chance to thank the fans for all the support, and the fans to thank him for all the work he’s done over the years. I’ve worked with Wayne, played with Wayne, and he doesn’t get recognised for what ability he still has and did have at his peak. I understand people have got different opinions but, from knowing Wayne and what he’s done for England, I don’t see any problem with it.<br /><br />It looks like he’s enjoying it out there. I saw one of the goals he made when he chased back, slide tackled and crossed. That is brilliant to see. He’ll always score goals because he is a goalscorer. I think he’s got 12 goals in 20 games, and it looks as if he’s really enjoying life in America. He’s a footballer who’ll want to play for as long as he can, I know that.

I think we’ve got the manager, the players to do that.<br /><br />Manchester City and Liverpool, the teams up there, they are consistent. When you’re not the gap is obviously going to be big. When your nearest rivals are that far ahead of you it’s hard to take. It’s still 13 games into the season, time to claw it back. But the only way of doing that is going on a run of seven or eight games unbeaten - small steps to build that confidence back up</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Giggs is not surprised by Jose Mourinho’s decision to drop Paul Pogba]</b> Lukaku scored at Southampton, and usually when a centre-forward scores they want to play next game so I was a bit surprised he was on the bench. Jose went with the speed of Anthony Martial, Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford, which you can understand as well. Pogba just didn’t play well at Southampton so I can understand that one. He could come back in quite easily and make an impact on Saturday <b>[against Fulham]</b>. He needs to really because he’s taking a lot of criticism, which I think comes because of what he is capable of. Especially as a midfielder at United, you need to be consistently good and he has just shown glimpses really. We all know what he’s capable of because we’ve seen it, he just has to do it regularly. It’s down to Paul - every United fan was excited when we signed him because of what he is capable of and what he achieved at Juventus and with France, but he’s just not done it on that consistent basis and you can see why Jose left him out.<br /><br />The top four at the moment looks a long way away, but there’s a long way to go in the season and that’s the plus. They’ve got to start winning if they have any ambitions of finishing in the top four and they are stuttering at the moment results-wise. It would be good to beat Fulham at home because we’ve seen that in the bigger games, okay we got beat by Tottenham, who played pretty well, and against City too, but at Chelsea we played really well, so we are going to be up for the big games. It’s just these sides outside the top six where we’ve stuttered. It is not going to be easy against Fulham because Claudio Ranieri’s just taken over there, but they are bottom and if you have any top four aspirations you’ve got to win these games</p>

It tops it off that it’s a disappointing season, then when you get beat by your rivals obviously your fans won’t be happy.<br /><br />Jose takes a lot of stick, rightly or wrongly, but the players have got to take responsibility as well. He’s not the one out there miscontrolling it, he’s not the one going out to Mane like Herrera did and making a stupid challenge. It’s a bigger story though. The season so far, when you don’t beat the likes of Wolves, don’t beat Crystal Palace at home, you have to take the criticism. The players in that squad at the moment are better than that. The standards of Manchester United over the years have been high and these players have dropped below that<br /><br />The manager has to take a lot of stick for that.

So far, he has played Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal and he is unbeaten in all those games. So, what he has done in a short space of time is amazing.<br /><br />At Manchester United you’ve got to have that consistency, week in, week out and it is not easy. He has had a great start to his coaching career at United.

When you are enjoying your football, and you’re playing with a smile on your face, you’ll try things. So, that’s what I see at the moment with the likes of Pogba, Martial, Rashford, all these players expressing themselves, and I think Ole has had a lot to do with that. I think all teams are happy when they are winning. So, no matter who the coach is, when you are winning you have a happy dressing room because then you have a happy staff, the media aren’t criticising you and the fans are happy.

He went from a winger, who used to beat people, make goals, score goals to now really just an out-and-out goal scorer, and he scores every type of goal, headers, goals in the six-yard box free-kicks and every type of goal. He is also the best professional I have played with. The way he looked after himself, not only in training but also away from the pitch. The way that he eats, the way that he conducts himself. So, I’m not surprised that he is still playing and still at the top of his game. You still have to have that hunger, desire and dedication to go out and train and look after yourself - eat the right way, not drinking alcohol, getting enough sleep and enjoying it. Ronaldo, if you look at him, he still looks after himself. So, if he still has that hunger, that desire and enjoying it like I said, he can still go until 40 I think.<br /><br />We would have been the first team to regain the Champions League which would have been special. That was probably the most disappointing game of my career. We didn’t play well. We didn’t turn up. I was really disappointed. In 2011, sometimes you just have to hold your hand up; we were up against a great team. It was very difficult for us… we still made it difficult for them, but it was of those times, probably the only time or a handful of times in my career, where we were up against a better team. I would have liked to have won more. Of course, we were in four finals - we got beaten twice by Barcelona; probably the greatest team I have played against… Messi, Xavi, Iniesta, Puyol, Pique - really top players in a top team. So, we would have liked to have won it a lot more, but it’s a difficult trophy to win. I’m just happy I won it twice<br /><br />I don’t think you can plan to play against Messi. What we tried to do was stop the ball from getting to Messi. So, if we could stop the ball from getting to Messi, then he couldn’t hurt us. But of course, it is very difficult. In that game, he had a free role where he could go wherever on the pitch, and you have Xavi, Iniesta on the pitch, you have to stop them as well, that’s the problem that we had. They had a great team, but to stop Messi is very difficult. Him <b>[Messi]</b> and Cristiano Ronaldo are probably on par, it just depends who you think is the best. Obviously, Ronaldo has won something internationally, his played in Portugal, England, Spain and now Italy. That is the difference between him and Messi. Then you look at Messi and he is doing things that no other player has done. He is scoring goals, making goals and they have both won so much in their career. So, there’s not much between them<br /><br />When you win it in 1999, I was 26 or 27 and you think ‘okay this is the first of many finals at least’, maybe winning it, but it wasn’t until nine years later where we got to the final. And it was different because it was against Chelsea; someone from your own league and, again, it was different because it went to penalties. It was a tough final in Moscow, against a very good team, but we managed to come out winners</p>

I saw him this week (at a training camp) and he looked like he enjoyed football to me. He was sharp, he wanted the ball, and he was practising his trademark of cutting in on his left foot. He scored a great goal. Afterwards, when a lot of the lads went in, he was practising his shooting, so that doesn’t strike me as someone who just wants to get off and go back to his room. It struck me as a professional who still loves football.</p>

  <p><b>[Wales manager Ryan Giggs has called upon officials to be prepared to take teams from the field if they face racist abuse during their upcoming 2020 European Championship qualifiers]</b> It’s obviously an issue. We have seen big problems in games this season that we haven’t seen for a long time. For us we have enough to worry about with the game, so we will leave it to the authorities if there is any racism during the game. We trust the authorities that they will do the right thing. But the punishments have not been strong enough. It’s not sufficient and it won’t stop teams. Bans need to be imposed or points deducted because that is the only way certain federations can do anything.<br /><br /><b>[Speaking about whether referees should show greater responsibility in halting encounters for such problems]</b> It’s difficult for the players to <b>[walk off on their own]</b>. I welcome the right people having to make the decision rather than the onus being on the players. Then the players are open to criticism rather than it being taken out of their own hands. If an individual is targeted it’s up to that individual to do what they feel is right, but everyone is different</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Giggs has sympathised with outgoing <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> midfielder <a href="aaron-ramsey.html">Aaron Ramsey</a>’s injury problems ahead of Wales’ European Qualifying campaign]</b> I was about 28-years-old and similar to Aaron when I started all the yoga and a different diet. As a professional it takes a bit of time to know what your body can take. A lot of the time you are thinking, ‘I can get away with it’. The amount of times my hamstring was a little bit tight and sometimes I got away with it and other times I didn’t. It’s that gamble. When there is a big game on a Saturday and you want to be part of it and your hamstring is a bit tight - it’s hard.<br /><br />Aaron has played a lot this season compared to other seasons leading up to his injury and each game seemed to be a big one. It’s easy to say to players you have to manage yourself. But when there is the carrot of a game like a Europa League knock-out stages or a game that you are going for the top four it’s not easy because footballers want to play. If you can get away with it then you go for it. Suddenly it hits home. I remember it was <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> away (November 2001) and I did my hamstring the night before the game. It was in the last two minutes of training. People might think it was an over-exaggeration but I kept missing big games.<br /><br />I seriously considered giving up because of the disappointment that I kept getting injured. I went back to my room and I thought I’ve had enough of this. It was only for half an hour! It was just the level of disappointment.</p>

I have said before, in the training camp he was great, about the place he has been great. It’s difficult fitness wise having not played for a long time and then that short turnaround. The way he plays as well, those high-intensity sprints. It’s difficult. But he’s been fine around the place, no problem. It’s always a bit of a juggling act trying to find where Gareth can be effective. We have so many players who can play off the right or number 10. Gareth has shown over the last few years he can play up front, number 10, off the right. It’s my job to try and get his best position and to get the other players in their best positions as well.<br /><br /><b>[Having seen his side lose 2-1 in Croatia three days before their reverse in Hungary]</b> We’ve had two tough away games five weeks after the season finished, and you saw it in both games - a lot of the players were short of match fitness and we’re asking miracles of our players. <a href="ethan-ampadu.html">Ethan Ampadu</a> has not really played, I did well to get 50 minutes out of him.

But still, we had enough chances to win the games. It’s tough, not enough of our players were at peak fitness but we have to probably win nearly every game now. We’ve made it really difficult for ourselves and we’re probably relying on other teams to drop points, which they will do, because it’s a competitive group.

But that doesn’t happen anymore. You are starting to lose that. Now I’m not saying you kick everyone. But that was how <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> got better. Scholesy would kick him if he took too many touches. And suddenly it clicked that you can’t keep dribbling or else I’m going to get kicked. I saw an interview with <a href="vincent-kompany.html">Vincent Kompany</a> at the end of the season. And he’s a bit old school. He was asked about the week ahead of last game at Brighton and he said ‘sometimes I have to give a player a kick!’ And I was thinking City might miss that this year<br /><br /><b>[Pressed further on <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> and how long he could stick around at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>]</b> I think the fans are split. Some fans say ‘let him go’, some fans recognise the quality he has got and that if he does go there will be a big void. If you get rid of all the players and you haven’t got quality to replace them then that is difficult as well. So it is a tough job for Ole that balancing act. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> said he wanted to go and then did an extra year.

Not saying we’re going to win the league this year, but if you start seeing improvements and a shift of culture with players you want to go and watch. We all want Ole to be successful, but even if he isn’t, I think he will leave the club in a better state than when he took over, which in itself is a job. In two or three years’ time some of these players are going to be top, top players. They are already good players, but in a few years they will be top players. Whether Ole is going to be successful in that time I don’t know, but introducing players like <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a> and <a href="tahith-chong.html">Tahith Chong</a> will stand the club in good stead.</p>

It should have been Marcus. It’s a strange one because before the game you usually have a designated penalty taker and you would think it would be Marcus after scoring last week.

The way that he’s playing - which is all that footballers want to do, they want to play, they want to get minutes, they want to do well - I’ve always said he’s at a fantastic club.<br /><br />Of course, it would have unsettled him because it was apparently very close for him going. But things might have changed. Things do change quite quickly in football and now he’s playing, he’s loved, he’s happy, and I expect him to carry on doing what he’s doing for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. If <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> is at your club and he’s training well and he gets the chance to play, he’s always going to keep you interested because he can turn a game on its head, he can score goals and he’s such an asset. So I’m not surprised in that respect. I was surprised with what happened in the summer - I think everyone from the outside thought it was a bit strange, but it seems like everything has gone a bit quiet now. I think that’s all you ask for - for players to be in good form for their clubs and then take it into the international arena</p>

  <p><b>[Giggs assesses <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a>’s <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> debut]</b> <b>[You saw]</b> glimpses of the quality he does possess. I think it might need a bit of working out what his best position is. With his back to goal, I don’t think that’s his position. When he’s a little bit deeper, defensively, he may be a bit of a liability. He’s in between the two really. That’s where you want to see him, coming on to the ball <b>[heading into the final third]</b>. But also you see when he is that little bit deeper he can spray the passes, he has got the vision to then play those passes. But then you need the runs.<br /><br />When I went back and played in midfield, if I got the ball and no-one was running in behind, I’d tell them because first five minutes, I want to turn, face the play and move the defence. What that does, it gives space to the wide-men who want to come in, the No.10, the defence then are already on their way as soon as he gets the ball. I think he’ll want to find his best position first of all. He tired towards the end but you can see the quality that he has got.<br /><br /><b>[Paul <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> and <a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a> are all currently out of action through injury]</b> After that, you’ll see the <b>[real]</b> Fernandes.

They were all in their own ways matchwinners. They did the stuff on the pitch, so he never felt he had to. Eric, there were some games where Eric didn’t do anything.

But he knew sooner or later he would come good. We would be sat in the dressing room thinking: ‘He’s got to have a go at him, he’s got to have a pop at him because he didn’t do anything today’. But the next week he’d scored the winner or he would produce a moment of magic, so he handled the big names really well as long as they were doing it on the pitch, he handled them in a different way. He was the master of psychology, he was a master at getting the best out of certain individuals like whether to put an arm around, or whether to give them a rocket at half-time or at the end of the game or leave them out knowing that the player would react in a positive way.<br /><br />I fell out with him plenty of times.

I could never do that. My philosophy was: ‘I’m putting it low into the corner - even if the goalkeeper goes the right way, he’s not gonna save it if I execute it right’. That was my philosophy, so it doesn’t matter if he went the right way or not. If I do low, side-netting, he shouldn’t be able to save it. That was my philosophy, rather than looking at the goalkeeper, trying to play mind games and having the confidence which <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a> and <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> <b>[have]</b>. <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> did for a while that slow run up.

Ole started his management with United flying, then had a tough spell, and then we were on a good run. But, like I said earlier, the players he’s got in have been really impressive.

Obviously we both worked under Sir Alex who I’ve known since I was 13. Sir Alex had everything - man-management, discipline, standards, tactics, knowing a player, but with him, because we had such good players who had been together for a long time, you’d just go out and play. You knew your role, it was just a matter of just tweaking it. With Louis it was probably the opposite. We played different systems under him whereas under Sir Alex we more or less just played one system and we’d tweak it. I can’t remember us ever playing three at the back, maybe once or twice if we needed to hold on, but other than that we didn’t.<br /><br />It was about getting an understanding of the different ways to play. So I know what Wayne was saying because Louis worked a lot more on the training pitch with regards to patterns of play and tactical work. He’d come from Holland and also an international background and he took that into club football, so we had a lot of meetings - players felt sometimes too many! With Sir Alex it was quite simple. I’m not saying we didn’t have meetings - of course we did - but we had such good players that the manager would just need to tell them once and it would just be a little tweak here and there, like Ji-sung Park would go and mark <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Pirlo</a> for example and Ji would do it and do it brilliantly.

Whereas when you’re playing, you don’t know the preparation<br /><br />You don’t know what the manager’s seen on the videos. Players get seven or eight minutes of watching the opposition, but the coaching staff watch hours and hours<br /><br />So that is completely different, it’s completely different, even though you’ve worked under a manager for so long.
