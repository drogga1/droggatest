He went from a winger, who used to beat people, make goals, score goals to now really just an out-and-out goalscorer, and he scores every type of goal, headers, goals in the six-yard box, free-kicks and every type of goal. He is also the best professional I have played with. The way he looked after himself, not only in training but also away from the pitch. The way that he eats, the way that he conducts himself. So, I’m not surprised that he is still playing and still at the top of his game. <b>[Ronaldo]</b>(cristiano-ronaldo.html), if you look at him, he still looks after himself. So, if he still has that hunger, that desire and enjoying it like I said, he can still go until 40 I think</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Giggs believes Daniel James can play at any level]</b> Ideally, as an international manager, you don’t want to influence players’s decisions when it comes to clubs. For me it’s about players playing. He was fantastic in the last six months for Swansea, putting in devastating performances and I think he can play at any level. He could play in the Premier League, but if he stays at Swansea for another year or two years I’d be equally as happy because he’s done so well there. That’s a decision for Dan to make and I’m sure he’ll make the right decision.<br /><br /><b>[Dylan Levitt is already on the Red Devils’ books, with the 18-year-old having made Giggs’ senior squad for upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers against Croatia and Hungary]</b> We have a great crop of young players coming through. For us, as a relatively small country, it’s about having competition for places. It doesn’t matter how old you are, as long as you’re good enough you’re going to get a chance in my squad. Dylan I know because he’s been at United, I’ve spoken to Nicky Butt about him, the academy director. He’s at a club that shares the same philosophy as me in giving young players a chance. I’ve watched him play and he’s a talent. He’s impressed in the last week in training and he’s an exciting player</p>

  <p><b>[Wales manager Ryan Giggs has insisted star player Gareth Bale remains happy and enthusiastic despite enduring a difficult season in Spain with Real Madrid]</b> He <b>[Bale]</b> has won a lot here, but we live for the present and the future. I saw him this week (at a training camp) and he looked like he enjoyed football to me. He was sharp, he wanted the ball, and he was practising his trademark of cutting in on his left foot. He scored a great goal. Afterwards, when a lot of the lads went in, he was practising his shooting, so that doesn’t strike me as someone who just wants to get off and go back to his room. It struck me as a professional who still loves football.<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he was surprised by the criticism aimed at Bale, who has also scored over 100 goals for the club]</b> Yes, but I’m not over there. I’m not a Real Madrid fan. I don’t know the ins and outs and I’m only looking from the outside. But you’ve got a player who won the team the Champions League final last year with one of the best goals you’ve ever seen and performs for that team week in, week out. I remember the original Ronaldo getting stick off Real Madrid fans. I remember Cristiano Ronaldo getting stick early doors. It’s that kind of club, it’s a club like no other where the white handkerchiefs come out if they don’t like you. That’s just the way it is. But we played a game (on Tuesday) and he looked really good, sharp and really fresh. I’m excited to see him in these two games</p>

  <p><b>[Wales manager Ryan Giggs has called upon officials to be prepared to take teams from the field if they face racist abuse during their upcoming 2020 European Championship qualifiers]</b> It’s obviously an issue. We have seen big problems in games this season that we haven’t seen for a long time. For us we have enough to worry about with the game, so we will leave it to the authorities if there is any racism during the game. We trust the authorities that they will do the right thing. But the punishments have not been strong enough. It’s not sufficient and it won’t stop teams. Bans need to be imposed or points deducted because that is the only way certain federations can do anything.<br /><br /><b>[Speaking about whether referees should show greater responsibility in halting encounters for such problems]</b> It’s difficult for the players to <b>[walk off on their own]</b>. I welcome the right people having to make the decision rather than the onus being on the players. Then the players are open to criticism rather than it being taken out of their own hands. If an individual is targeted it’s up to that individual to do what they feel is right, but everyone is different</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Giggs has sympathised with outgoing Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey’s injury problems ahead of Wales’ European Qualifying campaign]</b> I was about 28-years-old and similar to Aaron when I started all the yoga and a different diet. As a professional it takes a bit of time to know what your body can take. A lot of the time you are thinking, ‘I can get away with it’. The amount of times my hamstring was a little bit tight and sometimes I got away with it and other times I didn’t. It’s that gamble. When there is a big game on a Saturday and you want to be part of it and your hamstring is a bit tight - it’s hard.<br /><br />Aaron has played a lot this season compared to other seasons leading up to his injury and each game seemed to be a big one. It’s easy to say to players you have to manage yourself. But when there is the carrot of a game like a Europa League knock-out stages or a game that you are going for the top four it’s not easy because footballers want to play. If you can get away with it then you go for it. Suddenly it hits home. I remember it was Bayern Munich away (November 2001) and I did my hamstring the night before the game. It was in the last two minutes of training. People might think it was an over-exaggeration but I kept missing big games.<br /><br />I seriously considered giving up because of the disappointment that I kept getting injured. I went back to my room and I thought I’ve had enough of this. It was only for half an hour! It was just the level of disappointment.</p>

He will be with that pace but he’s got much more as well, he can go either side, he’s intelligent, he works hard and he’s a great lad as well. When you’ve got that raw pace you’re a threat at any level. As a winger you then have to develop the other parts of your game which will help you.

You have to be flexible because you don’t want things weighing on players’ minds, so if you can get it sorted it’s better for us and for the player as well. If it happens, United are getting an exciting player that I know Man United fans will get behind and enjoy watching him. It’s fantastic for everyone - for Dan, for Manchester United and a good deal for Swansea City as well.<br /><br /><b>[Giggs believes the youngster will slip seamlessly back into the fold]</b> He’s fine, he’s trained well. Obviously, after the terrible news, we had to be flexible and everything was on the table. I spoke to him numerous times over the last 10 days or so. He didn’t come to Portugal but met up with us to train in Wrexham. He went home on Thursday but he’s fine, he’s in a good place. He’s a level-headed lad. A lot has gone on over the last 10 days but he’s been fine around the group so we’ll just have to see whether he starts. But football-wise, he’s trained well and I’m really happy</p>

I have said before, in the training camp he was great, about the place he has been great. It’s difficult fitness wise having not played for a long time and then that short turnaround. The way he plays as well, those high-intensity sprints. It’s difficult. But he’s been fine around the place, no problem. It’s always a bit of a juggling act trying to find where Gareth can be effective. We have so many players who can play off the right or number 10. Gareth has shown over the last few years he can play up front, number 10, off the right. It’s my job to try and get his best position and to get the other players in their best positions as well.<br /><br /><b>[Having seen his side lose 2-1 in Croatia three days before their reverse in Hungary]</b> We’ve had two tough away games five weeks after the season finished, and you saw it in both games - a lot of the players were short of match fitness and we’re asking miracles of our players. Ethan Ampadu has not really played, I did well to get 50 minutes out of him. Brooksy <b>[David Brooks]</b> was the same. Asking Gareth Bale to play two games in a short space of time with the way he plays after not playing for six weeks. But still, we had enough chances to win the games. It’s tough, not enough of our players were at peak fitness but we have to probably win nearly every game now. We’ve made it really difficult for ourselves and we’re probably relying on other teams to drop points, which they will do, because it’s a competitive group. But obviously we have to start winning, if not win all of the games, then the majority of them</p>

  <p><b>[Wales boss Ryan Giggs has suggested that a loan move could be the best solution for Ampadu in the forthcoming campaign]</b> It’s just been a bit stop-start, together with the injuries, which is frustrating because he is an amazing talent and he’s shown that in the games he’s played. We’ve had players in the same situation - David Brooks, Harry Wilson, Ben Woodburn - talented players who’ve gone out on loan and benefited from it.</p>

  <p><b>[Giggs not surprised by Romelu Lukaku exit]</b> With Lukaku, with the way Ole has looked to play, with Anthony Martial up front, with Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood and he has probably looked at it and gone ‘maybe I am not going to get a lot of games out of him’. He is not the sort of player who can come in and out. He is either a player who starts and plays all the games, and he will score goals, but he is not a player to come in and out. I think Ole has looked at that and probably Lukaku has looked at that. But over the years players have wanted to leave, I don’t think it is anything new. It is more highlighted now because United aren’t doing as well as they did 10-15 years ago</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba continues to see his future at Manchester United called into question and Ryan Giggs believes he knows how to bring the Frenchman back in line - kick him in training]</b> Kick him in training. But that doesn’t happen anymore. You are starting to lose that. Now I’m not saying you kick everyone. But that was how Ronaldo got better. Scholesy would kick him if he took too many touches. And suddenly it clicked that you can’t keep dribbling or else I’m going to get kicked. I saw an interview with Vincent Kompany at the end of the season. And he’s a bit old school. He was asked about the week ahead of last game at Brighton and he said ‘sometimes I have to give a player a kick!’ And I was thinking City might miss that this year<br /><br /><b>[Pressed further on Pogba and how long he could stick around at Old Trafford]</b> I think the fans are split. Some fans say ‘let him go’, some fans recognise the quality he has got and that if he does go there will be a big void. If you get rid of all the players and you haven’t got quality to replace them then that is difficult as well. So it is a tough job for Ole that balancing act. Cristiano Ronaldo said he wanted to go and then did an extra year. Whether that is going to happen or not I don’t know<br /><br /><b>[Jurgen]</b> Klopp wasn’t brilliant overnight, but I think what you’ve seen from Klopp is improvement every year. It was a gradual improvement and I think as a United fan that’s what you want to see. Not saying we’re going to win the league this year, but if you start seeing improvements and a shift of culture with players you want to go and watch. We all want Ole to be successful, but even if he isn’t, I think he will leave the club in a better state than when he took over, which in itself is a job. In two or three years’ time some of these players are going to be top, top players. They are already good players, but in a few years they will be top players. Whether Ole is going to be successful in that time I don’t know, but introducing players like Mason Greenwood and Tahith Chong will stand the club in good stead.</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Giggs considers the £15 million deal Manchester United did for Daniel James to have been a no-brainer]</b> Ole asked me about him and I just told him that he is a player with plenty of potential. He’s really quick, a great lad, someone who you want in the dressing room, a great character. So, it was a no-brainer really, because he is a talent.<br /><br />From a standing start he is quick and he will beat anyone. It’s just that, like any other young winger, the finishing touches, that final ball, scoring more goals, which he will get better at. I watched him a lot for Swansea last year and he ripped nearly every full-back in that division apart<br /><br /><b>[While James caught the eye again at Molineux, it was Anthony Martial who found the target for United]</b> I’ve worked with him and he can do it. He is strong, and he can hold up the ball, proper centre-forward play. Balls into the channel, chesting it down, holding it up and laying it off and getting in the box, I think there’s a lot of promise there. He has to do it now for 90 minutes. If I was Ole Gunnar Solskjaer watching that, I’d be very pleased with his overall performance<br /><br /><b>[Giggs added on Martial’s impressive first-time finish with his left foot against Wolves]</b> It was a great goal. Of course you look at goals, what could you have done better defensively, but you’ve just got to look at the goal and think: ‘Well done, great strike.’ There’s not many players that can do that</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United midfielder Ryan Giggs believes that Marcus Rashford should have demanded to take the penalty Paul Pogba missed against Wolverhampton Wanderers]</b> <b>[Rashford is a]</b> centre-forward, scores a goal in his first league game, penalty, you get another penalty in the next game, you’ve got to be demanding to take it. It’s a shame, he was really disciplined tonight, Pogba. Pogba has not got a great record either of scoring penalties. He doesn’t score every penalty he takes. It seems like whoever wins the penalty gets to take it, I wonder if <b>[Harry]</b> Maguire or <b>[Victor]</b> Lindelof win the penalty, who gets to take it? I was surprised. I’m not surprised that Paul Pogba stepped up, because he’s that kind of player, which is obviously encouraging.<br /><br />I’m just surprised when you’ve scored a penalty the game before, that you get a penalty the next game you don’t take it. So you open up to criticism then, because if Marcus misses it then OK, you can miss a penalty, but now everybody is talking about why Marcus didn’t take it, why did Pogba take it? It should have been Marcus. It’s a strange one because before the game you usually have a designated penalty taker and you would think it would be Marcus after scoring last week. Like I say, he’s done it the week before. Again, there’s a conversation. Ole’s said after the game that they have two designated penalty takers and looking at this <b>[last week’s]</b> maybe they do, and again tonight they have the same conversation, so it’ll be interesting to see, ‘Do you fancy it? No, I fancy it?’<br /><br />If I’d have gone walking over to Ruud van Nistelrooy he’d have just said, ‘Go back!’ and he’d have put the ball underneath his shirt. There’s no way you’re getting the ball off him. So that’s why I find it a little bit difficult to understand, once a centre-forward has scored a penalty, next penalty they get, <b>[someone else is]</b> taking it.</p>

We needed to be strong and we have been. I was not happy with the number of corners we gave away, but they never really troubled us in open play and we could have scored a few more goals. Depending on the Croatia-Slovakia score, it sets us up nicely for Tuesday’s game<br /><br /><b>[It was Wales’ first away win since October 2018]</b> Some of our play was outstanding. Since the Azerbaijan game at home we’ve improved. We’ve played some difficult teams but overall the performances have improved.

It’s all these sort of things that you’re not getting off him at the moment.

I could never do that<br /><br />Because I’d come on as sub, I think beforehand they’d already done the list of penalty takers, and we had some good penalty takers. We had <b>[Carlos]</b> <a href="carlos-tevez.html">Tevez</a>, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> - who missed, we had <a href="michael-carrick.html">Michael Carrick</a>, <a href="owen-hargreaves.html">Owen Hargreaves</a> - obviously with his German background at Bayern he was never going to miss. So we had some really good penalty takers before as well. Some penalty takers who would be penalty takers in open play. Doubts over where to place the penalty? No, and that was the preparation during the week with <a href="carlos-queiroz.html">Carlos Queiroz</a> the coach. We’d practiced, tried to create a realistic atmosphere, which of course is nearly impossible. But <b>[we did]</b> the walk up from the centre-circle, place it, take it seriously, blow the whistle. What I’d done that week was I’d took about 15 penalties and scored 14, and the one that I’d missed hit the post - but every one was the same side. So I had the technique already in my head where I was gonna put it, it was just about me holding my nerve</p>

  <p><b>[Giggs explains how <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> overhauled <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>’s transfer policy]</b> <a href="daniel-james.html">Daniel James</a>’s not only a talented player. He’s a really good character and a solid lad. He wants to improve and that’s what I’ve seen over the last 18 months. Every time I went to watch him at <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a>, he was getting better and better and he’s had a great start to his United career. He’s a United player as well and someone who United fans will enjoy watching. He’ll beat men, he’ll make things happen and, of course, he has that devastating speed. But as I said, more than that for me, is he’s a really good character. I think that’s what Ole has tried to do over the last months, have some really good characters in the dressing room.<br /><br />It was a shame we had to pause the season because we were flying. Ole started his management with United flying, then had a tough spell, and then we were on a good run. But, like I said earlier, the players he’s got in have been really impressive. They’ve improved the team and the dressing room and obviously, in Fernandes, we’ve seen over the years the effect one player can sometimes have. You talk about the Eric Cantonas, the Robin van Persies … and I’m not comparing him yet to them but he’s made other players play better and he’s given everyone a lift. I still think we need four or five players but we’re definitely going in the right direction</p>

  <p><b>[Giggs backs <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> youngster Dylan Levitt to have bright career]</b> When Dylan was in the squad, we had must-win games, so I couldn’t really throw him in and put him in that pressure cooker. But, in training, he’s one of the best. He’s my kind of player - a good character, quiet but tough, and he’s one that I’ll be taking a big look at over the next year or so. I want him to develop and if he does and, if he plays more games, then he’ll definitely be in the reckoning. He’s a really intelligent player with a good range of passing and he stands out in training in every session. As I said, it’s just a shame that I couldn’t get him on the pitch<br /><br />Obviously, when I’ve been going away with them, I’ve not really played, but just being around them is amazing. Seeing the different side of international football, day in and day out, with everyone training at 100 per cent. We worked so hard to qualify so it’s a big shame really that it’s been pushed back <b>[until 2021]</b>. All of us were raring to go for the summer as soon as we beat Hungary so it’s a bit of a setback. I’ve seen the quotes from the manager and it really means a lot to hear that from someone who has achieved so much in the game</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs has opened up on the difference between former coaches <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> and Louis van Gaal]</b> I understand what Wayne was saying. Obviously we both worked under Sir Alex who I’ve known since I was 13. Sir Alex had everything - man-management, discipline, standards, tactics, knowing a player, but with him, because we had such good players who had been together for a long time, you’d just go out and play. You knew your role, it was just a matter of just tweaking it. With Louis it was probably the opposite. We played different systems under him whereas under Sir Alex we more or less just played one system and we’d tweak it. I can’t remember us ever playing three at the back, maybe once or twice if we needed to hold on, but other than that we didn’t.<br /><br />It was about getting an understanding of the different ways to play. So I know what Wayne was saying because Louis worked a lot more on the training pitch with regards to patterns of play and tactical work. He’d come from Holland and also an international background and he took that into club football, so we had a lot of meetings - players felt sometimes too many! With Sir Alex it was quite simple. I’m not saying we didn’t have meetings - of course we did - but we had such good players that the manager would just need to tell them once and it would just be a little tweak here and there, like Ji-sung Park would go and mark <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Pirlo</a> for example and Ji would do it and do it brilliantly. So I know what Wayne meant in terms of learning a lot under Louis</p>

He ran all day and he used to be a midfielder so he was comfortable on the ball, he could defend, he was tough and he actually broke my nose in the quarter-finals against them. He had everything as a defender.<br /><br />The best player is <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>. Obviously he was only with us for a short space of time, when he was brilliant, and then went on to do just as well as he did at United elsewhere. But Scholesy is the best player I played with at United. You’ve all seen him. In training, he was ridiculous, you couldn’t get near him. His brain was quicker than everyone else, his range of passing and he was nasty. If someone had taken the mickey out of him it was logged in the brain. Whether it be that training session or a week later or even six months later, he’d get you back. You’d think you’d got him in training and then he’d just pop the ball off and give the little feign, he was just brilliant in training</p>

  <p><b>[Giggs looking at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> for Wales inspiration]</b> I think what we have seen this year is <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are a fantastic team, managed by a great coach <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> and, it pains me to say it as a United fan, but they have been fantastic this season. Obviously they’ll go on and, whatever way it is, they’ll win the league and deserve it. They’ve had two brilliant seasons actually, last year pushing <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> all the way. They’re a great team to watch. There were certain things that I’ve taken out of the way that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> play, and taking it on to the way that I want to do with Wales. Hopefully United will bridge that gap and catch them up. But you have to give credit where credit is due and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have been fantastic this season.<br /><br /><b>[Asked about Old Trafford product Marcus Rashford]</b> It’s great when you see young players burst onto the scene and they’re just fearless. They just, don’t think too much about the game and just express themselves. And you think back to when you were like that. You have <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>, a young player who’s made the bold decision to leave <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and go to another country at a young age. And he really has made a difference. His team-mate as well, <a href="erling-haland.html">Erling Haaland</a> who’s scoring lots of goals. And I’ve got a lot of good young players in my Wales team, the likes of David Brooks, <a href="daniel-james.html">Dan James</a> and Ethan Ampadu</p>

Good players should be able to play with good players but we’ll have to wait and see. They both have lots of quality, it’s about if they can complement each other now<br /><br />Ole’s signings have been good, not only as players but they are good people. Fernandes coming in has given everyone a lift, it’s an exciting end to the season. It’s early doors to be talking about the players who have come in and made an impact <b>[such as Eric Cantona]</b> but certainly he’s off to a great start. He’s made players around him better and has just fitted in straight away. That’s always what you pray for when a new signing comes in. He looks a good guy as well, he wants to play for the club. He’s exciting, when he receives the ball he will try things, if something doesn’t come off he will try it again, he’s brilliant to watch. He’s given everyone a lift, the players around him, the staff, the fans. A really positive start but a long way to go yet</p>

  <p><b>[Giggs explains why he learned more from Van Gaal than Ferguson]</b> Obviously I had different international managers, but that’s only obviously a short space of time. That’s why I talk about Louis (van Gaal), regarding my coaching, because I’m actually two years in the meetings, <b>[taking]</b> responsibility, and I talk so fondly of him because that was really my first coaching role. Whereas when you’re playing, you don’t know the preparation<br /><br />You don’t know what the manager’s seen on the videos. Players get seven or eight minutes of watching the opposition, but the coaching staff watch hours and hours<br /><br />So that is completely different, it’s completely different, even though you’ve worked under a manager for so long. It was more sort of the man-management and the different things that Sir Alex would do that I’ve picked up on, whereas with Louis obviously I’ve seen first-hand different systems, why you play the different systems, the reasons for this and the reasons for that, It was a really good experience<br /><br />Amazing experience, amazing, and one, really, that made my mind up that I wanted to become a manager. I would say up until then that I was still unsure<br /><br />I just felt comfortable. I felt comfortable decision-making. I felt comfortable in that position. It was a brilliant experience. I was still doing my pro licence, but actually being in the job, having to make the decisions, all the pressure that you put yourself under, you can’t prepare yourself for that</p>
