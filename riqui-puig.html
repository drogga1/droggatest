  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> product Riqui Puig to ‘consider options’ if playing time doesn’t increase]</b> The Second B is a category that is passing through, players don’t want to be here for many years, because we aspire to play at a higher level<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he plans to leave <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> in January]</b> No, theoretically no. But we’ll see. I don’t close the door, but it’s true that I would like to have more minutes. If I don’t have any minutes, I will have to make a decision. I’m not training so much with the first team this season, whereas last year I was practically in the first team set-up, training with them and going down to play with the B team. But this is football and you have to play with your feet on the ground. I have to take the minutes and experience I get and I’m lucky that in the B side I play almost always<br /><br />It’s hard, because last year I was in the first team set-up and this year I am not participating so much. It’s football and I have to assimilate</p>
