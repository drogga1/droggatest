  <p><b>[father Paul Ince says <a href="tom-ince.html">Tom Ince</a> worth £25m]</b> If you’re talking £15m for <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a>, Thomas has got to be £25m. If you compare the two, Thomas should cost more. <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a> is a fantastic player, don’t get me wrong. <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a>’s a stronger runner and does a lot of tricks, whereas Thomas is more direct, he makes things happen and he scores goals. You’ve got a kid playing in the Championship who has scored 18 goals. When you look at the leading scorers, they’re all strikers, and he’s there amongst them. Potentially, I think he can reach that value. If Palace want £15m for <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a> who has scored six goals, it makes you wonder what price he’s going to be. You’re not going to get it because he’s not proven in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, but if United are paying £15m for <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a>, on the stats you’d have to say Thomas is worth a lot more than that. That’s my opinion.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Blackpool Manager Paul Ince recalls he was in good term with club chairman Karl Oyston who just fired him via text]</b> We had a good relationship. He had his way of doing things which were alien to the way I would but we never fell out. I got on well with his family, his wife and kids. It was disappointing I’ve had to hear it from my wife. He said because I was on the Pro-Licence that he couldn’t get hold of me<br /><br />These courses are vital. In Germany, managers and coaches have to miss games to get the Pro-Licence done. I would rather have been told face to face. Me and the chairman met on Sunday night, we had a conversation, we knew what we were doing. We had players on our list that we could have got, good players who would have improved the team, who have now gone to bigger clubs in the Championship<br /><br />It’s made me more determined. If I felt I couldn’t do the job as a manager I’d go and work on TV. Every club I have been to has involved firefighting: <a href="macclesfield-town-fc.html">Macclesfield</a>, MK Dons, <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a>, Notts County, Blackpool. I’ve managed to steer them away from trouble. I know what I’m doing. I work hard. I have an eye for good players<br /><br /><b>[He talked about why he wants to get back into management]</b> I’ve worked with some of the best players in the world. I’ve learned from some of the best managers, <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a>, <a href="terry-venables.html">Venables</a>, <a href="glenn-hoddle.html">Hoddle</a>, even as a kid, learning from John Lyall at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>, God rest his soul<br /><br />John Lyall was hard but fair. He did scare me but he was good for me. Eddie Baily <b>[<a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>’s chief scout back then]</b> said to Lyall: ‘The kid’s no good’. Lyall said: ‘I trust in this kid, he’s had a tough upbringing. I want to give him a chance’. I didn’t get any exams. I was always bunking school. I had no family life as a kid<br /><br />My dad left when I was two. My mum left me when I was 10 to go to Germany, looking for work, bar-work to make ends meet. My older brother went to live in Ipswich. My sister had to go and live in Germany. I lived with my cousins in Ilford, then in digs from 13. I’ve had to look after myself from a young age. Growing up, I wanted to be with my parents. It’s why I spend as much time as I can with my kids<br /><br />I had my own little family in Ilford <b>[Essex]</b>, a gang of boys, hanging around on the streets, getting into trouble, fighting. There were gangs, Beacontree, Canning Town, and we were Ilford. We used to meet up for punch-ups. I remember gatecrashing a party, got into a fight, ended up breaking someone’s ribs<br /><br />A week later at Chadwell Heath <b>[<a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>’s training ground]</b>, all of a sudden Mick McGiven <b>[one of Lyall’s coaches]</b> came over and said: ‘the Gaffer wants to see you’. I walked into the office and there were two policemen sitting there<br /><br />Lyall said: ‘I’ve been convincing these coppers not to take you to prison’. I played dumb. ‘Sorry, Gaffer, what are you on about? ‘You were in a fight last week, the boy reported you, you broke his ribs. They want to take you away. I convinced them I’m looking after you and it won’t happen again’<br /><br />The two coppers walked out and then Lyall absolutely lambasted me. ‘I’ve not got time to waste on you, you little pipsqueak. If you get in any trouble again, you can piss off’.<br /><br /><b>[He then had a coating of a different sort]</b> Chadwell Heath has these claret-and-blue gates, and I spent the next four weeks before and after training, getting in at 8am and finishing at 4pm, painting those gates and creosoting the fence<br /><br /><b>[Ince did well and in 1989 Ferguson came calling, talking to Lyall]</b> Lyall had looked after me since I was 13, was a father figure, and said to Fergie: ‘Listen, make sure you take over the responsibility of being a father figure to him’. That helped me. <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> was very kind to me. He wasn’t as intense with me as he was with other players<br /><br />I met him at a hotel in Waltham Abbey. He was sitting there, suit on, cup of tea, and I couldn’t believe I was in the same room as <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a>, the manager of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. It was always a dream of mine to play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. <a href="bryan-robson.html">Bryan Robson</a> was my idol. I always wanted to base my game on his - never actually got there. I always wanted to play for the team he was playing for. So to get the chance to go to United was fantastic<br /><br />Ferguson never coached; it was either <a href="brian-kidd.html">Brian Kidd</a> or Archie Knox. He would sit in his office and look down from his big window at the Cliff and if anyone was farting about, he’d be banging on the window and we all knew we were in trouble<br /><br />It was only on Thursday that we saw Ferguson in training, and then on Friday morning, doing the boxes with his silly little woolly hat on. Saturday was his domain. That’s when you really saw him. If I’d seen Ferguson every day on the training ground it wouldn’t carry that as much substance. It was special when we saw him. ‘Gaffer’s here, stand by your beds’<br /><br />We played Millwall at home in my first game <b>[Sep 16, 1989]</b>. I thought wow, <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>! We beat them 5-1 and I thought I’m really going to like it here. The next week, we went to Maine Road, got beaten 5-1 and I couldn’t go outside the hotel!<br /><br />Those were great teams. So many strong characters, myself, Robson, Keane, <a href="eric-cantona.html">Cantona</a>, <a href="steve-bruce.html">Bruce</a>, <a href="peter-schmeichel.html">Schmeichel</a>, so many egos, so many opinions. I’d argue with Keaney, Keaney would argue with <a href="peter-schmeichel.html">Schmeichel</a>, <a href="peter-schmeichel.html">Schmeichel</a> would argue with Brucey and everyone was shouting like little kids<br /><br />But <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a>’s voice was the one that counted. We were big giants and all of a sudden he walked in and we were like little boys. Sir Alex had a great presence. He was ‘the man’<br /><br />When people ask me what was the greatest ever United team under Ferguson, I always say 93-94, not because I was in it but because of the balance, the many big characters in that changing-room, who would answer <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> back, but he managed to gel us altogether to achieve something special. That’s the greatness of the man<br /><br /><b>[Ince made close friends at United, including <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a> and <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a>]</b> Giggsy was my best mate. He came from a split home so maybe that’s one reason we understood each other. I got on really well with his mum Lynne<br /><br />It got to the stage at one point where Giggsy was having problems at home and we’d talk about it. ‘Listen I’ve not had a dad since I was two and the most important person in your life is your mum. Not your girlfriend, not your wife, it’s your mum. Don’t worry too much about your dad. You’ve come so far without him’<br /><br />He ended up coming to stay with me for six months in Bramhall. He was a messy little bastard! His room had underpants and socks all over the place. I was saying to Claire: ‘Have you seen his room, it’s a disgrace.’ ‘Don’t worry,’ she said, ‘he’s only a kid!’ Giggsy did milk it. That’s where we built up our friendship. We used to practise goal celebrations in the bedroom. ‘No that’s not right, let’s try this one’ and eventually got it. That’s where we got those stupid dances!<br /><br />He’s a smashing kid. To see him still playing now is amazing. I remember two years ago he came to my villa in Portugal with Stacey and the kids. He took his top off and he was just the same size as when he started playing. I thought I’d better leave my top on! He’s brilliant, converting from a flying-machine winger to playing in the centre of the park where he’s got to be cleverer<br /><br />Me, Giggsy and Eric used to go out, have dinner, and we’d get on really, really well. Eric was funny, a good character, great company. When he was trying to be serious, me and Giggsy would be laughing. Eric would say: ‘What are you laughing at?’ ‘Nothing Eric. You’re 6ft 2in. We’re not laughing’<br /><br />Eric was the best trainer I’d ever trained with. This was someone who used to come in at 9am at the Cliff, doing his own warm-up before anyone got there. We’d turn up at 9.45 and he’d been out there working on his skills for 45 minutes, left foot, right foot, every day. After about three months, I was there training early with him, Giggsy was there, Sharpey was there, copying him. I had to work on my left foot because it was rubbish. Now my left is nearly as good as my right all because of Eric<br /><br /><b>[By 1993, the United midfielder was acquiring more England caps, and also the armband, against the USA on the summer tour in Foxboro]</b> The first question I got asked was: ‘what’s it like to be the first black England captain?’ I’d never really thought about it that way, I said. I was just proud to be England captain. I didn’t really look at my colour. Other people did. The fan-mail was unbelievable. I had 400-500 letters. They were from deprived kids. They were from mums and dads whose sons were in trouble, but I’d inspired them by becoming the first black England captain<br /><br />They’d write: ‘Can you come down and have a chat with my kid’. I thought I can’t chat to 400 people. I replied to all the letters. I wrote: ‘If you work hard, and believe, you will get there in the end. That was the case with me: have the passion to deal with the obstacles put in your way’<br /><br /><b>[Ince was a passionate player, giving everything, learning from managers, playing under <a href="roy-hodgson.html">Roy Hodgson</a> after moving to Inter in 1995 and then absorbing ideas under <a href="terry-venables.html">Venables</a> with England]</b> When I look back to euro 96 with <a href="terry-venables.html">Venables</a>, he played three at the back more or less, a great bit of tactical genius from Terry. We should have won euro 96. We played good football, 4-1 against Holland, all passion and being on the front foot<br /><br />Even during the Spain game when we got battered <b>[and won on penalties]</b>, I felt it was our time. Against Germany, I still think <a href="paul-gascoigne.html">Gazza</a>’s going to get to that ball <b>[sliding in and almost scoring]</b>. I was taking the sixth penalty after <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a>. When he missed I was a bit relieved! I’m joking Southy! Penalties are a lottery. We should have beaten the Germans<br /><br /><b>[In 1997, Ince left Inter for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I could have gone to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> or <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. <a href="ruud-gullit.html">Ruud Gullit</a> was at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and wanted me. So did <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsène Wenger</a> at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I thought: ‘I spent six great years at United, I liked the North-west’. So I chose <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I loved <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, everything about it. The fans were unbelievable. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> had the Bridge and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> had <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Highbury</a> but there was something bigger about <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. The European nights, the history. The chance to play at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> was something I couldn’t turn down<br /><br />I was good friends with Macca (Steve McManaman), Jamie (Redknapp), Jamo (David James) and Robbie (Fowler). They felt I was the missing piece in the jigsaw in midfield to go on and do things. We had a really good side, me and Jamie and <a href="patrik-berger.html">Patrik Berger</a>, <a href="steve-mcmanaman.html">McManaman</a>, <a href="michael-owen.html">Michael Owen</a> and <a href="robbie-fowler.html">Robbie Fowler</a>, Karlheinz Riedle. If our defence had been great we would have won the title the year we finished third <b>[in 97-98]</b><br /><br /><b>[One of Ince’s most memorable games came while a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> player for England in qualifying for France 98, getting the required point in Rome, although they almost lost when <a href="christian-vieri.html">Christian Vieri</a> went close late on]</b> That was a very good Italian team. That <a href="christian-vieri.html">Vieri</a> header! I was in London the other day with Thomas <b>[after his loan move to <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>]</b> and people came up, saying ‘remember Rome, you captained your country, you’d done <b>[cut]</b> your head’<br /><br />I remember Demetrio Albertini elbowed me. I remember the doctor putting the stitches in, must have been the worst stitches put in. It kills me because it’s killed my hair! He was rushing, digging deeper and <a href="glenn-hoddle.html">Hoddle</a> was trying to do a team-talk. All the lads said they could hear me screaming because the doc was screwing up my stitches<br /><br />The only other thing I remember was late on, <a href="ian-wright.html">Ian Wright</a> cutting inside, hitting the post, him falling on the floor, <a href="teddy-sheringham.html">Teddy Sheringham</a> hitting the rebound, it getting blocked and him falling on the floor. Italy go down the pitch with <a href="roberto-donadoni.html">Roberto Donadoni</a>, who crosses, <a href="christian-vieri.html">Vieri</a> heads it and <a href="david-seaman.html">David Seaman</a> is going the other way. It was like slow motion. I remember it going past the post<br /><br />I turned and looked up the pitch and it was like a war-zone. Wrighty was on the floor, <a href="teddy-sheringham.html">Sheringham</a> was on the floor, their bench was on the floor, heads in hands. So was our bench. But we got through. I felt then that we could do well at the World Cup. I looked at players like Dave <a href="david-seaman.html">Seaman</a> and <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a>, and sensed that we would do really well. We had a good mix, old-school and young like Michael, we had flair and leaders<br /><br /><a href="glenn-hoddle.html">Hoddle</a> was so into his football. I can’t believe <a href="glenn-hoddle.html">Hoddle</a> is not managing now. He has so much to give. He was so methodical. He was the <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> of ‘98 because he was so far ahead of the game. He’d learned under <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>. If <a href="glenn-hoddle.html">Hoddle</a> had stayed with England, we might have won something because he was that far ahead of anyone else<br /><br /><b>[England’s hopes in the round of 16 against Argentina were compromised by <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>’s dismissal for a gentle kick out at <a href="diego-simeone.html">Diego Simeone</a>]</b> Becks getting sent off was devastating. I think we would have beaten Argentina and gone on to win that World Cup if we’d stayed at 11. That’s not to say anything against Becks. That’s probably a sending-off now but not back in ‘98. It was madness. It was a poor decision<br /><br />Even now, I think of the shot I had at 2-2, 20 yards out. I think of what would have happened in my life if that had gone in. I’m not a great penalty-taker but I felt I’d had such a good game, playing so well, that if it came to penalties I was taking one. I was that confident. I’ll score. Then I missed a penalty and I felt it’s all my fault.<br /><br />It hurt me more than ‘96. It was the World Cup. I felt that squad would never come together again. It was a morgue in the dressing-room. <a href="tony-adams.html">Tony Adams</a> was trying to lift everyone, saying ‘we’ve done well with 10’. A few of us were in tears.<br /><br />Becks was in tears. What Becks then had to go through was a disgrace, the way he was treated. It showed Becks’ strength of character to turn it around, score the winner against Greece to take England to the next World Cup. But ‘98 was my last chance. It killed me<br /><br /><b>[His club career kept going strong, continuing at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and then Middlesbrough]</b> I didn’t want to leave <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> <b>[in ‘99]</b>. But <a href="gerard-houllier.html">Gerard Houllier</a> said they were trying to sign Marc-Vivien Foe, God rest his soul<br /><br />I’d had a really good season. I was 31. I had a lot left in me. Four years on, I was still playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> against <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Stevie Gerrard</a>. There was no reason to bring someone else in. But I’m not one to hold grudges. I got Player of the Year two years in a row at Middlesbrough and then went to <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> and played under Glenn again<br /><br />But my legs started to ache, I struggled to get up in the morning, and I started focusing on going into management. I never wanted to be a coach. I’m not a good coach. I don’t like coaching. I like to manage<br /><br /><b>[Ince wants more players from his generation and more recent ones to move into management]</b> People like <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a> - can we convince them to go into management?<br /><br />You’ve got <a href="tim-sherwood.html">Tim Sherwood</a> at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> with <a href="les-ferdinand.html">Les Ferdinand</a> on the bench. Weighty was always going to be a pundit. That’s his character and he does a fantastic punditry job. I look at <a href="sol-campbell.html">Sol Campbell</a> and Dave <a href="david-seaman.html">Seaman</a>, played for England, where are they now? <a href="steve-mcmanaman.html">McManaman</a>, Fowler. <a href="alan-shearer.html">Shearer</a> tried his hand at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. Gareth is now doing the Under-21s<br /><br />Look at the Spanish and Germans and they all have ex-players involved in their national set-ups. We need to get the players in who’ve had the experiences, who are role models for these kids in the England Under-19s, who are earning a lot of money and think they’ve made it. They need coaches they respect straight away<br /><br /><b>[Ince’s managerial career started in unglamorous surrounds]</b> If somebody had offered me a job in the Premiership when I left <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>, I wouldn’t have taken it. I wanted to learn my trade, learn how to manage. I went to Swindon for four months, played a few games for Wisey and <a href="gus-poyet.html">Gus Poyet</a>, but it was mainly to look and learn. I did some coaching there, got to know the mentalities of the players. Sir Alex always said to me: ‘Motivation is the key to success’. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> inspires players<br /><br />I have still a lot to learn. But I’ve done it the right way. I went to <a href="macclesfield-town-fc.html">Macclesfield</a> who were bottom of League Two. I got more phone calls from people saying ‘you are absolutely mad’ then saying ‘congratulations on your first job’. Before my first team-talk at <a href="macclesfield-town-fc.html">Macclesfield</a> I’ve never been so nervous. I couldn’t sleep the night before. But I kept <a href="macclesfield-town-fc.html">Macclesfield</a> up. I loved it there, putting the alarm on and locking the stadium up at 7.30pm<br /><br /><b>[Ince went on to MK Dons, and then <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a>]</b> I thought: ‘Jesus Christ, this is the Premiership, this is my chance’. In hindsight, I shouldn’t have taken the <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> job. It came too soon. <a href="brad-friedel.html">Brad Friedel</a> went. <a href="david-bentley.html">David Bentley</a> went. They had four great years under <a href="mark-hughes.html">Mark Hughes</a> but it needed rebuilding. There was this trust fund. They weren’t actually putting any money into the club. It was really tough<br /><br /><b>[He went back to MK Dons and then on to Notts County]</b> They were in trouble. But we got Thomas on loan <b>[from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b>, Lee Miller on loan (from Middlesbrough) and went on a great run on a terrible pitch. This is what frustrates me: right, bang, we’d just beaten Sunderland away in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup, got <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in the next round, drew 1-1 at Meadow Lane, and were trying to change the culture of the club. We couldn’t bring any players in and it killed us<br /><br />It was exactly the same at Blackpool. Last year, they were going down, me and Alex came in, and our record was phenomenal, play-off form, and we managed to keep them up. I’m meticulous. Me and Alex got in early, didn’t leave the office until 7.30 at night. We didn’t cut corners<br /><br />Anyway, we went to pre-season in Portugal. We had eight first-team players, eight kids and eight trialists. You don’t build a team from that. But we got off to a flying start. I knew the first XI we had at Blackpool could compete with anyone in the Championship with the motivation I give them<br /><br />I knew as soon as we lost one or two to injury that we’d struggle. That’s why I had targets to come in to improve the team. But I wasn’t allowed to do it. I’d like to think people would understand what a great job I did at Blackpool. Football people know that<br /><br /><b>[He has hardly stopped talking, pausing only for a sip of water. Now 46, Ince also so much to say about the problems with English football generally]</b> We are too obsessed with foreign managers. Because we have an influx of so many foreign players the owners think the best way is to bring in foreign coaches because they understand the culture of foreign players. Even watching the City-Chelsea game on Monday I was thinking everyone was foreign <b>[19 of the 22 starters]</b>. That can’t be right. As a former England player, that kills me<br /><br />The problem we have is that <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> are not interested in England. <a href="fa.html">The FA</a> are but don’t have the power. We get through the group phases at a World Cup, play against a better team, get beaten and all of a sudden everyone says: ‘damn, we don’t have enough world-class players’<br /><br />Well, we’re not going to have enough world-class players if we keep bringing in foreign players. There has to be some stipulation where you can only bring so many foreign players in. But <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is so big now, it’s a train that’s not stopping<br /><br />It saddens me more over what will happen next for England. <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> is coming to the end of his career, probably has another two years.

But sometimes at centre half, he wants to go forward with the ball and gets himself in positions he shouldn’t<br /><br />Look at the good England sides - Euro 96, France 98. They had characters, men, leaders. We’re not getting leaders any more. It’s the fault of the Academy system and society. Kids are getting snapped up by <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs at seven, coached at an early age. It’s not ‘go and enjoy football’. If they look half-decent they’re getting four-year contracts, their parents are being given money. Parents from foreign countries are being invited over and given a job<br /><br />Why are these <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> kids playing Under-21s? They should be playing <b>[on loan]</b> for League One or Two teams. You get more characters at <a href="macclesfield-town-fc.html">Macclesfield</a> and Notts County because they’re grown men, who’ve seen a bit of the outside world<br /><br />Thomas could have signed a four-year deal at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. He said: ‘As much I love <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, I need to go and see the real world.’ That’s why he went to Notts County where he could get kicked and no one cares who you are. He’s learned a lot from that<br /><br />When I see all these kids in the England Under-21s, they’ve not been in the real world. They get too much, too soon. You see them driving around in nice cars and I’m thinking ‘you’ve not achieved anything yet’. I see them with earrings and tattoos. They think they’ve made it. A lot of players are more interested in looking like players rather than being players<br /><br />Tom has no earrings, no tattoos. He wants to be a player. It would be easy for him to look like a player because ‘I’m Paul Ince’s son’ but he wants his own identity, to get away from ‘Paul Ince’s son’. He’s different to other kids. They just go on their PlayStations but Thomas will sit and watch games with me, Spanish, French, Italian football<br /><br />I can have a conversation with him about any player. I don’t just want him to play the game; I want him to understand the game. If he goes to the next level, if somebody like <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> or <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> says something to him, he will be able to take it in rather than go ‘uh?’ Maybe in 10 or 20 years’ time he might want to be a manager. He’s competitive - and polite<br /><br />I’m polite. People don’t think I’m polite because they only see me from when I played football: aggressive, moans and shouts but only because I want to win. They don’t see me in my normal life, relaxed with my family. I’m quiet. But I want to get managing again. But I don’t want to keep jumping into fires all the time. I want a chairman who says: ‘right here’s a three-year plan’ and have some stability.<br /><br />But when I look back I can’t complain, I’m a lucky, lucky man to have won trophies, played at Wembley, played in a World Cup. I’m privileged<br /><br />I was the first black England captain. I was the first black <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> manager. I am a trailblazer for other black people. I’m a pioneer</p>

When you’re at Bayern Munich and you’re winning 4-0 or 5-0 every week that’s great, but when you come to the Premier League every game is a tough game.

I think the most important trophy for them now is the Europa League because that’s the avenue to get into the Champions League. There’s no let up at the top with the top six teams trying to get four places and obviously Man Utd were disappointing in the 1-1 against Bournemouth. It’s not a foregone conclusion that they’re going to get in the top four. So when you look at it the Europa League has got to be massive for Mourinho, really, really massive. He’s got a big enough squad, looking at the bench there’s people who can come on and change the game, that’s a good thing. He’s got two shots at it, Mourinho. A club like Man Utd has to be playing in the Champions League so fingers crossed that will be the case<br /><br />I never thought that Man Utd would challenge <b>[for the title]</b> because I thought they were too far behind under Van Gaal and they went backwards for a couple of years.

United’s group opponents Basel, Benfica and CSKA Moscow will not be the acid test and he will not be fazed by them, but he needs to learn quickly so he is ready when the real elite stuff comes later in the season; knockout games against the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain.<br /><br />Lukaku is a goalscoring machine and would cause problems to any defence in the world because of the way he runs at people and keeps his composure in the penalty area.

And if they’d been better in front of goal, no one would be moaning about their defence. There’s got to be more onus on those forward players for not getting the ball in the net and being more clinical<br /><br /><b>[The forwards]</b> are getting away with it and avoiding the criticism, even though it’s those players at fault for missing golden chances.

Klopp will get that right, just like he has the forward line. But there could also be an issue with protection from the wingers and some of the midfield players too, defending should start right from the front.<br /><br />If you allow balls to go into the box willy-nilly, with wingers not doing their jobs then, yes, it’s going to end in goals.

To go to Anfield is different gravy, this is where they’ll truly be tested for the first time this season. United have to prove they really are title contenders. But Jurgen Klopp has more to prove than Jose Mourinho. If Liverpool lose, could you really class them as title contenders?<br /><br />At the minute, I can’t see it anyway. They’re way behind United and City and if they drop three more points here, they’re not going to make that gap up - no chance. It’s a huge game for Liverpool. If you look at the two sides at the minute, everything considered, you have to say United are way ahead of Liverpool. Win or lose, United will still be challenging for the title. Liverpool don’t come close<br /><br />Jose will want to win it. He can answer those doubters who are saying, ‘Well, they’ve not played anyone yet’. It’s a chance to shut people up. They’re scoring lots of goals, Romelu Lukaku is on fire, and that could really be the difference between the two teams. Liverpool don’t take chances and their defence is poor, you would think Lukaku would have too much for that back line.<br /><br />Man United at Anfield, against that back line, in the form they’re in now - they’ll score. There’s no doubt about it. There’s been a lot of unrest in Klopp’s side and United seem to know what they’re doing - that shows in the way that they’re playing</p>

  <p><b>[Romelu Lukaku critics need to get real]</b> When Romelu Lukaku came to Manchester United, and he was bagging goals for fun, no one was saying a thing. Not one United fan was moaning. Now, he hasn’t scored in a few games and suddenly loads of fans are on his back. They need to get real. We’re talking about someone who has scored 11 goals for United already, and we’re only at the start of November. Let’s get it right. So, when I see that Mourinho has had a dig at the fans for booing, I literally couldn’t agree with him any more for doing that. Those fans needed telling.<br /><br />When I was playing, even when things were going badly wrong, fans would support their team. They’re called supporters for a reason. And I think there’s a huge difference between ‘fans’ and ‘supporters’ nowadays. When you look at Huddersfield fans, they are what you would call a traditional supporter. They stick by their team whether things are going right or wrong. I was at Anfield for the game last week, and they didn’t stop singing, even when they were three goals down. Then you look to some United fans, whose side are second in the table, but they were booing their top goalscorer. It’s mental.<br /><br />If you’re a proper fan, you can’t just support someone only when they’re playing well. The proper Man United fans will be backing Lukaku whether he’s doing well or whether he’s having a rough patch</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United could be in the market for up to four players in the summer transfer window]</b> There’s a seriously big summer coming for Manchester United. When you’re a club like that, you’re always trying to improve. And sometimes, that means current players lose out, but that’s just how it goes. Come summer, I’m expecting around three or four more players to come to Old Trafford. There are still issues to address, and it’s all Jose Mourinho forming his team.<br /><br />He came out the other day and said he thought Luke Shaw was world class. I can see what he’s getting at, but he’s gone from slating him and refusing to playing him to saying he’s one of the best in the world. I know what he’s trying to do, give him a boost, but I’m not sure it’s right to go calling him world class. It sounds brutal, but that left-back area will surely be one of Jose’s priorities. Matteo Darmian has been far from impressive, and I still don’t believe Mourinho thinks Shaw is the answer. Danny Rose is a name that keeps popping up, with him not getting a game at Tottenham, and he would be fantastic at United. If I was Mourinho, I’d be looking to sign him.<br /><br />Another one you have to think about is how long is Antonio Valencia going to keep going? He’s been truly incredible this season, and he still looks strong and fit, but he’s 32 now and it would be good to have cover sooner rather than later for him. No United fan likes to accept it, but the chances are those chats from Real Madrid about David de Gea will start rearing their heads again. So, if you’re Mourinho and you know they could be on the horizon, do you start looking out for a top class goalkeeper?<br /><br />This one might shock people, but I reckon Mourinho will be on the lookout for another striker. A different kind of striker to Lukaku, more of a fox in the box. Obviously, it looks as though Zlatan Ibrahimovic could be on his way out unfortunately, so he could do with having a back-up option there. Someone who is lethal in front of goal is needed at the club, an out and out goal scorer. If there’s one player that doesn’t deserve to lose out with Sanchez’s arrival, it’s <b>[Anthony]</b> Martial. He is one of the most talented players in the league, and probably still has 25 per cent worth of improvement to come. He’s frighteningly good</p>

He looks like a totally different player. It’s probably due to the fact that, pre-Sanchez, he was the main man. He was the kingpin and the one everyone was talking about. But the arrival of Sanchez has taken the shine off him. What I would say is, at United, you’re all main men. You should all perform like that, too. Looking at the Newcastle game, you could see from his body language that he’s fed up. Whatever it is, it’s a problem that needs addressing.</p>

I can understand why Pogba might feel irritated with the position Mourinho currently has him playing in. He likes to roam, he likes to attack. He wasn’t signed to be a holding midfield player and that’s clearly not what he enjoys or is best at. So why does he insist on playing him there?<br /><br />The signals that are coming from Pogba is that he’s not happy and if he doesn’t feel like he fits in, then I could see him leaving in the summer. He’s one of the best players in the world and deserves to be played in his right position where he can show that off and express himself</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba is not suited to Jose Mourinho’s Manchester United]</b> Pogba has been made a scapegoat for the way the team are performing, when he’s the one being played out of position. But he isn’t the only problem. If you put the Frenchman into Manchester City’s team, or even Tottenham’s team, you’ll see a better player. I don’t believe that the way Jose Mourinho has United playing is suited to him. Alexis Sanchez looks as though he’s trying to do everything at once, there’s no connection between the players. When you look at Spurs, there are players who work together so well, like <b>[Harry]</b> Kane, <b>[Christian]</b> Eriksen, <b>[Mousa]</b> Dembele and Son <b>[Heung-min]</b>. They link up together - but it all feels disjointed in the Manchester United attack. They don’t know how to play with each other.<br /><br />Let’s get one thing straight. Pogba is not a defensive midfield player. But at the minute, he doesn’t fit in the team and the balance isn’t right. I’d go as far as to say that <b>[Romelu]</b> Lukaku, Sanchez and Pogba all on the same pitch just isn’t working out at the minute<br /><br />David De Gea is the only world class player at Manchester United - Paul Pogba isn’t there yet. Him and Anthony Martial have the potential to be, but there’s still some way to go. Fans of the club have an expectation of how they expect the team to play - and they just aren’t doing it at the minute. If United carry on playing the way they are, and forcing Pogba to play as a defensive player, you’re going to get supporters turning against you</p>

I can understand he was probably annoyed at Marouane Fellaini being chosen ahead of him, but you shouldn’t take those frustrations out on the rest of the team and the happiness of the fans. Irrespective of what’s going on, whether you’ve been having a tough time of it lately or you’re feeling irritated at not being selected, you need to appreciate what an honour it is to be at United. And you need to put a shift in, if not for yourself but for the sake of your team-mates and loyal fans.<br /><br />Sanchez keeps trying to do things and make things happen, but the more he does the worse the team gets. I’d bet that he probably wished he’d waited until the end of the season and gone to another team. It’s evident, from watching United since he joined, that he doesn’t suit how Jose Mourinho plays football. You could see him fitting in at Manchester City better. Maybe Jose’s plan is to bring in players that do suit the way <b>[Romelu]</b> Lukaku, Sanchez and Pogba play, but how much more can you spend to satisfy other players? They need to look at themselves and how they’re playing, rather than relying on others to help them out</p>

  <p><b>[Mourinho moaning concerns Paul Ince]</b> The way Jose Mourinho does things, as someone who has been a manager previously and has worked under Alex Ferguson, isn’t for me. When it comes to addressing players and calling them out, it should be done in-house. It definitely shouldn’t be done in the press and that’s the way it has been with Manchester United in the past. I don’t think there are any situations where a manager should call out a player in public, and it’s not the first time it has happened with Luke Shaw. Which, depending which way you look at it, either says a lot about the player himself or the manager saying it. For me personally, it’s something that needs to be dealt with in the club. Man United have got enough problems, and maybe they should focus on those instead of focusing on Shaw.<br /><br />We’re talking about a player who a few months ago, Jose called world class. Make your mind up. Suddenly, it looks as though he’s going to leave the club. And who knows, maybe he could have been world class. But he’s not been given much of an opportunity by Mourinho to show it. It’s clear Mourinho wants a reaction out of him. It’s a tactic he’s done in the past, but whether that’s right or wrong I’m not sure. It’s only pushing Luke further out of the door, but sometimes, it does come down to attitude. Ashley Young is getting older, and Shaw should be grabbing the chance to be the first choice left-back with two hands, but he doesn’t seem interested. This is his last chance</p>

Don’t get me wrong, it’s always going to be tough when the big boys come calling. It’s hard to ignore Real Madrid or Barcelona - as we saw with Philippe Coutinho and Luis Suarez. But I believe Salah should sit tight. There’s a lot of progression at Liverpool, they’re slowly but surely evolving. Creeping up the table, and doing fantastically in the Champions League. If Salah sits tight and enjoys the ride, he could find himself on a trophy-winning team next season, where he would be the star man.<br /><br />We’ve seen that plenty of times <b>[players flopping after big-money moves]</b>, but he’s a real rare talent. Liverpool will be in Europe again; they’ll have some new additions in the team and he will easily net 30 goals. He’s only 25-years-old, he still has plenty of time. He must be enjoying his football, and he’s at a club which have a very good team and manager, and will allow him to play exactly how he wants. He could end up regretting throwing that away, and potentially being sat on another team’s bench<br /><br />It’s only been a season, but if he proves he’s at this level consistently for another couple of years, then you can start to say it. He’s had a phenomenal season, but to be one of Anfield’s best ever, you need to keep re-producing that form</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool may be Champions League challengers]</b> The facts speak for themselves. Manchester City will win the Premier League by 18-20 points - across 38 matches that’s a massive gap. People will say that they have been so far ahead that they have been playing without the usual pressure of competition. They can play their brand of football knowing they have a safety net of points. And that’s true. But when you look at Liverpool, there is still this question of consistency. Can they take on the likes of Watford at Vicarage Road and stamp their authority on a game, stick to their principles and come away with three points? They just about managed it at Crystal Palace last week. But beating Spurs and Manchester United proved beyond them. Manchester City have answered those different questions. Liverpool have shown signs that they can - but also signs that they are not quite there yet, particularly before Christmas.<br /><br />There has been an upturn since Virgil van Dijk arrived at the club. The backbone has been stiffened. And to be fair to Klopp, losing a player such as Philippe Coutinho might have derailed lesser teams. It’s happened midway through the season, not at the start and, if anything, that makes the upturn in Liverpool’s form even more commendable. It shows that Klopp is on the right lines. I think a couple of players have moved up a level under him too. I couldn’t see where Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was going to fit in the jigsaw, but he has added to the balance of the side. That’s what I like about Liverpool, there’s a good balance and energy about that team now. It’s taken Klopp a while, but he’s got there. And his Liverpool teams want to take risks, want to entertain. The fans are definitely happier. Mo Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino put bums on seats. That wait for the title may go on a little longer yet, but Liverpool are developing the right way and going forward</p>

I know that because I went the other way from the intense Premier league to Serie A with Inter where it was a lot slower. It took a while to adjust. I can relate to Pogba losing the ball, ambling around. That’s Pogba, that’s his body language. I think my game changed from Man United when I was up and down, going into tackles, playing the way I played. As soon as I went to Inter, I was not allowed to tackle. Every time I did they rolled over and screamed! I was sent off more times at Inter than anywhere else in my career but I became a better player, a more technical player. Italy was all about technique - not about tackling. I had to change as a player. For me, Pogba has to go the other way. Pogba needs to be more aggressive and angry with himself. When he gets angry he tends to play. I remember me and Roy Keane used to wind each other up on the pitch at United because we knew it would help us play<br /><br />He has had the luxury of playing at Juventus, winning the title every year, where the onus is not on him because he has great players around him. He’s come from a team playing 3-5-2 where he is allowed to be flexible in the way he plays and not having to focus on defending. He always had five defending with three at the back and two sitting in there. He had licence to roam all over the pitch and get into the space and do what he does best</p>

Some of things England managers have been getting up to in the years since have put into perspective the so-called reasons why the FA got rid of those two managers, but the damage was done and it cannot be repaired.

That’s why sometimes you see him getting caught on the ball. He thinks he can go at his own leisurely pace. You forget that two years ago he was playing in a Juventus team that was winning every game and winning the Scudetto all the time. He could do what he wants. He could run where he wants and dictate in a 3-5-2 system. All of a sudden he comes to a United team that’s not as good as the Man City team. Not playing the style of football that the Liverpool team or other teams are playing. He has found it hard and that’s why he gets caught on the ball. If you put good players around Pogba then you will see him improve and he needs to get angry with himself. Me and Roy Keane used to get angry with ourselves just to make ourselves better.

Irrespective of what happened in the Champions League. I am not going down that road but I think they need another goalkeeper. He has not been sure all season, whether it is Karius or Mignolet. I think he will wanna go. I like Alexander-Arnold, he is a young kid and will improve, he will come back. So on the basis, I think they will need another striker. I think they need a target man. I know they have got the little players for how he plays but I think they need a target man. You need a target man sometimes, when you are chasing the game. When you just put balls into the box and I think someone like that. I expect them to be up there again challenging. It all depends on who City will buy. City will buy.

That’s like six and a half games more or less but the other teams can beat them. There are ways of beating them. Huddersfield got a point against them. Teams will defend deep against them and they won’t always break them down. I just think you if you can match them and fight fire with fire, you can exploit City because they do leave gaps in behind. For United, if you just sit back then they just open teams up because they have got Silva’s and De Bruyne who can just unlock those deep blocks up. So you want to stay in the game but fight fire with fire. Look at the second half where they won 3-2. They got lucky there because they should have been 6-0 down at half-time and wouldn’t have scored as many goals but the second half performance was something that you want to see.

The reason Lingard is playing so well in Russia is totally down to Jose. He was playing him regularly for United, and stepped up and showed what he’s made of, but Mourinho took that risk, not Southgate. If <b>[Marcus]</b> Rashford had played as well for United as Lingard did this season maybe he would be getting more England starts than him, but he didn’t. Mourinho has seen Lingard as an impact player and you can see Southgate using those same tactics with him. I’m not sure where Scholesy was coming from with this one, everyone’s entitled to their opinions, but from where I’m sitting it’s Mourinho that’s given Lingard the opportunity he has got and he deserves some credit for it. That’s why his form at the World Cup is so impressive and he owes the Man United gaffer for that.</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho is looking grumpy and could walk out on Manchester United]</b> Jose has said that he wants to stay at United for life. To be fair, most managers would say that. But managers do get frustrated. They want to take the club forward, they want to build and bring players in. He sees Liverpool spending big and he wants to compete. If he feels he’s not getting that from Ed Woodward and the Glazers, he’s going to be grumpy. If Jose doesn’t get the tools he feels he needs to win this title, then there’s a real chance that he will just go.<br /><br />You don’t want to see all this negativity. It’s the start of the season, it’s supposed to be an exciting time. The fans want to see a different Manchester United, a more attacking one which we didn’t see last season. He <b>[Mourinho]</b> should be talking about the players coming to Old Trafford, how he’s changed the style and how it’s going to be exhilarating. But we’re less than a week away from the start of the season it’s doom and gloom. Bad signals are coming out of Manchester United, it’s not good and I just don’t see any positivity there</p>

I know Klopp said a few years ago that he didn’t believe in that but, like anything in life, situations change in football. And Jurgen won’t care about that. His main goal is to compete with Man City. The Liverpool fans want the Holy Grail, which is the Premier League. He wants to bring it to them so, if that means spending money, and it’s there to spend, why shouldn’t he splash the cash? I know there are clowns out there who want to make Jurgen Klopp look like an idiot, but I’m not buying it.

Everything should be geared towards the first game of the season but instead it is all about Mourinho.

They’re becoming a laughing stock, and falling behind. They finished second last season, and will probably make the top four this year, but is that what they should be striving for? No. Realistically, their goal should be to win the Premier League. But they just cannot compete with Manchester City or Liverpool at the minute. If they lose against Tottenham on Monday, for example, they could find themselves six points behind City with three games gone already.<br /><br />At Manchester United, everything from top to bottom is in chaos, and it shows. Everyone - from Jose Mourinho not getting his transfer targets to the frustrated players and fans - look unhappy. So how do you expect to win anything? That’s the whole lot, from the top down, Ed Woodward, Jose Mourinho, Paul Pogba, everything is a total mess. You would never have seen this going on with Sir Alex Ferguson as manager, especially not playing out in public. I could see why it would be playing on the minds of supporters that this season might end up like the Chelsea 2015-16 one. I can see now that fans are turning against Jose Mourinho, and I can understand why. When you see Man City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham - they’re all playing the kind of football you expect from a Manchester United side. After last year, the way he set up his teams and some of the football the fans had to endure, you’d have thought he’d have tried a different technique this time around. I watched the game on Sunday, and I physically couldn’t see what Mourinho and United were trying to do. There was no game-plan whatsoever</p>

United are in danger of becoming a team known for sacking managers after a couple of years. They’ve now gone through Van Gaal, Moyes and maybe Mourinho in quick succession. There’s an attitude of just getting rid of someone straight away if they aren’t winning every game - imagine that had been done to Sir Alex Ferguson in the beginning?<br /><br />I keep seeing comparisons to the 1992 side, where we started the season losing two games then went on to win the title. That, to me, is insulting. You really cannot compare the two. For starters, we had better players in every area of the pitch, and we had leaders which the current team just doesn’t have. We also had that absolute hunger and desire to win every single game, again, which I just can’t see from this squad. Although Jose is right to demand respect, when things aren’t going his way at the minute, he’s showing that he’s under pressure. He knows what kind of responsibility it is to manage at Old Trafford. You’re put under huge scrutiny which you aren’t at other clubs, but you need to learn to not rise to it so much</p>

Get rid of him now.’ Because there’s no chance he’d allow his team to become a joke because of Paul Pogba’s behaviour. I think his fate is completely sealed and he’ll be gone in January. There’s talk of Mourinho going before him, but I’d be disgraced if Ed Woodward allowed that to happen. If you do that, you’re essentially allowing a player to become bigger than the manager and the rest of his team. It’s time for Woodward to step up and back Jose. If he tells him that he’s upsetting the dressing room and still not playing at the level he should be, then he needs to back the manager and let him go. Pogba has caused far more trouble than he has good since returning to Man United.<br /><br />There’s no way that Man United can compete with Liverpool or Man City, or even win trophies, when they’ve got situations like this happening in the club. I can tell you what Fergie would’ve done, too. There’d have been a complete ban on Pogba speaking to all media. Because it’s obvious that he’s been feeding off the attention he’s been getting and that’s made it even worse. There’s not a chance in hell that he’d have allowed Pogba to speak to the press after that bad result against Wolves last week. Anything he does now is a media circus. If Pogba was 10/10 every week, playing out of his skin and consistently performing, then perhaps he’d have more grounds to come out and disrespect his club. But he’s not. He’s letting his personal vendetta with Mourinho take over his game. Not every player is going to like their manager all the time. It’s not about the dislike for each other, it’s about the fact you’re playing for a team and you should want to put that aside and win games. I said weeks ago that someone needed to put this situation to bed. No one is bigger than Manchester United, yet somehow Pogba thinks he is. There’s been an issue between them for a long time, and it’s been allowed to spiral out of control and get into the mess it’s in now</p>

He works as hard as he can, but when the way you play just doesn’t fit into a team, what else can you do? Alexis Sanchez will regret not going to Manchester City. If he’d gone there, it would have been the absolute best move for him. A side with free-flowing, attacking football, where you’re encouraged to get the ball forward. Instead he’s at Old Trafford, where both the football and the mood around the club is negative. I don’t think you can blame him for that atmosphere.

We all know one swallow doesn’t make a summer, so are we papering over the cracks because they came back? To some extent, yeah, we are but it was an important result because they had to win after all the reports of Mourinho leaving. After the game I’d like to think that’s a game to push Manchester United on. I’m not saying they will start challenging City and Liverpool for the title but it gives them some respite after everything that has been going on.<br /><br />Players have changed. We’re not in the era where Sir Alex Ferguson could come in and slaughter me or Roy Keane or Mark Hughes and we’ll respond to what he’s saying. Players are a little more fragile to a certain extent and they need an arm around the shoulder, they need a lift, they need someone to say they are good players for them to respond. I hope <b>[he stays]</b> because Manchester United had Sir Alex Ferguson for so long and I don’t want us to become a yo-yo club with managers sacked every two years. What Mourinho has to understand is the game has evolved. It’s not like when he was at Inter Milan in the Champions League and he could park the bus defensively. The philosophy he’s had at Chelsea and Real Madrid has been different to what it should be at Manchester United. Manchester United has a tradition of playing attacking football. Yes they want to win trophies but you don’t need to win a trophy every week. They want to see entertaining football. Hopefully Mourinho stays, I’d like him to stay but he has to start changing his methods from those he’s used for years and understand the game’s gone forward. Don’t be a dinosaur, and start attacking teams like we did over the years</p>

We’re three seasons into Mourinho’s reign now. There are no more excuses.

But, in their defence, you can’t go and spend £50 million on Fred just to stick him on the bench. You can’t keep getting away with it and expect not to be questioned.<br /><br />Mourinho is too focused on what the opposition are doing. Focus on your own team, instead. Your players look completely scared, they have no confidence at all. The sad fact is United have no presence any more. Liverpool do, Man City clearly do, even Chelsea in such a short time are showing what they’re made of. Why after three years are Manchester United still trying to find a winning formula under Mourinho? They’re trying to find a remedy, the right personnel and a style of play, and it’s failing. With Jurgen Klopp, you know the direction his team are going in. You can see what they’ve been working on in training all week. With United, they look like they don’t have a clue.

Maybe you would say the goalkeeper, but then again Alisson has been outstanding, so why would you change that? If you look at reputation you’d say David De Gea but De Gea has made a few mistakes this season, and if you’re looking at what’s happening this year then Alisson would start. Anthony Martial would <b>[get into the Liverpool team]</b>, on his day, Pogba, on his day. But if I’m looking at that team now and I’m looking at players in form and who is playing week-in, week-out then I’m not going to say Pogba. So for me if I’m looking at those teams now it’s scary the fact that there is probably only two or three who could get into the team, and that just shows how far apart the two sides are.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Ince has praised Raheem Sterling for his reaction to the alleged racism he suffered during Chelsea’s win over Manchester City]</b> To be fair to Raheem, he helped it <b>[the situation]</b>. It would have been easy to jump into the crowd, like <b>[Eric]</b> Cantona did <b>[versus Crystal Palace]</b>. It really would have. It shows now that he is grown up, it shows that the penny has dropped. It shows he is a man, it shows he has gone from a kid to a man. The way he dealt with that situation, it was fantastic. To deal with it and not react to it and get on with the game was brilliant. I have had so many phone calls since Saturday asking ‘do you want to talk about Raheem’? ‘Do you want to talk about this racism stuff’? Yes, it needs to be said from someone like me. I have a voice in it. The press, FA, Premier League, Football League, the crowds and fans have done so well to stamp this racism out. We have come a long way since the 1970s and 80s but I feel that we got complacent with it in the last few years. sYou are never going to stamp out racism completely anyway. It doesn’t matter who it is against, what religion or creed, it doesn’t matter. Racism is racism and maybe we took our foot off the gas a little bit. Every now and again you get a situation where it rears its ugly head again. It is out there now because it happened to Raheem, but it is still going on in the lower leagues. It is not just in the Premier League, it is going on in the lower leagues. When we think we have done what we need to do with this racism stuff, we need to actually think that it is still there and it still needs to be stamped out.<br /><br />It is a minority, let’s get this right. Let’s also think about what he has done as a player and how he has improved from this year to last year. You can see it, you can see him going from a boy to a man. He is doing things the right way, making the right decisions and he looks happy in his life. Irrespective of what happened on Saturday, he looks happy with his life and when you are happy, you enjoy your football<br /><br />Obviously Pep <b>[Guardiola]</b> has got to take massive credit with the way that he has progressed and he has taken it all on board, Raheem. He is scoring goals, setting up goals. This is something that you want to see for England. It is funny though because people say <b>[Marcus]</b> Rashford and <b>[Jesse]</b> Lingard do it for England but not for Man United. Raheem does it for City but not for England. It is a different competition, team and environment. I think anyone playing in the City team would do it. I would have got 20 goals-a-season as a holding midfield player, so anyone can do it for City. I am just happy he is playing with a smile on his face. Long may it continue, he is scoring goals. City don’t play the same way England do. A lot of his goals are just getting into the right positions, back post, tap-ins. He has not even reached his full potential, he is only 24. There’s a lot to come from Raheem Sterling. If he knuckles down, under Pep he will do, we’re potentially looking at a great player here. He is up there as one of the best in the way that he is playing at the moment. Form can fluctuate, but if you are talking about the best player in the league? That’s Hazard. For me, he is the best in the league and you have got Mohamed Salah too. Raheem is doing well though, and he is winning over the fans and I still think <b>[even after the alleged racism incident]</b> that he is winning people over with the way he is playing. That’s starting to change by the performances that he is having<br /><br />The media want it out there, there’s no cover up story to say that black players are not being racially abused. I am not sure, I think we are all working together and trying to make it better but, on the same token, how do we make it better? Because there’s still more of it. It still keeps rearing its ugly head and it is not going away. Isolated situations are cropping up here, there and everywhere. We need to bang our heads together and make sure we make the right decisions so it doesn’t happen again</p>

They’ve got players who can come on and make a difference. As for United, if they’re missing a few players, they have to call for Marouane Fellaini and start launching it long. They haven’t got a strong squad. Liverpool have the stronger squad as a whole, hence why they’re doing so well.<br /><br />When you compare the two teams, you have to do so based on the form of the players. At the moment, you’d probably say that, in Paul Pogba, United have the best midfielder between the two sides, but he’s not performing well. Alexis Sanchez is out and he’s meant to be world class<br /><br />Sometimes you look at these derbies and imagine it’ll be a great game, two heavyweights going head-to-head, but then it turns out to be a drab, terrible game in which they both cancel each other out. If Liverpool were playing Manchester City, you’d know it would be a great spectacle with both teams playing attacking football. But United don’t play that way, Mourinho’s more conservative and all about getting a result. He’ll go into this one with a deep block and try to use the break. It’s important for United and Mourinho that they don’t get blown away</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United’s transfer supremo Ed Woodward is just as responsible as Jose Mourinho for the club’s current malaise]</b> Mourinho is the one who fronts it because he is the football manager but Ed Woodward is the one in the stands. He is not a football man, he is a business man. The club is the richest in the world from a business point of view, we understand that. But when Mourinho says at the start of the season that we need two centre halves and he can’t get them, then someone has got to take the can. It can’t always be Mourinho.<br /><br />I presume Mourinho would have had a list saying that these are the six or seven players that I want to play for Man United to compete against the other boys. They didn’t get them. When they didn’t get them and the results don’t go well, as much as you point at Mourinho, you have to also point at Ed Woodward because he didn’t get the players he wanted. Klopp got the players he wanted. Why is <b>[Virgil]</b> Van Dijk going to Liverpool and not Man United? If you ask me now which Man United player would get into the Liverpool team? Only the goalkeeper. That’s where we are now. At the moment he is the only one who would get into the Liverpool team.<br /><br />When you look at some of the players that the other clubs have got, why didn’t United get those players? Fred doesn’t even play. Sanchez doesn’t want to be here and wanted to go to City first. Pogba doesn’t play. Players who were bought for £80m-£50m don’t even play. You are right in questioning the recruitment because recruitment is the most important thing in football.<br /><br />I think the players he is bringing in can’t deal with the pressure to put on a Man United shirt and you are seeing it in the performances. <b>[Anthony]</b> Martial is a prime example. For me, he is the most talented player in United’s squad but he can’t deal with the pressure, week-in, week-out. When you are playing for Man United, you have to do it every week. You can’t be four out of 10. You have to be seven or eight out of 10 every week. That’s in games and in training. It has changed and you feel because these players have come in, can they deal with all this and with the rivals winning week-in, week-out. You’ve got to look at whether they have the desire and toughness to deal with that pressure. Not all of them, but a lot of them haven’t. Look at Kevin De Bruyne, he has every attribute you want in a player. His work-rate, talent, decision making. Nine times out of 10, he makes the right decision, you don’t see that for any outfield player at United. Not one. I don’t see it. I don’t see anyone and the proof is in the pudding.</p>

A lot of people are asking questions, should he stay there? Will he get enough game time? He still has a lot of time to grow at United, but he needs to ascertain what his position is. Is he going to be a right winger or up front? Mourinho likes his big <b>[Romelu]</b> Lukaku up there. He played Bournemouth away and they had Sanchez, Rashford and Martial up front. I liked that. It was dynamic but they all add different things to the game. It was pacey. Even though they shouldn’t have won the game. I liked that front three. It reminded me of Liverpool or City. All smaller players who are technically good. I could see that being the way going forward. That’s the way most teams are going. Dynamic, quick, technical players. I don’t think you could find an outfield player who is world class in that team and that’s despite spending £300 million<br /><br />On their day, United can still beat anyone.

We don’t want to make these players better than what they are the moment, they’re still only young and have a long way to go. We as a nation have a tendency to build people up from such a young age and then knock them back down. I feel with Sancho, the boy’s done well and he’s been brave to make that decision to go and play in Germany. He needs to keep playing games until he’s 19 or 20. Then maybe Liverpool should start looking at him. And not just him, there’s other kids out there <b>[in Germany]</b> doing well<br /><br /><b>[On what Klopp should be trying to bring in]</b> I feel maybe he needs another striker, I really do. It’s always hard to get the best players in January. The best don’t really want to leave then. But you’ve got to say if Salah got injured who’s necessarily going to replace him? Sturridge flits in and out and hasn’t really done it. I think as a manager you’re always looking to improve the team. And I think if they are up there - and they will be up there - like City and like United they’ll be looking to bring in some extra faces to improve the team. It’s exciting.

  <p><b>[Paul Ince has reiterated his belief that he, Mark Hughes, Steve Bruce or any other former Manchester United star could have made the same impact as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer when succeeding Jose Mourinho]</b> I caused a bit of a stir over the weekend when I said I could have done what Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has done at Manchester United, but let me explain a bit more what I was getting at. With nine wins from 10 games as United’s interim boss, Ole has been absolutely fantastic. He has lifted the cloud from over Old Trafford, and the team is playing a lot better than they were under Jose Mourinho. But we all knew the problems United had under Mourinho and, as a manager, I know it is relatively simple to solve them in the short term. My argument was that it was easy for whoever came in after that to right the ship, and lift the players and the dressing room - and put the whole club back on track. When I said anyone could have come in and done the same, I did not mean to be disrespectful to Ole. What I meant was any manager - for example, myself, Mark Hughes or Steve Bruce - could have recognised the issues at Old Trafford and come in and changed the environment in a positive way. There is far more to it than just bringing some of the fun back, but you would start by allowing the players to play with freedom, and in their correct positions, too. Ole has done all of that and has obviously made a big difference. With his results, he has then taken it on to the next level, too, but even that improvement does not mean he is the right man to get the job in the summer. It is easy to change the mood of a club but the real job at United is far bigger than that. There is a lot of rebuilding to be done, over the next three or four years, so they can compete with Manchester City, Liverpool and Tottenham for the title<br /><br />At the moment there is no pressure on Ole or his players. They don’t have to worry about anything because expectations were so low when Mourinho got the sack. At that stage, they were 11 points off the top four, and most United fans were thinking that just a top-six finish would be great, whoever came in. Ole has arrived and changed the way everyone is feeling, including the supporters, and all of a sudden there is a little bit of excitement back. So are their hopes of making the top four. But we don’t know how he deals with adversity - when things start going wrong, when results dip and when some of his players maybe start biting back. That will happen, because it happens at every club</p>

  <p><b>[Ole Gunnar Solskjaer remains a gamble for Manchester United]</b> United cannot afford to appoint another manager and sack him again after two years, or less. Compared to their rivals, they have gone backwards in the past few years while City, Liverpool and Spurs have all built and progressed. They are going in the right direction now, but there is still a lot of work to do for them to get close to those teams again. So, who should get the United job in the summer? My choice would be Mauricio Pochettino because he has got a proven track record as a Premier League manager over several seasons. Solskjaer doesn’t. And, everything United need from their next manager, we know Pochettino can do - based on what we have seen from him at Tottenham. He can build a team that can challenge for the title, playing the right style of football too. We saw what Spurs did to United at Wembley last month - yes, United won because of the brilliance of David de Gea in goal, but that is how I want to see a United team play. And, while I am not saying Solskjaer definitely shouldn’t get the job, I just think he would be a gamble, while Pochettino has the kind of CV you would want from a man who should be United manager for the next four or five years. That is the way United should be thinking now. They have got their last three appointments wrong, so they need to get the next one right<br /><br />If United finish in the top four and they win the Champions League or reach the final in Madrid, then his name is going to be very high on executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward’s shortlist in the summer. But the next month is massive for United, and I do not mean for Solskjaer’s job prospects - I am talking about their hopes of winning a trophy this season. That is what the focus should be on now, and he has alluded to that himself. Solskjaer has already said that silverware is his target, and the exciting thing for me is that they have got a real chance in the FA Cup, and in Europe. Mourinho was still United’s manager when the draw for the last 16 of the Champions League was made, and if you had asked me then about whether they would get past Paris Saint-Germain, I would have said they are out of it. Now, because of the way they are playing, I am starting to believe in them again</p>

It’s not often you see a City team do that, and that shows to me that they’re panicking, you can see they’re feeling the pressure. It’s not even about the performance at this stage of the season.

Any slip ups can be the end of your title run. Because it’s Liverpool, and they’re going for the title, of course people are going to criticise them and are desperate to see them lose.

You need top performances every week, and as a player you should start thinking and getting excited about making history. I did, when I was playing for Man United and the team won the first title in 26 years, and that’s what keeps you going. This is the time when those Liverpool players can put themselves in the history books. They can be legends forever, you have to desire and want that.

People were sure it was the end of his United career, but he’s resurrected it. He knew he was fighting for his place, and he’s seen an opportunity to get back into the team. The Belgian has taken it and he deserves massive credit for that. It’s easy for players just to sulk when they’re not in the side or blame other people, it’s tougher to dig your heels in and make it impossible for the manager not to pick you. Now, the challenge for him is that we see that every week</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> should be appointed manager at Manchester United on a permanent basis]</b> After the first few games for Ole at Old Trafford, I thought it was a bit premature to start saying he should get the job. We knew there was a cloud hanging over the club, we knew that the players were unmotivated and unhappy. But no one expected United to do what they did in Paris, and that’s down to Ole. The most important thing is the Man United fans. And the fans are happy for the first time in a long time, so why would you want to change that? It would cause outrage if they didn’t go with him. For me, looking at it now, there’s no reason why he shouldn’t get the job.<br /><br />When you see the reports where the Molde CEO is saying he expects Ole back, but the United fans are calling for him to be named permanent manager, just put it to bed and appoint him now. Are they waiting until the end of the season to see if they can get someone else? If they’re not, then just come out and give Ole the job! He’s worked miracles<br /><br /><b>[Overturning a 2-0 deficit against PSG]</b> As I said, initially, getting the players smiling was the first phase for Ole. I still believe anyone could have done that that knows the United way. What I would admit is, since then, Ole has taken it to another level. We expected them to beat the first so-called lesser teams that they played. But, now, what we’re seeing is he’s taken it to a completely different level. That love for Ole from the players, that change of mood, it hasn’t worn off. It’s just got better and better, and I’m over the moon about it</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United star Paul Pogba will leave Old Trafford this summer]</b> There are players who need to move on if Ole wants to rebuild. But also, there may well be a few players who seem to want to move on themselves regardless. The main culprit of that, I believe, is Paul Pogba. Ole needs to convince him that he’s going to build the team around him going forwards if he wants him to stay. Honestly, I don’t think Pogba will be at Old Trafford next season. It’s always hard when Real Madrid come knocking, but I’m not sure Pogba’s ever settled at United since he came back, and a move could be on the cards. It’s Ole’s job to do some convincing now, convince players like Pogba and David de Gea that they’re better off at Old Trafford.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United have been warned that failing to qualify for the Champions League would be simply not good enough]</b> They need to be picking up results, especially when they’ve still got the likes of Man City to play if they want to make those Champions League spots. Ultimately, Man United have to be in the Champions League. It’s simply not good enough if they’re not. Don’t get me wrong, Ole has done a fantastic job in getting them to this point, but they need to finish the job off. They cannot afford to be without European football next year. In fact, United should never not be in that competition. No disrespect, but they should be attracting the biggest players and the biggest players don’t want to play in the Europa League. The team should be doing everything they can do make top four, and the Wolves result seems particularly poor because of that.<br /><br />The honeymoon period with Ole is definitely over. He said when he got the job that now it was time to work. There’s always more pressure on you when you are given the job permanently, than when you’re a caretaker manager, and he knows that he will be getting analysed and picked apart every time they lose a game. The pressure will mount, of course it will. He’s got a lot of work to do and he knows that and not getting into the top four will cause more scrutiny on him - that result <b>[against Wolves]</b> has made that look like a tough ask. Every team has a dip in form, of course, but now could be the worst possible time to have one. United face Barcelona next, and then West Ham in the league and it’s crucial that they bounce back from this. That’s what the good Man United teams do, they bounce back</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba was off his game yet again as Manchester United succumbed to a 1-0 loss at home to Barcelona]</b> On the night, you’re looking at the so-called big players like Paul Pogba, Marcus Rashford and Romelu Lukaku to make something happen. You look at those to get the team going - and it didn’t materialise. Another off day for Pogba, which I didn’t expect considering how he’s been playing and Lukaku once again looked incapable of scoring a goal. He spent most of his time out on the wing, he just needs to play between the two goal posts. What use is Lukaku out on the wing? It doesn’t make sense to me. Anthony Martial came on and had zero impact. These are the kinds of players you look to change the game in such an important match, and it’s disappointing they couldn’t.<br /><br />I would say that defensively they looked good, and Scott McTominay was brilliant, he was assured and comfortable and looked ready for the occasion. He relished in that position and was easily the best United player on the pitch. He was a plus side of the game. But it was disappointing. They never had a go at Barcelona or tried to, in such a massive game where the fans are up for it. It’s a sad sight that at Old Trafford, in the Champions League, United aren’t having a shot on target. That Barcelona team were probably expecting a different performance from United. They’d have been expecting that resurgent Ole side who come at you from the off, that get in your faces, but that didn’t materialise</p>

But, the fact is, neither of them are. In 1993 when I won the league with Man United, there were defining moments in that season. The Fergie Time win over Sheffield Wednesday for example, we knew then that the title was ours. I sense that now with Liverpool. They’re not absolutely blowing teams away, they’re just having defining moments and decisions on their side. Against Everton when Jordan Pickford made that mistake, or against Fulham with the penalty, or Shane Long’s mistake last week.<br /><br />Things are happening for them that make me believe it’s their year. Decisions are falling for them, and that’s what you need in the title race. You need those decisions and the luck on your side. Liverpool aren’t even playing particularly well in the league, it’s scrappy to watch, but the end result is still the same - three points. They have got to go on and win it now. Chelsea is a crucial game for them because of previous memories they’ve had in the title charge. I honestly believe Liverpool will win it this season. Everything is on their side.</p>

What worries me is, since Ole’s been named permanent manager, they look a different team. They’re playing in a different way. When he was the interim manager they were creating chance after chance, and now he has the job permanently they’ve gone backwards! I always said the pressure would be on if he got it permanently. I said this would happen months ago. This is why I said it at the time - I’ve seen it loads of times that while a manager is interim the mood picks up and everyone feels like they have a chance. But when he becomes the manager, they’re worse than they were before. This is what I meant when I said that there was such a cloud over United that all Ole had to do was to come in and change the environment.<br /><br />No pressure on the players, just go out and play. But now, they’re in a position where they could get top four, and the stress and pressure is on. They’ve lost their way, and how they’re playing now is no different to how they played under Jose Mourinho - allowing teams to come at them. I’m not necessarily saying they made a mistake, but when they got Louis van Gaal or Jose Mourinho they didn’t think they’d made a mistake at first. Everyone keeps going on about how Ole knows the club, but it’s results and performances that matter. He’ll have, hopefully, two years to bridge the gap between United and their rivals and if he doesn’t he knows what will happen</p>

I was fortunate enough to play with the likes of Bryan Robson, Roy Keane and Eric Cantona - world class players - and they make everyone play better. United can’t just rely on Pogba and expect that he will do everything, people have to pull their weight and be great around him. Pogba needs and deserves to be in a team full of top players, and I don’t believe that’s Man United at the minute. When they’re in the Champions League you realise that a lot of their players just aren’t good enough. You look at Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard when they’re playing lower opposition and they look great - but the fact is, they’re miles behind the top players.

The footballing ­decisions have been mental for a few years now. The club has fallen far behind the pack. I’d like to think that they will recover, but I think we could be waiting a while.

How you improve not only the team but the club, from the top down. You have to start again from fresh. For me, a lot of the issues come down to the attitude of the squad.

It wouldn’t happen under <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> and it wouldn’t happen under <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>.

As I say, it was probably even worse when I first went to join Inter, there was even a racist remark on the wall about me, since the first day I landed there. It’s always been there. It feels like Italian fans have always got away with it - their federation never stamped down on it, and so they still feel they can use that kind of behaviour to affect black players. I don’t think <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> did or do enough to stop it, they have to set a precedent down with all teams, whether it’s in Italy, France, England, wherever - everyone, but they’re not doing it<br /><br />We’ve seen it with <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a>, we’ve seen it with <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> and obviously now <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a>. It isn’t right. Whether it’s the fans, or whether it’s social media, we’ve got to get our heads together, just stop all this going on. It’s time to think about sporting penalties instead of fines, we’ve got to be throwing that at people, so that they’re aware that will happen. Fines aren’t doing anything. It’s not hitting home to anybody, it really, really isn’t and you can see that.<br /><br />We need to make it transparent, if this behaviour continues, or it happens again, your club is out of Europe. It’s difficult though because sometimes it’s individuals with these opinions, that’s different to 20 or 100 fans. Unfortunately, there’s always one idiot, or two idiots, that will do that. There must be a deterrent. Whether it’s in England, or Europe or whatever, take points off the teams, take them out of cup games, whatever. Empty stadiums don’t really work - you’re only hit in the pocket for two or three games - but point deductions, that could work. What disturbs me is the last four or five years, we kind of felt like it was reducing and being stamped out. But in the last one or two years, it’s reared its ugly head again. It’s really disturbing</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Ince says It could be five years before <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title challengers]</b> There’s a lot of things that aren’t right at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> at the moment, and they need to be addressed. I don’t know where United are going as a club. From a football point of view, I expected an in and out season, I could’ve accepted that - but I would’ve anticipated the performances would be so much better. <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> knows they’re not going to win the title this year, or next. It could be five years before they do. I believe that the only chance they have in the near future is if <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> and Pep leave <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and City. Whether Ole will still be in charge by then, who knows<br /><br />This season, again, will be a transitional year. I’m not disappointed or angry about that, it’s just where they are as a team at the moment. The results are going to be up and down and I’m prepared to accept that, as long as they challenge for the top four. I’m more concerned about the director of football situation and the way <a href="edward-woodward.html">Ed Woodward</a> is building the club. He is rightly getting a lot of stick - people who appoint managers should be made accountable. For the results, for the structure of the club, for the recruitment, and so on. They knew they were going to lose <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>, and it was obvious Sanchez had to move on, so why the hell have they not got a striker or two in?<br /><br /><a href="edward-woodward.html">Ed Woodward</a> isn’t a football man, he’s a money man. From that perspective, I’m sure he’s doing a great job - but the fans don’t give a toss about the money if it isn’t being invested back into the team. They want <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> quality players on the pitch, to be entertained, to be winning things, and they’re not getting that. It doesn’t look like a <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> team anymore. What United need is someone who knows where to find <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> players, where the hidden gems are, and how to get them.<br /><br />Currently, United are being held to ransom. <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> is a terrific player, but £80 million? They’re being forced to pay over the odds to get top players. What they should be doing is identifying these talents earlier, doing proper research, and getting them for a lot cheaper. That’s not down to one person to do, it’s about the director of football and their team - United probably need to hire four or five people who can go out and start building blocks. It might take a year or two, but at least they’d be moving forwards</p>

I stand totally by that comment. Everyone got sucked into the start he’d made, without looking at the fixtures they had. It’s a result-based business, and that’s fine, but you can’t ignore performances. Now, though, having decided he’s the man, giving him a long-term project and buying into his vision, they have to stick with him. Irrespective of whether they win or lose at the weekend, he’s their man. There are no two ways about it, they’ve made their bed, and right now they’re lying in it.<br /><br />They can’t be sacking their manager and abandoning the strategy, based on a few results. United will win games, people will get excited again, then they’ll lose and it’ll be back to crisis mode. They’re the biggest team in the world, they’ll be on the back pages no matter what. That’s what comes with being a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player or manager. But they no longer have that presence in terms of intimidating opponents.

  <p><b>[Paul Ince has slated <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s performances in the 2019-20 season and believes that they should make winning the Europa League a priority now]</b> For me, Ole needs to focus on the Europa League now and make it a priority. Similar to how <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> did, he knows that realistically, it’s United’s best chance of Champions League football. Because, let’s be honest, top four looks like it’s going to be a struggle. At the minute, they don’t look like they will make it. And while United are falling, teams like <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> are building and looking to make those spots. And, realistically, all United can hope for nowadays is a top four place, because they’re so far off winning a league title. It’s a trophy, it’s a Champions League space, and when your team look like they might not be capable of making the top four in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> - why not try and win it? It’s got to be the main target<br /><br />Don’t throw away the league of course, but I don’t want to see a weakened team against <a href="az-alkmaar.html">AZ Alkmaar</a>. I know it’s not a tough opponent, but both that game and <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> this weekend should be games they’re winning, no question. It’ll be very disappointing if they don’t win both. For United, at the moment, every game is a big game<br /><br /><b>[Ince also highlighted the lack of quality in the draw with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">the Gunners</a>]</b> When I watched the <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> vs <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> match on Monday - with all the misplaced passes, people losing the ball, etc - it genuinely reminded me of being in the playground at school playing football, not watching two of the biggest teams in England!

There’s no comparison between them, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and even <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. Don’t get me wrong, I can see that <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> are trying to give their academy, and young players a chance. But you have to sit back and go - are these lads actually good enough? Are they going to be long term choices, realistically? It’s brilliant bringing them through, but we need to look at quality of them too. United are in a situation now where they’ve played seven games and are 12 points behind <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, and seven behind <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>. When you talk about the gap between them and those two, that says it all - it shows you how far they’ve fallen. We’re not talking 20 games into the season - we’re talking seven</p>

When you look at players like <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a>, <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a>, <a href="ian-wright.html">Ian Wright</a>, the composure they had was incredible.

My advice for him would to be to get out on that training ground, afternoon after afternoon, and work on it. Ole needs to get him working on it too, just take him to one side with a coach and get him working on his composure. It will improve him as a player - and in turn his confidence will come back too</p>

I think Man United fans understand that the quality isn’t there yet - they’ve got five or six players who’ve been out injured.

They get the best of everything financially and the pitches are great so they have that mentality where they are a bit soft. I watched United play <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> the other week and I saw them tackled and just rolling over. I wanted them to get up and get on with it, they were 1-0 down you know. That mentality we had, these players haven’t got that now. You don’t get those players anymore and this is the problem United have.

He’d be great at educating all of these young players that Ole is looking to bring through, an incredible off-pitch influence as well as on the field.

The fact is, though, when <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> plays and he plays well there’s no way Ole would drop him. Really, he should be the talisman of that team.<br /><br />He should be enthused and excited by the fact that the team could be built around him and he could be the main man, but he doesn’t seem interested in that to me. He’s not bothered about being the captain of Man United. It doesn’t excite him to be the leader of this club. It feels as though we all bought into the romance of him returning to Man United.

I would say he regrets making the move, now<br /><br />Ole has said he’s waiting for <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> to come in and talk to him, even. But it shouldn’t be like that, it should be Ole dragging him in and asking him what exactly he sees for his future of the club. As a manager, he should be asking him what’s going on and what his issue is. You’re telling me <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> would’ve dealt with it this way? No chance - he’d have pulled <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> in and then decided whether he wanted to then pass that message on to fans and media.<br /><br />Where it’s really frustrating is we’ve heard this story about <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> wanting to leave several times now, but yet here he still is. Unless someone’s going to come in for him at the price United want, for someone who’s still injured, he’s still going to be there at the end of the month. It’s a vicious circle.

You go back to other great teams. I say <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> Invincibles, those Man United teams and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> teams that kept winning things constantly.

We can take our time so come next season they are ready to go. It is a shame not to have it but it is the right decision to delay it.<br /><br />It is different now and it is good to see players going to different countries and learning their trade. Looking at the Italian league, there’s a resurgence. When I went there it was the best league in the world. Best players, managers and money. Then <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> came up and it kind of fell flat on its face. Now, I see a resurgence from <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>. Players want to play there and crowds go up. It is easier for our players to move abroad because it is so cosmopolitan. When I went to Inter there were no English players, it was mostly Italian players, I had to learn the language and get involved in the culture. Players go to clubs and they can speak English. We got lazy for a period because we didn’t want to learn a new language. Now it isn’t a scary thing because people speak English. It is great for our young players who go out there and do it. Like <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a>, they learn a different football, way of life and then they become a man. It can help you on the international stage as well.

When you cost that kind of money as a player, fans expect you to be consistently great, especially when you’re playing for Man United. Their expectations are very high. The on the pitch performances, plus his behaviour off the pitch, with his agent and generally acting up, isn’t good for the club. If <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> is looking to take the club forward, to build and to instil the ‘United Way’ back into the team, then <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>’s actions don’t reflect that. The way he’s been acting and behaving recently, he just isn’t good for the club. If you want the right attitude and mentality, and high standards, then sorry, but that doesn’t fit in with <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>. There’s been too many distractions, too many reports around him and his behaviour, so his time for me is up. Perhaps if Fernandes hadn’t come in and done as well as he has done, maybe Ole might try and keep <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>. But now, he might be thinking if I can get the right money for <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, then I can let him go. It’s a shame, because he could’ve been a great player for the club, but he isn’t a great player at the moment. Ultimately, he’s a distraction and his behaviour impacts and damages the rest of the team. Now, if he was performing out of his skin every week and changing games, you could forgive him for his behaviour even when he’s being a nightmare, but he isn’t, so why bother? If he’s not performing, just let him go, get rid. The decision needs to be made, and quickly, because we can’t have another season of the <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> circus. He wouldn’t even get in the side at the moment.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Ince says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> kidding themselves if they think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> can be caught in a couple of years]</b> It will take a long time to catch up and if anyone at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> thinks it can be done in a couple of years with some big money signings, they are kidding themselves. I would look at the departure of <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> as a starting point for where we have got to now, with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> so far ahead of United. <a href="david-moyes.html">David Moyes</a> came into United at that time, didn’t get the time or money he needed to do the job and then they moved on to <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a>, who never seemed to be the right for fit United, despite winning <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup in 2016. After that, you had <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> and he didn’t look happy from day one, even though he won a couple of trophies in his first seasons<br /><br />It was all about <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> sniping at the press, problems behind the scenes with <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> and there was a general mood of discontent at the club. Then they turned to Ole and he is very inexperienced for a job of that size. To manage Cardiff, Molde and then end up in charge of the biggest club in the world was always going to be tough for him and I’m not surprised that he has struggled. The end result is there has been a lot of damage caused by the instability at the club over the last six years and at the same time, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have had stability, especially since <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> came in. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have had a plan, they stuck to it even when things didn’t go great for <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> in his first year and now they are getting the rewards. At United, managers have come and gone, they’ve had their own ideas on players, spent fortunes on terrible signings and they found themselves 30 points behind <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> at the halfway point of the season, which is embarrassing for a club of United’s stature.<br /><br /><b>[the differences between <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and United]</b> They have a fantastic spine and that’s what United are lacking at the moment, primarily because their transfer dealings have been absolutely horrendous. There is no point beating around the bush here. <a href="edward-woodward.html">Ed Woodward</a> (executive vice-chairman) has failed in his transfer dealings and I don’t think United can move forward until he is replaced or someone comes in to help with transfers who understands the game</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Ince says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> used to fall apart, now they’re made of strong stuff]</b> They won the Champions League in June and have kicked on from there. They are hungry, they are ready for it and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> have not been up to the task of sticking with them this time. I give all the credit in the world to <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> and his players. They had a massive high winning the Champions League and that came on the back of the massive low of losing out in the title race after getting 97 points and losing just one game all season. You look back to 2014 and the last time <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> nearly won the league, they fell apart the next season and <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> ended up getting sacked because they took one too many punches in the stomach, but this <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team are made of stronger stuff. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has built them superbly, piece by piece. He has bought a spine in Alisson, <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> and <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a>, with players like <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> and <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> improving so much since he arrived at the club</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Ince says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> would be daft not to ask the <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> question]</b> I cannot see <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> happening. I can see him going, yes, and wanting to leave <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, but not to join United. People keep saying that what they keep forgetting is they’ve got <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> up front. He’s always wanted to play up front, but what you need to remember is he can also play off the left-hand side, as we’ve seen from plenty of his goals this season. Plus, between him and <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a>, <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> coming in would also bring some competition to the side. There’s always been a sense of competition at United, and it would be nice to see that back again, players fighting for their places. So if you’re looking at <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> left, <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> centre and <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> on the right, it sounds pretty nice doesn’t it? But it probably sounds like a dream for a reason, it is a dream<br /><br />Don’t get me wrong, if, and it’s a big if, United can get <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a>, and he fancies the move, surely you’re going to go for him. You’d be absolutely daft not to. If you can get him, then you have to go and get him, but I can’t see it being the case. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fans won’t like to hear me say this either, but sometimes as a player you simply need a new challenge. Whether that’s at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>, or in my opinion, more likely abroad, who knows? However if he’s on the market then if you’ve got to at least have a go at getting him, if you’re United. You’re taking a completely complete, proven player. He’s only going to get better and better. He’s a guarantee</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Ince says <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> isn’t bigger than <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> &amp; do they need him?]</b> They’ve got to resolve the <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> situation. It has to be resolved. You can’t keep having what we’re having every six, seven, eight weeks. He’s going, he’s staying, the agent comes out. <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> is not bigger than <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, no player is bigger than <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. The way Ole <b>[Gunnar <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>]</b> is going, you don’t want any disruptions. He either knuckles down and starts performing the way he should be performing for the money he cost, or they sell him. The biggest thing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> is Fernandes coming in. Before that you are saying, ‘We need <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> in there’. Now because he’s been out injured and Fernandes has come in, all of a sudden, ‘Do we need <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> in there?’ Does he get in there? I know he <b>[<a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>]</b> likes <b>[Scott]</b> <a href="scott-mctominay.html">McTominay</a>. <b>[Nemanja]</b> <a href="nemanja-matic.html">Matic</a> has come in and started playing well. Does <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> start every game? If Ole thinks he’s not going to, he might think he can cash in and bring one or two other players in. But the saga needs to be sorted out before the start of next season because next season is a big season for Ole. A big, big season. But I like the way they are going now, I like what I’m seeing. I can’t make judgement yet. They are not there yet where <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and City are, but signs are good and that’s a good thing to say because I didn’t see those signs a year ago. I like what I’m seeing. I like the place and I like the players they are bringing in. You’ve got to give Ole time now to take them where they need to be, which is challenging for the league title</p>
