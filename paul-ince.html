  <p><b>[father Paul Ince says <a href="tom-ince.html">Tom Ince</a> worth £25m]</b> If you’re talking £15m for <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a>, Thomas has got to be £25m. If you compare the two, Thomas should cost more. <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a> is a fantastic player, don’t get me wrong. <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a>’s a stronger runner and does a lot of tricks, whereas Thomas is more direct, he makes things happen and he scores goals. You’ve got a kid playing in the Championship who has scored 18 goals. When you look at the leading scorers, they’re all strikers, and he’s there amongst them. Potentially, I think he can reach that value. If Palace want £15m for <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a> who has scored six goals, it makes you wonder what price he’s going to be. You’re not going to get it because he’s not proven in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, but if United are paying £15m for <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a>, on the stats you’d have to say Thomas is worth a lot more than that. That’s my opinion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former Blackpool Manager Paul Ince recalls he was in good term with club chairman Karl Oyston who just fired him via text]</b> We had a good relationship. He had his way of doing things which were alien to the way I would but we never fell out. I got on well with his family, his wife and kids. It was disappointing I’ve had to hear it from my wife. He said because I was on the Pro-Licence that he couldn’t get hold of me<br /><br />These courses are vital. In Germany, managers and coaches have to miss games to get the Pro-Licence done. I would rather have been told face to face. Me and the chairman met on Sunday night, we had a conversation, we knew what we were doing. We had players on our list that we could have got, good players who would have improved the team, who have now gone to bigger clubs in the Championship<br /><br />It’s made me more determined. If I felt I couldn’t do the job as a manager I’d go and work on TV. Every club I have been to has involved firefighting: Macclesfield, MK Dons, <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a>, Notts County, Blackpool. I’ve managed to steer them away from trouble. I know what I’m doing. I work hard. I have an eye for good players<br /><br /><b>[He talked about why he wants to get back into management]</b> I’ve worked with some of the best players in the world. I’ve learned from some of the best managers, <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a>, <a href="terry-venables.html">Venables</a>, <a href="glenn-hoddle.html">Hoddle</a>, even as a kid, learning from John Lyall at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>, God rest his soul<br /><br />John Lyall was hard but fair. He did scare me but he was good for me. Eddie Baily <b>[West Ham’s chief scout back then]</b> said to Lyall: ‘The kid’s no good’. Lyall said: ‘I trust in this kid, he’s had a tough upbringing. I want to give him a chance’. I didn’t get any exams. I was always bunking school. I had no family life as a kid<br /><br />My dad left when I was two. My mum left me when I was 10 to go to Germany, looking for work, bar-work to make ends meet. My older brother went to live in Ipswich. My sister had to go and live in Germany. I lived with my cousins in Ilford, then in digs from 13. I’ve had to look after myself from a young age. Growing up, I wanted to be with my parents. It’s why I spend as much time as I can with my kids<br /><br />I had my own little family in Ilford <b>[Essex]</b>, a gang of boys, hanging around on the streets, getting into trouble, fighting. There were gangs, Beacontree, Canning Town, and we were Ilford. We used to meet up for punch-ups. I remember gatecrashing a party, got into a fight, ended up breaking someone’s ribs<br /><br />A week later at Chadwell Heath <b>[West Ham’s training ground]</b>, all of a sudden Mick McGiven <b>[one of Lyall’s coaches]</b> came over and said: ‘the Gaffer wants to see you’. I walked into the office and there were two policemen sitting there<br /><br />Lyall said: ‘I’ve been convincing these coppers not to take you to prison’. I played dumb. ‘Sorry, Gaffer, what are you on about? ‘You were in a fight last week, the boy reported you, you broke his ribs. They want to take you away. I convinced them I’m looking after you and it won’t happen again’<br /><br />The two coppers walked out and then Lyall absolutely lambasted me. ‘I’ve not got time to waste on you, you little pipsqueak. If you get in any trouble again, you can p*** off’.<br /><br /><b>[He then had a coating of a different sort]</b> Chadwell Heath has these claret-and-blue gates, and I spent the next four weeks before and after training, getting in at 8am and finishing at 4pm, painting those gates and creosoting the fence<br /><br /><b>[Ince did well and in 1989 Ferguson came calling, talking to Lyall]</b> Lyall had looked after me since I was 13, was a father figure, and said to Fergie: ‘Listen, make sure you take over the responsibility of being a father figure to him’. That helped me. <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> was very kind to me. He wasn’t as intense with me as he was with other players<br /><br />I met him at a hotel in Waltham Abbey. He was sitting there, suit on, cup of tea, and I couldn’t believe I was in the same room as <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a>, the manager of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. It was always a dream of mine to play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. <a href="bryan-robson.html">Bryan Robson</a> was my idol. I always wanted to base my game on his - never actually got there. I always wanted to play for the team he was playing for. So to get the chance to go to United was fantastic<br /><br />Ferguson never coached; it was either <a href="brian-kidd.html">Brian Kidd</a> or Archie Knox. He would sit in his office and look down from his big window at the Cliff and if anyone was farting about, he’d be banging on the window and we all knew we were in trouble<br /><br />It was only on Thursday that we saw Ferguson in training, and then on Friday morning, doing the boxes with his silly little woolly hat on. Saturday was his domain. That’s when you really saw him. If I’d seen Ferguson every day on the training ground it wouldn’t carry that as much substance. It was special when we saw him. ‘Gaffer’s here, stand by your beds’<br /><br />We played Millwall at home in my first game <b>[Sep 16, 1989]</b>. I thought wow, Old Trafford! We beat them 5-1 and I thought I’m really going to like it here. The next week, we went to Maine Road, got beaten 5-1 and I couldn’t go outside the hotel!<br /><br />Those were great teams. So many strong characters, myself, <b>[Robson]</b>(bobby-robson.html), Keane, <a href="eric-cantona.html">Cantona</a>, <a href="steve-bruce.html">Bruce</a>, <a href="peter-schmeichel.html">Schmeichel</a>, so many egos, so many opinions. I’d argue with Keaney, Keaney would argue with <a href="peter-schmeichel.html">Schmeichel</a>, <a href="peter-schmeichel.html">Schmeichel</a> would argue with Brucey and everyone was shouting like little kids<br /><br />But <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a>’s voice was the one that counted. We were big giants and all of a sudden he walked in and we were like little boys. Sir Alex had a great presence. He was ‘the man’<br /><br />When people ask me what was the greatest ever United team under Ferguson, I always say 93-94, not because I was in it but because of the balance, the many big characters in that changing-room, who would answer <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> back, but he managed to gel us altogether to achieve something special. That’s the greatness of the man<br /><br /><b>[Ince made close friends at United, including <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a> and Ryan Giggs]</b> Giggsy was my best mate. He came from a split home so maybe that’s one reason we understood each other. I got on really well with his mum Lynne<br /><br />It got to the stage at one point where Giggsy was having problems at home and we’d talk about it. ‘Listen I’ve not had a dad since I was two and the most important person in your life is your mum. Not your girlfriend, not your wife, it’s your mum. Don’t worry too much about your dad. You’ve come so far without him’<br /><br />He ended up coming to stay with me for six months in Bramhall. He was a messy little bastard! His room had underpants and socks all over the place. I was saying to Claire: ‘Have you seen his room, it’s a disgrace.’ ‘Don’t worry,’ she said, ‘he’s only a kid!’ Giggsy did milk it. That’s where we built up our friendship. We used to practise goal celebrations in the bedroom. ‘No that’s not right, let’s try this one’ and eventually got it. That’s where we got those stupid dances!<br /><br />He’s a smashing kid. To see him still playing now is amazing. I remember two years ago he came to my villa in Portugal with Stacey and the kids. He took his top off and he was just the same size as when he started playing. I thought I’d better leave my top on! He’s brilliant, converting from a flying-machine winger to playing in the centre of the park where he’s got to be cleverer<br /><br />Me, Giggsy and Eric used to go out, have dinner, and we’d get on really, really well. Eric was funny, a good character, great company. When he was trying to be serious, me and Giggsy would be laughing. Eric would say: ‘What are you laughing at?’ ‘Nothing Eric. You’re 6ft 2in. We’re not laughing’<br /><br />Eric was the best trainer I’d ever trained with. This was someone who used to come in at 9am at the Cliff, doing his own warm-up before anyone got there. We’d turn up at 9.45 and he’d been out there working on his skills for 45 minutes, left foot, right foot, every day. After about three months, I was there training early with him, Giggsy was there, Sharpey was there, copying him. I had to work on my left foot because it was rubbish. Now my left is nearly as good as my right all because of Eric<br /><br /><b>[By 1993, the United midfielder was acquiring more England caps, and also the armband, against the USA on the summer tour in Foxboro]</b> The first question I got asked was: ‘what’s it like to be the first black England captain?’ I’d never really thought about it that way, I said. I was just proud to be England captain. I didn’t really look at my colour. Other people did. The fan-mail was unbelievable. I had 400-500 letters. They were from deprived kids. They were from mums and dads whose sons were in trouble, but I’d inspired them by becoming the first black England captain<br /><br />They’d write: ‘Can you come down and have a chat with my kid’. I thought I can’t chat to 400 people. I replied to all the letters. I wrote: ‘If you work hard, and believe, you will get there in the end. That was the case with me: have the passion to deal with the obstacles put in your way’<br /><br /><b>[Ince was a passionate player, giving everything, learning from managers, playing under <a href="roy-hodgson.html">Roy Hodgson</a> after moving to Inter in 1995 and then absorbing ideas under <a href="terry-venables.html">Venables</a> with England]</b> When I look back to euro 96 with <a href="terry-venables.html">Venables</a>, he played three at the back more or less, a great bit of tactical genius from Terry. We should have won euro 96. We played good football, 4-1 against Holland, all passion and being on the front foot<br /><br />Even during the Spain game when we got battered <b>[and won on penalties]</b>, I felt it was our time. Against Germany, I still think Gazza’s going to get to that ball <b>[sliding in and almost scoring]</b>. I was taking the sixth penalty after <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a>. When he missed I was a bit relieved! I’m joking Southy! Penalties are a lottery. We should have beaten the Germans<br /><br /><b>[In 1997, Ince left Inter for Liverpool]</b> I could have gone to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> or <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. <a href="ruud-gullit.html">Ruud Gullit</a> was at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and wanted me. So did <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsène Wenger</a> at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I thought: ‘I spent six great years at United, I liked the North-west’. So I chose <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I loved <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, everything about it. The fans were unbelievable. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> had the Bridge and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> had <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Highbury</a> but there was something bigger about Old Trafford and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. The European nights, the history. The chance to play at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> was something I couldn’t turn down<br /><br />I was good friends with Macca (Steve McManaman), Jamie (Redknapp), Jamo (David James) and Robbie (Fowler). They felt I was the missing piece in the jigsaw in midfield to go on and do things. We had a really good side, me and Jamie and <a href="patrik-berger.html">Patrik Berger</a>, <a href="steve-mcmanaman.html">McManaman</a>, <a href="michael-owen.html">Michael Owen</a> and <a href="robbie-fowler.html">Robbie Fowler</a>, Karlheinz Riedle. If our defence had been great we would have won the title the year we finished third <b>[in 97-98]</b><br /><br /><b>[One of Ince’s most memorable games came while a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> player for England in qualifying for France 98, getting the required point in Rome, although they almost lost when <a href="christian-vieri.html">Christian Vieri</a> went close late on]</b> That was a very good Italian team. That <a href="christian-vieri.html">Vieri</a> header! I was in London the other day with Thomas <b>[after his loan move to Crystal Palace]</b> and people came up, saying ‘remember Rome, you captained your country, you’d done <b>[cut]</b> your head’<br /><br />I remember Demetrio Albertini elbowed me. I remember the doctor putting the stitches in, must have been the worst stitches put in. It kills me because it’s killed my hair! He was rushing, digging deeper and <a href="glenn-hoddle.html">Hoddle</a> was trying to do a team-talk. All the lads said they could hear me screaming because the doc was screwing up my stitches<br /><br />The only other thing I remember was late on, <a href="ian-wright.html">Ian Wright</a> cutting inside, hitting the post, him falling on the floor, <a href="teddy-sheringham.html">Teddy Sheringham</a> hitting the rebound, it getting blocked and him falling on the floor. Italy go down the pitch with <a href="roberto-donadoni.html">Roberto Donadoni</a>, who crosses, <a href="christian-vieri.html">Vieri</a> heads it and <a href="david-seaman.html">David Seaman</a> is going the other way. It was like slow motion. I remember it going past the post<br /><br />I turned and looked up the pitch and it was like a war-zone. Wrighty was on the floor, <a href="teddy-sheringham.html">Sheringham</a> was on the floor, their bench was on the floor, heads in hands. So was our bench. But we got through. I felt then that we could do well at the World Cup. I looked at players like Dave <a href="david-seaman.html">Seaman</a> and <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a>, and sensed that we would do really well. We had a good mix, old-school and young like Michael, we had flair and leaders<br /><br /><a href="glenn-hoddle.html">Hoddle</a> was so into his football. I can’t believe <a href="glenn-hoddle.html">Hoddle</a> is not managing now. He has so much to give. He was so methodical. He was the <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> of ‘98 because he was so far ahead of the game. He’d learned under <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>. If <a href="glenn-hoddle.html">Hoddle</a> had stayed with England, we might have won something because he was that far ahead of anyone else<br /><br /><b>[England’s hopes in the round of 16 against Argentina were compromised by <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>’s dismissal for a gentle kick out at Diego Simeone]</b> Becks getting sent off was devastating. I think we would have beaten Argentina and gone on to win that World Cup if we’d stayed at 11. That’s not to say anything against Becks. That’s probably a sending-off now but not back in ‘98. It was madness. It was a poor decision<br /><br />Even now, I think of the shot I had at 2-2, 20 yards out. I think of what would have happened in my life if that had gone in. I’m not a great penalty-taker but I felt I’d had such a good game, playing so well, that if it came to penalties I was taking one. I was that confident. I’ll score. Then I missed a penalty and I felt it’s all my fault.<br /><br />It hurt me more than ‘96. It was the World Cup. I felt that squad would never come together again. It was a morgue in the dressing-room. <a href="tony-adams.html">Tony Adams</a> was trying to lift everyone, saying ‘we’ve done well with 10’. A few of us were in tears.<br /><br />Becks was in tears. What Becks then had to go through was a disgrace, the way he was treated. It showed Becks’ strength of character to turn it around, score the winner against Greece to take England to the next World Cup. But ‘98 was my last chance. It killed me<br /><br /><b>[His club career kept going strong, continuing at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and then Middlesbrough]</b> I didn’t want to leave <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> <b>[in ‘99]</b>. But <a href="gerard-houllier.html">Gerard Houllier</a> said they were trying to sign Marc-Vivien Foe, God rest his soul<br /><br />I’d had a really good season. I was 31. I had a lot left in me. Four years on, I was still playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> against <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Stevie Gerrard</a>. There was no reason to bring someone else in. But I’m not one to hold grudges. I got Player of the Year two years in a row at Middlesbrough and then went to <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> and played under Glenn again<br /><br />But my legs started to ache, I struggled to get up in the morning, and I started focusing on going into management. I never wanted to be a coach. I’m not a good coach. I don’t like coaching. I like to manage<br /><br /><b>[Ince wants more players from his generation and more recent ones to move into management]</b> People like <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a> - can we convince them to go into management?<br /><br />You’ve got <a href="tim-sherwood.html">Tim Sherwood</a> at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> with <a href="les-ferdinand.html">Les Ferdinand</a> on the bench. Weighty was always going to be a pundit. That’s his character and he does a fantastic punditry job. I look at <a href="sol-campbell.html">Sol Campbell</a> and Dave <a href="david-seaman.html">Seaman</a>, played for England, where are they now? <a href="steve-mcmanaman.html">McManaman</a>, Fowler. <a href="alan-shearer.html">Shearer</a> tried his hand at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. Gareth is now doing the Under-21s<br /><br />Look at the Spanish and Germans and they all have ex-players involved in their national set-ups. We need to get the players in who’ve had the experiences, who are role models for these kids in the England Under-19s, who are earning a lot of money and think they’ve made it. They need coaches they respect straight away<br /><br /><b>[Ince’s managerial career started in unglamorous surrounds]</b> If somebody had offered me a job in the Premiership when I left <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>, I wouldn’t have taken it. I wanted to learn my trade, learn how to manage. I went to Swindon for four months, played a few games for Wisey and <a href="gus-poyet.html">Gus Poyet</a>, but it was mainly to look and learn. I did some coaching there, got to know the mentalities of the players. Sir Alex always said to me: ‘Motivation is the key to success’. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> inspires players<br /><br />I have still a lot to learn. But I’ve done it the right way. I went to Macclesfield who were bottom of League Two. I got more phone calls from people saying ‘you are absolutely mad’ then saying ‘congratulations on your first job’. Before my first team-talk at Macclesfield I’ve never been so nervous. I couldn’t sleep the night before. But I kept Macclesfield up. I loved it there, putting the alarm on and locking the stadium up at 7.30pm<br /><br /><b>[Ince went on to MK Dons, and then Blackburn]</b> I thought: ‘Jesus Christ, this is the Premiership, this is my chance’. In hindsight, I shouldn’t have taken the <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> job. It came too soon. <a href="brad-friedel.html">Brad Friedel</a> went. <a href="david-bentley.html">David Bentley</a> went. They had four great years under <a href="mark-hughes.html">Mark Hughes</a> but it needed rebuilding. There was this trust fund. They weren’t actually putting any money into the club. It was really tough<br /><br /><b>[He went back to MK Dons and then on to Notts County]</b> They were in trouble. But we got Thomas on loan <b>[from Liverpool]</b>, Lee Miller on loan (from Middlesbrough) and went on a great run on a terrible pitch. This is what frustrates me: right, bang, we’d just beaten Sunderland away in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup, got <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in the next round, drew 1-1 at Meadow Lane, and were trying to change the culture of the club. We couldn’t bring any players in and it killed us<br /><br />It was exactly the same at Blackpool. Last year, they were going down, me and Alex came in, and our record was phenomenal, play-off form, and we managed to keep them up. I’m meticulous. Me and Alex got in early, didn’t leave the office until 7.30 at night. We didn’t cut corners<br /><br />Anyway, we went to pre-season in Portugal. We had eight first-team players, eight kids and eight trialists. You don’t build a team from that. But we got off to a flying start. I knew the first XI we had at Blackpool could compete with anyone in the Championship with the motivation I give them<br /><br />I knew as soon as we lost one or two to injury that we’d struggle. That’s why I had targets to come in to improve the team. But I wasn’t allowed to do it. I’d like to think people would understand what a great job I did at Blackpool. Football people know that<br /><br /><b>[He has hardly stopped talking, pausing only for a sip of water. Now 46, Ince also so much to say about the problems with English football generally]</b> We are too obsessed with foreign managers. Because we have an influx of so many foreign players the owners think the best way is to bring in foreign coaches because they understand the culture of foreign players. Even watching the City-Chelsea game on Monday I was thinking everyone was foreign <b>[19 of the 22 starters]</b>. That can’t be right. As a former England player, that kills me<br /><br />The problem we have is that <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> are not interested in England. The FA are but don’t have the power. We get through the group phases at a World Cup, play against a better team, get beaten and all of a sudden everyone says: ‘damn, we don’t have enough world-class players’<br /><br />Well, we’re not going to have enough world-class players if we keep bringing in foreign players. There has to be some stipulation where you can only bring so many foreign players in. But <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is so big now, it’s a train that’s not stopping<br /><br />It saddens me more over what will happen next for England. <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> is coming to the end of his career, probably has another two years.

They had characters, men, leaders. We’re not getting leaders any more. It’s the fault of the Academy system and society. Kids are getting snapped up by <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs at seven, coached at an early age. It’s not ‘go and enjoy football’. If they look half-decent they’re getting four-year contracts, their parents are being given money. Parents from foreign countries are being invited over and given a job<br /><br />Why are these <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> kids playing Under-21s? They should be playing <b>[on loan]</b> for League One or Two teams. You get more characters at Macclesfield and Notts County because they’re grown men, who’ve seen a bit of the outside world<br /><br />Thomas could have signed a four-year deal at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. He said: ‘As much I love <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, I need to go and see the real world.’ That’s why he went to Notts County where he could get kicked and no one cares who you are. He’s learned a lot from that<br /><br />When I see all these kids in the England Under-21s, they’ve not been in the real world. They get too much, too soon. You see them driving around in nice cars and I’m thinking ‘you’ve not achieved anything yet’. I see them with earrings and tattoos. They think they’ve made it. A lot of players are more interested in looking like players rather than being players<br /><br />Tom has no earrings, no tattoos. He wants to be a player. It would be easy for him to look like a player because ‘I’m Paul Ince’s son’ but he wants his own identity, to get away from ‘Paul Ince’s son’. He’s different to other kids. They just go on their PlayStations but Thomas will sit and watch games with me, Spanish, French, Italian football<br /><br />I can have a conversation with him about any player. I don’t just want him to play the game; I want him to understand the game. If he goes to the next level, if somebody like <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> or <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> says something to him, he will be able to take it in rather than go ‘uh?’ Maybe in 10 or 20 years’ time he might want to be a manager. He’s competitive - and polite<br /><br />I’m polite. People don’t think I’m polite because they only see me from when I played football: aggressive, moans and shouts but only because I want to win. They don’t see me in my normal life, relaxed with my family. I’m quiet. But I want to get managing again. But I don’t want to keep jumping into fires all the time. I want a chairman who says: ‘right here’s a three-year plan’ and have some stability.<br /><br />But when I look back I can’t complain, I’m a lucky, lucky man to have won trophies, played at Wembley, played in a World Cup. I’m privileged<br /><br />I was the first black England captain. I was the first black <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> manager. I am a trailblazer for other black people. I’m a pioneer</p>

  <p><b>[Former Red Devils skipper Paul Ince did not hold back in an open letter questioning the management of the club from top to bottom]</b> There’s just so much about Manchester United that isn’t right. The footballing ­decisions have been mental for a few years now. The club has fallen far behind the pack. I’d like to think that they will recover, but I think we could be waiting a while. United are back in the Europa League, which is depressing to even think about it, never mind speak about. You’ve got to realise that, while United have fallen behind, City and Liverpool have kept advancing. Don’t think for one minute that those teams will give United any chance to catch up, they’ll only slip further behind.<br /><br />It’s all about personnel for United now. How you improve not only the team but the club, from the top down. You have to start again from fresh. For me, a lot of the issues come down to the attitude of the squad. The players are doing exactly what they want, when they want, and there’s no control from above. It wouldn’t happen under Fergie and it wouldn’t happen under Pep Guardiola. Players are dictating to you and the board what they want - and that’s not on. I get it. You’re a banker - not a football man. You’re absolutely fantastic at bringing in profit and sponsorship deals but you can’t just keep throwing money away on players.<br /><br />You need someone in who gets football, who has the presence to deal with these players and tell them they can’t demand X, Y and Z from United. Tell them where to stick it. Players like Jesse Lingard think they’re bigger than the club and the manager. If Fergie was in charge they wouldn’t be doing it, they wouldn’t even still be at the club. Jesse has been bang average this year and if I’d performed the way he did last season the last thing I would do is post anything on social media. The way he played last season he should be embarrassed. Then there’s Pogba - the man you spent £89 million on. Why did he wait until the end of the season to say he wants to go with a sly comment in the press? If you’re gonna say it, say it in front of those thousands of fans who go to watch you<br /><br /><b>[Solskjaer says he wants to change the philosophy at the club and focus on developing young players rather than more established stars, highlighted by the summer signings of Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James. But Ince believes that strategy is a mistake]</b> On transfer business. I hear people say you need to get players in that will work hard and run around for the club - but it’s not about that. I can come in now and work hard and run about, even at my age. I mean, I wouldn’t last five minutes, but that’s not the criteria that you should want. It’s about quality players with the right spirit and attitude. Aaron Wan-Bissaka was signed for £55m, a lot of money for a full-back. Ole said he wanted to go down the route of bringing in younger, fresher talent and building the team that way - but that’s not the way to go.<br /><br />Do you see many youth players in Manchester City ‘s team except Phil Foden? No, and they just won the league. Liverpool have a couple, but the majority of their team are senior, experienced players interspersed with youth. Youth players today aren’t the likes of David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs. There’s just not that much coming through the academy. Yes, pick two or three youngsters but then integrate them with top class, top quality senior players - don’t rely on it. Then there’s the manager. I said last season you should’ve gone with someone more experienced and I stand by that. But you have made your bed and now have to lie in it. You have tried the whole binning a manager after a year thing and it’s not worked. Now you have to stick with Ole.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Ince says Paul Pogba’s heart isn’t fully in it at Manchester United]</b> Before the game, I was concerned about the Paul Pogba situation and how the fans would react. The way he went about his business this summer, saying he wanted to leave, I wondered what the supporters would do. But he owes the fans because their reception was good. He must’ve been sceptical about the reaction he was going to get, but you have to applaud the fans because it couldn’t have been easy seeing him behave like that. That could have really impacted the way the team played, if all the focus was on Pogba and there was a negative environment for him. It has an impact on all the players, too, they wonder whether they’re going to walk out and he will be slaughtered - and it means he, once again, becomes the centre of attention. That being said, it’s clear that his heart isn’t fully in it at Man United and you can see that from how he played against Chelsea.<br /><br />Sometimes his concentration levels weren’t as they should have been - maybe he still has it in his mind that he’s going to get away before the European window shuts in a couple of weeks. He’s saying all the right things off the pitch, but I wonder if that’s because he has one eye on the exit door. No one is going to be totally happy and confident he’s staying until the window shuts in Spain, Italy etc. You’ve got a big decision after that - if he doesn’t go to Real Madrid, how’s he going to react with his performances at United, at least up until January? With him, the toys are often thrown out of the pram, but if he’s staying he needs to knuckle down for the club.<br /><br />It would be tough for United if he does go, though, and they are unable to replace him. Because from what I can see they don’t have someone already that can do what he does. His attitude was better on Sunday, but he has to continue that now, especially if he doesn’t get his transfer. He’s still putting himself in the shop window at the moment, and it’s clear he wants the move to Real Madrid, so I believe he’ll play to the best of his ability until their window shuts. It’ll be interesting to see what happens after that</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Ince says Romelu Lukaku will be a big loss for Manchester United]</b> It’s a tough one with Romelu Lukaku, because the fact of the matter is he is always going to score you goals. Last season you could see the signs that he wasn’t happy, that he wanted to leave. There were signs that the end was approaching for him, but what he does offer is guaranteed goals in the net. As a club, for United to suddenly lose 20 or so goals that he nets, that’s a big loss and they should have replaced him - his goals will be missed. It puts a lot of pressure on Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial. In my eyes, for United to be performing well, Rashford needs to be netting 20-25 goals this season and I’m not yet sure if he’ll do that.<br /><br />I look at United and I feel like they’re almost copying a Liverpool model. They got Virgil van Dijk in and United got Harry Maguire in, and it seems they’ve gone for three forwards too, pacey players like <b>[Anthony]</b> Martial, Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford - I don’t see where Lukaku fits into that - so I’m not surprised Ole let him go. But that does put extra pressure on the younger lads to find the net. The fact is, Lukaku is a goalscorer, he’s always been a natural goalscorer but the ball has to be placed right in front of him. He has to be fed and he will score you goals, and I’m sure he’ll show that at Inter Milan. Having played there myself, it’s a great move for him. It’s a wonderful club and a wonderful place to live, it’ll be a great experience. The expectations will be huge on him because he’s come from United, and there’ll be nowhere to hide, but he should relish that</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Ince says Manchester United have to hand penalty-taking duty to Marcus Rashford with Paul Pogba’s miss against Wolves having sparked an unnecessary debate]</b> It’s down to Ole’s management. He should be making it perfectly clear before they go on the pitch. He should be saying: ‘If there’s a penalty - Rashford, you’re taking it. If you’re not on the pitch - it’s Pogba, and so on’. There’s a list of order there, it makes it transparent, and there’s none of this bickering about who scored when and who missed, it leaves no room for debate. That’s where it comes down to Ole. He should be making it crystal clear that there is one penalty-taker and that’s it. He needs to show his leadership and tell the players that it’s the end of the theatricals, there’s one person only for the job.<br /><br />There’s been people suggesting that Ole is trying to appease Pogba by letting him take penalties, but as the manager at one of the biggest clubs in the world that shouldn’t even be a thought. You can’t work like that, you need to show that leadership. There’s no reason why he should feel the need to appease Pogba, if anything it should be the other way around. For me, it’s clear who should be chosen, too. Marcus Rashford has never missed a penalty in senior football, he netted in United’s 4-0 opener against Chelsea, there’s an obvious choice here, he should be the penalty taker. Look at his record, why would you go for anyone else? We all miss them at times of course, but also a major consideration should be Pogba’s future. Will he even be here when the European window shuts? And if he is, will he leave in January anyway? Whereas you’ve got Rashford, who’s going to be around for four or five years, so why not just make him your man?</p>

It’s funny because I remember going to Cremonese as an <a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a> player. I went out for the ball with the goalkeeper and he keeper fouled me. We both went down, and was rolling around for a bit. I got up just to show I wasn’t hurt and carried on playing. Then, suddenly half the stadium was shouting racial abuse at me. The ball came out - on the edge of the box - and I hard volleyed it straight in the top right-hand corner. But I’d done my hip in and I was trying to stay on, because I didn’t want to come off and let them know I was hurt. But for the next 20 minutes or so, until half time, they were shouting awful stuff at me, ‘negro’ and ‘negro di merdia’ - that kind of thing. That was terrible.<br /><br />Anyway, we ended up winning the game three-one, and then the next day I got a letter from the mayor of Cremonese just to say, Paul, we apologise for that, what our fans said and our poor behaviour - that’s not us. And I said, well, to be fair, it is you. They’re your fans, and you can’t control them. So, it’s always been there. As I say, it was probably even worse when I first went to join Inter, there was even a racist remark on the wall about me, since the first day I landed there. It’s always been there. It feels like Italian fans have always got away with it - their federation never stamped down on it, and so they still feel they can use that kind of behaviour to affect black players.

It’s time to think about sporting penalties instead of fines, we’ve got to be throwing that at people, so that they’re aware that will happen. Fines aren’t doing anything. It’s not hitting home to anybody, it really, really isn’t and you can see that.<br /><br />We need to make it transparent, if this behaviour continues, or it happens again, your club is out of Europe. It’s difficult though because sometimes it’s individuals with these opinions, that’s different to 20 or 100 fans. Unfortunately, there’s always one idiot, or two idiots, that will do that. There must be a deterrent. Whether it’s in England, or Europe or whatever, take points off the teams, take them out of cup games, whatever. Empty stadiums don’t really work - you’re only hit in the pocket for two or three games - but point deductions, that could work. What disturbs me is the last four or five years, we kind of felt like it was reducing and being stamped out. But in the last one or two years, it’s reared its ugly head again. It’s really disturbing</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Ince says It could be five years before <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title challengers]</b> There’s a lot of things that aren’t right at Old Trafford at the moment, and they need to be addressed. I don’t know where United are going as a club. From a football point of view, I expected an in and out season, I could’ve accepted that - but I would’ve anticipated the performances would be so much better. <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> knows they’re not going to win the title this year, or next. It could be five years before they do. I believe that the only chance they have in the near future is if <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> and Pep leave <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and City. Whether Ole will still be in charge by then, who knows<br /><br />This season, again, will be a transitional year. I’m not disappointed or angry about that, it’s just where they are as a team at the moment. The results are going to be up and down and I’m prepared to accept that, as long as they challenge for the top four. I’m more concerned about the director of football situation and the way <a href="edward-woodward.html">Ed Woodward</a> is building the club. He is rightly getting a lot of stick - people who appoint managers should be made accountable. For the results, for the structure of the club, for the recruitment, and so on. They knew they were going to lose <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>, and it was obvious Sanchez had to move on, so why the hell have they not got a striker or two in?<br /><br /><a href="edward-woodward.html">Ed Woodward</a> isn’t a football man, he’s a money man. From that perspective, I’m sure he’s doing a great job - but the fans don’t give a toss about the money if it isn’t being invested back into the team. They want <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> quality players on the pitch, to be entertained, to be winning things, and they’re not getting that. It doesn’t look like a <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> team anymore. What United need is someone who knows where to find <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> players, where the hidden gems are, and how to get them.<br /><br />Currently, United are being held to ransom. <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> is a terrific player, but £80 million? They’re being forced to pay over the odds to get top players. What they should be doing is identifying these talents earlier, doing proper research, and getting them for a lot cheaper. That’s not down to one person to do, it’s about the director of football and their team - United probably need to hire four or five people who can go out and start building blocks. It might take a year or two, but at least they’d be moving forwards</p>

I stand totally by that comment. Everyone got sucked into the start he’d made, without looking at the fixtures they had. It’s a result-based business, and that’s fine, but you can’t ignore performances. Now, though, having decided he’s the man, giving him a long-term project and buying into his vision, they have to stick with him. Irrespective of whether they win or lose at the weekend, he’s their man. There are no two ways about it, they’ve made their bed, and right now they’re lying in it.<br /><br />They can’t be sacking their manager and abandoning the strategy, based on a few results. United will win games, people will get excited again, then they’ll lose and it’ll be back to crisis mode. They’re the biggest team in the world, they’ll be on the back pages no matter what. That’s what comes with being a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player or manager. But they no longer have that presence in terms of intimidating opponents.

  <p><b>[Paul Ince has slated <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s performances in the 2019-20 season and believes that they should make winning the Europa League a priority now]</b> For me, Ole needs to focus on the Europa League now and make it a priority. Similar to how <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> did, he knows that realistically, it’s United’s best chance of Champions League football. Because, let’s be honest, top four looks like it’s going to be a struggle. At the minute, they don’t look like they will make it. And while United are falling, teams like <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> are building and looking to make those spots. And, realistically, all United can hope for nowadays is a top four place, because they’re so far off winning a league title. It’s a trophy, it’s a Champions League space, and when your team look like they might not be capable of making the top four in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> - why not try and win it? It’s got to be the main target<br /><br />Don’t throw away the league of course, but I don’t want to see a weakened team against AZ Alkmaar. I know it’s not a tough opponent, but both that game and <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> this weekend should be games they’re winning, no question. It’ll be very disappointing if they don’t win both. For United, at the moment, every game is a big game<br /><br /><b>[Ince also highlighted the lack of quality in the draw with the Gunners]</b> When I watched the <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> vs <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> match on Monday - with all the misplaced passes, people losing the ball, etc - it genuinely reminded me of being in the playground at school playing football, not watching two of the biggest teams in England! There’s an enormous lack of quality in those two teams, they’re both really, really poor. There’s no comparison between them, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and even <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. Don’t get me wrong, I can see that <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> are trying to give their academy, and young players a chance. But you have to sit back and go - are these lads actually good enough? Are they going to be long term choices, realistically? It’s brilliant bringing them through, but we need to look at quality of them too. United are in a situation now where they’ve played seven games and are 12 points behind <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, and seven behind <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>. When you talk about the gap between them and those two, that says it all - it shows you how far they’ve fallen. We’re not talking 20 games into the season - we’re talking seven</p>

You do need to remember that he’s played a lot of football for a kid so young, and there is so much pressure on him because United are so reliant on him.

My advice for him would to be to get out on that training ground, afternoon after afternoon, and work on it. Ole needs to get him working on it too, just take him to one side with a coach and get him working on his composure. It will improve him as a player - and in turn his confidence will come back too</p>

It would have been the next step for him, but obviously that wasn’t to be. What’s happened at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> this season doesn’t change the way I felt then<br /><br /><b>[Ince has been outspoken in his criticism of United of late]</b> They’re a young team and there’s going to be some inconsistency in their performances and results. But it’s a little bit worrying that there’s not been any progress. It’s not always about winning games. I think Man United fans understand that the quality isn’t there yet - they’ve got five or six players who’ve been out injured. But you still want to see progress in what they’re doing, and we’re not seeing that. We didn’t see it against AZ Alkmaar, and we didn’t see it against <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. That’s what people are getting a bit critical of - not having a shot against AZ Alkmaar, and against <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> they had two shots that didn’t really trouble the goalkeeper.<br /><br />When you look at <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>’s team at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, you see what they’re doing - scoring goals and creating chances. Man United fans can deal with the results as long as you’re seeing a performance on the pitch where the <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> goalkeeper got man of the match and made eight saves, they’ve hit the post and the bar. You can accept that, but we’re not seeing that - we’re not seeing chances<br /><br /><b>[Ince fears for the Red Devils]</b> People talk about relegation - they’re not going to go down, let’s get that out of our heads. I don’t know why people are saying that - they could finish in the bottom half, but who knows, they could finish in the top half. They’ve got enough quality to finish in the top half, but it’s about the gap to the teams at the top. <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> are five points ahead - that could be eight if United lose on Sunday</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Ince says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> have gone soft and lost fear factor]</b> It’s all about mentality. You have to have people and characters. The biggest thing for us was we had a presence. In the tunnel we had already beaten most teams before even going out on the pitch. We had that presence about us but if you look at United now, teams look at them and think they can get something from them. Not just at home but also when they go to Old Trafford<br /><br />The game has changed. There are no (Roy) Keane, (Bryan) <a href="bryan-robson.html">Robson</a>, (Steven) <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a>, (Patrick) Vieira or Emmanuel Petit-type players anymore. You just don’t get them anymore and a lot of those players, a lot of them had tough backgrounds and football has been their life. It was their passion but now football is just a job to some players. They get the best of everything financially and the pitches are great so they have that mentality where they are a bit soft. I watched United play <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> the other week and I saw them tackled and just rolling over. I wanted them to get up and get on with it, they were 1-0 down you know. That mentality we had, these players haven’t got that now. You don’t get those players anymore and this is the problem United have. That time (under Ferguson) has gone and we need to find another way to be successful<br /><br />You have to get quality and that is something United haven’t got. You can’t blame the youth, players like <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a>, <a href="tahith-chong.html">Tahith Chong</a>, <a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a>, there are no people around them to get them through these games.

But I think, if he wanted to, returning to Old Trafford would be the way to go. He’d be great at educating all of these young players that Ole is looking to bring through, an incredible off-pitch influence as well as on the field. They need someone who can control the changing room and be a true leader, and he fits that role. He can show the young players how it’s done. He would be the Godfather of United’s dressing room<br /><br />You know that he isn’t going to play 90 minutes every game, but he’s a lethal goal scorer ultimately.

He needs to just come out and say where he’s at. But instead, as we’ve seen, he hides behind <a href="mino-raiola.html">Mino Raiola</a> rather than saying it himself.

It’s clear he regrets returning to Old Trafford. The fact is, though, when <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> plays and he plays well there’s no way Ole would drop him. Really, he should be the talisman of that team.<br /><br />He should be enthused and excited by the fact that the team could be built around him and he could be the main man, but he doesn’t seem interested in that to me. He’s not bothered about being the captain of Man United. It doesn’t excite him to be the leader of this club. It feels as though we all bought into the romance of him returning to Man United. But it’s never really happened for him, has it? It’s not gone the way either he or the club wanted it to go. I would say he regrets making the move, now<br /><br />Ole has said he’s waiting for <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> to come in and talk to him, even. But it shouldn’t be like that, it should be Ole dragging him in and asking him what exactly he sees for his future of the club. As a manager, he should be asking him what’s going on and what his issue is. You’re telling me <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> would’ve dealt with it this way? No chance - he’d have pulled <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> in and then decided whether he wanted to then pass that message on to fans and media.<br /><br />Where it’s really frustrating is we’ve heard this story about <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> wanting to leave several times now, but yet here he still is. Unless someone’s going to come in for him at the price United want, for someone who’s still injured, he’s still going to be there at the end of the month. It’s a vicious circle. I’m not convinced he’s going anywhere in January. He wants to, yes, but realistically I don’t know who’s going to have him. At the moment though, it feels like it’s all about <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>. And Man United have never, and should never, be about just one person.

I say <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> Invincibles, those Man United teams and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> teams that kept winning things constantly.

We can take our time so come next season they are ready to go. It is a shame not to have it but it is the right decision to delay it.<br /><br />It is different now and it is good to see players going to different countries and learning their trade. Looking at the Italian league, there’s a resurgence. When I went there it was the best league in the world. Best players, managers and money. Then <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> came up and it kind of fell flat on its face. Now, I see a resurgence from <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>. Players want to play there and crowds go up. It is easier for our players to move abroad because it is so cosmopolitan. When I went to Inter there were no English players, it was mostly Italian players, I had to learn the language and get involved in the culture. Players go to clubs and they can speak English. We got lazy for a period because we didn’t want to learn a new language. Now it isn’t a scary thing because people speak English. It is great for our young players who go out there and do it. Like <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a>, they learn a different football, way of life and then they become a man. It can help you on the international stage as well.

  <p><b>[Paul Ince says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> kidding themselves if they think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> can be caught in a couple of years]</b> It will take a long time to catch up and if anyone at Old Trafford thinks it can be done in a couple of years with some big money signings, they are kidding themselves. I would look at the departure of <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> as a starting point for where we have got to now, with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> so far ahead of United. <a href="david-moyes.html">David Moyes</a> came into United at that time, didn’t get the time or money he needed to do the job and then they moved on to <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a>, who never seemed to be the right for fit United, despite winning <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup in 2016. After that, you had <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> and he didn’t look happy from day one, even though he won a couple of trophies in his first seasons<br /><br />It was all about <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> sniping at the press, problems behind the scenes with <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> and there was a general mood of discontent at the club. Then they turned to Ole and he is very inexperienced for a job of that size. To manage Cardiff, Molde and then end up in charge of the biggest club in the world was always going to be tough for him and I’m not surprised that he has struggled. The end result is there has been a lot of damage caused by the instability at the club over the last six years and at the same time, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have had stability, especially since <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> came in. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have had a plan, they stuck to it even when things didn’t go great for <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> in his first year and now they are getting the rewards. At United, managers have come and gone, they’ve had their own ideas on players, spent fortunes on terrible signings and they found themselves 30 points behind <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> at the halfway point of the season, which is embarrassing for a club of United’s stature.<br /><br /><b>[the differences between <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and United]</b> They have a fantastic spine and that’s what United are lacking at the moment, primarily because their transfer dealings have been absolutely horrendous. There is no point beating around the bush here. <a href="edward-woodward.html">Ed Woodward</a> (executive vice-chairman) has failed in his transfer dealings and I don’t think United can move forward until he is replaced or someone comes in to help with transfers who understands the game</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Ince says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> used to fall apart, now they’re made of strong stuff]</b> They won the Champions League in June and have kicked on from there. They are hungry, they are ready for it and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> have not been up to the task of sticking with them this time. I give all the credit in the world to <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> and his players. They had a massive high winning the Champions League and that came on the back of the massive low of losing out in the title race after getting 97 points and losing just one game all season. You look back to 2014 and the last time <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> nearly won the league, they fell apart the next season and <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> ended up getting sacked because they took one too many punches in the stomach, but this <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team are made of stronger stuff. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has built them superbly, piece by piece. He has bought a spine in Alisson, <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> and <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a>, with players like <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> and <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> improving so much since he arrived at the club</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Ince says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> would be daft not to ask the <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> question]</b> I cannot see <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> happening. I can see him going, yes, and wanting to leave <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, but not to join United. People keep saying that what they keep forgetting is they’ve got <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> up front. He’s always wanted to play up front, but what you need to remember is he can also play off the left-hand side, as we’ve seen from plenty of his goals this season. Plus, between him and <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a>, <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> coming in would also bring some competition to the side. There’s always been a sense of competition at United, and it would be nice to see that back again, players fighting for their places. So if you’re looking at <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> left, <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> centre and <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> on the right, it sounds pretty nice doesn’t it? But it probably sounds like a dream for a reason, it is a dream<br /><br />Don’t get me wrong, if, and it’s a big if, United can get <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a>, and he fancies the move, surely you’re going to go for him. You’d be absolutely daft not to. If you can get him, then you have to go and get him, but I can’t see it being the case. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fans won’t like to hear me say this either, but sometimes as a player you simply need a new challenge. Whether that’s at Old Trafford, or in my opinion, more likely abroad, who knows? However if he’s on the market then if you’ve got to at least have a go at getting him, if you’re United. You’re taking a completely complete, proven player. He’s only going to get better and better. He’s a guarantee</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Ince says <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> isn’t bigger than <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> &amp; do they need him?]</b> They’ve got to resolve the <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> situation. It has to be resolved. You can’t keep having what we’re having every six, seven, eight weeks. He’s going, he’s staying, the agent comes out. <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> is not bigger than <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, no player is bigger than <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. The way Ole <b>[Gunnar Solskjaer]</b> is going, you don’t want any disruptions. He either knuckles down and starts performing the way he should be performing for the money he cost, or they sell him. The biggest thing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> is Fernandes coming in. Before that you are saying, ‘We need <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> in there’. Now because he’s been out injured and Fernandes has come in, all of a sudden, ‘Do we need <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> in there?’ Does he get in there? I know he <b>[Solskjaer]</b> likes <b>[Scott]</b> <a href="scott-mctominay.html">McTominay</a>. <b>[Nemanja]</b> <a href="nemanja-matic.html">Matic</a> has come in and started playing well. Does <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> start every game? If Ole thinks he’s not going to, he might think he can cash in and bring one or two other players in. But the saga needs to be sorted out before the start of next season because next season is a big season for Ole. A big, big season. But I like the way they are going now, I like what I’m seeing. I can’t make judgement yet. They are not there yet where <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and City are, but signs are good and that’s a good thing to say because I didn’t see those signs a year ago. I like what I’m seeing. I like the place and I like the players they are bringing in. You’ve got to give Ole time now to take them where they need to be, which is challenging for the league title</p>
