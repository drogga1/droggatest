  <p><b>[Legendary Milan midfielder Gianni Rivera believes <a href="leonardo.html">Leonardo</a>’s men have what it takes to reconquer the European scene]</b> I think Milan are the favourites to get to the final in Madrid, but watch Inter and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> too. The <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a> are a complete squad. Milan just need some consistency in terms of their physical strength.

  <p><b>[Italian legend Gianni Rivera believes Inter will win the Scudetto at the end of the season]</b> I think that they will dominate in 2010, just like they have in 2009. The other sides are not able to keep up with them, and don’t have as much depth in their substitutes. Inter will win the championship without any problems. If a coach doesn’t transform individual players into a group, then it could do irreparable damage. Many teams with quality players did not win anything because they were not united</p>

They are two great attackers, but the two teams have already shown that they can do without important players. Who would I choose? <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a>.

It’s a key match for <a href="leonardo.html">Leonardo</a>’s men. A defeat would mean they are still inferior to an Inter side who felt they had no rivals. ‘Dinho’ strikes me as an athlete now and he even puts in plenty of tackles. The <a href="ac-milan.html">Rossoneri</a> are in excellent form and there is a lot of enthusiasm. That’s why I believe they are favourites</p>

He is the best of the best and knows how to do everything. He deserves the golden boot for what he is doing. I don’t think being champions is a handicap for us.

I was sincerely scared seeing all those people armed with knives. I am a bit saddened because it seemed an interesting match. Both teams were prepared, and it is a shame the match was suspended. The referee rightly called the match off after a dangerous incident involving our goalkeeper, who barely saved himself from a dangerous moment.<br /><br />Now, we will speak about footballing violence, and what we saw at the Marassi was true delinquency. If we <b>[Italy]</b> have to go to Serbia, we will go there with a team that has no problems. <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> should reflect whether the return match should be played in a neutral venue, away from Serbian territory</p>

  <p><b>[Italian legend Gigi Riva has defended former Inter president Giacinto Facchetti in the wake of the recent accusations that he had regular contact with former referee designators Paolo Bergamo and Pier Luigi Pairetto in an attempt to influence games]</b> I’m not saying he didn’t make those phone calls, they are in the documents, but it just isn’t possible that Giacinto made them to gain an advantage. I can imagine lots of others doing that, but not him, absolutely not. He dedicated his life to the sport and the national side, and anyone who ever met him knows who Giacinto was. A true man. Hearing certain things really gets my back up. Maybe one day I’ll be able to understand it but at the moment I find it impossible: what’s the point in digging out a matter whose statute of limitations has passed and involving a person who is no longer alive, who can’t have his own say? I just can’t see him in the role of someone who talks to referees in order to influence them. All those people who are saying things about him now would do well to keep their mouths shut because Giacinto was a simple, honest man who deserves respect</p>

When I saw these buses of <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> fans arriving from Germany, Holland and England for our games in Milan or <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a>, it wasn’t the joy of sport you saw in their eyes but the joy of being Sardinian.
