<blockquote>
  <p>[On Justin Meram] When he first got to the league he was so raw, but you saw little glimpses that there was something special in him. He was always quick, he was always fast, but he wasn’t powerful. He didn’t have an ability to take contact and bounce off it. He’d be able to push it by you but then you could always get a body on him and throw him off his path. Now he’s really worked in the weight room, he put the time in there and he’s just more powerful now.<br /><br />[The club’s constant desire for wide reinforcements has become a running joke in the Crew locker room] That is something that we’ve been joking about for a while. Since he’s been here, there’s always been guys in and out, and good players as well. We’ll sign one and he’ll say, ‘Well there goes my spot’.</p>
