  <p><b>[Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck admits his love of football helped to keep him going]</b> I think it’s just the love of football <b>[that keeps you going]</b>. However hard it may have been at the time experiencing what I experienced - it was hard being on the sidelines and watching on TV - it’s about the thrill of getting back out on the pitch. Once you’re able to go outside the gym and physically do stuff on the pitch it’s something you can’t really put into words how good it feels. Even just passing the ball for the first time. Obviously you go through ups and downs in the rehab process and that was difficult but as you get closer and closer you feel so much better.<br /><br />The most important thing for me at the moment is to gather a consistency in training and obviously get minutes under my belt in the first team matches then we’ll see from there. Obviously I’ve been out for a long time and then a long before that which was horrible for me. The second time round it really, really hit home because it was so difficult to take. At first you get told you’re missing a couple of months and after the surgery you get told you’re missing a certain amount of time <b>[over 8 months]</b>. It’s difficult to take. Right now I’m just going to enjoy playing, enjoy training and hopefully get back on the pitch and win some games</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Welbeck reveals the Arsenal team-mate he used to hate]</b> Obviously me and Gibbo <b>[Kieran Gibbs]</b> are very close friends now but back then I used to hate him, to be honest. He was bigger than me, faster than me, he was so strong and I was like, ‘what is this guy about?’.<br /><br />He scored the first goal at the Emirates. The second leg was at Old Trafford and I scored the winner to knock Arsenal out<br /><br />It’s difficult to put this guy into words. He is one of the sickest guys, seriously! He just lifts the whole atmosphere up in the dressing room. And I think he helped me a lot. He’s always there talking to you, giving you advice, asking you how you’re feeling. I think once you’re injured it can be quite a dark place, but Per was one of the reasons that kept me smiling throughout. Even his playlist is banging to be fair! It’s mad man, you walk in the dressing room and he’s there singing Drake and Future and that. You wouldn’t expect it if you met Per Mertesacker, but he’s a top man. A sick, sick guy!</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Welbeck had to be man who would break Mourinho’s hold over Arsenal and Wenger]</b> I grew up there and it’s a special place in my life, but once we get on that pitch it’s just business at the end of the day. It’s for the team. When you score, you’ve got to be happy. It’s only normal</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Welbeck admits Arsenal have disappointed as he seeks to right FA Cup wrongs]</b> As a club, with the way the season’s panned out, it’s not a <b>[league]</b> position we want to be in at all. We know that we’ve got the opportunity of playing in the FA Cup final, and it’s something we really want to do our best in.<br /><br />With the last cup final, I wasn’t on the pitch and that was disappointing for me. It was a bittersweet moment for me because you know you’ve played your part to get there and your team-mates are winning and lifting the trophy, but you wanted to be a part of that and play a part on the pitch as well.<br /><br />It’s difficult but it’s now something that’s behind me and you can’t change it. I’ve got the final to look forward to this season, so it’s something that I’m going to enjoy. I’m going to play the game and try to win the final.<br /><br />Wembley is a place I know really well because I’ve played there multiple times. If you know the surroundings a bit better, it gives you that kind of familiarity. It’s a great place to play and what better occasion than the FA Cup final. Hopefully we’ll be able to lift the cup again</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Welbeck is concerned by the speculation surrounding Alexis Sanchez at Arsenal]</b> It’s obvious to see how important he is for the team with his great ability on the pitch and also off it with his attitude. It’s not great to lose your best players.<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he considers those issues to be behind him]</b> Yes, definitely. I’ve not done it yet but I’m looking forward to building on the stage I’m in at the moment and obviously in the future I hope I will be playing three games in a week. It has been difficult, coming back from injury and getting into the team and out of it. I have just got to make sure I’m integrated well into the team, not just in for a certain amount of games but repetitively one after the other.<br /><br />My body has got to adjust to the training load and then playing in the matches so you do get your niggles here and there, it’s something you have got to cope with. But I feel like I’ve been handling it pretty well and have had no major reactions with my knee. It’s just a little niggle here and there with my foot and my big toe. That’s the thing that has been putting me out of the team at the moment. It’s just a bruise on the bottom of my foot so every time I’m running on it, it repeatedly is banging on the bruise</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Welbeck claims to have taken extra motivation from Arsenal investing heavily in fellow forwards Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang]</b> It’s competition and I embrace it. Ever since I was a young kid, I’ve been playing for an academy with scouts all over the world that are looking for top players to come in. You have competition throughout your whole life and it only makes you better. That competitive edge gives you extra motivation.<br /><br />Obviously the injuries have derailed me in the past, but it’s gone now and there’s nothing I can do about it. My mindset’s just focused on looking forward, bettering myself, getting on the pitch, on the training pitch, doing what I can do to improve myself. When I get on that pitch, I want to make an impact. That’s all I can say<br /><br />With the way the season’s gone at the moment, we know that we should be doing much, much better. Arsenal Football Club should be much higher up the table and we should be pushing to win championships. Obviously it’s disappointing for us to be in this position now, but what we can do now is just focus on the remaining fixtures, going into those games and giving everything</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Welbeck has welcomed added competition at Arsenal]</b> The miss, it isn’t like I wanted to miss. I just couldn’t stretch enough to get there. But that’s football. You just have to know there is going to be another opportunity and you have to keep focused. I’ve been through much tougher stuff than that so it’s nothing, you just have to keep your mindset strong. In professional football, there are always going to be critics. You see people are criticising Cristiano Ronaldo, and he’s at the pinnacle. Every day in every single walk of life, you can do something good and people will have something bad to say about you. You just get on with it and do your job as best you can.<br /><br /><b>[On the squad depth at Emirates Stadium]</b> It is nice. It gives you that added motivation. The competition is there so you are going to improve and better yourself. I’ve had that throughout my whole career. Being at an academy where players come from all over the world and it is the same here, you are always going to have that competition. It is healthy. As you’ve seen, I can play with Pierre and with Laca. When I’m on the pitch, I just want to give as good a performance as possible. I know I can link up with plenty of the players in this team</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Welbeck has David Beckham’s England goal record in his sights]</b> Everybody watched David Beckham growing up, it’s nice to hear I’m one away. Obviously I want to keep on getting more game time for England and scoring more goals. I’m looking forward to achieving that but I don’t want to rest on my laurels, I want to keep improving. My most outstanding moments watching England were Michael Owen’s goal <b>[against Argentina]</b> in ‘98 and Beckham’s free-kick against Greece at Old Trafford. He was such an inspiration for players all around the world.<br /><br />Marcus scored a hell of a goal and Vards was dangerous through the whole game, there’s a lot of competition in the squad. But I have a good record scoring goals for England. I’ll always make those runs and be there to try and stick it in the back of the net. That healthy competition ups everyone’s game. Every time we meet up with the squad there’s great camaraderie, it’s a very enjoyable environment to be in and I’m really excited for the coming</p>

  <p><b>[England can hurt any team they play]</b> We will do our analysis of Colombia. We know the strengths and weaknesses we will be looking to exploit. With the players in our squad, we can hurt any opposition.<br /><br />With the formation we play, we like to keep possession of the ball but we also like to create opportunities. There has been a lot of talk about set-pieces and getting goals from that but in this tournament a lot of goals have been scored from set-pieces. We have created opportunities but maybe we have been fouled in dangerous positions, which is leading to us not getting as many goals from open play</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Welbeck admits it has been frustrating at times watching on at Arsenal]</b> Yeah, but you have to wait for your opportunity. A few of the lads had a bit more of a pre-season than me, which made it a bit difficult. I came back a bit later than the others, but when I get the opportunity … I got 90 minutes last week <b>[against Vorksla Poltava in the Europa League]</b> and 90 minutes today so I’m just going to build on it from there and keep on improving.<br /><br />We want to impose our style on the game and we want to create chances that way. I think when we broke <b>[against Brentford]</b> it was very difficult for the other team to keep up with us. The more we can do that, the better. It’s nice to finish it off at the end</p>

I used to live in digs with Craig at United and I’ve spoken to Clevz a lot about the club. He said I’d really enjoy it here and thinks it’ll be a great match for me to come here.<br /><br />It seems like a great club with the whole surrounding environment. It’s a family-orientated place and that’s something that I value very highly. I’ve played against <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> and I like to watch football so I’ve seen them play on TV a lot and I know the team, and I think this is a place where I can really flourish.
