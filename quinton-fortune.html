  <p><b>[Quinton Fortune on Adnan Januzaj]</b> Everyone around the club knew that he was special. He was making so much progress and when he went to train with the first team, some of those lads were talking about him. He has so much belief and confidence in his own ability, and that’s hard to see in young players these days. He reminds me of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> when he arrived. He is doing incredibly well. He is already one of the key players in the team. He is a fantastic player and there is more to come from him</p>

  <p><b>[Quinton Fortune has returned to Manchester United as part of a coaching re-structure of the club’s Under-23 side]</b> I am delighted to return to the club in this new role. As a former player, I know exactly what it takes and also what it means to play for Manchester United. I have a great relationship with Ole, whom I also worked with at Cardiff when I was assistant manager of their Under-21s, and I look forward to working with him again alongside Nicky and Neil. We will all work together in order to achieve the ultimate aim of producing players capable of performing in Manchester United’s first team</p>

  <p><b>[Quinton Fortune believes that <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> will be impeded if the Swede had to face <a href="ronny-johnsen.html">Ronny Johnsen</a> in his prime]</b> Johnsen is too humble. I’d say Ronny could stop him – no problem! If it was me in my prime, I don’t know – maybe I’ll kick <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a>, or he’ll kick me!<br /><br />I’ve played against many great players over the years and I’d love to play against <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> – he’ll be a great challenge. It’ll be a great battle, but with Ronny, we can stop him easily – not easily – but Ronny can stop him!</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player Quinton Fortune has set his sights on one day becoming manager at Old Trafford]</b> I thought about that question yesterday for some reason and my first thought was to become the manager of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. That’s my dream. Of course, I’m starting now with the Under-23s and I’m learning a lot and I want to learn as much as possible because management changes so much in the game today. Look, I <b>[may]</b> have to go out and learn somewhere else and become a manager. But the dream, the ultimate dream, is to come back and be the manager of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. From what I’ve been through, I’m going for the highest level<br /><br /><b>[Critics pointing out just four of England’s 92 clubs are managed by a black man, Fortune wants to be given a role because of his qualities and not because of his race]</b> I want to be given the job because of my ability. I want to always be judged because of my character and what I can bring to the team, not because of the colour of my skin. When you look at the game, you see a lot of black players but why are there not many black managers? I don’t know what the reason is. I think if I go too deep into that it will block my way of thinking. I like to think I am going to work as hard as I can, get all my qualifications, prepare myself and not let that barrier stop me. And if there is a system put in place, great, but regardless of that I’m going to go and work anyway.</p>

  <p><b>[Quinton Fortune says <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a> is the real deal]</b> This is how amazing Mason is and why he’s a little bit different. I’m walking through the building at the Aon Training Complex and there’s a computer room where the analyst team work. Mason was in there, looking at games and how he can do better. He’s on it. He’s just a natural. He’s an unbelievable finisher. He’s the real deal.<br /><br /><b>[Fortune added on <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> being the ideal man to help <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a> reach his full potential]</b> Mason is fortunate he’s got Ole as a manager. Obviously there’s all the coaches he’s had through his youth-team career but he couldn’t ask for a better manager because Ole’s done it at the highest level.<br /><br />There’s not many players in world football that are able to go both ways like Mason does. Equally, left and right foot, he’s ridiculous. I thought he was left-footed and then he takes penalties with his right! And I’ve seen him take a free kick with his right foot, his left foot. I’m like ‘what’s wrong with you!? Just pick one! Are you okay?’ I’m waiting for him to have a burst of speed but he’s so good around the box. Stepover, boom! He’s just created that one little yard for him and boom! As a defender, which way do you show Mason? He can go right, he can go left. I don’t even know, the guy’s got everything.</p>

  <p><b>[Quinton Fortune: Team-mate’s racist abuse was ‘lowest point of my life’]</b> I’ve never spoken about this much but the lowest point in my life was in Spain. Not just as a football player, but as a human being. I was signed with <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> and they loaned me out to Mallorca. My own team-mate racially abused me in training. I didn’t know what to do. I was 17 or 18, I didn’t know who to turn to, I didn’t speak the language, and of top of that the manager didn’t communicate with me. I had no support. I was just told to sit on the side of the pitch. I never prayed so much in all my life just to get away from that club. I’m sure many players went through worse experiences but that for me was the lowest point because I had no mum or dad or brothers or anyone to turn to. This guy is a senior player in the team and he was saying all these things to me. Luckily for me, I got out of there. When I went back to Madrid, I was so happy, just to get out of that environment. I made some very good friends in Madrid and carried on with my football. I’m sure many players went through more difficult (experiences) but you need support. It needs changing. It needs education<br /><br />All the clubs, I take my hat off, the way they’ve approached this and the support they have given. But when you talk about change <b>[…]</b> Around 34 per cent of players in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> are black, maybe more, but when we look at coaches right around <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and Football League, six per cent are black coaches. I’m all for the <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> Rule. It’s a great step forward in terms of giving BAME coaches the opportunity to have an interview. That’s progress. Any club can have diversity, inclusion, but you need to have a target. For the next 18 months, I want to see four or five black coaches in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. <br /><br />But not just in coaching, board members as well. You need to put them in a position where they can learn. It will be brilliant for the game because different minds, different ways of looking at things. It will inspire people from BAME backgrounds to see someone they can identify with.<br /><br />When I saw Nelson Mandela become president after 27 years in prison, I felt anything was possible. When I came over to this country in 1991, my former team-mate at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, Neale Fenn, gave me a book about <a href="pele.html">Pele</a>. He won the World Cup aged 17 and when I read his story, he came from same background as me. It is important to have diversity and I would encourage every club to do it, but the next step is keeping those black and Asian players there for a long period of time. Put them in positions of leadership and then see what happens. That’s real change. <a href="les-ferdinand.html">Les Ferdinand</a>, look at what he is doing as director of sport at QPR. I think <a href="chris-hughton.html">Chris Hughton</a> was the last black manager in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. You need more. It is not possible to have 34 per cent of players being black and no black coaches. You need real change<br /><br /><b>[Fortune hails <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>’s selflessness]</b> What Marcus has done is beyond his years. It’s unbelievable. When you’re playing, you’re so focused on just doing your job. Of course, you think about your family but you’re so focused on making sure you prepare well and do well for the team, for the boss. For Marcus to take a moment and do what he did <b>[…]</b> I saw the letter he wrote on social media. This sums up <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. When Brian McClair left, he told me, and I always remember, the very core of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is humility. What Marcus showed is humility of the highest level. He didn’t think about himself or his family; he thought about every kid around the country. That selflessness sums up <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> as a club</p>
