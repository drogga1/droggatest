  <p><b>[Quinton Fortune on <a href="adnan-januzaj.html">Adnan Januzaj</a>]</b> Everyone around the club knew that he was special. He was making so much progress and when he went to train with the first team, some of those lads were talking about him. He has so much belief and confidence in his own ability, and that’s hard to see in young players these days. He reminds me of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> when he arrived. He is doing incredibly well. He is already one of the key players in the team. He is a fantastic player and there is more to come from him</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho needs to replicate his success from the 2016 summer transfer window at Manchester United]</b> Hopefully, we will get some signings as good as the ones we got last season. Paul Pogba, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Eric Bailly and Mkhi. All were high quality and the deals were done very quickly. <b>[Jose]</b> was very clear on the players he wanted and it was good to see that we went out and got them quickly. We settled them in, and it took a bit of time, but they’ve been brilliant, every single one of them.<br /><br />I hope we’ll have the same kind of summer, bringing in a few new faces and strengthening the club. Manchester United always need to strengthen, it’s good for competition, and the aim next season in my opinion, and I’m sure the manager will think the same, has got to be to win the Premier League. It’s nice being back in the Champions League but the main goal will be winning the league<br /><br />That’s just going to happen every summer, with so many players being linked. It’s <b>[Antoine]</b> Griezmann one day and <b>[Kylian]</b> Mbappe, the young French player, the next day and there are so many other players too. But it’s what you want and what you expect - players to be linked to Manchester United</p>

  <p><b>[The weather in Manchester prevented United from signing Ronaldinho in 2003]</b> I think we got it wrong by bringing Ronaldinho in at the wrong time of year as it was raining that day he arrived at Manchester Airport. Maybe it was summer anyway but, if we’d have timed it with the right day, it could have been a different story. It would have been absolutely amazing to have him here. He’s one of the greatest players ever to play football and entertained with his skill, fun and joy. I was very fortunate to play for South Africa against him in the Olympics in front of 72,000 fans but, when he was at Barcelona, he was a different Ronaldinho so I’m hoping we get a glimpse of that and I hope I won’t have to mark him!.</p>

  <p><b>[Pogba can be one of the Premier League’s best]</b> Pogba has been fantastic now he’s had a pre-season under his belt. Pogba stands out for me but it’s a team performance. Of course he can be one of the best players in the league this season. I am sure this is one of his own objectives and goals he has set himself. I’m just happy he’s settled now and has had a season back here, plus pre-season, which is very important.<br /><br />Paul looks very strong and very calm. He is not trying to prove to the whole world his ability as we’ve known that now for some time. This season, hopefully he’ll score loads of goals and it’s about him taking that leadership role. The manager has made him his captain a few times and it’s good for him. He has got to take responsibility and I am sure he relishes that. He has got to help the side as the most important objective is for the team. I hope the team agree that objective is to win the Premier League. We have definitely got the team to do that</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United have enough quality to hurt Manchester City]</b> First of all I can’t see United losing against City, I think United will win. They are playing a fantastic team but there’s been signs in the last couple of weeks against West Ham and Huddersfield where I thought they were very fortunate. You can see in their game play that there’s opportunities for United to capitalise on that. They have some fantastic players, but who will be fit? Then there’s the big one - Paul Pogba - I think he would have made a big difference but I still think United have enough quality to win the game. It’s too early <b>[to call it a title decider]</b> but in terms of 11 points, it’ll make it harder for United to catch them.<br /><br />Any footballer would say to play under Pep would be a dream. I talk to some of the lads about Jose Mourinho in terms of preparation and his attention to detail. A lot of people seem to think he’s defensive-minded but I think he’s just doing it his way and he’s getting results</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United are hoping to keep David de Gea at the club for many years to come]</b> When he arrived at Old Trafford, he was a bit rocky at the start of his career but the improvement he has made has been unbelievable. When you look at the last couple of seasons, he has been player of the year - which is a little bit weird for a Manchester United goalkeeper. I think the position we are in the league and all the competition, I think David’s played a big role in that. Look at some of the games this season - he has kept us in games. The Sevilla game, especially, he was outstanding. In my opinion, he’s probably the best goalkeeper in the world at this moment in time and we hope that continues. He’s been absolutely brilliant, and we hope we can keep him here for many years to come.<br /><br />It’s a little bit frustrating to see us in second position <b>[sic]</b>, but City has been outstanding this season and it will be a miracle to catch them. They are going to have to lose every single game and we’re going to have to win every single game, but the signs are there for next season and there’s still a lot to play for this season. The way we’re playing looks very difficult to beat in any competition, so I hope next season we’ll go that extra step further and win the league. I am sure there will be changes in the summer. The manager will want to strengthen the team and that’s part of being a Manchester United player. You want to improve, you want to have competition and I am sure the manager will strengthen his team and try to win the league next year</p>

  <p><b>[Quinton Fortune has returned to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> as part of a coaching re-structure of the club’s Under-23 side]</b> I am delighted to return to the club in this new role. As a former player, I know exactly what it takes and also what it means to play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. I have a great relationship with Ole, whom I also worked with at Cardiff when I was assistant manager of their Under-21s, and I look forward to working with him again alongside Nicky and Neil. We will all work together in order to achieve the ultimate aim of producing players capable of performing in <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s first team</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player Quinton Fortune has set his sights on one day becoming manager at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>]</b> I thought about that question yesterday for some reason and my first thought was to become the manager of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. That’s my dream. Of course, I’m starting now with the Under-23s and I’m learning a lot and I want to learn as much as possible because management changes so much in the game today. Look, I <b>[may]</b> have to go out and learn somewhere else and become a manager. But the dream, the ultimate dream, is to come back and be the manager of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. From what I’ve been through, I’m going for the highest level<br /><br /><b>[Critics pointing out just four of England’s 92 clubs are managed by a black man, Fortune wants to be given a role because of his qualities and not because of his race]</b> I want to be given the job because of my ability. I want to always be judged because of my character and what I can bring to the team, not because of the colour of my skin. When you look at the game, you see a lot of black players but why are there not many black managers? I don’t know what the reason is. I think if I go too deep into that it will block my way of thinking. I like to think I am going to work as hard as I can, get all my qualifications, prepare myself and not let that barrier stop me. And if there is a system put in place, great, but regardless of that I’m going to go and work anyway.</p>

  <p><b>[Quinton Fortune says <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a> is the real deal]</b> This is how amazing Mason is and why he’s a little bit different. I’m walking through the building at the Aon Training Complex and there’s a computer room where the analyst team work. Mason was in there, looking at games and how he can do better. He’s on it. He’s just a natural. He’s an unbelievable finisher. He’s the real deal.<br /><br /><b>[Fortune added on <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> being the ideal man to help <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a> reach his full potential]</b> Mason is fortunate he’s got Ole as a manager. Obviously there’s all the coaches he’s had through his youth-team career but he couldn’t ask for a better manager because Ole’s done it at the highest level.<br /><br />There’s not many players in world football that are able to go both ways like Mason does. Equally, left and right foot, he’s ridiculous. I thought he was left-footed and then he takes penalties with his right! And I’ve seen him take a free kick with his right foot, his left foot. I’m like ‘what’s wrong with you!? Just pick one! Are you okay?’ I’m waiting for him to have a burst of speed but he’s so good around the box. Stepover, boom! He’s just created that one little yard for him and boom! As a defender, which way do you show Mason? He can go right, he can go left. I don’t even know, the guy’s got everything.</p>

  <p><b>[Quinton Fortune: Team-mate’s racist abuse was ‘lowest point of my life’]</b> I’ve never spoken about this much but the lowest point in my life was in Spain. Not just as a football player, but as a human being. I was signed with <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> and they loaned me out to Mallorca. My own team-mate racially abused me in training. I didn’t know what to do. I was 17 or 18, I didn’t know who to turn to, I didn’t speak the language, and of top of that the manager didn’t communicate with me. I had no support. I was just told to sit on the side of the pitch. I never prayed so much in all my life just to get away from that club. I’m sure many players went through worse experiences but that for me was the lowest point because I had no mum or dad or brothers or anyone to turn to. This guy is a senior player in the team and he was saying all these things to me. Luckily for me, I got out of there. When I went back to Madrid, I was so happy, just to get out of that environment. I made some very good friends in Madrid and carried on with my football. I’m sure many players went through more difficult (experiences) but you need support. It needs changing. It needs education<br /><br />All the clubs, I take my hat off, the way they’ve approached this and the support they have given. But when you talk about change <b>[…]</b> Around 34 per cent of players in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> are black, maybe more, but when we look at coaches right around <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and Football League, six per cent are black coaches. I’m all for the <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> Rule. It’s a great step forward in terms of giving BAME coaches the opportunity to have an interview. That’s progress. Any club can have diversity, inclusion, but you need to have a target. For the next 18 months, I want to see four or five black coaches in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.<br /><br />But not just in coaching, board members as well. You need to put them in a position where they can learn. It will be brilliant for the game because different minds, different ways of looking at things. It will inspire people from BAME backgrounds to see someone they can identify with.<br /><br />When I saw Nelson Mandela become president after 27 years in prison, I felt anything was possible. When I came over to this country in 1991, my former team-mate at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, Neale Fenn, gave me a book about <a href="pele.html">Pele</a>. He won the World Cup aged 17 and when I read his story, he came from same background as me. It is important to have diversity and I would encourage every club to do it, but the next step is keeping those black and Asian players there for a long period of time. Put them in positions of leadership and then see what happens. That’s real change. <a href="les-ferdinand.html">Les Ferdinand</a>, look at what he is doing as director of sport at QPR. I think <a href="chris-hughton.html">Chris Hughton</a> was the last black manager in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. You need more. It is not possible to have 34 per cent of players being black and no black coaches. You need real change<br /><br /><b>[Fortune hails <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>’s selflessness]</b> What Marcus has done is beyond his years. It’s unbelievable. When you’re playing, you’re so focused on just doing your job. Of course, you think about your family but you’re so focused on making sure you prepare well and do well for the team, for the boss. For Marcus to take a moment and do what he did <b>[…]</b> I saw the letter he wrote on social media. This sums up <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. When Brian McClair left, he told me, and I always remember, the very core of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is humility. What Marcus showed is humility of the highest level. He didn’t think about himself or his family; he thought about every kid around the country. That selflessness sums up <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> as a club</p>
