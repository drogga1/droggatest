  <p><b>[Andreas Brehme Hopeful Of A <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> Win Against Inter In Champions League Final]</b> It’s a special match for me personally. I had my best spell as a player with Inter, but I’m supporting Bayern. As I’m German, my loyalties are 51 percent Bayern and 49 percent Inter. My time at Inter was terrific. Italian football was head and shoulders above the rest in Europe at the time, and I was proud to be playing there. The stadiums were always packed, every game was a sell-out and the atmosphere was unique. It was a magnificent time. I’d happily do it all over again. The supporters and the media were very good to us. Their backing was tremendous, especially in the first season when we won the league.</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich Have A Chance Of Taking Something From Inter]</b> Inter haven’t pushed on as a team since the final. It’s obviously difficult when you’ve won every trophy you contested in a given season, and I would say the same for Bayern. Bayern are in confident mood after two convincing wins in the league. They’ll need to be aggressive, because they have a chance of taking something from the game in Milan. Inter will have to attack, and that should suit Bayern, although Munich will have to watch themselves in defence, where they’ve wobbled a lot recently. Every Inter player is capable of scoring, and that’s dangerous for Bayern. You could argue that’s also the case for Bayern, although their star performers right now are <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a>, <a href="franck-ribery.html">Franck Ribery</a> and <a href="mario-gomez.html">Mario Gomez</a>. At the end of the day, I’m German, so I’m 51 per cent for Bayern and 49 per cent for Inter. My bet is a 1-1 draw, although I don’t think either of them will go on and win the competition. Other teams will make the running this season</p>

  <p><b>[Brehme feels that <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is a phenomenon and is particularly impressed with his intelligence on the pitch]</b> I would not have been able to stop him.

He was too much for <b>[Nemanja]</b> <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Vidic</a> and <b>[Rio]</b> Ferdinand. He is better than <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> in my opinion. He is 23 <b>[sic]</b> and has already won everything. He has much more brains.

  <p><b>[Andreas Brehme says <a href="julian-draxler.html">Julian Draxler</a> has experienced a beautiful mess at Paris Saint-Germain]</b> It makes sense to talk about a beautiful mess. Julian is a talented player, but he has never really exploited his potential. He lacks character to meet expectations at the highest level. In Paris, there was the opportunity this season for him to seize his chance and prove his worth during the long periods of unavailability of <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> and <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Edinson Cavani</a>, but he was too disappointing, especially in the big matches in the Champions League. He could do a lot better<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on where <a href="julian-draxler.html">Draxler</a> has disappointed the most]</b> In his finishing<br /><br />Whether in the league or Champions League, he has had many opportunities to score, but lacks composure in the final moment and I feel that has complicated things. He lacks certain simplicity in his game<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he should stay at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, Brehme said of Draxler’s future]</b> To do what? He cannot win because of formidable competition and if he is still ambitious, it is better to leave. He should try to revive his career at a club in England or Italy, like Inter or Roma for example. In any case, I do not see him coming back to Germany</p>
