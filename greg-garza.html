  <p><b>[Longtime friends, USMNT hopefuls Greg Garza and Jorge Villafana set to face off in MLS Cup]</b> I don’t call him Jorge, I call him ‘Sueno’, because that’s what I always knew him as from when I was 16 years old and he started coming into national team camps. He wasn’t a left back then, and neither was I. It’s kind of funny to see how we both ended up at the left back position as a pro and, for the both of us, I’m a good friend of his and he’s a good friend of mine.<br /><br />It’s crazy how much time has passed. It’s been 15 years, and we’re still in touch with most of those guys, and we’re all very proud of that</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United hopes to send off humble, direct Martino with MLS Cup win]</b> I think the thing that probably stuck out to me the most is just how humble and how honest he is. Off the field, he’s a guy you can probably talk to about the game or talk about anything with and he’ll give you a straight answer - and tell you what he’s feeling or what he thinks about you on the dot. There’s nothing he hides. He’s the kind of person that can sit in the middle seat on the plane on travel days, and he doesn’t complain about it. He doesn’t want to make himself feel a bit more special than any of us. He’s a part of this group, a part of this team and we can leave him a good legacy on Saturday.</p>

  <p><b>[MLS Cup title a fitting end for Tata Martino’s Atlanta United journey]</b> He’s left his legacy here in Atlanta, and moves on to a new project, I’m guessing that’s Mexico. The main thing for me was the humbleness and the honesty of the person that he is off the field. He’s a great coach on the field, but I think the person he is off the field is really what leaves his legacy for all of us.</p>

  <p><b>[Record-breaker. MVP. Golden Boot winner. Josef Martinez sure earned a lot of accolades in 2018]</b> From the first practice when I got to Atlanta from January camp, we were just doing crossing and finishing. I just thought, ‘Jesus this guy’s a killer’. I think, in my personal opinion, he should have been MVP last year as well. He played half the games he did this year. He’s an amazing player.</p>
