<blockquote>
  <p>[Criticisms levelled at Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy over the club’s lack of transfer acquisitions is grossly unfair] Daniel works closely with the managers and always has done. We are no different to other clubs in not necessarily being able to acquire who might be top of your list for whatever reason. There are so many other moving parts in that whole scenario. Sometimes there’s a degree of frustration at how much is written [about him] that isn’t accurate. But what you get with him is he is so focused on delivering for this club – and that’s why any of us who work around him think it’s grossly unfair. If he was a chairman who came out and spoke every time there was an assertion that we weren’t comfortable with, you guys would stop listening after a while. When he does speak he does it because he’s got something to say rather than just responding. He is so modest, shy and understated and it’s never about him.<br /><br />[Asked about Pochettino’s opinion on the lack of incoming players] Mauricio is very relaxed. I also think there was a misinterpretation of his comments [at the end of last season]. He will say that what he said was not about going out and spending money</p>
