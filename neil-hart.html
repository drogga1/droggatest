  <p><b>[Burnley CEO slams ‘disgusting’ White Lives Matter banner after <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> match]</b> I was disgusted to sit in the directors’ box of the Etihad and see that plane fly over the stadium. It’s not good, we stand in solidarity with our players, with our stakeholders, our management team, with our community and our town, and we will continue to be very strong in our words against any form of discrimination. I think disgusted is the word I would use<br /><br />We are working very closely with the authorities, we believe we know who is responsible, a police investigation has been launched and we will be issuing lifetime bans to those individuals, 100 per cent<br /><br />The battle is not won by banners, whether they are positive or negative, while what the players are doing with the logos and Black Lives Matter on the back of their shirts goes a long way it is not won by that, it is won by action, it is won by doing work with those communities and working with those individuals, and it is won by action and communication<br /><br />I still see that as an opportunity and we will continue to develop and evolve our work in that space, and I will make it one of my top priorities over the coming months and years to continue this fight</p>
