  <p><b>[Anthony Joshua’s promoter can’t see <a href="michael-owen.html">Owen</a> &amp; <a href="alan-shearer.html">Shearer</a> in a ring. When asked if other celebrities want to get involved in his business]</b> Yeah, loads. But more like people like <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a>. I’ve got a podcast, he was on there recently, he loves it. He’s been boxing in amateur clubs. Wayne would love to do a charity fight. All these guys, they love boxing<br /><br /><b>[While hinting that <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> could step through the ropes at some stage in the future, Hearn is not expecting <a href="alan-shearer.html">Shearer</a> and <a href="michael-owen.html">Owen</a> – who have become embroiled in a war of words on social media – to trade physical blows]</b> The sad thing is, from a numbers game, and I’m obviously not going to do this fight, but can you imagine how big <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a> vs <a href="michael-owen.html">Michael Owen</a> would be? Unfortunately there’s a little bit of a mismatch in size. But I was watching that unfold on Twitter and I couldn’t believe my eyes. I was glued to it … The only way I’d do a fight like that is if there was a huge amount of money for charity. I said that to <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> before, he was joking about fighting <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a> before when Rio was getting into his boxing. That’s an opportunity, a Sport Relief event or something like that, to make big money for charity</p>
