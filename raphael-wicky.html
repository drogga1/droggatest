  <p><b>[Who is Dimitri Oberlin? The on-loan Basel forward who rejected Man Utd]</b> I don’t think <b>[he is frustrating]</b>. Because no matter how Dimi plays, always and everywhere in the box he offers me one thing: a high degree of intensity. Players like Oberlin don’t always know themselves what will happen next. They act instinctively. That makes them unpredictable, this sometimes causes nerves, but above all it is a strength. Dimitri will become calmer and clearer as he grows with experience.</p>

  <p><b>[Raphael Wicky hired as U.S. Under-17 national team coach]</b> It’s an exciting moment to join U.S. Soccer. As a coach, it excites me to be a part of the process and working to help players grow. I’ve been following U.S. Soccer for more than 10 years now, and with the growth of the sport in the United States, I’m really excited to come in and help develop the program</p>

  <p><b>[Busio and Reyna headline USMNT U-17 squad for World Cup qualifying]</b> I’m very excited about the team we’ve put together for this World Cup qualifying tournament. There’s a lot of very good quality in this group. We brought together a strong roster for the mini-camp earlier this month, and now we’ve added a few more pieces with a lot of good characteristics. The players have brought a great mentality and we’re excited and ready for a number of interesting games ahead.</p>

  <p><b>[Raphael Wicky only took charge in March]</b> We knew we weren’t going to come in here and change everything, because I don’t have that much time to train with them. The new things we want to bring in are pretty basic concepts or basic principles. So far, I’m very happy with what I’ve seen.<br /><br /><b>[On Gianluca Busio]</b> So far, I know his personality, he needs to be part of a team. He alone, even if he has regular minutes, he’s not going to make a team alone. It’s about the team, and he’s aware of that. I’m very happy to have him here<br /><br /><b>[On Giovanni Reyna]</b> I think a player like him needs to be involved as much as possible in the game. He makes the other players look better, he makes things easier for the other guys, so I would like to have him as much as possible in the center of the field. I don’t think the position where he plays when we have the ball is important. It’s more that he knows I want him in the center. So, he can start from the wing and come inside. He can be as a nine and drop down a little bit. He can start as a center midfielder, as an eight or a 10. So, there is a lot of different variations of him. I want to put him into positions where he touches the ball a lot. He has the potential, the quality to create chances<br /><br /><b>[On Joe Scally]</b> He’s very important for this team, has been in the recent games. His personality, his fighting spirit, his mentality to work for the team is really, really good and I’m really happy to have him</p>

  <p><b>[Former Switzerland international and current U.S. Under-17s boss Raphael Wicky on <a href="giovanni-reyna.html">Gio Reyna</a>’s potential]</b> He has the whole package when you talk about the offensive part of his game. That makes him a very interesting prospect because he can change a game. Those players are the ones everyone is looking for and those players are guys who bring people to stadiums, right? The Pulisics, the <b>[Xherdan]</b> Shaqiris, these guys. He has that talent to do that, but if we talk about his offensive game, but there’s still a long way to go.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was that his technique is outstanding, which is always the base that makes everything look easy. He’s very elegant</p>
