  <p><b>[Despite long periods of inactivity in Serie A, Chivas expects Fiorentina to purchase defender Carlos Salcedo when his loan deal expires]</b> My point of view is that for the player he is with the price what it is, they’re going to buy him. What happened with him on the bench has to do with another situation that wasn’t about his performance. We let him go to Italy at a price where we were asking almost three times that. Salcedo’s value was three times what Fiorentina is paying. We could’ve said, ‘No, he has a contract,’ but we have a different way of looking at life and it’s very laudable that a player wants to play in certain teams.</p>

  <p><b>[Chivas center back Oswaldo Alanis is training with the club’s second team in Guadalajara because of a contract dispute]</b> We respect Oswaldo Alanisa lot, like all other players. He decided not to renew with us. He asked for something that wasn’t the right time for him. We didn’t negotiate with the players we don’t have <b>[need to]</b> contract negotiations with.<br /><br />With the contract we had, we gave Oswaldo the ability to look for another team. We made him transferable, practically would loan him if he would have stayed active. The only thing we asked is that if he were to go on loan, he had to extend his contract for protection<br /><br />We’re evaluating it, but you can’t just look at the immediate situation. We don’t think that’s the way to do things</p>

  <p><b>[Higuera tweeted in response to a fan pleading for continuity rather than a quick firing]</b> We’re all in the same boat. There’s no reason to bid farewell to <b>[Cardozo]</b>. He’s working really hard. I’m confident in him and in all the squad. We’re working to get back to the formula that gave us success. Remember that signings were 100 percent my responsibility since three years ago.</p>
