  <p><b>[Manchester United defender Daley Blind feels that his father Danny does not deserve to be sacked as Netherlands coach if the Dutch fail to qualify for Euro 2016]</b> It is a difficult question, but I think the coach should stay on after Euro 2016, even if we fail to qualify. I always support the national team coach. I did so when Louis van Gaal was in charge, I did so when Guus Hiddink was the coach and I do the same with my father. Let’s not forget that he started the job at a rather complicated moment. I knew that he would be criticised when he became national team coach. I know how things work in the world of football and with the press. I don’t let those kinds of things distract me, though, and neither does my father.</p>

  <p><b>[Daley Blind is also of the opinion that his father, Danny Blind, should be allowed to continue in his role]</b> I support the coach and I think the whole group does too. Today was one big disappointment, but we are fully behind the coach. Of course this is a huge disappointment and obviously I am thinking of my father</p>

  <p><b>[Daley Blind has predicted that Manchester United will be in the top four by the end of the season]</b> It will be close and we’ll need to focus and win our games but I’m sure we’ll be in the top four by the end of season.<br /><br />You want to play games as players. We’ve still got a lot to fight for, including a final, so we’re all looking forward to it. It’s always nice to get clean sheets and for defenders to have that confidence. We have so many players with pace and creative players. I’m happy to play on the same team as these kinds of players<br /><br /><b>[Victory over the Hornets at Old Trafford was secured courtesy of goals from Juan Mata and Anthony Martial]</b> You want to finish the chances. The second goal was good for Anthony and well deserved. We deserved to win and created many chances. We could have finished more of the chances; everyone wanted the ball. The second half was more difficult as they changed their system a bit but, overall, it was a good win</p>

  <p><b>[Daley Blind eager for return of ‘very smart’ Mkhitaryan]</b> Micki <b>[Mkhitaryan]</b>’s a very smart player. You can always reach him - he always makes good runs. It’s a pleasure to play with him. I’m very happy Micki is back; he’s a great player with a lot of qualities, so of course we’re happy that he’s back on the pitch again with us<br /><br />We’re here to win. We want to get a good result, but we know in our minds it’s over two games, so we have to be smart and adapt in the game if that’s needed. We know there is always a second leg at home at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> - we are aware of that but the first thing is we want to win here and score a goal. That’s how we look at it</p>

  <p><b>[Daley Blind believes rotation will make Manchester United stronger and stronger]</b> Zlatan is of course a very important player for us. Other players have to stand up, that’s how it is. I think you make players better as well if there’s more competition in the group. So if there’s rotation at this level it only makes the team stronger and stronger. I think that’s why we can cope with every game</p>

  <p><b>[Daley Blind admits Manchester United’s Europa League clash with Rostov was an ugly game]</b> It’s a good job we scored an away goal but, of course, we wanted to finish the game 1-0. They came back to 1-1 and then you can do two things: you can attack or you can be a bit smarter and know there’s a second leg. We chose the second option. The game was unplayable <b>[because of the conditions]</b>. It was very bad, we couldn’t play any balls to each other. I think it was an ugly game to watch.<br /><br />We have to finish it at home now - we have the away goal and we have the advantage. We have to make sure we do that. I wanted a win for my birthday but an away goal will do! It was a great finish from Micki. It was a good goal - good from Felli, good from Zlatan and Micki was there to finish. We have to move on and for the next game we’re in a good position. We didn’t underestimate them and we know what they’re capable of in the home game. I’m sure we’ll play on a better pitch, in better conditions, with all the crowd behind us. We have to finish it at home.</p>

It was a very good performance from the team too, I think. I played there a lot of times last season and I feel confident in the position; I feel good and I feel comfortable. I’m happy to play there again and of course everybody knows me - I play where the manager needs me, and I just want to play like anybody else. I’m just happy for the team that we put in a good performance here today.<br /><br />Yes, we have a big squad. Everybody is ready and we need everyone. You can see that and we have to realise that as well, that you have to be ready when you’re needed. That’s why we can still fight for what we want</p>

  <p><b>[Daley Blind ignoring <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> exit talk despite threat of summer arrivals]</b> I hear that the club’s high-ups are satisfied with me, and they just want me to keep on working. There are lots of transfer rumours surrounding United. Five or six players in my position are linked to the club every week, and given my contract situation it’s logical people have written about me leaving.<br /><br /><a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> gave me over 30 matches in his first year in charge, which not everyone had expected. He stated his faith in me, and I have done my best to reward him. I have a great relationship with him. He always involves me with the first team, even though he picks other players. That can happen at this level - this is <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, and there is lots of competition for places. It’s down to me to keep working hard, get as many minutes as possible and show what I can do<br /><br />This is my fourth season with United, and I’ve averaged over 30 games a year in the first three. This is the first time I’ve played less often, but I’ve been out injured for two months<br /><br /><b>[He may have to settle for more of a support role heading forward, but he believes <a href="manchester-united.html">the Red Devils</a> are improving as a collective]</b> We have an amazing squad at United, with talented youngsters like <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> and <a href="jesse-lingard.html">Jesse Lingard</a>, and I think <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a> is incredibly good as well.

They didn’t get many chances after the 2-2, but they scored anyway and that’s devastating. I’m extremely proud to be part of this team. We’ve shown fantastic stuff and I think the whole world enjoyed it, but it’s a bit too early for us to think like that. Anyway, we have to go on. We have to win another trophy with this team.
