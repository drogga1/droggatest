  <p><b>[Daley Blind eager for return of ‘very smart’ Mkhitaryan]</b> Micki <b>[Mkhitaryan]</b>’s a very smart player. You can always reach him - he always makes good runs. It’s a pleasure to play with him. I’m very happy Micki is back; he’s a great player with a lot of qualities, so of course we’re happy that he’s back on the pitch again with us<br /><br />We’re here to win. We want to get a good result, but we know in our minds it’s over two games, so we have to be smart and adapt in the game if that’s needed. We know there is always a second leg at home at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> - we are aware of that but the first thing is we want to win here and score a goal. That’s how we look at it</p>

  <p><b>[Daley Blind ignoring <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> exit talk despite threat of summer arrivals]</b> I hear that the club’s high-ups are satisfied with me, and they just want me to keep on working. There are lots of transfer rumours surrounding United. Five or six players in my position are linked to the club every week, and given my contract situation it’s logical people have written about me leaving.<br /><br /><a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> gave me over 30 matches in his first year in charge, which not everyone had expected. He stated his faith in me, and I have done my best to reward him. I have a great relationship with him. He always involves me with the first team, even though he picks other players. That can happen at this level - this is <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, and there is lots of competition for places. It’s down to me to keep working hard, get as many minutes as possible and show what I can do<br /><br />This is my fourth season with United, and I’ve averaged over 30 games a year in the first three. This is the first time I’ve played less often, but I’ve been out injured for two months<br /><br /><b>[He may have to settle for more of a support role heading forward, but he believes <a href="manchester-united.html">the Red Devils</a> are improving as a collective]</b> We have an amazing squad at United, with talented youngsters like <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> and <a href="jesse-lingard.html">Jesse Lingard</a>, and I think <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a> is incredibly good as well. I enjoy playing alongside <a href="juan-mata.html">Juan Mata</a>, and I’ve learned a lot from <a href="michael-carrick.html">Michael Carrick</a>.

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> fan Blind hoping <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> turns things around]</b> When <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> was appointed, there was a fresh positivity. They started well, but now they dropped a bit. Hopefully they find their way to the top again, so they can qualify for the Champions League. I’m still a United fan, so I hope they’re back in business soon. Some guys send me compliments. <a href="juan-mata.html">Juan Mata</a>, <b>[Anthony]</b> Martial, and these are very nice things to hear. I still have a strong connection with these lads, like <a href="ashley-young.html">Ashley Young</a>. They’re such great guys. I had a good time there<br /><br /><b>[United’s <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> rivals <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, meanwhile, await <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> in the last four of the Champions League, with ex-Ajax stars <a href="toby-alderweireld.html">Toby Alderweireld</a>, <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a>, <a href="jan-vertonghen.html">Jan Vertonghen</a> and <a href="davinson-sanchez.html">Davinson Sanchez</a> in line to face their old club]</b> I’m looking forward to it. It’s going to be a fantastic game. I’m delighted that I’m going to meet my old team-mates. To meet each other in the semi-finals of the Champions League, who would have thought that in advance? I think every person in Amsterdam has set their mind on this game. I speak with Jan from time to time. We get along quite well, on and off the pitch. So it’s going to be so much fun to meet again on the pitch</p>

It’s wonderful to have the game in front of me and be a part of building from the back with my forward passes to start attacks<br /><br />Matthijs and I feel good about each other. I reach a high level in the Champions League matches - that feels good.<br /><br /><b>[If he and De Ligt can maintain that level for three more games, Daley could emulate father Danny, who guided the Dutch club to an incredible European triumph in 1995]</b> Maybe <b>[my father]</b> is getting a little worried right now</p>

  <p><b>[Daley Blind, who played at centre-back alongside De Ligt at Ajax this season and operated at left-back outside Van Dijk in Guimaraes in midweek, believes the whole team has a defensive job to put in against a gifted Portugal side]</b> They’re both great defenders. I think it’s comfortable next to them. Matthijs is a big talent, Virgil is showing his qualities all season long. But our defence starts with our attacks - you can see on the two goals we scored against England <b>[in extra time]</b> when we won the ball high up the pitch and to create chances</p>

  <p><b>[Blind admits to frustration over <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>’s form compared to Chelsea]</b> Of course I’m not happy to see <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> and how they’re performing at the moment. I’m still a fan of United and it’s not nice to see. Regarding <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, they are doing well, they have a good philosophy under a manager who wants to play out from the back. They play different attacking football with a lot of youngsters and that’s nice to see. From that perspective, it’s good. But if you’re talking about United then I’m not happy about that, of course<br /><br /><b>[Abraham]</b> is doing very well at the moment, he’s a big striker, scored a lot of goals. But I will take care of myself like I always do and we have to prepare as we always do - not just against the striker but also the whole team. We attack as a team and we defend as a team. I think that’s the most important thing</p>

The central defender has undergone extensive medical examination in recent days, following the dizziness that briefly bothered him during the <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> - <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> match. It was then decided to place a subcutaneous ICD on Blind, a device that is applied under the skin.
