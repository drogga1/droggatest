<blockquote>
  <p><b>[25 years after his father’s disappearance, Colombia star Quintero is still looking for answers]</b> He called us the next day and said that he had got Uraba in the Voltigeros battalion; at that time there were battles between the guerrillas and the Army. He said they would be taken there in a plane. We were waiting for him to call again, because he always got in touch with us, wherever he was. As he was also a footballer, he would always call us from wherever he found himself<br /><br />I have the right as a son to know what happened to my father and that is what I want to know, because I have suffered and seen my family suffer mental and sociological problems and the absence of my father. There is an empty space there and I feel it every day, I just want to know what happened</p>
