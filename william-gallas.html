  <p><b>[Gallas reveals Redknapp inspiration behind Spurs’ famous defeat of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> didn’t give particularly war-like speeches, it was business as usual. <a href="harry-redknapp.html">Harry Redknapp</a> used it. The year of the famous 3-2 win for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> at the Emirates, when the club hadn’t beaten one of the ‘big four’ away since 1993, everyone talked about my story with <a href="samir-nasri.html">Samir Nasri</a> and that I wasn’t going to shake his hand. It was talked about every day, but I stayed in my bubble. In the dressing-room before the game, Redknapp came to see me. ‘What’s the story with <a href="samir-nasri.html">Nasri</a>?’ I explained it to him, and he said to me: ‘You know what? You’ll be captain.’ He did it deliberately to increase motivation. It worked<br /><br />It’s good that you’ve asked me that question, since you’ll be able to make things right. We found a picture on the internet that gives the impression of a fight. But that’s not what happened. <a href="nicklas-bendtner.html">Bendtner</a> fought with <a href="emmanuel-adebayor.html">Adebayor</a>, and I separated them!<br /><br />Pointing to his face, <a href="nicklas-bendtner.html">Bendtner</a> told me: ‘Did you see what he did to me?’. And I answered that it was something you don’t resolve on the pitch. So, really, I had nothing to do with it.<br /><br />In my first match I was whistled. I expected it a little bit. When I played at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in my first match with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in 2006, when I’d moved from one club to the other, it was fine.

  <p><b>[Former Arsenal defender William Gallas believes that the time could be right for the club to replace Arsene Wenger]</b> Maybe it is time to change something at the end of the season. We can’t forget what he did for the club. He did a very, very good job so sometimes you can’t sack the manager like this. You have to respect the manager. That is why I said at the end of the season maybe the board has to speak with Arsene and try to find a solution.<br /><br />You get criticism when you don’t win trophies, when you don’t win games, and that is maybe the difference between Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger. Mourinho wants to win every game and at the end of the season sometimes he has success but, for Arsene, Arsenal didn’t win from 2004 so everybody starts to criticise him because football has changed. Football is about victory, about trophies. Players want to lift trophies. If you don’t lift a trophy in your career, you will feel disappointed at the end of your career. I don’t know what Arsenal are going to do but they have to win trophies again</p>

  <p><b>[William Gallas explains the differences in style between Mourinho and Wenger]</b> Both managers want to win trophies but with Jose he will show you every day at training <b>[what needs to be done]</b>. If you are not 100 per cent he will stop the training and say to you ‘what’s wrong with you? Why don’t you train? If you don’t want to train just go outside and run, because what I want and what I expect from you is to give me everything<br /><br />And with Arsene it’s a little bit different. You have to be more responsible to manage yourself so he won’t be behind you all the time and that makes a difference. So for me it was very good to be with one manager who was always behind me.</p>

They are top of the league and maybe they will win the league. They have won the Premier League four times already so if you have to compare Tottenham and Arsenal, I think Chelsea are the top team in London because they have won as well the Champions League.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Chelsea defender William Gallas believes that Olivier Giroud is ready to lead the line regularly for the Blues]</b> He can be <b>[Morata’s replacement]</b>. He has shown in the past that he can do it with Arsenal. He was struggling a little bit at Arsenal when he was on the bench. But when Arsene Wenger put him on the pitch, he showed everybody he can do the job. With Chelsea I think he will do the same thing. Everyone knows at Chelsea that the first choice will be Alvaro Morata but you have to play well to keep your position to be the first choice. If you don’t play well, you know behind you, you have a striker <b>[Giroud]</b>. If he has his chance to play, maybe he will take it. That’s why I like it. That lifts the level of the training and that then lifts the performance of the players. You need to have competition between the players because you have to play in many competitions. You have to play in the Champions League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup and Premier League. We know it is very difficult for the players to play all the games. Some players can be tired. Some players can be injured. The players who don’t start, they will have their opportunity to play but he has to be ready when his manager needs him. I don’t just look at it as the competition between the two strikers. The best will play, for sure, but when you are at the training ground, you are friends and colleagues. You are not there to fight against each other because you do the same job. What both players want is to see their team win every game or lift some trophies<br /><br />Because he had his family, it was very important for him to stay in London. I understand exactly why he decided to move to Chelsea. I know some fans are not happy because he is going to the west London club and it is a rival. I did the same move but in a different way from Chelsea to Arsenal. It can be difficult for the fans to understand but at the end of the day, what is most important? The most important when you play for one club is to give 100 per cent when you wear that shirt - it can be the blue one or the red one. When you are on the pitch, you are fighting for that club, that’s what I did. I am sure Giroud will do the same thing. I didn’t know him as a man but I used to know him as a player. I used to play against him. Maybe I played against him two times. He is a very strong striker and it is difficult to get the ball from him<br /><br />I realised that he is very passionate. It is normal for him to go to another club to see if he can play more and to see if he can be involved in the World Cup. As a man I say he is a very humble guy and very polite. He is a guy who you can have a good conversation with. He is a guy who knows what he wants to do. He is a family guy, he has his wife and children. He tries to do everything for them and his family as well</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea will go into the biggest game of their season with record signing Alvaro Morata out of form, out of the team and suffering a crisis of confidence]</b> A player like Morata likes to feel his defender <b>[when he has his back to goal]</b>. But, when he doesn’t feel his defender, he doesn’t know where his defender will go or will anticipate the ball. So, the players like him, I would anticipate everything. I won’t be in contact with him all the time. Only in the box, because when you are in the box you have to be in contact with the opponent. That’s very important, but outside of the box, you don’t need to be very close. You just have to read the game and be in a good position.</p>

  <p><b>[Andreas Christensen has been advised by William Gallas that he needs to talk more on the pitch]</b> He is still young and what he does is unbelievable. He is the main central defender for Chelsea and everybody makes mistakes. The best central defenders make mistakes. So for me, I am not worried for Christensen because when you see him playing, he is not scared because of his age. He takes his responsibility. He knows how to speak to his team-mates. For the next game, you have to be sure that he won’t make the same mistake. So for me, for the future, he will be a great, great defender. For now, we need to know if he can only play in that system with three centre backs, or if he can play with four defenders, alongside one team-mate. For the moment, in that system, he looks great. I don’t know if he will look great if you play with four defenders. It shows that the academy of Chelsea is really good because now everybody knows you have to spend a lot of money to bring in players. Sometimes money doesn’t make you look great, or doesn’t allow you to play very well. He is still young and we don’t have to put pressure on his shoulders but I had the opportunity to meet him at Cobham. When I say meet him, I just mean to say hello to him, but when I said hello, I heard from the boys that he is very mature in his head. I know he will have a good career. If he listens to the more experienced players, he can be one of the best defenders. He has to improve by maybe speaking a little bit more on the pitch, to be a leader in his defensive line. That is very important in football, the communication. When I watch Chelsea, I don’t see him speaking a lot with his team-mates, maybe because he is focused on what he has to do. Some players like to do this, just to be focused on their job, but slowly, slowly he has to speak to his defensive line and midfield. That’s what John Terry used to do.<br /><br />I think they realise this season is not easy like last season, because last season they were very focused on the Premier League. They didn’t have to play in the Champions League or Europa League so it was easier for them. This season they have to qualify for the Champions League. It won’t be easy because you have got Manchester United, who are second at the moment. You have Tottenham and Liverpool who are very close <b>[to Chelsea]</b>. You need some leaders when you don’t play well, you need some players who can shout on the pitch. That’s why John Terry was such a good captain, because he was shouting when we needed him to shout and we were listening to him. Even when he was younger than the other players, he was a leader and we respected him. He was the first guy on the pitch, the first tackle. It was a good example for us. It was like when you go to war, you have to know you can go to war with this soldier. When you see the soldier on the right side who is not scared to fight, then you want to fight with him. I think in football it is good to have the quality players but when the game is a little bit more physical and difficult, then you need that soldier. That’s why it is important to get a soldier like that in your squad to shout and show you where to go</p>

  <p><b>[William Gallas says that his Chelsea side never feared Barcelona and Lionel Messi]</b> At this time we were strong. When you play for a strong team, you don’t have to speak about your opponent. We know, we knew there were really good. In the dressing room we didn’t talk about them and say ‘oh did you see Messi? He is really good’. Or ‘oh, I am a little bit worried for you because you are going to mark him, so be careful.’ No, no, because everybody knew what he had to do. At this time I was marking him and my team-mates knew I could do the job. I had all the information I needed from my manager <b>[Jose Mourinho]</b> and then I was focused to go on the pitch and do what I had to do. To be honest, I think I played maybe just two times against Lionel Messi, yes, he didn’t score but the first time he got injured after just 15 minutes in the Camp Nou.<br /><br />For me, it was very important for me to compete against Messi, to know if I was a good defender. At this time Messi was still young but everyone was talking about Lionel Messi. I had seen some video of him and I thought, ‘oh my god, I am going to mark him’. So I tried to find the best solution to mark him. That’s why for the first 15 minutes I was very close to him because I knew I had the space to compete with him. What I knew as well was if I left him to get the ball and to run at me, I would have been in trouble. That’s why the whole time I was very close to him. Unfortunately, he was injured after 15 minutes and I wanted to know that I could do it for 90 minutes. I played against him again with Arsenal but he was not playing in my area, so that’s why I didn’t have the opportunity to mark him. When I played for Chelsea, he was a right winger and I was a left back. When I played for Arsenal, I was a centre back and he was right winger. That’s why I didn’t have an opportunity to mark him. As a defender, when you play against players like him, you want to compete. You want to know if you are good enough to stop that kind of player. They can be Messi, Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo or Neymar.<br /><br /><b>[Chelsea now need a win or a high scoring draw to progress]</b> It is a shame they conceded that goal because at the beginning of the game, it wasn’t easy for Chelsea. Barcelona was playing very well. Around 20 minutes in, Chelsea started to show some character, that’s why they hit the post twice in the first half with Willian. They started to press Barcelona very high. In this competition, a small mistake, especially against a team like Barcelona will cost you a goal. A draw isn’t too bad but when you play in the Camp Nou, it will be completely different because the pitch is a little bit bigger and you have to have the best system to play against Barcelona.<br /><br />I hope for Chelsea that they qualify for the next round but it looks like it will be a little bit difficult for them. Everybody wants to know which system, which tactics that the manager will take, if he has to defend or press Barcelona very high. To be honest, I have got my opinion but I am not the manager. I didn’t pass all my exams to be manager so that’s why I can’t give any advice to Antonio Conte. Because what he did with Chelsea, he did a great job. He did it with Juventus, I am sure he will find the best solution to block Barcelona. I played so many times against Barcelona. For me, it looks like a team who doesn’t like to feel the pressing. If you press them all the time. I think Barcelona will struggle</p>

  <p><b>[Tiemoue Bakayoko has come in for criticism this season after struggling to adapt to Chelsea after his £40 million move from Monaco]</b> I would tell him to just ignore what people have said. Maybe they are right so maybe you have to work more, but don’t let people put you down because you play football. That was your dream to play football and you made a lot of sacrifices to be where you are. Don’t let people put you down and take the criticism in a positive way. Try to finish the season well and be ready for next year. You can prove people wrong because if you start to play well next season everyone will say: ‘Oh yeah, Bakayoko is the best midfielder we have.’ Everyone knows how it works so just ignore what people say to you. I was in the same situation, I will give you my best example. When I moved from Arsenal to Tottenham in my first game, my fans were booing me. I said ‘Oh my God!’ First game boos, second game boos. I said: ‘Okay, I decided to play for Spurs for many reasons and no one knows exactly why you went to Tottenham, so you have to show you are working hard and prove them wrong.’ Slowly, slowly, they started to clap me. That’s football. That’s why we love football. I know now football is really, really impatient. People want results straight away, but what we have to understand is that he arrived from Monaco. The English language is not his first language so you have to adapt.<br /><br />He has to adapt as well to Premier League football, you have to give him time. That’s why it is really difficult to speak before, I like to give time to the players and the manager. For me, if I have to judge him, I will do it next season. For me, this season is about adaptation. Everything changed for him. Football, language, maybe the family, maybe it is difficult for him to find an apartment or a house and to feel good. I will judge him next season</p>

I thank him everything for and wish him the best for his future.<br /><br />When he made me captain of Arsenal, I was very thankful.

I was privileged and I tried my best<br /><br /><b>[Wenger’s final seasons at Arsenal have been characterised by supporter unrest in some quarters]</b> I think everybody is very sad for this decision.

  <p><b>[William Gallas thinks that Didier Deschamps made the right call in not selecting Anthony Martial for the World Cup]</b> I feel sorry for Lacazette because for his first season in England, he did well. Fifteen goals with an injury! He came back and did well. Maybe it is a little bit difficult for him to accept that he’s not one of the 23 players. Martial? I don’t feel sorry for him because he had the opportunity. He was in the squad many times before. I think he missed his chance go to the World Cup. He didn’t perform at his best for the whole season. To go to the World Cup, you have to perform all season. You can’t be up and down, that’s what has made the difference. He is still young and maybe he will learn. He has great quality and it is a shame for him.<br /><br />As a French guy, I hope they win the World Cup. It will be very difficult as there are some very strong teams. Spain, Brazil, Germany… it will be very interesting to see if France can get to the final. In France, everybody expects them to get to the semi-final so I hope they will do something. We have got some good, young players. They may be young but they are very talented and they can make the difference. The only problem is that if we play against a strong team, we could be in trouble because we will need to be stronger. We need players who shout on the pitch when you’re not playing well. At the moment we don’t have that type of player. I hope that before the World Cup, the manager will speak with his players and say what they have to do. Everyone wants to see one leader, but no one wants to be that leader. To be a leader, you have to think about your performance and the performance of your team-mates. You have to talk to them and it is not easy. I know because I became a leader when I was 28 years old. When you ask a player who is only 25, it is really difficult. It might not be natural</p>

  <p><b>[William Gallas believes that France are major contenders to win the 2018 World Cup]</b> I will go for Brazil because they look like they are really strong. You still have teams like Spain, Germany, France and I am sorry, I don’t say England because it is always the same problem with England. They are not strong. They are not strong enough in the head. That’s always a problem for them. I remember when we used to play against them and even in the European Championships in 2004, they had a strong, strong squad and they were leading 1-0, three minutes before the end of the game. But then we won 2-1, when I looked at that squad I thought ‘my God’. Rio Ferdinand, John Terry, Ledley King, Steven Gerrard, for me they were unbelievable, but they didn’t qualify I think for the quarter or semi-final. In the World Cup it was the same thing. This England have the same problem, they are not strong enough. Maybe <b>[the shirt is too heavy]</b>. Maybe they are also too young. They don’t have a lot of experience. I don’t know why it is so difficult for them to play in the national team. Maybe there is something wrong. I don’t know if there’s something wrong with the players, I would say maybe yes. But they also have to have the right manager.<br /><br />I want to know if France can win that World Cup. We have a good opportunity because we have got some great players, some talented players. It is a young squad. We are not afraid of any team, we know we can compete against anyone but when you play a World Cup, it is a different story. You have a lot of pressure on your shoulders. You are going to realise that you are playing in a World Cup, you can be very emotional and that’s why the players have to understand the World Cup is a completely different competition. I am sure the France squad can do the right job, the manager is good and he knows how to speak to his players. The players are very clever and intelligent to know what they have to do. That’s what’s very good about that group, you need to have a good relationship with your manager. The manager knows the World Cup very well because he won it in 1998. He used to be a player, he knows how the players can react so that’s why communication is very, very important. From when he was manager of the national team, he has had good results. The players like him because he understands them. We have got so many talented players. I wouldn’t want to be in the position of the French national manager because I don’t know how he can make that selection. If you look, at the back it is maybe a little bit easier to select players but in terms of midfielders and strikers, to be honest I wouldn’t want to be in his position. All of them are good, we have got so many good wingers and strikers. You don’t know which ones you would have to choose.<br /><br />Yes, but Belgium, they let me down for the last competition. Euro 2016, they let me down. They had the same squad, maybe they didn’t have the experience that they had now. They let me down because everyone said Belgium has a great chance to win the Euros and it didn’t happen. Maybe for this World Cup, they will go to the final, because they have got great players. When you look at the players, all of them play in big clubs. They are unbelievable. When you don’t have experience in the big competitions, then sometimes you can have pressure. In 2006, we went to the final because we had some experienced players. Zidane was there, Vieira was there, Makelele was there, Henry was there. Barthez was there. For the younger players, it was good, because we didn’t have that pressure on our shoulders. The pressure was on the experienced players. So it was easy for us to do what we have to do, focus on our job. For example, I was playing with Lilian Thuram so I didn’t feel the pressure on my shoulders, because he was used to playing in many World Cups. For the Belgian squad, how many players have played in the World Cup? I don’t think a lot of players have played in it. That’s why I said when they have to play against the big teams, maybe it will be a little bit difficult for them</p>

  <p><b>[William Gallas claims that former Arsenal team-mate Philippe Senderos had panic attacks before matches]</b> I knew Philippe Senderos, before a match he would need to speak a lot, you could see that he was sweating, that he did not feel good. Especially against certain players. I saw him against Chelsea, against Didier Drogba, where he would genuinely panic, like he was going through his match before playing it. And unfortunately, when you saw him on the pitch, he lost his playing abilities, he didn’t play well. But against his own team-mates, he played better.</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil only plays when he wants to play]</b> Emery has tried everything he can to try and get a reaction out of Ozil but the player isn’t responding. It is a very difficult situation for Ozil and for Arsenal. Everybody knows Ozil’s quality but he isn’t consistent. He only plays when he wants to play. Ozil should be doing more with the quality he has, he has to be the best player for Arsenal every game that he plays in<br /><br />The fans are upset with Ozil and Emery knows this. He made the choice to start Ozil on the bench to try see if he would get a reaction from the player and it is now down to Ozil to make this happen. If he doesn’t perform, Arsenal may consider selling him so they can use the money from the transfer and his big wages to buy a more effective player</p>

  <p><b>[When asked if <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Ljungberg</a> is a viable long-term option]</b> I don’t think so. I think what they need is an experienced manager, especially when we talk about former players because to be a manager you need experience. Like for example <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>, what he did <b>[at Derby]</b> worked very well and now he’s the manager of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. So I think for <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Ljungberg</a> it should be the same but right now he is the manager of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and as I said it will be very difficult. You know, you’ve got so many former players that played for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> that can easily manage them. You have to give them a chance if they’re a former player. For example, <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a> can be the manager. He was a legend for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, so why not?<br /><br /><b>[<a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Ljungberg</a> has plenty of credit in the bank with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> supporters from his playing days]</b> He has received a lot of love from the fans. He is very passionate. To be a manager is not easy. For him, the manager was sacked, and even if he knows the players, when you start to be a manager you have to start to be a coach. You know your players very well and what to expect of them. You have to explain how you want your team to play so right now it is very difficult because he needs to have an impact straight away. He has pressure on his shoulders</p>

  <p><b>[William Gallas on facing former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> team-mate <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a>]</b> He had something about him, a power I’d never sensed as a team-mate, an aura I had never seen before. Facing that, you just s— yourself. He was so intimidating that it rattles you</p>
