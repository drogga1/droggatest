  <p><b>[Gallas reveals Redknapp inspiration behind Spurs’ famous defeat of Arsenal]</b> <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> didn’t give particularly war-like speeches, it was business as usual. <a href="harry-redknapp.html">Harry Redknapp</a> used it. The year of the famous 3-2 win for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> at the Emirates, when the club hadn’t beaten one of the ‘big four’ away since 1993, everyone talked about my story with <a href="samir-nasri.html">Samir Nasri</a> and that I wasn’t going to shake his hand. It was talked about every day, but I stayed in my bubble. In the dressing-room before the game, Redknapp came to see me. ‘What’s the story with <a href="samir-nasri.html">Nasri</a>?’ I explained it to him, and he said to me: ‘You know what? You’ll be captain.’ He did it deliberately to increase motivation. It worked<br /><br />It’s good that you’ve asked me that question, since you’ll be able to make things right. We found a picture on the internet that gives the impression of a fight. But that’s not what happened. <a href="nicklas-bendtner.html">Bendtner</a> fought with <a href="emmanuel-adebayor.html">Adebayor</a>, and I separated them!<br /><br />Pointing to his face, <a href="nicklas-bendtner.html">Bendtner</a> told me: ‘Did you see what he did to me?’. And I answered that it was something you don’t resolve on the pitch. So, really, I had nothing to do with it.<br /><br />In my first match I was whistled. I expected it a little bit. When I played at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in my first match with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in 2006, when I’d moved from one club to the other, it was fine. But between <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is another thing. On the pitch, you feel the hatred of the fans. It’s a real force</p>

You are the king of the world when you lift a trophy. At <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> I wanted to lift a trophy again, but it didn’t happen.

  <p><b>[William Gallas speaks about <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a>]</b> The guy is born to be one of the best players in the world. How he talks, how he manages his life is unbelievable. He’s only 18. But he looks like he’s a real, real professional player. He knows what he wants and that shocked me. To be mature at this age, I haven’t seen many players like him</p>

  <p><b>[When asked if <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Ljungberg</a> is a viable long-term option]</b> I don’t think so. I think what they need is an experienced manager, especially when we talk about former players because to be a manager you need experience. Like for example <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>, what he did <b>[at Derby]</b> worked very well and now he’s the manager of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. So I think for <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Ljungberg</a> it should be the same but right now he is the manager of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and as I said it will be very difficult. You know, you’ve got so many former players that played for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> that can easily manage them. You have to give them a chance if they’re a former player. For example, <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a> can be the manager. He was a legend for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, so why not?<br /><br /><b>[<a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Ljungberg</a> has plenty of credit in the bank with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> supporters from his playing days]</b> He has received a lot of love from the fans. He is very passionate. To be a manager is not easy. For him, the manager was sacked, and even if he knows the players, when you start to be a manager you have to start to be a coach. You know your players very well and what to expect of them. You have to explain how you want your team to play so right now it is very difficult because he needs to have an impact straight away. He has pressure on his shoulders</p>

Facing that, you just s— yourself. He was so intimidating that it rattles you</p>
