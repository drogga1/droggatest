  <p><b>[Newcastle United goalkeeper Martin Dubravka is hoping his stay at St James’ Park will be made permanent]</b> I would like to, of course. It’s a huge club with a great history, amazing fans and quality players. We will see what’s going to happen. I’m happy that we stayed in the league. Next season, for us, hopefully we can bring the same attitude and level that we played. I really hope that next season we will show that we are stronger.<br /><br /><b>[Martin Dubravka has relished the opportunity to play in the Premier League]</b> Standing with the best players in the world - I’m so proud of it. I’m so happy that I could play these games</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle United goalkeeper Martin Dubravka has called for the players to hold an in-house meeting]</b> We need to find it ourselves. We need to analyse everything, but we have to be honest with each other - we have not done that until now I think. We should have a meeting and discuss things, sometimes you have to do that. Sometimes, that can help the players.<br /><br /><b>[Newcastle lost 2-0 against Leicester City]</b> We have to react differently. No one is happy when you concede a goal, of course, but we have to change something if, and when, it happens. We lost the game against Leicester so confidence is not high right now. We have to sit down together and speak about which direction we need to go in now. We have to go in the same direction. Every player. So, I expect to see us putting in more, even when we are conceding goals<br /><br />Everybody has to know which kind of system we play. Rafa has told us many times how we should do things. Against Leicester we were a little bit confusing in a few moments but, for me, it was more important how we reacted and we did not react well. Even if you are not playing in the way you would like to play, you always have to give 100 per cent because this is Premier League, one of the best leagues in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Martin Dubravka will start having not been included in the squad for Euro]</b> It’s not just about superstars, of course, those teammates pull down teammates. If we play at least as well as against the Hungarians, we will not be afraid to create and combine. You need to concentrate on your performance and attack with your own weapons</p>

  <p><b>[Dubravka looking for strong finish after ‘up and down’ season with Newcastle]</b> The first 10 games was really tough for us, especially mentally, because if you don’t win in 10 games, it’s really hard to keep going. It was up and down. A lot of people probably expected that we would keep losing the games, but after that, probably the crucial game was against Manchester City (at the end of January). That gave us so much confidence, and after that we had the run of victories. We were very close also with the big teams and even the away teams, but we are safe, and that’s the most important thing.<br /><br />We felt that we could probably take one point. It was up and down, and we felt a draw would be fair, maybe. We didn’t put our heads down, and we were trying to be dangerous and we scored two very nice goals. To be honest, they didn’t create too many chances. They had probably one more chance in the first half, and that’s it. Then they scored from the set-pieces. We gave them a golden opportunity to score. It was not the best from our side, but we showed character and we were full of emotion. We had trained during the week and prepared to be more successful in the high duels. We definitely want to win the game (against Fulham). You can see it was a great effort (against Liverpool). The fans were incredible</p>
