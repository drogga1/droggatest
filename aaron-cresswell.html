  <p><b>[<a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> left-back Aaron Cresswell has signed a contract extension through 2023]</b> I’ve been here for six years and I’ve loved every minute of it. I want to continue that and, thankfully, to extend the stay is fantastic news for me and my family. I’m looking forward to the next few years ahead.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> defender Aaron Cresswell says <a href="west-ham-united.html">the Hammers</a> supporters were right to boo the team off the field following their defeat to <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> on Saturday]</b> It was understandable the way they reacted. There is no beating around the bush, <b>[our performance]</b> was not good enough. We have got to put it right. We are not in a panic situation, but considering the start to the season we had, it was frustrating that we have not kicked on. To be 3-0 down at home against <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> is not good enough. We are going through a tough period at the moment. We have got to stick together and get through it. We have got to get back to what we were doing at the start of the season<br /><br />We have been in worse positions than now, but we need a strong reaction. I hope the squad understand</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="declan-rice.html">Declan Rice</a> would reach another level with better players]</b> He’s close to 100 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> games already, and I’m not just saying that because he’s a <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> player and a good mate of mine, but I really do believe he’s one of the top talents in the country. I wouldn’t like to see him leave, but if he were to ever leave he would become another level with better players around him. He’s come in at centre-back over the last couple of games due to injuries we’ve had and he can play either. It’s a great option he’s got but in terms of ability-wise, he’s a fantastic player<br /><br />As a team, as I’ve mentioned before, the kind of luck against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> didn’t go our way and get the break we needed. But I’m confident we are going to stay up, for sure. It’s down to us now as players and as a team to make sure that happens. We are fully focused and fully confident that will happen</p>
