His exemplary drive, passion and dedication have always marked him out as a rare talent and all of those qualities, alongside his understanding of the game, make him a natural choice.<br /><br />Patrick’s a natural-born leader. He’s played under some of the best managers in the world and experienced different leagues and playing styles, enjoying success everywhere he has been. We believe he can bring that knowledge and experience to take New York City FC forward in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. We’re looking forward to him joining us in the coming weeks</p>

  <p><b>[Why many talented international players won’t be drafted by MLS teams]</b> The better <b>[foreign players]</b> will be taken, but to be totally honest there will be some really good players who aren’t drafted simply because they’re internationals. There are some players who could find a spot in the league, but teams aren’t ready to use an international slot on them because they’re not ready. It certainly puts all the clubs in a tricky situation, and I don’t think that’s going to go away because more and more kids are coming here from foreign countries like Spain and Germany, and they’re good.<br /><br />The college game is becoming a pathway for international players, more than before. Take the University of Virginia … UVA was not that school I remember when I watched them play this year, and seven or eight are internationals</p>

  <p><b>[Stoke City make transfer bid for New York City FC’s Jack Harrison]</b> Every league is a selling league, so why not us. It’s a statement of credibility to be honest. I know in some way we don’t want to lose our most talented players, but we’ll bring in other talented players as clubs. I think it’s really a statement of credibility for the league when you start attracting clubs from big leagues to come watch MLS games and the talent here. It should happen, it needs to happen, and I think we need to start looking at this the other way, that actually it’s good for the league that these clubs are coming here because what they’re saying is this player is talented playing in this league and he can come play in a very good league. it obviously brings money into the clubs to reinvest in other players and youth development, so I think it’s something that needs to be done. That’s just my opinion, I know other clubs have different philosophies around it. I guess the question is who’s not a selling league. Liverpool just sold a player to Barcelona. There’s no league where you don’t look at offers and think about it, and we’re becoming that league and I think that’s great.</p>

  <p><b>[US Under-17 national team star Giovanni Reyna is set to join the Borussia Dortmund youth academy]</b> I’m a dad first, and I will support whatever he wants to do. The thing about a player at 14, 15, 16 is they’re going to make their own decision. They’re going to take everything in and see. It all depends. It’s case by case. It’s certainly, for me, one that’s difficult of course, being sporting director of a club here. But he knows around him all the time I’m his dad first. I’m there to support him, to teach him. Not to tell him he’s great, but that he’s got a long way to go, he’s got to continue to work and develop good habits and to continue to guide him.</p>

He’ll remain with us for the 2020 season, but during that time he’ll be able to go over to Germany and begin adapting to those surroundings, so when he goes in January 2021, he is able to hit the ground running. He’s still 16 years old, so he has a lot of growth and development still to come. He works extremely hard, is very competitive, strives to get better and is a winner.<br /><br />This move is a culmination of work from our Academy staff and the Club to build him up from when he arrived as a 13-year-old to where he is today. I personally want to recognize the entire Academy for the work they’ve done in developing Joe. It’s extremely exciting for the Club and we’re very happy for him</p>

  <p><b>[New <a href="austin-fc.html">Austin FC</a> sporting director Claudio Reyna jumps at another chance to build a roster from scratch]</b> It’s just this challenge again; I’m really energized by it. When you look at the possibilities, and how the league’s changed from when <b>[NYCFC]</b> came in. It’s hard to compare from 2015 to 2021, when <b>[<a href="austin-fc.html">Austin FC</a>]</b> comes in. The league has completely changed in terms of the different mechanisms of bringing players in, the competition in general, the profile of players that are coming in<br /><br /><b>[While he acknowledged the challenge, he also showed enthusiasm for the chance to build a second expansion team, noting]</b> It’s exciting to put your fingerprints on something<br /><br />It’s a process that needs a lot of collaboration. We need scouts. We need to recruit players, which I think is going to be easy with a city like Austin and a club like <a href="austin-fc.html">Austin FC</a>. And then also, when they get to the club, we have to make them better players. It’s not just the scouting and the recruitment; it’s also the work that we’ll do to make those players successful<br /><br /><b>[There’s a bit of a bittersweet element for Reyna leaving. He characterized leaving NYCFC for this opportunity as a difficult decision, adding]</b> I feel really good about what we’ve done in New York, leaving behind a great academy, and a very competitive first team that is only going to be better next season<br /><br /><b>[But he also underscored the excitement of coming to Austin to begin this new project and this new phase of his career]</b> It’s a very energizing, exciting opportunity at a new club in this incredible city. That was just something that that fit for me. And, you know, I really can’t wait</p>

  <p><b>[q: Can you tell me about the new competition format and maybe what’s different than what the Development Academy offered?]</b> There’s always been a framework discussion around the youth development competition platform. It’s always an ongoing conversation with the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> teams, so it’s adjusted with the end of the Development Academy.<br /><br />At some point, and probably more importantly with what we’re going through now (with the COVID-19 pandemic), is when we can get back out there it will be a different approach because of what we’re going through. This is impacting all the thinking, probably short term. In general, there’s going to be youth soccer again, but certainly throughout the United States it’s gonna look different. What we at <a href="austin-fc.html">Austin FC</a> are going to be committed to is the continuation of what we set out to do with the addition of two teams (expanding to include U-13, U-14 and U-15 age groups) and find a highly competitive league to compete in that will include <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> teams.<br /><br /><b>[q: My understanding was there was already a conversation underway about whether to split off those <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> academies from the rest of the DA clubs. Where do you fit in that conversation between going only <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> versus letting in, I think it was close to 90 clubs at most age groups in the DA?]</b> This is an opportunity to pause again and maybe think about youth development and different stages. At the younger age groups - up until, say, 12 years old - in my view should be very local, well-organized because it can be. That’s something we’re committed to at <a href="austin-fc.html">Austin FC</a>, is to improve that landscape within the greater Austin metro area and Central Texas.<br /><br />After that, you have to start to find the right opportunities to start traveling and playing better competition. It has to scale up at the right time. Now because of the (COVID-19) situation there will probably be less travel right off the bat. International competition will not be something that I’d imagine teams will plan for the rest of this year. It’s best to be creative. You have to think outside the box<br /><br /><b>[q: That word ‘opportunity’ has been the one tossed around the most. I’ve been talking to some local people who are involved, whether it’s high school or on the youth side. What are your thoughts on how <a href="austin-fc.html">Austin FC</a> can be a leader in that?]</b> We want to be at the table with other soccer influencers in the area and think about how we could add our views, our facility as well. I think we’ll be hosting some events in our future training facility. I think that’s exciting for kids to be playing in games near the first team of the city that will be a well-supported club. There’s a lot of inspiration we can bring to it as well.<br /><br />The community has had proper coaches and soccer clubs. It’s no secret how well-loved soccer is in Austin. As a club we’re excited to link with that and make it even grow. That’s what we can do.<br /><br /><b>[q: What are maybe one or two areas of that opportunity that you see to maybe take a step back, that you’d like to see be more shifted into the focus of how we go about youth development at the highest levels?]</b> It’s a good question. There’s a lot of things that are important that we can maybe change. The amount of cost. I think we have to be very conscious of how much parents are paying for their kids in all sports, from individual training to just the travel out there. It takes away from the joy a little bit. I grew up in a different time, and I can talk to that. I spent a lot of time playing, but I also was home with my brother and my family. I feel now youth sports has become this industry where you just travel so much. On weekends, long trips. Kids of a young age getting on planes to play games. You’re just not quite sure why.<br /><br />It’s something more generational from my time growing up. It’s on steroids. It needs to calm down a little bit. That would be one thing. That would also calm down the hysteria with all the parents about trying to get their kids to college. We’re in a different world right now and hopefully that’s something that will change, is just the overall drain of cost and those resources<br /><br /><b>[q: Anything else?]</b> Kids can’t play other sports because if they do they don’t start. They’re pressured to only play one sport. That was different when I grew up. Different kids played different sports for a different age. You had the school part of it as well.<br /><br />I feel we need to land somewhere in the middle from where we left off. We’re probably gonna have to reset. We need to think about these things, because it’s going to change (because of COVID-19). I think there could be some benefits from not all this traveling and being able to stay around, and maybe find different ways to compete. Maybe it’s playing against older players and just being creative and thinking outside the box. At the same time, being optimistic that we’ll get back and be able to compete. Soccer is huge in this country. Youth soccer is big, boys and girls. It’s going to be back.<br /><br /><b>[q: Is there anything from your upbringing you’d like to see back or that is kind of outdated, or just that idea that maybe things have changed so much but maybe they’re not really all that different?]</b> You would play in the Thanksgiving Day tournament when you were 12, 13. You would go with your family, but it would be two hours away for us and we’d stay in a hotel. Now it’s just so different, having been through it as a parent. The amount of driving, boys and girls side, seeing it. With all the friends that we have that are in this world, it’s completely different. It’s actually quite straining at times. You’ve got different kids going in different directions.<br /><br />Again, that’s not what I had growing up. I had a lot of time. I also felt I was exhausted and played a lot of sports, but it was closer and it was good competition local. And then at that right age I started to travel when I was a little bit older. I didn’t practice four or five days a week. I practiced twice a week, but then I would play with my brother. I would play in pickup games. I would play basketball. Whatever it was. We would play indoor in the winter. Now, you get in a car and you’re driving, it’s kind of disruptive to everyone’s family life. That’s something that’s different. There’s a lot of value in that.<br /><br />It’s one of the things when you have an academy like we’ll have and a facility like we’ll have, those are the things you are always able to manage. You can make those decisions and be a little bit different. You can have kids come a little bit early and hang out at the training facility and be a little bit of a club environment. That was the birth of soccer, that it’s a social gathering for the players and the supporters around this game. You lose this aspect of it when you have kids just being dropped off and picked up and parents are running around dropping kids off.<br /><br /><b>[q: What is <a href="austin-fc.html">Austin FC</a>’s relationship with Lonestar Soccer Club?]</b> Tyson Wahl has been great in managing the relationships of the local soccer clubs. I’ve gotten to meet some people at Lonestar and people from other clubs. I think we want to have relationships with everybody. They’re certainly a big club in Austin. They’ve been very cooperative in the players they’ve had come to our academy.<br /><br />We want to continue to build relationships with different clubs and that’ll continue. Right now, they announced going to the (Boys) ECNL before any of this happened. It’s interesting, similar to pretty much every team it’s just kind of waiting and seeing how the landscape is gonna shake out, when are you gonna start. They’ll continue to play an important role in youth soccer in Austin, and we’ll have a continued relationship with them.</p>
