  <p><b>[Barcelona &amp; Liverpool-linked Torres tipped to attract ‘a lot of offers’]</b> Ferran Torres is already very good and I’m sure there will be a lot of offers at the end of the season. For the sake of <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>, we hope to see him in the club for many years. <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> has always produced great talents like Carlos Soler and Gaya and so many other players in the past and I’m sure it will continue to do so. Let’s hope that the big talents remain in the club for as long as possible</p>

  <p><b>[Gaizka Mendieta has described <a href="james-rodriguez.html">James Rodriguez</a> as a real player, but says the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> star hasn’t capitalised on his advantages since joining the club]</b> James seems like a real player to me. I really enjoy watching him and I’d like to see him on the pitch more, but due to injury and other reasons he hasn’t been. A club like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> can’t give players advantages, but he’s had them given to him<br /><br />In the short term it will be affected. But in the medium and long-term, I think it’ll return to the same <b>[as before]</b>. We’ll get used to it, adapt to the circumstances and people will return to the stadiums, when it’s safe to do so, with the same passion. What’s happening now will shape us as a society because it’s taught us about what are our priorities in life.</p>
