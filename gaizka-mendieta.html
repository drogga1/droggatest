  <p><b>[Atletico Madrid’s encounter with Barcelona represents their only chance to reel in the La Liga leaders]</b> It will be a tough game. For Atletico Madrid, it will be about cutting off the points gap, while for Barcelona it will be to keep the distance at the top of the table because the end of the season will be really tough in terms of the title challenge. Atleti will have this match as the only chance to get closer to Barcelona<br /><br />I think the performance of Valencia so far has been great. Considering the past few seasons, it has been really good. What started as a new project, under a new manager and a bit of expectation, it has been amazing. Now, hopefully, Valencia qualify for the Champions League.<br /><br />Valencia has always had a great academy. The way they project their youngsters into the first team is great. Ferran Torres is another talented youngster who has come through the academy. Valencia has always been a club which has broken young talent through the ranks and sold them. This has been their philosophy all these years; it’s great to see them produce great players</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea cannot stop Lionel Messi in the second leg of their Champions League Round of 16 tie at Camp Nou]</b> You cannot stop Messi. You can stop Barcelona but <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi is difficult. If you try to stop <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi, then you have <b>[Andres]</b> Iniesta. Then, you also have <b>[Luis]</b> Suarez, there is so much individual talent in the team<br /><br />Do Chelsea have a chance? Yes, of course. They have shown before that in football anything can happen. They played against Barcelona and defended really well, which wasn’t easy. In my opinion, playing at Camp Nou will be difficult. I cannot see Barcelona not scoring. We have seen few matches this season where they haven’t scored so hopefully they will score and go through</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid boss Santiago Solari has been urged to keep faith with Vinicius Junior]</b> He definitely brings something different to this Real Madrid team, they are playing with a player that is different. No-one does those runs, passes and moves, takes on defenders or opponents like he does or the way he does at the moment. That is why he has to play every game at the moment for Real Madrid. He is a key player. Lucas Vasquez is totally fit and Bale is totally fit. It is the decision for to the manger Solari who he thinks is the best player for each match.<br /><br />If they’re all fit I think <b>[Gareth]</b> Bale would be first choice but the way Vinicius is playing for Real Madrid he has to be in the team before anyone. People mention Isco all the time, but if you’ve got this guy why play with Isco?</p>

  <p><b>[Former Valencia midfielder Gaizka Mendieta says the challenge to surpass his idols was the secret to his success in La Liga]</b> When I joined Valencia, obviously, I wasn’t the player I became. I knew my chances were small. Even if I played a few minutes, I had to be at my best. Also, I wasn’t playing in my natural position. I had a lot of challenges, but for me, it was that. It was a pure challenge. As a sportsman, I like challenges.<br /><br />I always looked up to people like <b>[Pep]</b> Guardiola, <b>[Zinedine]</b> Zidane, <b>[Luis]</b> Figo, <b>[Fernando]</b> Redondo. I looked up to them like idols to learn from. Then you become friends, teammates. So, it’s quite a strange process, but it’s the way you get through. It’s like from idolising these players to wanting to be better than them</p>

  <p><b>[Gaizka Mendieta and Fernando Morientes relive Real Madrid vs Valencia memories]</b> I remember one, in particular, at the Bernabeu, when we were right up in each other’s faces. I think we won 3-2. I scored a penalty. You won lots of them, but winning at the Bernabeu was always special.</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona need to respect incredible Jurgen Klopp and his Liverpool side]</b> Barca shouldn’t fear Liverpool, but rather respect them. When you get to those stages in the Champions League and looking at how Liverpool has done in the league, it is incredible the work that Klopp has put in. I don’t think there’s a favourite, I think it’s 50-50. I don’t think there’s any advantage of playing at home, in the way both teams play. I could see it going either way. They have different styles and are in great form, which is great for the competition. Obviously I hope Barca makes it through and they manage to get another trophy. But we know how difficult and punishing the Champions League can be. So it’ll be about not making mistakes that will be important.<br /><br />I think it’s been amazing the way he’s been managing the team both on the pitch as well as in the dressing room. When you coach this team, you need trophies to justify your season. Ernesto has already got one now and hopefully there’s more to come in the Spanish Cup or the Champions League</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> &amp; Liverpool-linked Torres tipped to attract ‘a lot of offers’]</b> Ferran Torres is already very good and I’m sure there will be a lot of offers at the end of the season. For the sake of <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>, we hope to see him in the club for many years. <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> has always produced great talents like Carlos Soler and Gaya and so many other players in the past and I’m sure it will continue to do so. Let’s hope that the big talents remain in the club for as long as possible</p>

  <p><b>[Gaizka Mendieta has described <a href="james-rodriguez.html">James Rodriguez</a> as a real player, but says the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> star hasn’t capitalised on his advantages since joining the club]</b> James seems like a real player to me. I really enjoy watching him and I’d like to see him on the pitch more, but due to injury and other reasons he hasn’t been. A club like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> can’t give players advantages, but he’s had them given to him<br /><br />In the short term it will be affected. But in the medium and long-term, I think it’ll return to the same <b>[as before]</b>. We’ll get used to it, adapt to the circumstances and people will return to the stadiums, when it’s safe to do so, with the same passion. What’s happening now will shape us as a society because it’s taught us about what are our priorities in life.</p>
