I think we’ve gotten better<br /><br /><b>[Osorio may not have hoped Jamaica would be waiting for his team in the semifinal]</b> I think it’s going to be a very complicated game. It’s going to be the same, they’re going to sit back and wait for us to make a mistake. We’ve got to be concentrated and now analyze and figure out how to open them up</p>

  <dd>Rodolfo Pizarro is making his first start of the Gold Cup for Mexico against Costa Rica in the quarterfinals. The <a href="monterrey-fc.html">Monterrey</a> winger replaces Roberto Alvarado , who started all three group matches for <a href="tata-martino.html">Tata Martino</a>’s men, with the Argentine manager going with what appears to be his strongest XI in the quarterfinal tie</dd>

  <p><b>[Rodolfo Pizarro stakes claim for more Mexico opportunities whether club future in Europe or Liga MX]</b> I think we played in a different way (under Martino), with more mobility, more desire to come out and play and not send as many long balls. I think the idea is there. The manager asked for that from us, and I think we’re on the right path. I’m always going to have this dream. I don’t know if it’ll be this semester, but I know I’ll move to Europe sooner or later<br /><br /><b>[The 2019 Gold Cup won’t be the last trophy we see Pizarro lift]</b> I’m happy, happy for what I did, for the matches I played and for the title, more than anything</p>

Tata said the league was at the same level as Liga MX. A lot of people think <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is still a league where players come to retire. That’s all in the past. Many more Mexicans will come to the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. As time goes by, more Mexicans want to come here. It’s a fact<br /><br />It’s a good thing that <a href="tata-martino.html">Tata Martino</a> coached here. He won <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup. The fact that he looks at <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, at the league, is very important.

In the street, nobody bothers you and you can go out to dinner in peace. But you also lose because nobody is looking at you or knows what you are doing. You win on one side and lose on another. it’s completely different being in <a href="chivas-fc.html">Chivas</a>, for better or worse. It can sink your career if you can’t cope with the pressure or it can catapult you to being a name, help you a lot with marketing<br /><br />After this <b>[break]</b> we’ll be more ready to run a marathon than to play football. It’d be good if they could find a solution to play five a side or something so we’re aren’t going so long without playing with the ball</p>
