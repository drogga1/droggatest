Rodolfo Pizarro is making his first start of the Gold Cup for Mexico against Costa Rica in the quarterfinals. The Monterrey winger replaces Roberto Alvarado , who started all three group matches for Tata Martino’s men, with the Argentine manager going with what appears to be his strongest XI in the quarterfinal tie</p>

  <p><b>[Rodolfo Pizarro stakes claim for more Mexico opportunities whether club future in Europe or Liga MX]</b> I think we played in a different way (under Martino), with more mobility, more desire to come out and play and not send as many long balls. I think the idea is there. The manager asked for that from us, and I think we’re on the right path. I’m always going to have this dream. I don’t know if it’ll be this semester, but I know I’ll move to Europe sooner or later<br /><br /><b>[The 2019 Gold Cup won’t be the last trophy we see Pizarro lift]</b> I’m happy, happy for what I did, for the matches I played and for the title, more than anything</p>

  <p><b>[Pizarro has made his intentions known, saying that he sees <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> as a better stepping stone to Europe than Liga MX]</b> I think it’s a bit closer, being there first and then later <b>[in Europe]</b>. It’s a lot easier from there <b>[in MLS]</b> to Europe. <b>[Beckham]</b> spoke to me on video-calls, he told me that he wanted me to come, and from when I spoke to him on the calls it influenced my decision <b>[to come]</b> a lot</p>

  <p><b>[Monterrey confirmed it had parted ways with Rodolfo Pizarro on Wednesday]</b> Today, the notification from the player Rodolfo Pizarro was received in our offices in the sense that, in order to suit his interests, he unilaterally terminates his contract with the <a href="monterrey-fc.html">Monterrey</a> Rayados Football Club, since his desire is to continue his career with the new <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> franchise based in Miami. We wish Rodolfo success in his future projects</p>

  <p><b>[Inter Miami have confirmed the signing of Mexican star Rodolfo Pizarro from Monterrey]</b> The truth is I’m very happy, very happy to be here, to live this new experience, to leave my country. I’m feeling very positive, looking forward to getting this started. It’s a very nice challenge. They tell me they want to do important things. They showed me the project and the truth is that I came here without having to think about it<br /><br />My main goal is to be champion. I want to lift a cup with this Club, make <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> history with Miami</p>

  <p><b>[Tata Martino advice makes Rodolfo Pizarro even more comfortable with MLS]</b> I first spoke with Matias Almeyda and then with <a href="tata-martino.html">Tata Martino</a> about joining <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. Tata said the league was at the same level as Liga MX. A lot of people think <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is still a league where players come to retire. That’s all in the past. Many more Mexicans will come to the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. As time goes by, more Mexicans want to come here. It’s a fact<br /><br />It’s a good thing that <a href="tata-martino.html">Tata Martino</a> coached here. He won <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup. The fact that he looks at <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, at the league, is very important. Part of the reason I chose to come to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is because of that: I want to return to the Mexican national team</p>

  <p><b>[After Inter Miami’s <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> debut ends in defeat]</b> We played a great game. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to finish our chances but in the end, it was a great game. The man of the match was their <b>[LAFC]</b> goalkeeper and I think that says a lot about our game</p>

  <p><b>[Inter Miami’s Rodolfo Pizarro says there’s little to separate fellow Mexico internationals <a href="raul-jimenez.html">Raul Jimenez</a> and <a href="carlos-vela.html">Carlos Vela</a> as the best player]</b> I think they <b>[Vela and Jimenez]</b> are the best. It’s difficult because Raul is scoring goals against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and Carlos is in the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. In talent, everyone knows about <a href="carlos-vela.html">Carlos Vela</a>. I think it’s between the two and it’s even<br /><br /><b>[He’s enjoyed being out of the limelight, but is worried about the lack of profile hurting his marketability as a young El Tri star]</b> You get more tranquillity. In the street, nobody bothers you and you can go out to dinner in peace. But you also lose because nobody is looking at you or knows what you are doing. You win on one side and lose on another. it’s completely different being in <a href="chivas-fc.html">Chivas</a>, for better or worse. It can sink your career if you can’t cope with the pressure or it can catapult you to being a name, help you a lot with marketing<br /><br />After this <b>[break]</b> we’ll be more ready to run a marathon than to play football. It’d be good if they could find a solution to play five a side or something so we’re aren’t going so long without playing with the ball</p>
