  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo’s free kick mentor reveals how he moulded Portugal &amp; Real Madrid star’s technique]</b> Put your feet right here, take these three steps, wait for the right time and make the goalkeeper anxious<br /><br />As a boy, he was obsessed with physical exercises the same way I was. And destiny brought together these two guys. But I’m not responsible <b>[for him]</b>. People say that I taught Cristiano <b>[how to take free kicks]</b>, but I didn’t. I heard him saying he was going to be the best in the world, and that made a mark on me. His kick is better than mine was. The one who taught me how to take free kicks was Dorinho, at Internacional: ‘Put your feet right here, take these three steps, wait for the right time and make the goalkeeper anxious’. I received all this advice for free, so I’m passing them on for free. It’s my legacy. My wife said to me that we look exactly the same before taking free kicks, but it wasn’t I who taught him. I just showed him how I did it<br /><br />My relationship with Cristiano was a very nice one, like the ones he has with all the Brazilians. He was in the youth teams and was a Sporting supporter. When he was 16, he started training with the senior squad and after that we used to train a little more together. When the training session was over, we used to stay there on the pitch to play with the ball. He didn’t believe I was good enough with the ball because he thought that, as a defender, I didn’t have the necessary ability to play in attack. But I proved him wrong, and used to joke: ‘Everything I do, you must do as well’, and vice-versa. We became friends. During our conversations, always related to football, Cristiano told me one thing I can never forget. He told me: ‘I’m going to be the best in the world, mate’. We didn’t know he would go on to be the best five times, but he is the best and has proven that during this World Cup in only two games.<br /><br />If I had the opportunity to talk to him, I’d hug him to say it was worth it to pass on the little that I could to him, and that he made it better and is the only one responsible. Because he believed in himself</p>
