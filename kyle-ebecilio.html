  <p><b>[How ex-Arsenal youngster Kyle Ebecilio battled serious illness to return to top level. Ebecilio’s father and agent Steve Ebecilio]</b> We never expected him to be the best player but in that team all his team-mates saw him as the leader without the captain’s armband. We were very proud.<br /><br /><b>[Arsenal scout]</b> Bob Arber approached us and asked us if Kyle was ready and willing to come to Arsenal. The first reaction was a surprise that a big English club was interested in Kyle. We immediately asked ‘are you for real? Is this a joke? Show me your card.’ Bob showed us his card and said ‘don’t worry Steve, we really like your son, he has lots of potential and we’d like him to play for Arsenal’. Kyle had offers from other big English clubs as well including Man City and Chelsea. We decided to go to Arsenal for the developmental side. All the other clubs offered us a lot of money to come but Arsenal was not a club that pays a lot of money to players, especially young players. Studying how they developed players in their academy we thought that it would be a good time for Kyle to develop in his career</p>

  <p><b>[Dr. Jane Pritchard On Guillan-Barre syndrome]</b> Guillan-Barre syndrome is when your immune system attacks your nerves. Some people fully recover but 5 per cent of people die. The classic presentation is that people start to develop a bit of tingling perhaps in the feet at first and then gradually they become weak. Some people progress very rapidly. Some people within two days might be unable to work but with other people it’s more gradual. It really is a question of getting through those initial stages when you’re severely affected and then gradually improving and healing the nerves from whatever your worst point was.</p>

  <p><b>[On his learning period]</b> Feyenoord came with a contract after Arsenal came with a contract, so Arsenal was first. The first two months I couldn’t sleep. It had to be a secret and I couldn’t tell anyone but in school I told everyone! At the beginning I was quite scared to go to a new country, new language, new people, new frieinds, being away from my family. That period was really hard for me but after six months my parents came and it was a lot easier<br /><br /><b>[He reflects on his time in north London with great fondness]</b> It gave me experience on and off the pitch. Physically I got strong. For example when I went back to Holland with the national team it was just so easy for me because I was used to the style. Off the pitch it made me a man<br /><br /><b>[On Guillan-Barre syndrome]</b> At the moment I’m 100 per cent fit. I’ve played maybe six games now from January until now. I’m feeling good mentally, physically. I’m ready for my next step.</p>
