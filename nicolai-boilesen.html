  <p>[Nicolai Boilesen has revealed that the national team will go to the World Cup inspired by the heroics of Sevilla, who recently knocked Manchester United out of the Champions League] The anatomy of building team spirit and confidence of a national team is pretty fascinating and complex because we don’t work together every day like for our clubs but only a few times a year. We all have this great pride of representing our country, of course, and that is the main driver together with our ambitions. But a great thing in a national team is, how the success of individual players merges together in the team spirit, when the players arrive in the camp with a lot of confidence from their clubs. I have that feeling myself right now after five league wins in a row with FC Copenhagen, and we all share the success of players like Christian Eriksen, scoring a brace for Tottenham in his latest game and joining the group in a great mood. And an even better example right now is our captain Simon Kjaer, who delivered an amazing performance when his team Sevilla knocked Manchester United out of the Champions League last week. It is a great thing about team sport, that it surely raises the team spirit, when you share the success of any of the players - and in this case our national team captain.<br /><br />I enjoy feeling this kind of winning mentality in the national team - because that is ‘competition mode’. I was educated for this in Ajax and now experience it with FC Copenhagen; only winning counts, and that mindset works. I can confirm that with a smile on my face after having been part of teams winning four titles with Ajax in the Eredivisie and then the Double in Denmark last season in my first season in Superligaen.<br /><br />We’re all thinking of the World Cup. This is where it begins. It’s great to feel the confidence within the squad after an extremely long series of good results. We’re unbeaten for 17 months and 11 games, and getting results like that makes you grow as a team. You gain confidence and it helps you in match situations. If the other team gets the first goal, you never doubt as a team that you can overcome that and get a good result, because you just have that confidence. This winning mentality will help us perform to our best in the World Cup and hopefully cause a stir<br /><br />I had to take a step down to kickstart my career after having been frozen out in Ajax for the last year of my contract as punishment for not extending my deal with the club. Now I enjoy having a lot of responsibility in FC Copenhagen, which considers itself as an international club based in Denmark, but of course my ambition is to go abroad again and to play in one of the biggest leagues. I have only just turned 26 and is entering, what is normally the best years of a football career</p>

  <p>[Copenhagen defender Nicolai Boilesen is optimistic that he will be back playing in one of Europe’s biggest leagues come the start of the season] I have heard a bit about interest from different clubs from both Ligue 1 and Premier League. I also saw stories about Galatasaray in media, but to be honest, I have no idea if it is just a very vague interest or something more substantial. It is always flattering, when you hear about interest from big clubs and the biggest leagues. But I am not the best source for these transfer stories, since I don’t hear anything until it is 100 per cent concrete. It is all with my agent. My only focus is football - and right now it is all about finishing the season well with Copenhagen and then the World Cup.<br /><br />No doubt my ambition is to get back to the bigger leagues in Europe. I don’t know whether it will be this summer or later, but I went through my football education in Ajax and with the Denmark team, and I feel that I belong in that international level. I am back at my best, which I believe is proved by the fact that I was back in the Denmark national team for the internationals in March against Panama and Chile. I was a regular before my ‘Ajax punishment’ with one year in the deep freezer for not extending my contract, and I have missed the national team like crazy. There is nothing bigger in football than representing your country<br /><br />I am 26 now and enjoying being 100% fit. I got the taste of top-level football in the Europa League, where we lost to a top-class team like Atletico Madrid in the knockout rounds. They were really, really good, and after facing them I was sure, that they would go on to win the trophy - as they did in great style. For Copenhagen the season has been a sort of a transition phase and the results a bit disappointing. I don’t want to sound arrogant, but it feels strange not to win any titles, not only for this club but also for me personally. I have been used to a winning feeling; with Ajax I won four league titles and then last season I won the double with Copehagen<br /><br />I believe that the Denmark squad has a great potential in Russia, and we definitely have the quality of players to advance from the group. Then it’s the knockout stage, and anything can happen. Our current team is unbeaten for 13 games in a row, and that is a national record for 110 years of the national team. It has never happened before, and that shows the winning mentality of this team</p>

  <p>[Copenhagen have what it takes to shock Atalanta in the Europa League] We respect Atalanta, and we all know about the high quality of Serie A as one of the best leagues in the world, so we expect a super difficult opponent. Atalanta has also shown good qualities in recent seasons in Europa League, but it does not change out ambition, our goal. We want to beat them and qualify for the group stage again. We can win. Of course we believe that. If we perform on our best level, we will definitely make it difficult for Atalanta. It is a difficult last hurdle, but we want to get into the group phase. We have a good squad this season. Quite a lot of us have experience from the Danish national team, and then obviously we have some interesting players from other countries as well. At FC Copenhagen we like to see ourselves as an international club based in Denmark..<br /><br />We have big ambitions, and FC Copenhagen belong in the group stage. History shows that, having played in the group stages in 11 of the last 12 seasons, and so does our current form and level. We have not lost for nine games, winning eight of them, and we have moved to a higher level than last season, when we actually qualified from the Europa League group for the knockout stage, then were unfortunate to be drawn against a true top team like Atletico Madrid<br /><br />It is always an honour to represent your country. I received my education as a football player on international level with Ajax and with the Denmark national team, and that is the level where I feel, that I belong. Denmark did well at the World Cup, reaching the knockout phase and only losing on penalties against Croatia, but now it is a new start, and we are all looking forward to that.</p>
