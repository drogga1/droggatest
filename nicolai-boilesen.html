  <p><b>[Copenhagen star Nicolai Boilesen is confident that his side can cause a Europa League upset when they tackle Atletico Madrid over two legs]</b> Parken is our secret weapon in the first match. Denmark have a very good home record in international matches here. Of course, Atletico are used to be playing in a league of another quality than the Danish league, but we won’t be a pushover at Parken. I have been at for Copenhagen a year and a half now, and in that time we have had a lot of good results in the European matches at home - we’re unbeaten against clubs like Leicester, Porto, Ajax, Club Bruges, Lokomotiv Moscow, Zlin and Sheriff Tiraspol. I turn 26 between the two Atletico games, and I can think of no better birthday present entering the best years of my career than knocking this great team out of the competition.<br /><br />It is a pleasure to play big games like these ones against Atletico. You want to play against the best players and the best teams, and Atletico are one of the best in the world - as the UEFA club ranking proves. Obviously, they will be the favourites, but we are going all-in to create the sensation and knock them out of the competition. With Ajax I have won against Barcelona in the Champions League, and Copenhagen is almost the same level as Ajax - so why not?<br /><br />Maybe it will make Atletico focus more on this game now, when Barca are so far in front of them in La Liga, and when they are not in the Copa del Rey anymore. This is their last chance of a trophy this season, so they can put a lot of power into their performances against us because this competition must now be their top priority<br /><br />We are a very focused team in the big games, and we proved that in the Europa League group. Three clean sheets and seven points collected in our home games was the key to advance from the group stage<br /><br />Ajax kicked me out on the sideline for one year as a punishment for not extending my contract with them, and it was a difficult time for me. Now I am back and stronger than ever, both mentally and physically. A football player can always find parts of his football to optimise - even without playing matches. The World Cup is a big goal for me this summer. I was a regular for Denmark before my ‘Ajax punishment’, and I have missed that a lot. There is nothing bigger in football than representing your country<br /><br />Football is all about the team, and obviously I prefer to play in my natural role as left-back, but when my coach needs me to play in another position to help the team, of course I do that. It only develops me as a player to be able to play in more positions</p>

  <p><b>[Nicolai Boilesen has revealed that the national team will go to the World Cup inspired by the heroics of Sevilla, who recently knocked Manchester United out of the Champions League]</b> The anatomy of building team spirit and confidence of a national team is pretty fascinating and complex because we don’t work together every day like for our clubs but only a few times a year. We all have this great pride of representing our country, of course, and that is the main driver together with our ambitions. But a great thing in a national team is, how the success of individual players merges together in the team spirit, when the players arrive in the camp with a lot of confidence from their clubs. I have that feeling myself right now after five league wins in a row with FC Copenhagen, and we all share the success of players like Christian Eriksen, scoring a brace for Tottenham in his latest game and joining the group in a great mood. And an even better example right now is our captain Simon Kjaer, who delivered an amazing performance when his team Sevilla knocked Manchester United out of the Champions League last week. It is a great thing about team sport, that it surely raises the team spirit, when you share the success of any of the players - and in this case our national team captain.<br /><br />I enjoy feeling this kind of winning mentality in the national team - because that is ‘competition mode’. I was educated for this in Ajax and now experience it with FC Copenhagen; only winning counts, and that mindset works. I can confirm that with a smile on my face after having been part of teams winning four titles with Ajax in the Eredivisie and then the Double in Denmark last season in my first season in Superligaen.<br /><br />We’re all thinking of the World Cup. This is where it begins. It’s great to feel the confidence within the squad after an extremely long series of good results. We’re unbeaten for 17 months and 11 games, and getting results like that makes you grow as a team. You gain confidence and it helps you in match situations. If the other team gets the first goal, you never doubt as a team that you can overcome that and get a good result, because you just have that confidence. This winning mentality will help us perform to our best in the World Cup and hopefully cause a stir<br /><br />I had to take a step down to kickstart my career after having been frozen out in Ajax for the last year of my contract as punishment for not extending my deal with the club. Now I enjoy having a lot of responsibility in FC Copenhagen, which considers itself as an international club based in Denmark, but of course my ambition is to go abroad again and to play in one of the biggest leagues. I have only just turned 26 and is entering, what is normally the best years of a football career</p>

  <p><b>[Copenhagen defender Nicolai Boilesen is optimistic that he will be back playing in one of Europe’s biggest leagues come the start of the season]</b> I have heard a bit about interest from different clubs from both Ligue 1 and Premier League. I also saw stories about Galatasaray in media, but to be honest, I have no idea if it is just a very vague interest or something more substantial. It is always flattering, when you hear about interest from big clubs and the biggest leagues. But I am not the best source for these transfer stories, since I don’t hear anything until it is 100 per cent concrete. It is all with my agent. My only focus is football - and right now it is all about finishing the season well with Copenhagen and then the World Cup.<br /><br />No doubt my ambition is to get back to the bigger leagues in Europe. I don’t know whether it will be this summer or later, but I went through my football education in Ajax and with the Denmark team, and I feel that I belong in that international level. I am back at my best, which I believe is proved by the fact that I was back in the Denmark national team for the internationals in March against Panama and Chile. I was a regular before my ‘Ajax punishment’ with one year in the deep freezer for not extending my contract, and I have missed the national team like crazy. There is nothing bigger in football than representing your country<br /><br />I am 26 now and enjoying being 100% fit. I got the taste of top-level football in the Europa League, where we lost to a top-class team like Atletico Madrid in the knockout rounds. They were really, really good, and after facing them I was sure, that they would go on to win the trophy - as they did in great style. For Copenhagen the season has been a sort of a transition phase and the results a bit disappointing. I don’t want to sound arrogant, but it feels strange not to win any titles, not only for this club but also for me personally. I have been used to a winning feeling; with Ajax I won four league titles and then last season I won the double with Copehagen<br /><br />I believe that the Denmark squad has a great potential in Russia, and we definitely have the quality of players to advance from the group. Then it’s the knockout stage, and anything can happen. Our current team is unbeaten for 13 games in a row, and that is a national record for 110 years of the national team. It has never happened before, and that shows the winning mentality of this team</p>

  <p><b>[Copenhagen have what it takes to shock Atalanta in the Europa League]</b> We respect Atalanta, and we all know about the high quality of Serie A as one of the best leagues in the world, so we expect a super difficult opponent. Atalanta has also shown good qualities in recent seasons in Europa League, but it does not change out ambition, our goal. We want to beat them and qualify for the group stage again. We can win. Of course we believe that. If we perform on our best level, we will definitely make it difficult for Atalanta. It is a difficult last hurdle, but we want to get into the group phase. We have a good squad this season. Quite a lot of us have experience from the Danish national team, and then obviously we have some interesting players from other countries as well. At FC Copenhagen we like to see ourselves as an international club based in Denmark..<br /><br />We have big ambitions, and FC Copenhagen belong in the group stage. History shows that, having played in the group stages in 11 of the last 12 seasons, and so does our current form and level. We have not lost for nine games, winning eight of them, and we have moved to a higher level than last season, when we actually qualified from the Europa League group for the knockout stage, then were unfortunate to be drawn against a true top team like Atletico Madrid<br /><br />It is always an honour to represent your country. I received my education as a football player on international level with Ajax and with the Denmark national team, and that is the level where I feel, that I belong. Denmark did well at the World Cup, reaching the knockout phase and only losing on penalties against Croatia, but now it is a new start, and we are all looking forward to that.</p>

  <p><b>[Nicolai Boilesen has said that Denmark’s international footballers will be delighted to get back to business when they face Wales]</b> It has been a hectic and frustrating week, because as football players, what we want most is to play football - and obviously we are always proud to play for our country. We were all gathered in Copenhagen. I play for FC Copenhagen, so for me it was a short walk from my home to the hotel, where we met, but for the other players, they were traveling from all over Europe. We all showed up because we wanted to play and we tried our best to get an agreement so that we could play the two internationals. I love to play for Denmark - it was a terrible feeling for all of us not being able to do that because of the conflict. Happily, in the end we agreed with the football federation, and now we have full focus on the Wales match.<br /><br />This is an important match, our first in the Nations League, and we are really looking forward to it. It adds some extra spice that we are playing for points instead of a friendly<br /><br />It is definitely an important mission to stop Gareth Bale. He is a truly top-class player and it will take a great team effort to make sure that he won’t shine against us. It would be wrong to use man marking - he is too good for that, so we need to make sure tactically and by supporting each other on the pitch that he does not get the space he wants. We have a lot of respect for Bale, but also for the Wales team in general. Beating Ireland 4-1 proves how good they are. I also like Aaron Ramsey. Like Bale he is technically very gifted</p>
