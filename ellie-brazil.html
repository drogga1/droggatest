  <p><b>[Ellie Brazil says I could never fall out of love with football]</b> My assist of the season! My family have been great. The whole thing that I love about them is that I think they were just as gutted as me. It was really nice, he won’t say the same, but my grandad was in the crowd when I did it. When I got to him, I was on crutches, and he was like, ‘It’s alright, you’ll be running next week!’ It was just one of those things where you just needed that, someone who was going to make you laugh and get you through it, and I definitely have that in my family<br /><br /><b>[My dad has]</b> obviously been my biggest influence when it comes to football. He was really successful, which motivated me, but without my mum, I wouldn’t have got as far as I have. Not a chance<br /><br />I remember my dad being there and he was proud as punch even though we both knew I was absolutely dreadful. I was probably the worst player on the pitch! But we both sat there like, if I’m here at 15, I can do this. <b>[England]</b> give you that little taste and then go, this is where you could be, this is what you could do, and now it’s all up to you to get yourself there<br /><br />My nan flew all the way to Jordan, bless her heart. She was there in her England t-shirt in the crowd and when I scored <b>[in England’s opening group game]</b>, I just saw her and my mum crying their eyes out. You go through psychological blocks where, if <b>[football]</b> starts to become more like work, it can be really hard. Then, you think of these memories. Like now, I’m just sat reminiscing about them … I could never fall out of love with the game<br /><br />I’ll never regret the decision because if I didn’t go to Florence, I wouldn’t be at Brighton. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve loved every team I’ve been in, but Brighton, as a whole, the players and the management, is the best team that I’ve been at. I think everything happens for a reason, in that sense<br /><br />It was really frustrating because the pre-season of this season, I’ve been playing at probably the best <b>[level]</b> I’ve played. If I was playing like I was last year, just mediocre, it wouldn’t have hit me as hard. But I got back into this mindset where I was loving it, loving going to work, I was in such a good mood. I’ve tried to stay in the same head space</p>
