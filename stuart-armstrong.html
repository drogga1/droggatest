  <p><b>[Moussa Dembele is intent on leaving Celtic this summer]</b> He’s such a young boy, but sometimes you forget just how young he is with some of his performances, especially in the Champions League, where he performs well beyond his years. Physically, he’s so strong, and he’s a powerful finisher. You need that in the team - it’s the most valuable thing in football.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Celtic midfielder Stuart Armstrong is happy with his move to Southampton]</b> As an individual I wanted something new, a new challenge, and if I hadn’t taken that opportunity I would have regretted it. I wouldn’t say I miss Scottish football. I had my time here. I was very grateful for it and had a lot of nice memories. It’s always hard when you’re not playing games, not starting games especially, because nobody likes sitting on the bench. I’m not the most patient. I need to learn to adapt. I’m in a different league - I spent eight years in the Scottish League.<br /><br />I would say it’s a different type of challenge. If I’d stayed at Celtic and continued to have success I’d view my career when it finished as a very good one and a very successful one. I think each individual is different, they’ll have their own desires and want to have their own experiences. I grew up watching a lot of Premier League - it’s something I dreamed about as a young player. That was my own interest and something I’m very happy to be experiencing right now</p>

  <p><b>[Albania vs Scotland]</b> We’re all behind him and I think what would show that the best are performances and results. We certainly have the belief. The performance last time out wasn’t great and everyone knows that, so it’s up to us to turn that around and put in a good performance.</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester City vs Southampton]</b> We have to learn from these games, of course we do. Tuesday is a good chance to make amends, move forward and progress. The quality is there - we have a very talented squad and I feel we’re better than the league position shows. We’ve had a number of results where we’ve ended up with a draw when we’ve felt we could’ve had more, so we need to start turning those draws into wins.</p>
