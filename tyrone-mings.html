  <p><b>[Bournemouth defender Tyrone Mings has cancelled an interview with talkSPORT following comments made by former Reading frontman Dave Kitson in relation to the current row over racism in football]</b> I’m meant to be doing an interview with talksport tomorrow which won’t be happening. I’m fed up of broadcasting channels who have a huge voice allowing this sort of sh*t to be said. Like someone or dislike them, there is no ‘but’ or grey area when it comes to racism.<br /><br /><b>[Replying to a message of encouragement for his actions]</b> Sometimes silence is just as powerful as trying to force someone to listen to you. If we all don’t do interviews with ‘them’ they will soon start to have a level of appreciation for what we bring to their sport.<br /><br />I will absolutely voice my opinion and play my part for those who do not have as much of a reach. It has to be in the right way and on the right platforms though. Silence is deadly for stations and outlets who rely on viewers and listeners</p>

  <p><b>[Tyrone Mings, who joined <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> on loan from <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> in January, has also been full of praise for the influence of <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a>]</b> I’m always learning from him. He is a defender who a lot of people would have in their all-time <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> XI, so the opportunity to work with him was a huge factor in me coming here. After every game we sit down and watch clips of my performance, assessing what I did well and what I can improve. The best defenders are the ones you don’t always notice, keeping clean sheets and trying to remain under the radar, letting the strikers get all the adulation! He has been a huge help for me.<br /><br /><b>[Mings is aware of the challenge facing Villa at Wembley after Derby county overcame <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> in a thrilling semi-final]</b> They are full of talent and you can’t get to this stage of the season if you’re not a good team. They have a lot of spirit and you have to be a threat to score four goals at <a href="leeds-united.html">Elland Road</a>. They have a manager who is a winner and players in the dressing room who have won stuff before, but we feel we are in a good position to counter anything they can throw at us. It will be a great game of football for the neutral. But hopefully one we will deal with</p>

We then try to implement that on the training pitch. He gives me a little bit of criticism but mostly it’s a lot of positivity</p>

  <p><b>[England defender Tyrone Mings following incidents in Bulgaria says Racism protocols were ‘effective’]</b> I think <a href="uefa.html">UEFA’s racism protocol</a> was effective, I don’t know whether certain members of the crowd were removed, obviously there were announcements that went out. I think whatever the protocol was, the correct steps that were taken definitely helped and we made a decision at half-time to come out and play the game, which we thought was the right decision. If anything else was to happen then we would have taken appropriate action. We’re ultimately delighted with the result at the end<br /><br /><b>[Mings was delighted to make his debut and thought the team handled the adverse circumstances well]</b> It was good, obviously it was a great occasion, I made my England debut. Slightly overshadowed by a few disappointing chants, it was quite clear to hear on the pitch. But I think we showed a great response, we showed a good togetherness. Ultimately we let the football do the talking, and I think the higher powers will hopefully deal with the incidents that happened but yeah, we couldn’t do much more than what we’ve done on the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Tyrone Mings has warned his <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> team-mates to be wary of the threat posed by <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> when they face <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> Knowing that he’s <b>[<a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>]</b> a good player and knowing how to stop him are two very different things. He’s a fantastic talent - you saw his goal against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> <b>[a stunning free-kick in the Carabao Cup]</b> - and a player who can produce moments of magic. Coming on for England - his goal against Kosovo - he’s a wonderfully gifted player. I think we’ll all have our work cut out on Sunday as a back four but we’ll be looking to back up our most recent clean sheet with another one<br /><br />I wouldn’t say they are there to be got at but I would definitely say that they probably haven’t clicked this season as they would have liked to. They’re probably quite frustrated with the results that they’ve had. Some of their key players being injured hasn’t helped either but we have all respect for every team in the league and <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> are a good team as well, so there’s no surprise that they cause teams problems.<br /><br />With Man United, we’ll look at what their weaknesses are and how we can attack them and how we can nullify them. They’ve obviously got world-class players all over the pitch so we’ll know full well the challenges that we’ll face but we haven’t gone to any team so far and been humiliated so that stands us in good stead, knowing that we can go toe-to-toe with anyone. Being at such a big club like <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> obviously comes with massive expectation and I think if you get into a game and things aren’t perhaps going well for them on the pitch, naturally fans seem to turn against you. So if that situation was to arise then potentially it’s something we can use to our advantage</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> defender Tyrone Mings has said that <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players know they are ‘commodities’ and that the league’s restart is almost entirely about money]</b> The motives are possibly 100 per cent financially driven rather than integrity driven. I am all for playing again because we have no other choice. As players, we were the last people to be consulted about Project Restart and that is because of where we fall in football’s order of priority. That isn’t a problem. We are commodities in the game and we accept that. We got the option to come back to training and that’s fine because we didn’t have to but if <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> and the EFL and the Government and <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> and <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> all say you are going back to play, it really doesn’t make any difference what the players think because you are going back to play. It is get in or get out<br /><br />It is important that players are given the choice. It’s a personal thing. If you don’t want to do it, you absolutely don’t have to. People have aired their concerns about families’ health and I back those people 100%. That is something people have to take into consideration really carefully. No one should ever be on the end of personal abuse for making a decision based on their families’ needs or health needs. Project Restart is financially driven. I think everybody accepts that. But that’s fine with me because I look at this monster that is <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> football and the revenue it creates and I didn’t moan about being a part of it when everything was great so I’m not going to moan now when the atmosphere around the game is more hesitant</p>
