  <p><b>[Confidence booster for Malaysia U22 after clinching 2-0 win over Myanmar U22]</b> We need to see some players behind them to see if they are ready for the AFC championships. I can only value the first half. In the first half we shouldn’t have been down one zero as we had a few chances. I can live with this result. In the qualifer we will have a different tactic and a different XI.</p>

  <p><b>[Myanmar may have already qualified for the semi-final stage but Gerd Zeise has little intention to change things around and is aiming for top spot in Group A]</b> I don’t think so <b>[on making changes to the team]</b> because now we are in a good rhythm to play and I don’t want to put too many reserve players. Partly because I don’t have many good reserves as well. Not all eight you can use from beginning to play, only substitution. It’s a serious match that can decide first and second. We’ll go for an almost full team.<br /><br />Malaysia deserve to see good football, not the reserve players.The only difference is that we don’t have this pressure now. With this win, we have nine points and we are through. So there’s no we must, we must, we must - it’s a good feeling and not only for me<br /><br />No injuries. Shwe Ko is not 100% fit to go 90 minutes. He’s from 98’ born, very young player. We must treat him step-by-step. And Aung Thu, I cannot give him six matches 90 minutes. He’s our best player and it’s better for him after this result to cool down<br /><br />Frankly, I don’t want to meet both Vietnam and Indonesia because they are brilliant. But if we have to face them, we have to see what we can do. But it is a different level, the match today is a group match and that is a semi-final. Vietnam is a top team while Indonesia have improved a lot</p>

  <p><b>[Zeise disappointed in Myanmar after collapse to Malaysia]</b> I’m very disappointed with most of my players. In the approach to the game I could see something was wrong. The ticket <b>[to the semi-finals]</b> was already in the pocket, but they played like that. It was shameful the way they played in the first half, a shame for Myanmar to present that performance to your <b>[Malaysian]</b> spectators, a shame for me. It’s a disaster, a major disaster.</p>
