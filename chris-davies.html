  <p>[Celtic assistant manager Chris Davies believes Brendan Rodgers will break the club’s £6 million transfer record] I think the club will support if it is the right player. Brendan works closely with Peter [Lawwell] and Dermot [Desmond]. If it is the right player that we all feel is worth that money, and can really take us forward, then I’m sure Brendan would be supported in that. We could just bring players in almost for the sake of it. You pay fees, they are not quite right but you are getting your numbers in. But to protect the club and make sure we are doing the right thing for them and the team, we want to make sure it is the right player. It has to be quality but it has to be the right player. That’s what Brendan is focusing on, working with the club.</p>

  <p>[Celtic vs Hibs] It’s rare to have this many injuries. We’ve got a pretty good team of injuries and suspensions - 4-4-2, you can probably fit them all in at the moment. We have to just, as always, focus on ourselves, focus on our game, bring our intensity, our quality and we should get the win. We showed that against St Johnstone [in a 2-0 Sunday win]. We could put a team out that’s going to be a good team, a very good team of quality players and we’ll be able to cope no problem. I certainly wouldn’t underestimate Hibernian.</p>
