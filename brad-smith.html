  <p>[Brad Smith is locked in a battle with Aziz Behich for a starting spot on the left for the Socceroos] [It’s] very difficult to see how we’re going to line up, I’m not really sure just yet. In training we’ve been doing stuff, but it’s too hard to tell at the moment, but hopefully I’ll be in it.<br /><br />We just need to look back at that and see how we dominated them last time and hopefully do the same again and get a result out here. They’re a good team too, so we’ve got to make sure we’re ready on the day. We’re unbeaten in the qualifiers so that’s a great thing for us to have and [gives us] great confidence going into the game<br /><br />[The Socceroos were surprisingly held to a 2-2 draw by 127th-ranked Thailand] It was a really weird game for us. The conditions were difficult but to be fair to them, they were a good side on the day. We’ve analysed it and put it under the rug and we’ll move on to the important game we’ve got on Thursday</p>

  <p>[Full-back Brad Smith sees the Socceroos’ status as the only unbeaten team in their World Cup qualifying group as a big confidence boost for the must-win match against United Arab Emirates] e’re on our home soil, we’ve got our fans to help us through it and we’ve got plenty of confidence. The team has been working really hard and I feel like we’re doing well. Everyone knows it’s a big game but the Socceroos have never really had it easy, have they? We’re leaving it late but I think we’ll get the job done.</p>
