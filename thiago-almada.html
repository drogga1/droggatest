<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Thiago Almada: Argentina’s next great playmaker on <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>’s radar]</b> I spent my childhood in the neighbourhood. I learned good and bad things. There were people who smoked next to me and I saw people walking with a gun in their hand. In the neighbourhood there are a lot who chose the bad road. It’s one way or the other, and I had to choose.</p>
