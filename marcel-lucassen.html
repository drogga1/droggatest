<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Marcel Lucassen explains how he has implemented a structure into the club’s youth ranks]</b> When I arrived at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, I firstly wanted to know, what the club stands for in general. The problem was that no coach could answer me that exactly. As a result, we collectively developed the ‘Way of Arsenal’, for which philosophy or teams from under-9s to under-23s stand for and also set an example of<br /><br />I disapprove of systems. For me, there is way too much talk about them. It starts, when I ask people, which systems they know. Then the answer is 4-4-2 or 4-3-3. That means, football is played by ten people? If I talk about systems, it is 1-4-3-3 for example. Or does the goalkeeper have a role as an outsider in the team?<br /><br />The playing philosophy should be fixed, the system variable. There are six basic principles, which are features of football: Start the attack, create an attack and finish an attack. Contrary to that, defend as high as possible, as fast as possible and initiate transitional play. If you lose the ball, win it back</p>
