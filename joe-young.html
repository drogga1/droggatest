  <p><b>[Former Limerick FC chairman Father Joe Young recalls <a href="sam-allardyce.html">Sam Allardyce</a>’s successful tenure at the modest Irish club, his first managerial job, during a week which has seen the Sunderland coach heavily linked with the England national team job]</b> When <a href="sam-allardyce.html">Sam Allardyce</a> told me he was moving on I was very sad - in fact I cried. If I had won the lottery I would have held on to Sam because he would have taken us into Europe. Nothing he has achieved since has surprised me. He was driven by a belief that nothing was impossible. That’s why we called it the field of dreams, and I had the joy of sharing it with him for a while</p>
