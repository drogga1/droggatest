  <p><b>[Ex-Newcastle Jets coach Scott Miller will only return to the A-League on his terms]</b> Yeah, definitely, <b>[I would like to coach in the A-League again]</b>. At the right time, of course, and on my terms. Not financially but on my terms structurally - I think that’s key. If you’re going to be measured as a coach, you need some form of strategy and structure and certainly<br /><br />Leaving the Jets was obviously very disappointing and my next role had to be something I could really believe in and trust the people I was involved in, and I’ve certainly found that here<br /><br /><b>[When asked about the possibility of AaB signing Andrew Hoole]</b> When I joined the club, I put a number of players on their scouting list and a number of players in the A-League are actually being reviewed at this point now. At his stage, at this club, we’re very populated in the midfield area, so whether or not they go for that … essentially I provide the information but I don’t make the decision. That’s the sporting director’s position but there’s certainly been a massive interest in approaching Australian players in the short term because they see the value in it economically but also physically and mentally, they can deal with the demands of the Superliga. There’s certainly interest in that demographic of player</p>
