  <p><b>[Ex-Newcastle Jets coach Scott Miller will only return to the A-League on his terms]</b> Yeah, definitely, <b>[I would like to coach in the A-League again]</b>. At the right time, of course, and on my terms. Not financially but on my terms structurally - I think that’s key. If you’re going to be measured as a coach, you need some form of strategy and structure and certainly<br /><br />Leaving the Jets was obviously very disappointing and my next role had to be something I could really believe in and trust the people I was involved in, and I’ve certainly found that here<br /><br /><b>[When asked about the possibility of AaB signing Andrew Hoole]</b> When I joined the club, I put a number of players on their scouting list and a number of players in the A-League are actually being reviewed at this point now. At his stage, at this club, we’re very populated in the midfield area, so whether or not they go for that … essentially I provide the information but I don’t make the decision. That’s the sporting director’s position but there’s certainly been a massive interest in approaching Australian players in the short term because they see the value in it economically but also physically and mentally, they can deal with the demands of the Superliga. There’s certainly interest in that demographic of player</p>

  <p><b>[Former Newcastle Jets boss Scott Miller, who now works as an assistant coach at Danish Superliga club AaB, believes football is much more cut-throat outside Australia]</b> You don’t get much time. I’ve seen instances this year in the A-League - not to be critical - but these coaches wouldn’t be here. They’d get a month in Europe and then be moved on very quickly.<br /><br /><b>[Prior to his one season in charge of Newcastle, Miller worked in various roles at Fulham]</b> It’s very easy to be a big fish in a smaller football community, and I think - ultimately - some people would enjoy that. I left Australia because I wanted to see more and learn more about it, and it was a proud day when I signed with the Jets because it was almost like returning home with what I learned. But not everyone can come to Europe and do it. Even though you might win the A-League … a lot of coaches may well find it difficult to <b>[move abroad]</b>. It’s not just a case of making a phone call and applying for a job. This job was created for me here based on my relationships<br /><br /><b>[Miller reckons his experience at Fulham]</b> I don’t think I got much respect at all. From the important people, I certainly did because they’re the ones that brought me back to the country but it’s like anything - when you’re young and you’re Australian but you’re new to an environment … there are a couple of things: people can be intimidated by it or they can be fearful of it or they just don’t like you. It was a bit hard to take, to be fair, because I haven’t seen many Australians be in a Premier League dressing room for nine years, and that’s not an egotistical thing but more about how about we share ideas and learn off each other and that was always my perspective</p>
