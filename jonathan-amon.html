  <p>[American teenager Jonathan Amon primed for breakout in Denmark] I was always trying to beat my brothers one on one. They didn’t take it easy on me, and that made me get better.<br /><br />To be honest I didn’t know it was going to come this fast,” Amon said. “I wasn’t playing matches on a daily basis with the academy, then the first team coach calls me in and the same week I went in the match against Lyngby and played maybe the last eight minutes. So it was a great feeling just to play in front of a crowd<br /><br />I know it’s cliche but the hardest part was being away from my family. You go from seeing your parents and brothers and sister every day to only seeing them twice a year<br /><br />I feel like I did well, but I know there’s a lot of stuff to work on,” Amon said. “I’m still 18, and I can’t be satisfied with where I am. I just want to keep improving - if you keep improving you’ll keep getting playing time<br /><br />I’ve always thought I could become good at what I do, but when you see other young players do well you get real excited,” Amon said. “I’ve known Tyler Adams from a while ago, just to see him doing well is really exciting, and to see other Americans doing well outside of the country is real exciting</p>

  <p>[Jonathan Jr on Jonathan Amon] He was always the small one out there playing with us, but his technique was so developed for his age, and sometimes better than our technique. I would do tough love on him, so I didn’t really let him have anything, but then around 10 or 11 he started to give me trouble. You could always see it, the talent was always there.<br /><br />Watching him now, it’s just like he’s playing in the backyard,” Joseph Jr. told Goal. “He likes to dance on the ball a little bit every now and then, he still goes at players. He’s like the same exact player I grew up watching</p>

  <p>[Joseph Sr on Jonathan Amon] I had my mixed feelings on that, because I want all my children to get their college degree, but with him I knew that he had something special in him - that he could make a career out of soccer. That said, I told him he has a lot of free time on his hands now so he should be taking some courses online.</p>

  <p>[USMNT’s all-teen attack impresses against Peru] During the national anthem I had a lot of nerves, I was really nervous, but once the game started I felt like it’s just football. I just had to do my best and try to help the team<br /><br />[On Josh Sargent and Tim Weah] I really did (feel a connection) from the start of camp. I was with them and I was really connected with them because I’m the same age as them</p>
