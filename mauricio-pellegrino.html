I know Virgil is an important player and around him will be a lot of speculation like other important players in the squad. I cannot control this and I don’t want to talk about it<br /><br />In the past, when I was a player, I didn’t have the same name as Virgil in the media but when you hear something that another club wants you, it increases the confidence</p>

  <p><b>[Southampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino has confirmed that the club would like to sign Theo Walcott from Arsenal in January]</b> I have been talking about him. He is a good player, but I don’t know with the negotiations, with the market, I imagine that this type of player would have a lot of possibility. For us, it’s not easy. Hopefully we can bring somebody that can help us be stronger. This is our target now. We know the market is difficult, but we are working on that.</p>

  <p><b>[Southampton have parted ways with manager Mauricio Pellegrino]</b> Southampton Football Club can today confirm that it has parted company with first team manager Mauricio Pellegrino. Assistant manager Carlos Compagnucci and assistant first team coach Xavier Tamarit have also parted company with the club. We would like to place on record our thanks to Mauricio, Carlos and Xavier for their efforts during their time with Southampton, and wish them well for the future. The club will look to appoint a new management team as soon as possible, with the search for a replacement already underway.</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid vs Leganes]</b> We have the mindset to compete against all teams of La Liga. That has been proven against Athletic and Real Sociedad. We made mistakes, but we was fine. This will be one more challenge.<br /><br />Cristiano Ronaldo is not here, but Real Madrid are Real Madrid. Football is a team sport. Now, Real Madrid are a bit of diferent from last year. They want to have the ball. They are less chaotic. They’re a great team. But sometimes the better team does not win. The best team in 90 minutes wins. We will need to harness the moments in the game</p>
