  <p><b>[Argentina laboured on the road to Russia. What’s your take on that campaign?]</b> It was very tricky because we changed coach midway through qualifying. Such changes are never easy.

It is an important point: the coach is very happy with the work of the boys, he knows that a demanding season is waiting for us, but he has brought the right mentality.
