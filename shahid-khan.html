  <p><b>[Who is buying Wembley? Billionaire Shahid Khan is the man behind the bid]</b> One of the many benefits of the Jaguars’ commitment to London has been our partnership with the FA and Wembley Stadium. Over the past several years, it became clearer to us and the FA that the idea of our purchase of Wembley Stadium made a lot of sense for all of us<br /><br />For the FA, it would mean Wembley Stadium returning to private ownership, permitting the FA to direct its full attention to its mandate to develop talent and serve the game with the vast resources it would realize from the sale. For the Jaguars, it would deliver another - and very significant - asset and local revenue source that would further strengthen our investment in London, which as everyone knows is crucial to the Jaguars’ continued sustainability in Jacksonville<br /><br />In every respect, the Jaguars’ standing in London would be improved and dramatically enhanced if we are fortunate to be approved as the new owner and steward of Wembley Stadium, and that’s good news for the Jaguars and all of Jacksonville</p>

  <p><b>[Will England still play at Wembley?]</b> Our commitment to the FA is we will own and operate Wembley with the care and respect it deserves, always being mindful that it is - and will continue to be - the home of England’s national teams as well as the ultimate destination for the world’s top entertainment and sports event, including Jaguars and NFL games</p>

  <p><b>[Slavisa Jokanovic has been sacked by Fulham with Claudio Ranieri appointed as the Premier League club’s new manager]</b> I wasn’t anticipating having to make this announcement related to Slavisa and wish the circumstances were such that I didn’t have to, but our path this season has led me to make what I know is the correct decision, at the right time, for our players, the club and our supporters.<br /><br />Slavisa will always have my appreciation and respect for everything he did to return Fulham to top-flight football. I am hoping everyone in the Fulham family shares my heartfelt sentiments for Slavisa and joins me in wishing him success and good fortune, wherever his next stop may be.<br /><br />Making a change without having the right answer or succession plan was not an option, so having someone of Claudio’s calibre ready to accept our challenge was comforting but, most of all, essential. Claudio is risk-free and ready-made for the Premier League, and particularly so for what we need at this moment at Fulham. His recent body of work with Leicester City is literally legendary, and then you look at Claudio’s experience with Chelsea and big clubs throughout Europe, and it’s pretty evident we are welcoming an extraordinary football man to Fulham football club</p>

  <p><b>[Fulham have sacked manager Claudio Ranieri after just 17 games in charge at Craven Cottage]</b> Claudio’s tenure at Fulham didn’t produce the outcome we anticipated and needed when I appointed him as manager in November, but be assured he is not solely to blame for the position we are in today. Claudio walked into a difficult situation, inheriting a side that gained only one point in its prior eight matches, and he provided an immediate boost by leading our club to nine points in his first eight matches as manager. Though we were unable to maintain that pace thereafter, I am grateful for his effort. Claudio leaves Fulham as our friend and he will undoubtedly experience success again soon.<br /><br />Scott Parker’s immediate assignment is merely to help us stabilize, grow and rediscover ourselves as a football club. If Scott can answer that challenge, and our players respond to the opportunity, perhaps victories will follow in the months ahead. What’s most important at this moment, however, is to regroup in a smart and deliberate manner that will serve our long-term vision for sustainable success. If we’re able to do that and win some matches to make a stand late in the season, all the better</p>

  <p><b>[Fulham have appointed Scott Parker as their new manager on a permanent basis]</b> Scott was brave to accept a very difficult challenge in February when appointed as our caretaker manager. Since that time, day by day, whether in training or on matchday, we’ve undeniably become a better football club. Scott will now have another challenge to face, and that is to return Fulham to the Premier League. I fully believe Scott is more than up to the task. I appreciate that he’s been clear for many years that his ultimate goal is to excel as a manager, and he will be given every opportunity to succeed at Fulham. I also have no doubt that he knows and loves this club every bit as much as our supporters, and that’s an intangible that everyone can welcome.</p>

I am confident <b>[it]</b> will be everything that everyone had asked or hoped for, and much more.<br /><br />This will be open to all on non-matchdays, providing a picturesque and uninterrupted stroll along the river for the first time ever. It will be here that you will find places to eat, drink, meet, exercise, learn new activities, take in special events or simply enjoy the waterfront. I envision a vibe that will blend nostalgia with contemporary, always alive, and always respectful of the club, neighbourhood and city<br /><br /><b>[He added the new construct would be]</b> Nothing less than a signature destination befitting our world-class city</p>
