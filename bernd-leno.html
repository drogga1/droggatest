  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> goalkeeper Bernd Leno says it is a scandal for this year’s Europa League final to be held in Baku, amid political hostilities between Azerbaijan and Armenia.

I’m just sorry for him <b>[Mkhitaryan]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[He added on calls to boycott the event]</b> The club wants the title, they want to go to the Champions League, and if <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> refuse, they would probably be excluded from <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>. That’s not so easy<br /><br />I have great respect for Petr, and we get along very well. He deserves all credit, and I treat him well, but it’s clear that I’m an athlete, I want to always play, especially in a final. To win the Europa League would be the first big title for me. We all want to hear the <b>[Champions League]</b> anthem again. The Thursday-Sunday rhythm is also not so good because you always suffer in the league. If we lose the final, our season, which was actually good, would be disappointing</p>

Because in the end that is the most important thing. The three players up top, with Pepe also there now, have unbelievable quality they can score the big chances but also score from nothing. The other teams always know and have to be aware that we have a lot of dangerous players and that gives us big confidence. You can see the game against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> we had one or two chances to score when it was 0-0 so we can score with our quality in that top three</p>

It’s not a big problem just because we conceded a goal, I had to stay positive and I thought after that I did a very good job<br /><br /><b>[When quizzed on whether he felt the England captain had dived, Leno remained coy]</b> I don’t know. I think from Kane and also from Sokratis it was maybe over-reacting from both, but that is normal in this game. Everybody was going crazy in the last few minutes. All the fans and players were crazy and the referee made the right decision. He just said that everyone should calm down. So it was okay</p>

It was too easy for them and they could go around our box. I don’t know why it was like that but everybody could see that we have to talk about this. In the first half it was better but not perfect. I think we have to be honest and analyse this game. We were lucky we didn’t lose. Everybody was angry and disappointed after <b>[the game]</b>. Everybody was emotional, very mad and crazy. But that is normal. The manager is a very positive guy. He said ‘calm down and then on Tuesday we analyse this game and then on Thursday we have another game’<br /><br /><b>[When asked about <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> allowing <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> 31 shots on goal]</b> I think many <b>[of those]</b> shots were from distance. <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> had many chances but sometimes they were shooting for a throw-in and you can’t count every shot. <b>[So]</b> 31 is like every three minutes, someone is shooting at our goal. It is a statistic but it is not ‘the truth’. For example, <a href="gerard-deulofeu.html">Deulofeu</a>, he shot 15 times from distance. Of course there were some dangerous shots but not every one<br /><br /><b>[Sokratis revealed that he apologised to his team-mates in the changing room immediately after the game for his error which allowed Tom Cleverley to make it 2-1 early in the second half]</b> It is still a process we have to work on. We try to take the risk because if we beat the press of <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>, then there is a lot of space for our strikers. In the first half, we did it very well but in the second we didn’t create too many chances from playing out from the back</p>

I remember the Champions League final in 2002 against my former club Bayer Leverkusen. He played amazingly and was only 18 years old.

Unfortunately, I’ve never played against him, but hopefully I will, or I will meet him. Maybe he can play again for <a href="porto-fc.html">Porto</a> when he comes back from his injury (Casillas suffered a heart attack in May), but hopefully one day I can meet him. If I only had one question that I could ask him, it would be ‘how have you managed to be so good?’<br /><br />It’s different and it’s much harder, I think having gained experience in both leagues. In the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, like in Europe, the referees protect the goalkeeper. In <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, they don’t.

He showed us some situations that we needed to be braver. We did this. It is a good feeling, we all missed the feeling. He was calm but in a very straight way. It was not like everyone was not trying, but you could feel that we did not play in a free way and he made us more free to play. You could see this more in the second half. After the second and the third goal you could see how we can play with more confidence. This is the real Arsenal</p>

At the moment we have to say there is a gap between <b>[the top]</b> teams. We have the quality but when you see the games we miss intensity, we are not fresh in our minds.

We play against all the top six. We have a lot of opportunities to win games against them. We still believe. It is in our hands. We have to show mentality, we have to play good football and I think then we will have opportunities. When we just speak about tactics or quality or what was in the past, it doesn’t matter. I think the only way is that we work hard, that we get back our strong mentality and then I think I am confident we can reach our target<br /><br />It was completely different to other games. We didn’t let them have chances, like Freddie <b>[<a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Ljungberg</a>]</b> said and the new manager.

I think this is the only way we can play<br /><br /><b>[<a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> spoke to the players before and after the match at Goodison Park]</b> He didn’t speak too much about quality or about tactics, he just said he wants to see players who run, who support their team-mates, who defend the goal or in general play as a team. I think this is the way he needs to push us and I think it was a good point that he pushed us on Saturday. We understood the message</p>

When you score in extra time and then you concede in the last minute it is always disappointing. Nobody could sleep very well after this disappointing night.

  <p><b>[Bernd Leno is refusing to give up on <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s bid for Champions League qualification]</b> I hope we can get into Europe. We’re not ruling out the Champions League places because we might get it with just fifth place, given <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>’s possible ban. We were in decent form before the break, I just hope we can get back to that when we return and end up in a European spot. It’s a great way to start because we have to go full throttle right from the off - they’re an absolutely top team. It’ll be strange to play again after such a long time out and with such little time to prepare, but I’m optimistic about the rest of the season<br /><br />Here in England it was a lot worse than in Germany. I was at home for nine weeks with my wife and my dogs and we had no contact with anyone. It really struck me how much I missed football, the atmosphere in the stadium and that boost of adrenaline you get from playing competitive football. I’m just thankful we can get going again next week.</p>

  <p><b>[Bernd Leno says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> players are idols and role models for equality]</b> We as players have so many people looking up to us as idols. We have to show, as <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, that we support you; it doesn’t matter if you are black or white, or what your religion is. It is sad in 2020 we are still discussing these things, but this is the reality and we have to keep pushing on this. It doesn’t matter if you are black or white, we have to respect each other and everybody should have the same chances in life<br /><br /><b>[Speaking ahead of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s return to <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> action on Wednesday against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> Everyone is getting more excited <b>[about the season beginning]</b>. I’m looking forward and probably everybody in the world is looking forward that <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> football is going back at least to something like normal. Everything will be new at the beginning with the match-day protocols. But it was the same with training and you get used to it. And we’re all glad we can do what we love and play football again. I’m sure that everything will go in a good way and that everything will go smoothly like in Germany. We as players have a good feeling that everything is safe<br /><br />We are prepared for the situation without the fans, we have worked during the break on our mindset and our leadership. We can surprise City because nobody has the rhythm. I’m sure we can have a good start. Mikel (Arteta) knows every player and he knows the manager better than anyone. I think Mikel will have a good game-plan and at this level we think we are a very good team</p>
