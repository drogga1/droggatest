I could see his ability. As a striker he’s got a little bit of everything. He can hit it, he’s got enough pace, he plays off his left, his right. He scores all types of goals. He has this little instinct to know where the ball will drop, which means he picks up positions. And that’s a bit of everything really.

England have had many great strikers over the years who have excelled in certain parts of the game but there is no chink at all in <a href="alan-shearer.html">Shearer</a>’s armour, even to the point of magnificent mental strength. He works so hard. He’s not afraid to put himself around physically and won’t be intimidated by aggressive tactics. He is a clever player, who is capable of understanding tactical instructions and then carrying them out, even if it means defensive duties. He is not just after the glory of scoring goals. You see him running to the wings, demanding the ball, searching for space, especially down the right, where he crosses the ball in as good as any winger in the game. Not only will Alan score from close in. He can <b>[score]</b> from outside the box, he takes free-kicks and he scores with his head, his right foot and his left foot. There are no real weaknesses</p>

There was too much speculation, too much going on and eventually <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> would have been snapped up<br /><br />How long <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a> and the board had been thinking of making a change, who knows, but eventually they had to move quickly with things moving quickly at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. So, while there were mixed feelings among <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fans at losing someone so well liked as <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>, the arrival of <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> would have given the supporters reason to believe he will deliver silverware at long last<br /><br />It might only be in the short term as <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> has moved on every two or three years but even so it is what the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fans crave - trophies. The club needs a trophy to move it to the next level. Yes, it was a shock to see <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> go after all he did for the club but, if he wants to stay in football, there looks like plenty of openings for him. In a way it wasn’t a surprise that <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a> was looking to someone like <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>. Hopefully he will achieve what the fans have been dreaming of. He has done it everywhere he has gone, so there will be optimism. If <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> does win silverware at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> it will prove to have been the right move at the right time for him to go to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>. It will also turn out to be a shrewd move for <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>, who will quickly discover that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> are a massive club - much bigger than he might have thought. He has probably underestimated just how big a club <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> are. There is a bigger fanbase than at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and no one now has better facilities in terms of training ground and stadium. He has walked into a fantastic job at the right time with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> becoming a modern-day club. This is a good marriage</p>

What makes it easier for him is that he’s not in the centre of the pitch where it’s all 360 degrees going on around him, he’s out wide. When he picks the ball up, nine times out of 10 he’s got nobody behind him but a linesman. He knows he’s got no pressure coming on him, everything is inside him.

I said it at half-time, they look like a team that are just hoping they’re going to play well, hoping they’ll get a break.

For me, Frank needs a clear transfer policy to take his team forward. He has been getting it right on the training pitch, on the football side, but the next big phase for him will be how the club operate in the transfer market. If Frank gets the players he wants, not the players someone else wants, he has an excellent chance, in two or three years’ time, of having the right squad and the right team to challenge for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have to treat Frank exactly the way <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> treated <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, give him the time to rebuild, give him the players he wants. He needs a clearly defined pathway, a clear line of communication, which I don’t think has always been the case in the past. If I was a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fan, I’d think their team is in the right hands, as Frank is doing an excellent job under the circumstances and the future will be bright.<br /><br />He only had one year at Derby and then took on a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> job with all the extra pressure that comes with it. Frank’s a legend at the club as a player and that brings even more extra pressure on you. It’s all right having a view now, but take us back to the start of the season. No one would have thought he would have done as well as he has done with such a big rebuilding project ahead of him and without any ability to move into the transfer market. You would have said he would do well to get <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> into the top six or even seven under those circumstances. Sitting where he is now, I don’t think anyone would have anticipated that. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are in good hands, the way they are playing, the way Frank has brought on the young players, while he is learning all the time about management in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.
