  <p><b>[Former Chelsea boss Glenn Hoddle has hailed Eden Hazard]</b> Given that Chelsea are so good as a unit, it’s hard to single out an individual, but Eden Hazard was outstanding on Saturday. When you play the big games, you want your big players to step up. That’s exactly what he did. The contrast with Mesut Ozil was unavoidable. The bigger the game, the better Hazard plays. For Ozil, despite his record as a World Cup winner and a La Liga champion at Real Madrid, you feel it’s the opposite.<br /><br />His goal was wonderful but throughout he was excellent. Antonio Conte praised his back-tracking and work for the team. But he has that magical ability to change a game. He beat Laurent Koscielny twice for his goal, and that’s a defender I rate highly. Once he has you face on, bearing down on goal, he can destroy the best defenders with his quick feet</p>

  <p><b>[Dele Alli has had an indifferent season]</b> I don’t think he’ll be worried about it. He’ll look to get on with his own job. It’s up to other people to assess what they’re looking for. Gareth Southgate will look for something different in the plan if he goes for one player and not another because it suits what he’s looking to do in the team. Dele Alli will just get on with his job and he’s a top threat. He’ll maintain getting into the penalty area and scoring goals. He’s had a slightly indifferent season, but he’s still affected the game. He will affect the game as he’s a box threat and he likes to score goals. He’s done that time and time again over the last few seasons and we forget how young he is. It’s great seeing two young English players playing well in that position. It’s such an important position nowadays in that role if they play the player in behind the striker. It’s not a free role, it’s the hub of the team. It comes with a difference to winning games and being the difference.</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli is a better option for England than Manchester United’s Jesse Lingard when on top of his game]</b> For Dele Alli’s own peace of mind, I hope he realises a little dip in form for a 21-year-old prospect is completely normal and he’ll learn more about himself as a player now than at any other time. It is easy when everything goes your way. How to shake off any negative vibes when things aren’t going so well is the difficult bit. It could be the making of Dele, and there are plenty of important matches left to win back his England starting place before the World Cup. I know he often plays as a No 10 for Spurs because of his relationship with Harry Kane, but the way Gareth Southgate seems to be setting up, I think he’d be best suited as one of three midfielders in a 3-5-2. It will take a certain amount of adjusting his game but won’t require anything he can’t do. And if you look at his rivals for the position - Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Adam Lallana, Jack Wilshere - he is a better goalscorer than any of them. An in-form Dele Alli is probably even better than Jesse Lingard in that regard.</p>

  <p><b>[England should be starting Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford over City rival Raheem Sterling]</b> I hope he plays with two up front. I’d love to see Rashford and <b>[Harry]</b> Kane. Sterling’s done great for his club but 19 games without scoring a goal as your second striker or main striker for England and the positions he picks up there are completely different for City. I would look at Rashford and Kane. That would scare the life out of any defence, those two. In world football, not many centre-backs are used to playing with two up against them. One with pace and one with strength and a bit of guile can do either. They’re used to playing one striker and it’s the full-backs that push on and I think we could cause them a few problems. Dele Alli would have to change his role a bit, he’s not going to be put in behind the one striker, he’d have to become that one of three in midfield and play slightly different but get in the box still.</p>

  <p><b>[Eden Hazard is absolutely crucial to Chelsea]</b> If keeping <b>[Antonio]</b> Conte may be beneficial to Chelsea, keeping Eden Hazard is absolutely crucial. He’s the most important person in the Chelsea dressing room going forward and the Cup final proved that. Hazard was excellent, even though I’ve seen him play better, he was able to get away from Ander Herrera and we saw the consequences when Phil Jones brought him down for the vital penalty. The biggest European clubs would have been watching. I know Barcelona look likely to sign Antoine Griezmann but you could see Hazard fitting in at Real Madrid. He isn’t Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo but for me he’s among the top five players in the world, he has that X-factor that causes danger every time he’s on the ball. If Gareth Bale leaves Madrid, you could see them wanting Hazard, and it’s vitally important Chelsea don’t allow that to happen and make the kind of signings that will want him to say. It’s even bigger than keeping Conte. The problem for Chelsea is that their current squad is not good enough to compete in the Champions League and Premier League. Manchester City can do it, Chelsea can’t, and that’s why you’ve had these seasons where the Premier League form is poor if they are in Europe.<br /><br />As a former Chelsea manager, I am very interested to see what Roman Abramovich and the club do next. It’s OK to let managers leave if they have been unsuccessful, but you can’t call Conte that. Maybe Chelsea think the pattern of changing managers without impacting on trophies will carry on. It’s a big call. Whoever the next manager is, there has to be a reshuffle in the squad. First of all, Hazard can’t be expected to provide the ‘Wow’ moments all on his own. And secondly, if recruitment is poor, he is going to wonder why he wants to stay at a club without Champions League football again. And on Saturday’s form, there will be no shortage of takers for the Belgian star. Ideally, Conte and Hazard might be at The Bridge next season. But Hazard has to be</p>

  <p><b>[Potential sales of Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli would be devastating for Tottenham]</b> I was a little bit anxious at the start of the season when the club didn’t go out and buy. But you have to trust the manager and so far he has insisted he’s happy with his squad. It would be devastating for the team to lose any of their players. I’m sure they will have a good run at it in the league and even the Champions League again. But to bond the team together even more you need to start picking up trophies<br /><br />At the beginning of the season I could see he was starting to improve a lot and it’s what I had expected. When he arrived he hadn’t had much game time with Paris Saint-Germain and didn’t look match fit, or sharp. But you could see he was a talent and capable of wonderful goals. Now he’s had more of a foundation in a solid pre-season, he can make an improvement in the team and will push Heung-min Son for a place. That is healthy, to have that competition</p>

  <p><b>[Glenn Hoddle believes that Jose Mourinho has lost the support of his players at Manchester United]</b> United look as though they are playing with chains on. To me, it seems 50 per cent of that group of players are not really chomping on the bit or enjoying their football. They’re not doing it for their manager. They should be doing it for themselves and the club, and if they like the manager and they do it for the manager as well that’s an added bonus, but I don’t see that at the moment<br /><br />I don’t see him turning it round. United have got to think very deeply how they are going to deal with this. They don’t want to sack him - he’s just signed a new contract!</p>

I do believe they’ve got a very good side and a great manager and they’re going forward, but at the moment they’ve just hit the buffers. Trophies are the number one for Tottenham. What’s the point of getting in the top four if you’re not good enough to get out of the group stages of the Champions League? I don’t get it. Players want to win things and, if that’s the FA Cup or League Cup, I think it’s a stepping stone. That would be a foundation to go and win something else, something bigger further down the line<br /><br />I feel they should have strengthened the squad in the summer for nights exactly like this when you get injuries and suspensions, these are the key games where you’ve got to go deep into your squad. And I think this game shows that the squad hasn’t got the depth Pochettino and Daniel Levy really believe it had. I think that was glaringly obvious</p>

Hazard is not in that category but how do Chelsea replace him, they can’t. I don’t see anyone out there who can do what Hazard does for Chelsea week in, week out. I can see him in a white shirt next season and really enjoying his football there. Next week against Liverpool, he’s going to have to almost play as a defender and you don’t get that in Spain. Personally, I hope he stays. He is enjoying his football at Chelsea because if he wasn’t playing in a team that passes the ball and move around he would have left already and I think that’s what’s pulling on his heartstrings a little bit. He really has to think ‘do I want to go and play for Real Madrid, one of the best teams in the world?’ He deserves to because he is a wonderful player.

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri has been accused of being the only person at Chelsea who does not know how to handle Eden Hazard]</b> Higuain looks as if he’s thinking about things before he’s even going to get a shot off. He’s a little bit slower than he was in yesteryear, he was a fantastic striker, don’t get me wrong. He looks like he should be in better shape than when he arrived, but for me he looks actually a little bit in less good shape, he looks as if he’s put a bit of weight on since he’s been here. Perhaps he’s been in the gym too much, I don’t know. But Giroud is class, and he gives Chelsea a focal point and allows Hazard to play off a focal point, which is important. Hazard shouldn’t be the one up there, I think everyone in this stadium knows that bar Sarri.<br /><br />Absolutely <b>[fans will be happy to see him out there]</b>, I just don’t get it, why would you put such a talented player with his back to play? Where centre-backs will come in and get him, midfielders who are holding are going to nip back get him. Why would you put him in those circumstances?<br /><br />Also at Anfield and certain other games, you need someone to hold the ball up for you. Consequently, Liverpool had too much for them. I don’t get it… they need a target man. You can’t play balls to Hazard, one of the best players in the world, like that. No one is going to be able to produce anything with service like that. In Chelsea’s game against Liverpool, Mohamed Salah capitalised on a Chelsea mistake and was able to score a wonderful goal. That’s where this wonder goal from Salah comes from, and that’s not Hazard’s fault, it’s the system and I don’t get it, I really don’t</p>

He deserves to play in that team. They’ve got a re-build going on as well. I personally would love to see him play in the Premier League but I’ve got a feeling he might move.

Can you fill it? Probably not. And it’s a real big concern for Chelsea at the moment. And that’s where I think they are at as a club, they’re at a crossroads. With their owner, the new stadium not coming, there’s a lot of players coming to the end of their contracts, the transfer embargo as well. All these things are not positive. The main thing they’ve got to do is switch off from that, win their last two games, get into that top four, or win the Europa League, they are still in a good position to win that. But I think they’ll end up in fourth spot</p>

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri’s handling of Eden Hazard continues to baffle former Chelsea manager Glenn Hoddle]</b> I really for the life of me can’t understand why you wouldn’t play your best player in this semi-final. They will only find out how important Hazard is after he is gone, unfortunately, because he is that good a player. But let’s face it, without him in the first half they were ordinary. What he does brilliantly is you can give him the ball and he will draw three players over to him and he can get you up the pitch. But he has goals in him and has got end product in there and around the penalty area. He is a danger. He has got everything going forward, possibly not all the time he doesn’t track back, but they will miss him. I actually think that he could be even better as a No. 10 with two holding midfield players behind him. You could then just say to him go and play and he might get that if he goes to Real Madrid, unfortunately</p>

There was too much speculation, too much going on and eventually <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> would have been snapped up<br /><br />How long <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a> and the board had been thinking of making a change, who knows, but eventually they had to move quickly with things moving quickly at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. So, while there were mixed feelings among <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fans at losing someone so well liked as <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>, the arrival of <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> would have given the supporters reason to believe he will deliver silverware at long last<br /><br />It might only be in the short term as <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> has moved on every two or three years but even so it is what the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fans crave - trophies. The club needs a trophy to move it to the next level. Yes, it was a shock to see <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> go after all he did for the club but, if he wants to stay in football, there looks like plenty of openings for him. In a way it wasn’t a surprise that <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a> was looking to someone like <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>. Hopefully he will achieve what the fans have been dreaming of. He has done it everywhere he has gone, so there will be optimism. If <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> does win silverware at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> it will prove to have been the right move at the right time for him to go to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>. It will also turn out to be a shrewd move for <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>, who will quickly discover that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> are a massive club - much bigger than he might have thought. He has probably underestimated just how big a club <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> are. There is a bigger fanbase than at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and no one now has better facilities in terms of training ground and stadium. He has walked into a fantastic job at the right time with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> becoming a modern-day club. This is a good marriage</p>

He’s got an array of talent like a midfield player, he can pick a pass like any midfield player. What makes it easier for him is that he’s not in the centre of the pitch where it’s all 360 degrees going on around him, he’s out wide. When he picks the ball up, nine times out of 10 he’s got nobody behind him but a linesman. He knows he’s got no pressure coming on him, everything is inside him. He can pass like <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a>, <a href="paul-scholes.html">Scholes</a>, <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a>.

I am a little bit <b>[worried]</b>. I don’t see a team pressing together, and I don’t see a team with good movement when they’ve got possession. You’ve got a problem there. And I think playing 4-4-2 in straight lines, there’s nothing wrong with it if you come off the lines and make a three in midfield and you have the strikers with the movement. I said it at half-time, they look like a team that are just hoping they’re going to play well, hoping they’ll get a break. I don’t see a team like Leipzig - they’ve got shape on the ball, they press, they knew both sides of the game, what they were all about, and you can see they were miles ahead of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> on the night</p>

Has he lost his self-belief? Only he would know that. I am hoping he hasn’t for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s sake, I really do. In a way, I think he does need to rebuild. Not in terms of just getting players, but he needs to rebuild that team in the way that he is going to put them out there or get them in a shape where he knows exactly what they are doing, every player, whoever comes from the bench<br /><br />I don’t know if it’s <b>[the game]</b> moved on and he hasn’t. Let’s be fair I don’t think the squad was as good as he thought it was going to be at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. He’s had his key players taken away from him so actually he’s got to do better with the players that he’s got. That is his problem at this moment in time. He hasn’t sort of pushed himself to the limits tactically to come up with something where he’s going to get the best out of this squad at this moment in time. That might come later down the line but he might need another transfer window to get some more players in that he wants. Whether the game’s moved on I’m not sure. I’ll tell you what I do worry as a <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> man, I do wonder whether he’s got self-doubts now which he’s never had in his career.

For me, Frank needs a clear transfer policy to take his team forward. He has been getting it right on the training pitch, on the football side, but the next big phase for him will be how the club operate in the transfer market. If Frank gets the players he wants, not the players someone else wants, he has an excellent chance, in two or three years’ time, of having the right squad and the right team to challenge for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have to treat Frank exactly the way <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> treated <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, give him the time to rebuild, give him the players he wants. He needs a clearly defined pathway, a clear line of communication, which I don’t think has always been the case in the past. If I was a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fan, I’d think their team is in the right hands, as Frank is doing an excellent job under the circumstances and the future will be bright.<br /><br />He only had one year at Derby and then took on a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> job with all the extra pressure that comes with it. Frank’s a legend at the club as a player and that brings even more extra pressure on you. It’s all right having a view now, but take us back to the start of the season. No one would have thought he would have done as well as he has done with such a big rebuilding project ahead of him and without any ability to move into the transfer market. You would have said he would do well to get <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> into the top six or even seven under those circumstances. Sitting where he is now, I don’t think anyone would have anticipated that. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are in good hands, the way they are playing, the way Frank has brought on the young players, while he is learning all the time about management in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Under all those considerations he is doing an amazing job. It was a shrewd move to bring in <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a> at Derby and then to take him with him to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. Together they are making the team stronger</p>
