<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Why do <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> wear red &amp; have they always had that colour for their home kit?]</b> We’d just finished training and I was on the way home when Shanks called me back. My initial reaction was that I’d done something wrong. Either that or I was getting a pay rise! Anyway, it was neither. ‘I want you to try on this all-red strip,’ he asked. So I went into the dressing room and put it on<br /><br /><b>[The switch paid off, with St John netting the opener after just 10 minutes with the game ending in a 3-0 home victory for the Reds]</b> I went home that night. I said to my wife Ness: ‘You know something… tonight I went out onto <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> and for the first time there was a glow like a fire was burning’. Our game against Anderlecht was a night of milestones. We wore the all-red strip for the first time. Christ, the players looked like giants. And we played like giants</p>
