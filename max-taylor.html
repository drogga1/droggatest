  <p><b>[<a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> includes youngster Max Taylor in <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> squad for Astana clash 12 months after cancer treatment]</b> Obviously, Ole has given quite a few of us the opportunity to travel with the team and, hopefully, a few of us will get a game. The position I was in this time last year, I was in my first few weeks where I had chemotherapy, I wouldn’t have thought, a year on, I’d be travelling with the first team. It doesn’t matter what the environment is like, just being out there is massive. It’s been a dream since I can remember ever kicking a ball - being a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> first-team player</p>

  <p><b>[Inspirational Max Taylor set for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> debut after winning cancer battle]</b> My first thought was: ‘Will I play football again?’ But then you get to the point when you’re by yourself, you can’t sleep and all you’re thinking is: ‘This could end my life’<br /><br /><b>[After further scans, though, it was revealed that Taylor had testicular cancer]</b> My mum broke down straight away. I was so taken aback I didn’t cry. I got out of the clinic and thought: ‘Oh my God’.<br /><br /><b>[However, he still had to undergo an operation because of swollen lymph nodes]</b> After the operation I spent five nights in hospital, with an epidural pump in my back and all these wires that were slowly taken out. I still felt ill. I was still bald. I would look in the mirror and think: ‘I do not look good’. It was a good three months before I started to feel right<br /><br /><b>[New boss <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> then invited him to watch the first team train]</b> It was a great way to come back, very uplifting. That was massive for me. I thought people might not remember<br /><br /><b>[Taylor said of his illness]</b> I don’t want it to define me</p>
