But the quality he has is not up for discussion. He is a player who can make a difference at all times. He is a different attacker, with his movement, and he is lethal one-on-one. It’s normal that it takes take for him to get back to his best. He arrived at Inter following a period without playing much at United. He has different skills, someone like him is always comfortable at a club like Inter<br /><br />I was with him in the hotel where he lived in Milan. For me he’s a great player, with a long career, especially with his national team, he’s very respected. He hasn’t been given the right time, he can’t play so little, he needs to stay on the pitch for several games, for ninety minutes. He needs time to go back to be the player he is. He needs two games to gain confidence, but he needs to do it whilst starting and playing the full game. I’d keep Alexis for another year at Inter. He’s a goal scorer, physically he’s very well and still has a lot to give. He’s a guy who has scored a lot of goals and will continue to do so.</p>

As a player, you had the feeling that you didn’t run much, although you did, because you were enjoying it. They are specific techniques for those of us who love good football. For me, football is feeling like you’re in a theatre, and seeing tiki-taka, passing the ball, it’s not the only way to win but it’s special. It’s Pep’s way.</p>
