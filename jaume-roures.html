  <p><b>[Jaume Roures says <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> could resume behind closed doors in July]</b> I hope football returns in July and I say July because, among other things, everyone’s health must be guaranteed. It will return without an audience, surely, but before that they have to do a pre-season. After so long at home, they can’t go out and play as if nothing happened<br /><br /><b>[While Roures believes it could resume in July, he warned a positive test for Covid-19 from a player after that would see the campaign ended]</b> If once <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> resumes a player tests positive for coronavirus, they will have to throw in the towel and say goodbye to the season</p>

  <p><b>[Jaume Roures, who is well versed in Spanish business, doesn’t believe the Catalan club have a chance of putting together the money required to re-sign <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>]</b> The club no longer has the economic capacity to spend <b>[…]</b> I don’t know how much. It’s impossible now. The crisis will affect the price of TV rights in one way or another. Likewise, paying players hundreds of millions of euros will be over. Firstly, because the clubs will no longer have the means, and secondly, because banks will not lend the clubs money with the same ease as before. This is all going to change and I think it’s very positive.</p>
