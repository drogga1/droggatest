<blockquote>
  <p>[Eduardo Berizzo believes the Copa America should be exclusive to nations from the Americas after guests Qatar secured a draw against Paraguay on Sunday] I think it would make sense to play a Copa America with teams from all the Americas. Are you asking me about invited nations, right? About Qatar and Japan? I think we should imagine a whole Copa America, with Central America and North America playing all the same tournament. I never saw Europe inviting any South American team to compete. Don’t take it wrong, maybe it sounds a little acidic today, just after playing against [Qatar]. But I firmly believe Copa America should be played by all the American teams in one tournament – <a href="concacaf.html">CONCACAF</a> and <a href="conmebol.html">CONMEBOL</a> together.<br /><br />This result disappoints us all, we all want to win, from the fan to the coach. We need to mind our rival, our reality, a lot of things that explains a lot about this situation. This is a new cycle for the team, there is no way I didn’t know Copa America was coming to this date, so I cannot make any excuse of it if we cannot play well, when we play well I will tell you we did it. Today we had a hard time finding the ball, especially in the middle of the field, and especially after being 2-0 up. If we would have this done, we should get another result</p>

  <p>[Eduardo Berizzo says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> must be stopped by a collective effort from Paraguay in Wednesday’s crunch Copa America clash] To annul a player like <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is not an individual task, it is a collective task. When you try to neutralise him, he opens the way [for others]. So the question is not centred only on him, but on the possibilities that are generated from him for other players<br /><br />[Paraguay’s late collapse against Qatar stung Berizzo and he wants to see a response from his players] We have talked about what happened and what we have to improve. That is control of the ball and [making sure] that the process of the match does not escape us depending on the result. We have to sustain the plan from beginning to end</p>
