  <p><b>[Celta have been rocked by the news that Chile midfielder Fabian Orellana has been separated from the squad due to a disciplinary matter]</b> The decision is based on an unacceptable lack of respect. I have handed my decision to the club and he has been separated from the squad. With me he won’t be part of the team again.</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Remiro was shocked to see his name removed from Athletic’s teamsheet for the start of the Liga season amid a dispute over his new contract]</b> As long as this is not resolved with peace and harmony we have decided not to call up <b>[Remiro]</b>. The club have learned from the past and do not want to see history repeated.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico encounters Paraguay team with similar style thanks to managers’ roots]</b> If I have to choose how to attack, I’d like to do it with possession of the ball, not sitting back and hoping to get the ball as well. You have to recover it, but I like to use possession to attack. I believe that if you dominate the ball, you dominate the game - and if you use it well with movement, imagination, you hurt the opponent. It’s an idea I believe in. Not everyone plays the same way, and all the ways of playing are valid.<br /><br />Gerardo, for example, also adheres to this idea. It’s a team that always bets on coming out to play for the respect of the game’s aesthetic and that’s where we find ourselves. Two similar styles will face each other, where always for one side or the other the balance tilts toward the good players, the players who connect with other good players and make a good team.</p>

  <p><b>[Eduardo Berizzo believes the Copa America should be exclusive to nations from the Americas after guests Qatar secured a draw against Paraguay on Sunday]</b> I think it would make sense to play a Copa America with teams from all the Americas. Are you asking me about invited nations, right? About Qatar and Japan? I think we should imagine a whole Copa America, with Central America and North America playing all the same tournament. I never saw Europe inviting any South American team to compete. Don’t take it wrong, maybe it sounds a little acidic today, just after playing against <b>[Qatar]</b>. But I firmly believe Copa America should be played by all the American teams in one tournament - <a href="concacaf.html">CONCACAF</a> and <a href="conmebol.html">CONMEBOL</a> together.<br /><br />This result disappoints us all, we all want to win, from the fan to the coach. We need to mind our rival, our reality, a lot of things that explains a lot about this situation. This is a new cycle for the team, there is no way I didn’t know Copa America was coming to this date, so I cannot make any excuse of it if we cannot play well, when we play well I will tell you we did it. Today we had a hard time finding the ball, especially in the middle of the field, and especially after being 2-0 up. If we would have this done, we should get another result</p>

  <p><b>[Eduardo Berizzo says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> must be stopped by a collective effort from Paraguay in Wednesday’s crunch Copa America clash]</b> To annul a player like <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is not an individual task, it is a collective task. When you try to neutralise him, he opens the way <b>[for others]</b>. So the question is not centred only on him, but on the possibilities that are generated from him for other players<br /><br /><b>[Paraguay’s late collapse against Qatar stung Berizzo and he wants to see a response from his players]</b> We have talked about what happened and what we have to improve. That is control of the ball and <b>[making sure]</b> that the process of the match does not escape us depending on the result. We have to sustain the plan from beginning to end</p>
