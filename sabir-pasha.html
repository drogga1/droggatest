<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Sabir Pasha, technical director of Chennaiyin FC’s youth development, said]</b> Since its inception, the club has done a great job in grassroots by reaching out to thousands of budding footballers in Tamil Nadu. However the time had come to go to the next level by starting fully functional teams in three age groups which will not only start the process of having a proper structure for the talent to flourish within the club but also give everybody involved with grassroots further incentive as boys would get to play competitive matches from a very young age. I would like to thank the owners for their vision and support in this regard and look forward to making this initiative grow further in the near future.</p>

  <p><b>[Chennaiyin FC sign six AIFF Elite Academy graduates]</b> They are all teenagers but at Chennaiyin FC age has never been a hindrance. The door is open to each one of them to stake a claim for the senior team. Our head coach John Gregory will be following their progress closely.</p>
