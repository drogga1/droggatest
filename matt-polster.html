<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Matt Polster’s right-back revelation has a central theme]</b> The message was like, ‘Hey, we would like to play you at right back and your role is not to be a right back,’ even though it’s kind of weird saying that. They wanted me to play my style at the right-back position, which is to play center mid - be good on the ball, take players on and find passes through lines. They just kind of let me play my own role in that type of position<br /><br /><b>[Polster credits the coaching staff with giving him the confidence to make the move without fighting against his natural instincts]</b> And I feel like that’s what I’ve done. I’ve tried to make runs in behind and I’ve tried to help defensively as much as I can, and then also just find good passes and try and break pressure - just as a center midfielder would do as well<br /><br />I think <b>[Schweinsteiger]</b> helped me quite a bit in terms of what he wants from me in certain moments of the game. And I think Dax has done the same as well as he’s like, ‘Hey, in this moment, we could try this.’ And Basti has also given me the license, per say, to go forward and take guys on<br /><br />It felt good. I actually didn’t expect it because of coming back from an injury so quickly. But it was an honor to be named to that list but I still have aspirations and goals to not just be on the list but be a part of the national team at some point in my career</p>
