  <p><b>[<a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> sign <a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a> winger Daniel Podence in £17m deal]</b> I’m very excited. It was always a childhood dream of mine to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and I look at this achievement as a dream come true. <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> are a team with a big project, with ambitious goals to look forward to, where I’ll get to meet former team-mates with whom I had the pleasure to play with in the past and I hope to be very successful here. My individual goals are to play as much as possible, help the team with goals and assists and collectively, I’d like to qualify for the Champions League. That is a goal that’s within our reach, and I hope we can have a better season than last year<br /><br />Thank you <a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a>, Thank you Greece! From the bottom of my heart, I depart with mixed emotions. The feeling of gratitude and happiness for having represented this huge European club, the biggest in Greece. I’ll be eternally grateful and carry each one of you with me.<br /><br />My special thanks to President <a href="evangelos-marinakis.html">Marinakis</a> for the effort he made to have me and for letting me follow my dream of playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. To Mister <a href="pedro-martins.html">Pedro Martins</a> for all the trust he had in me and all he taught me! I’ll carry for all my life the impressive derbies I’ve played, the unparalleled support I’ve received, the unique life of Athens and the greatness of <a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a>. I lack the words to express all I feel for the last year and a half I spent here, but I feel the tears I’ve shed speak for themselves. May this be a see you soon</p>
