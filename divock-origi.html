Everybody’s very hungry and we have one goal in common, and that’s to finish in the highest spot possible in the league. We’re on a good way and we have to continue<br /><br />I’m very good, I’m very fit. I feel even better than last year. For me it is just giving everything for every minute that I get. I want to do everything to get in the team. The coach has several choices and that is only good for the team. The team is most important and we have to finish strong. I hope I can play a big part in the end of the season. I’m very ambitious and I believe in my qualities. Like I say, I’m ready and ready now to do whatever. But you have to put everything in and show it on the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool’s Divock Origi has compared himself to a NFL wide receiver and Philippe Coutinho to a talismanic quarterback]</b> If there was a wide receiver that’d be me - pace, strength and finishing skills. We have a lot of tactics at Liverpool, but I think the NFL have even more. They study tactics a little bit differently! Klopp focuses a lot on tactics, it’s important of course. But in this game he puts an accent on playing on our intuition and just enjoying the game. You have to have a good mix.<br /><br />If there was one player I wouldn’t want to be tackled by, it’d be Dejan Lovren. He’s very aggressive and makes some dangerous tackles. If I was to compare an English football player and an American football player, I think the American player would be stronger but the English player would be quicker</p>

He’s there in the big moments and for me, he’s a joy to play with.<br /><br /><b>[On Daniel Sturridge]</b> Daniel, as well, is a big talent and of course he has experience.

I’m confident in my qualities and I’m confident in the group - it’s only a good thing that we have so many top players. I enjoy playing with quality players. For me, I just have to enjoy my own game and do my thing as it’s what I can control.<br /><br />I think I learned a lot, because it was a special situation with a big club having no European competitions.

Of course I am ambitious and I want to play as much as possible but the most important thing is our team and the team goals..<br /><br /><b>[Origi has said of his positional switches]</b> I loved that role. Even in the youth teams, I used to play up front and on the wing so I’m comfortable in both positions. People have maybe seen me more up front in the last couple of years but I totally love it on the wing as well. I enjoyed linking up with Sadio <b>[Mane]</b> and Mo <b>[Salah against Watford]</b> but of course they are top players which makes it easier for me and I think it was just about having fun. Being an offensive player, I like it when I have space in front of me. That’s always good and I think we turned in a really good performance that night</p>
