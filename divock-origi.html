  <p><b>[Divock Origi always believed he was capable of taking the ‘next step’ at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> My job was to shine my light and enjoy my game. I’m somebody who loves the game, is passionate about the game and loves to express himself in the game. Whenever I do that, good things happen. Trying to help the team as much as possible. I knew it was going to be an important season for the club, and for me as well, and I just wanted to make that next step. When I came back - obviously I was away for a year - I saw the group had made another step. We recruited some top players and I felt like we had a lot of quality, and experience as well. We were a bit older. I knew it was going to be a special season.<br /><br /><b>[Origi said of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>]</b> They have a super team. We played against them a couple of times and we know they have danger from all angles, which makes the game so beautiful. It’s going to be a special game for us. We have a lot of respect for them but we also know we have a very good team. We have big qualities and, above everything, we’ll play with a big heart. It will be a mountain to climb for us - but a good mountain. With preparation and training, we’ll feel confident for the game</p>

  <p><b>[Divock Origi is unsure what the future holds for him at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Quizzed on the possibility of landing fresh terms]</b> That’s a good question for the coach or the club.<br /><br />I’m ready to play whatever role the coach wants me to play. Everyone is excited for this final and, personally, I’ll be as fit and as ready mentally as possible to do whatever I can do<br /><br />In a big club like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> there is always going to be big expectations. But as a professional you have to close that off, it’s important to stay focused on the right things. I’ve experienced finals like these from the outside. There are a lot of talks going on, which make it good for a final, but it’s something as a player you need to cut yourself off from</p>

  <p><b>[Divock Origi has confirmed he will hold talks with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> over his future in the next few weeks]</b> The next few weeks we’ll have to sit down and see what the future holds. For now I just want to focus on these last few games <b>[with Belgium]</b> and then see after that. I want to speak to the club and my people internally before going public but hopefully the talks between me, the club and my people will be positive.<br /><br /><b>[Origi says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> will be determined to be crowned champions of England when they return for pre-season]</b> It’s a big goal which we want to make steps towards. This year’s experience and the Champions League win will help us and it would be nice to win it. But also let’s just enjoy what we have done <b>[winning the Champions League]</b> and then reset some goals ready for next season</p>

  <p><b>[Divock Origi has said a gut feeling caused him to turn down a move to <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> in January of last year to stay and fight for his <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> place]</b> It was a gut feeling. For me I just sat down and I felt like I wanted to stay and help this team. I felt good, I just had to keep performing in training and I knew my chance would come. I felt like we could do something special. I just had to block everything out and focus on the right things. In football you never know 100 per cent, it could have gone another way but that’s the choice I made. It’s a lot to happen in a year. And that’s the beauty of football. You can see that I am back focusing on performing. Has Madrid changed the direction of my career? Yes definitely, it was a great experience. Winning the Champions League is a boy’s dream so it changes a lot in a player’s career. I am trying to be as fit as possible and just perform. I feel positive, I feel good, there is a high vibration going around <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and I think we need to use it in a good way. There might be some difficult moments in the future, as there might be some good moments, I am just preparing for the best</p>

<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> manager <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> has said that Divock Origi is like a new signing after the 24-year-old forward signed a new long-term deal at Anfield</p>

  <p><b>[Divock Origi is confident he still has more to offer <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> For me, the contract was a logical and good decision. The club always showed faith. We had some good conversations and everything just clicked, so it was very easy. You have to listen to your instinct. I felt appreciated and I felt like I could make further steps at this club. I still have a lot to give and to show here. This is such a young, talented group and it feels like Madrid was just the beginning. We are hungry for more. I saw that hunger from the moment I returned in July<br /><br /><b>[Origi’s strike against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> gave him a place in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> history]</b> The respect of the fans is always nice to have. I am humbled that they have such a place in their hearts for me. To be part of the history of a club like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is something to be proud of and something I always wanted. I always saw myself playing for a big team in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and being important there. After my career, I’ll be able to sit back and enjoy what I’ve achieved. But for now, it’s about performing more and more<br /><br /><b>[Origi acknowledges he is still adjusting to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s tactical demands]</b> I think I’m a different player now compared to when I first signed. I feel like I’ve grown more mentally, personally and on the pitch. The team has evolved in terms of the way we play and now I understand the tactics part of the game better - how to press, how to choose my moments, when to express my creativity and when to play it simple. I have a lot of aspects to my game but I need to synchronise them with the game of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I study the game better now. Being able to play in different positions up front has been very important to me</p>

To be clear, the image used perpetuated a racist stereotype. This is completely unacceptable. We acted swiftly to have the banner removed and we are now working with the local authorities and stadium team in Genk to identify those responsible.

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> striker Divock Origi rates <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> goal above Champions League strikes]</b> <b>[My favourite goal is]</b> definitely the <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> one - minute ninety plus six. I remember going into the airport in Manchester. There was an <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> fan on border control, and he said to me, ‘I’m not going to let you in’. I was like: ‘What?’ It was all good, friendly banter. It’s the goal they speak about most in the city. It’s amazing. I love it. It shows the heart of the supporters. It’s <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, you know. I see <b>[the winner against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> on Instagram. <b>[No clips on my phone]</b>, no. I like to visualise it. If I want to relive something, I close my eyes, go in silence and I can see it again. People ask me about my favourite goal and I say it is not easy to choose. The derby goal was a very different emotion than scoring in the final. I put it in a bank of experience<br /><br /><b>[Origi reveals that he is grateful to have been involved in so many significant moments in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s rich history]</b> It is good for the storytelling. That is what people say. More and more I realise how grateful I am to be in such a team in such an era. Maybe at the end of my career I can say I shone my best light to help this team</p>

That text never went through, but in my head I said ‘we’, as if I was in it. I don’t even know if the manager knows, but the text never went through. In the end I came back and ended up scoring in the final, so that was quite symbolic. Maybe it was fate, definitely</p>

  <p><b>[Divock Origi on <a href="neco-williams.html">Neco Williams</a>]</b> That’s Neco. He’s very consistent in his behaviours, he doesn’t get too influenced by things that happen in games, good or bad. He keeps his focus really well. And though he always hid it well away from the pitch, where he could be very quiet and reserved, he’s got massive self-belief. He believes he’s good enough, and that can be seen in the way he plays</p>

I saw their facial expressions. It is a feeling that is very difficult to explain. <b>[Andy]</b> Robertson jumped on my back, <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a> joined and Virgil <b>[Van Dijk]</b>. Unbelievable. The more days pass, the more I can enjoy it. It’s like wine, it matures with time</p>
