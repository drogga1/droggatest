  <p><b>[Divock Origi has admitted that he is open to a permanent transfer from Liverpool to Wolfsburg]</b> I take that as a compliment that the club rates me. Several factors play a role. I am someone who is enjoying the moment. I think everything’s possible. I focus on the here and now. I have a good relationship with Liverpool but feel really well here at Wolfsburg. We’ll sit down at the end of the season, and talk we’ll see what’s next. Right now, I am here for another six months, and I am open for everything</p>

It’s a special moment for the club and city, and I’m enjoying that. It was just instinct. I tried to be sharp and in the end Virgil gave a nice assist! I just want to try to help the team, and I’m happy that I could do that today.</p>

  <p><b>[Origi reveals what Klopp told him before derby winner]</b> It was special. Always with a derby it is a good feeling to win, and especially to keep our stride going and score the goal is special, I am happy. I always just try to focus on what I can control and that was just training well and shining my light. I just to try to play my game, whatever role it is. It’s on the pitch you have to do your talking and it is the coach who makes the decisions so the best I can do is show my best form. Whatever minutes I got, I had to make the most of. Thank God it turned out well!<br /><br />His instructions? Go and get us a goal, Divock. Basically! He said to just to play my game and playing like I was training. I was feeling good, I kept in shape so in the end, I could do that and it turned out well<br /><br />I think was like a trap for a striker. You miss a chance and you keep dwelling on it. But for me, instantly, it was like you could see my reaction was ‘no, I just have to focus, chill, play my game and see whatever happens’ and thankfully the big man <b>[Virgil van Dijk]</b> had another effort and I could tap it in so I’m happy. It was a crucial goal, one of the most crucial I have scored for Liverpool so it was special, you could see the emotion of the fans and the coach and the players so we celebrated all together. It is a good day for Liverpool</p>

  <p><b>[From the shadows to the spotlight: Liverpool hero Divock Origi’s long road to redemption]</b> It was a learning season for me. I learned a lot mentally and grew a lot. I think I’ve come back more mature. The aim, he said, was “getting fit, getting back into my rhythm as soon as I can and hopefully scoring as many goals as possible.<br /><br /><b>[Fluent in four languages]</b> I get my friends to do personality tests and see what type they resemble. At Liverpool, I can say who is an introvert and who is an extrovert</p>

  <p><b>[Origi willing to play anywhere for Liverpool after earning another chance under Klopp]</b> It is a squad game and, like I have always said, I try to shine my light whenever I get my opportunity. I focus on what I can do to help the team in whatever capacity that is. I just have to stay positive. I know that we have big goals so whatever role I am asked to play, I am happy to do that. Of course I am ambitious and I want to play as much as possible but the most important thing is our team and the team goals..<br /><br /><b>[Origi has said of his positional switches]</b> I loved that role. Even in the youth teams, I used to play up front and on the wing so I’m comfortable in both positions. People have maybe seen me more up front in the last couple of years but I totally love it on the wing as well. I enjoyed linking up with Sadio <b>[Mane]</b> and Mo <b>[Salah against Watford]</b> but of course they are top players which makes it easier for me and I think it was just about having fun. Being an offensive player, I like it when I have space in front of me. That’s always good and I think we turned in a really good performance that night</p>

We just had to fight for the three points.<br /><br />It’s a lot of emotion but we have to control it. It’s very exciting, it’s a special season but we want to finish it in style.

We have not seen the manager, but with my teammates, we were so happy. It’s special, it’s difficult to describe with words. We <b>[played]</b> our usual 4-3-3 but we knew that today we had to take risks, play with our heart. Everyone had to be attentive and we did it. We have a lot of respect for this team but it is the mentality that made the difference. On the fourth goal, I knew that everyone was tired. These are things that have been done all year round in training. I had some great nights in my career but today, it’s fantastic</p>

  <p><b>[Divock Origi always believed he was capable of taking the ‘next step’ at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> My job was to shine my light and enjoy my game. I’m somebody who loves the game, is passionate about the game and loves to express himself in the game. Whenever I do that, good things happen. Trying to help the team as much as possible. I knew it was going to be an important season for the club, and for me as well, and I just wanted to make that next step. When I came back - obviously I was away for a year - I saw the group had made another step. We recruited some top players and I felt like we had a lot of quality, and experience as well. We were a bit older. I knew it was going to be a special season.<br /><br /><b>[Origi said of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>]</b> They have a super team. We played against them a couple of times and we know they have danger from all angles, which makes the game so beautiful. It’s going to be a special game for us. We have a lot of respect for them but we also know we have a very good team. We have big qualities and, above everything, we’ll play with a big heart. It will be a mountain to climb for us - but a good mountain. With preparation and training, we’ll feel confident for the game</p>

Everyone is excited for this final and, personally, I’ll be as fit and as ready mentally as possible to do whatever I can do<br /><br />In a big club like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> there is always going to be big expectations. But as a professional you have to close that off, it’s important to stay focused on the right things. I’ve experienced finals like these from the outside.

I want to speak to the club and my people internally before going public but hopefully the talks between me, the club and my people will be positive.<br /><br /><b>[Origi says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> will be determined to be crowned champions of England when they return for pre-season]</b> It’s a big goal which we want to make steps towards.

For me I just sat down and I felt like I wanted to stay and help this team. I felt good, I just had to keep performing in training and I knew my chance would come. I felt like we could do something special. I just had to block everything out and focus on the right things. In football you never know 100 per cent, it could have gone another way but that’s the choice I made. It’s a lot to happen in a year. And that’s the beauty of football. You can see that I am back focusing on performing. Has Madrid changed the direction of my career? Yes definitely, it was a great experience. Winning the Champions League is a boy’s dream so it changes a lot in a player’s career. I am trying to be as fit as possible and just perform. I feel positive, I feel good, there is a high vibration going around <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and I think we need to use it in a good way. There might be some difficult moments in the future, as there might be some good moments, I am just preparing for the best</p>

  <p><b>[Divock Origi is confident he still has more to offer <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> For me, the contract was a logical and good decision. The club always showed faith. We had some good conversations and everything just clicked, so it was very easy. You have to listen to your instinct. I felt appreciated and I felt like I could make further steps at this club. I still have a lot to give and to show here. This is such a young, talented group and it feels like Madrid was just the beginning. We are hungry for more. I saw that hunger from the moment I returned in July<br /><br /><b>[Origi’s strike against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> gave him a place in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> history]</b> The respect of the fans is always nice to have. I am humbled that they have such a place in their hearts for me. To be part of the history of a club like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is something to be proud of and something I always wanted. I always saw myself playing for a big team in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and being important there. After my career, I’ll be able to sit back and enjoy what I’ve achieved. But for now, it’s about performing more and more<br /><br /><b>[Origi acknowledges he is still adjusting to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s tactical demands]</b> I think I’m a different player now compared to when I first signed. I feel like I’ve grown more mentally, personally and on the pitch. The team has evolved in terms of the way we play and now I understand the tactics part of the game better - how to press, how to choose my moments, when to express my creativity and when to play it simple. I have a lot of aspects to my game but I need to synchronise them with the game of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I study the game better now. Being able to play in different positions up front has been very important to me</p>
