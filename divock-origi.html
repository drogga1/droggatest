  <p><b>[Divock Origi has said a gut feeling caused him to turn down a move to <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> in January of last year to stay and fight for his <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> place]</b> It was a gut feeling. For me I just sat down and I felt like I wanted to stay and help this team. I felt good, I just had to keep performing in training and I knew my chance would come. I felt like we could do something special. I just had to block everything out and focus on the right things. In football you never know 100 per cent, it could have gone another way but that’s the choice I made. It’s a lot to happen in a year. And that’s the beauty of football. You can see that I am back focusing on performing. Has Madrid changed the direction of my career? Yes definitely, it was a great experience. Winning the Champions League is a boy’s dream so it changes a lot in a player’s career. I am trying to be as fit as possible and just perform. I feel positive, I feel good, there is a high vibration going around <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and I think we need to use it in a good way. There might be some difficult moments in the future, as there might be some good moments, I am just preparing for the best</p>

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has said that Divock Origi is like a new signing after the 24-year-old forward signed a new long-term deal at Anfield</p>

  <p><b>[Divock Origi is confident he still has more to offer Liverpool]</b> For me, the contract was a logical and good decision. The club always showed faith. We had some good conversations and everything just clicked, so it was very easy. You have to listen to your instinct. I felt appreciated and I felt like I could make further steps at this club. I still have a lot to give and to show here. This is such a young, talented group and it feels like Madrid was just the beginning. We are hungry for more. I saw that hunger from the moment I returned in July<br /><br /><b>[Origi’s strike against Spurs gave him a place in Liverpool history]</b> The respect of the fans is always nice to have. I am humbled that they have such a place in their hearts for me. To be part of the history of a club like Liverpool is something to be proud of and something I always wanted. I always saw myself playing for a big team in the Premier League and being important there. After my career, I’ll be able to sit back and enjoy what I’ve achieved. But for now, it’s about performing more and more<br /><br /><b>[Origi acknowledges he is still adjusting to Liverpool’s tactical demands]</b> I think I’m a different player now compared to when I first signed. I feel like I’ve grown more mentally, personally and on the pitch. The team has evolved in terms of the way we play and now I understand the tactics part of the game better - how to press, how to choose my moments, when to express my creativity and when to play it simple. I have a lot of aspects to my game but I need to synchronise them with the game of Liverpool. I study the game better now. Being able to play in different positions up front has been very important to me</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool vow to take action against fans after racist Divock Origi banner displayed at Genk]</b> <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club condemns the offensive banner displayed in our section of the ground, prior to kick off. To be clear, the image used perpetuated a racist stereotype. This is completely unacceptable. We acted swiftly to have the banner removed and we are now working with the local authorities and stadium team in Genk to identify those responsible. Any subsequent action will be taken in keeping with our sanctions process</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool striker Divock Origi rates <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> goal above Champions League strikes]</b> <b>[My favourite goal is]</b> definitely the <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> one - minute ninety plus six. I remember going into the airport in Manchester. There was an <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> fan on border control, and he said to me, ‘I’m not going to let you in’. I was like: ‘What?’ It was all good, friendly banter. It’s the goal they speak about most in the city. It’s amazing. I love it. It shows the heart of the supporters. It’s <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, you know. I see <b>[the winner against Barcelona]</b> on Instagram. <b>[No clips on my phone]</b>, no. I like to visualise it. If I want to relive something, I close my eyes, go in silence and I can see it again. People ask me about my favourite goal and I say it is not easy to choose. The derby goal was a very different emotion than scoring in the final. I put it in a bank of experience<br /><br /><b>[Origi reveals that he is grateful to have been involved in so many significant moments in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s rich history]</b> It is good for the storytelling. That is what people say. More and more I realise how grateful I am to be in such a team in such an era. Maybe at the end of my career I can say I shone my best light to help this team</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool forward Divock Origi tells about his experience of watching the 2018 <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Champions League final on a TV in the Dominican Republic only to go on and score in the final 12 months later]</b> I didn’t want to say many words, but used the bicep emoji to say ‘keep strong, keep on going’ and I said ‘we are going to be back next season’. That text never went through, but in my head I said ‘we’, as if I was in it. I don’t even know if the manager knows, but the text never went through. In the end I came back and ended up scoring in the final, so that was quite symbolic. Maybe it was fate, definitely</p>

  <p><b>[Divock Origi on Neco Williams]</b> That’s Neco. He’s very consistent in his behaviours, he doesn’t get too influenced by things that happen in games, good or bad. He keeps his focus really well. And though he always hid it well away from the pitch, where he could be very quiet and reserved, he’s got massive self-belief. He believes he’s good enough, and that can be seen in the way he plays</p>

  <p><b>[Divock Origi says he is improving under <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and not interested in move]</b> I am a better player than last year. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has given me the space to develop myself. I always listen to my instinct and continue to work. We have spoken with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and we have a nice course ahead of us. I just want to get better here. It is a project for me and I want to follow it. I don’t know how long I will do that. I feel that I am making progress, so it was a pity that the season stopped <b>[due to coronavirus]</b><br /><br /><b>[Origi continues to revel in his goal against Spurs]</b> I was able to connect with the supporters. I saw their facial expressions. It is a feeling that is very difficult to explain. <b>[Andy]</b> Robertson jumped on my back, <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a> joined and Virgil <b>[Van Dijk]</b>. Unbelievable. The more days pass, the more I can enjoy it. It’s like wine, it matures with time</p>
