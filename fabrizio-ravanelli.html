  <p><b>[Fabrizio Ravanelli says that it is his dream	to become the Middlesbrough manager]</b> One day it’s my dream to come back to Middlesbrough as manager. Aitor Karanka is a fantastic manager, but if he one day he leaves, Steve, call me. Every one of the Middlesbrough fans is in my heart. I wish the maximum for the Middlesbrough team and the club. I love Middlesbrough.</p>

  <p><b>[Fabrizio Ravanelli considers former Juventus team-mate Antonio Conte to be a maniacal coach]</b> I was at Cobham a month ago to see Antonio and he is a maniacal coach. He is a fantastic manager and every player at Chelsea is in touch with what he is doing. Before he was a manager he was a big man, he always talks to you face to face, and when you are a fantastic man it is easy to be a fantastic manager. He won everything as a player and he always had a strong personality, and that’s important when you are a manager. With Antonio, it’s important to be professional in everything, in training and on the pitch.<br /><br /><b>[Ravanelli believes Conte’s methods will deliver tangible reward]</b> Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City are a little behind Chelsea, and they are strong in attack and at the back. Being strong at the back is very important in the Premier League and I think they will win it</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> legend Fabrizio Ravanelli has ‘big dream’ to manage <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> champions]</b> It is normal that my goal is to become a coach. Because I know my qualities and I know football well. I think I was a player who had the opportunity to be trained by great coaches. My experience can help me do this job. The two years I was coach at Ajaccio and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> Kiev, there were always problems in the clubs. And that did not allow me to set up my ideas. I hope soon to receive a nice proposal who could make me really start my career as a coach. My big dream is still to coach <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. One day, to become the coach of Juventus<br /><br />I have been supporting <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> since I was born, the day I received the <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> jersey for Christmas when I was a child, I started to support <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. To one day wear the jersey of <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> was the biggest dream of my life because <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> still is a school of life for me. It’s a very professional club, it’s a club that has an exceptional mentality. It’s not just a club that helps you become a great player, but especially helps you to become a man. In the dressing room of <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, I changed next to great men. Because at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, before being a great player you must be a great man. It’s something that has marked me, especially because I arrived very young, I was 23 years old and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> allowed me to become a man right away. I realised that life always has surprises for you and that made me understand that in life one must always make many sacrifices to achieve his ends</p>

  <p><b>[Fabrizio Ravanelli has said that he will try to sign <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Gonzalo Higuain</a> from <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> if <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> appoint him as sporting director]</b> Would he come? I don’t know! He could be an important player for OM in the Champions League. It’s possible that he will leave <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>. He’s 32 and there is also a chance that a deal could be done as a loan.<br /><br />I’m convinced I can sign players who will capture the imagination of the Velodrome. Despite not having been a sporting director, I’ve got many contacts at very big clubs. And if OM has no money to sign players, why would Fabrizio, with loans, not be able to bring important players to <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a>?<br /><br /><b>[Meanwhile, Ravanelli is happy to let the club make the first move]</b> I will not call <a href="jacques-henri-eyraud.html">Jacques-Henri Eyraud</a>. I met him during the inauguration of the new Stade Velodrome. We spoke at the time. I’ve not contacted him. He has a lot of things to do but he knows that I want to come back to <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> to work for OM and he knows that I am available to the club</p>
