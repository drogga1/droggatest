  <p><b>[Mike Summerbee has been impressed with John Stones’ start to life at Manchester City this season]</b> John Stones has done remarkably well. He’s a young man, it’s a big responsibility playing in that position. I like him on the ball. He picks the ball up and if there’s 20 yards in front of him he’ll go into that place, which will commit an inside forward or a midfielder to go into him. Then he’ll lay the ball off and he does that very well.<br /><br />I like anybody with confidence who can control the ball and beat people. It’s the footballing world now, everybody has to be able to play. In my day, we had full-backs who kicked wingers, you had centre-halves who won the ball in the air and the skilful people were the inside forwards and they created situations. Now, everybody in the entire Premier League tries to play football.</p>

  <p><b>[Mike Summerbee believes that Antonio Conte could have the edge in the title race given that there is no Champions League or Europa League participation for his side]</b> I think we’re talking a little bit prematurely about title races, it’s very early days. But Chelsea have come out and they’re doing very, very well under this new manager. But what we have to look at as well is that they’re not in the Champions League. From one week to another… when they come into the FA Cup, fair enough, but the Champions League is very demanding and we’re in that.<br /><br />It does help a side like Chelsea, with a new manager, to not be in the Champions League and look forward to one game a week to lift the side. For us it’s very different, playing game after game after game. Being in the Champions League is fantastic. I’m not saying anything against it but it is an advantage for a side not in the Champions League challenging for a top-four place.<br /><br /><b>[On Pep Guardiola]</b> The first thing that you see is that he’s a gentleman, he’s a nice man, he’s hands on. When they’re training and they’re practicing he’s on the pitch with them going through different situations with them and you can see the players responding. Every day is a different day. They’re training and they do things differently, which keeps the mind focused.<br /><br />He’s very much a person I admire. I watched him as a manager when he was at Bayern Munich and at Barcelona. You can’t do anything else but admire a man who can make teams play that way and entertain that way. The change he’s brought to Manchester City has been really automatic. It’s not as if it’s taken over a period of time; he’s done it in a short period of time. There’s a long way to go, he probably wants to do more with the squad of players and enlighten them more into how he wants to play but, at the moment, he’s playing a good system.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City are on the verge of doing something special]</b> We’re on the verge of doing something special. It’s a special squad, that was proved last season. We’ve got a fantastic squad of players. I watch it and stand there in awe of the players. Right the way through the whole squad, they can play, control the ball, pass the ball, it’s as simple as that. They play entertaining football and that’s what football is about. They could do <b>[win all four trophies]</b> but at the moment they’re on the verge of doing it. It’s a situation where they’re on the verge of being able to complete what they’re wanting to complete. We’ve got a squad of players who can do it but it’s going to be very, very difficult. It’s not easy<br /><br /><b>[On Pep Guardiola]</b> He’s an amazing man. He lives and eats football. The only thing he doesn’t do is play anymore. He’s very clever and astute</p>
