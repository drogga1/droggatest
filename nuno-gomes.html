  <p><b>[Ronaldo vs Ronaldo: Real Madrid stars past and present both phenomenons]</b> I played against one who was one of the best ever, the Ronaldo phenomenon. His qualities were simply so impressive. I believe I have never seen a player like him in that position again. I played with Cristiano Ronaldo too, and I compare them a lot, despite the different physical and positioning issues. I saw things in Cristiano that I also saw in Ronaldo - explosion, speed dribbling. Ronaldo is one of the best of them all.<br /><br /><b>[On Renato Sanches]</b> I do not know if Bayern Munich was the best choice. But that is easy to say now. Renato did not do well in Germany, although I believe he can still play well at Bayern Munich. Despite being a great player, having been national champion with Benfica and in Europe with the Portuguese national team, we are talking about a player of only 20 years. These things can happen. The rise of Renato Sanches was very fast. I remember seeing him in the same season playing for the juniors and two weeks later being in team B, then another two weeks later making a debut in the main team, 15 days later playing a Champions League match, a few months later in the Portuguese team, then champion of Europe, then negotiating with Bayern. In the space of nine months everything changed. It’s not easy. Today we can say: ‘Oh, if he had stayed another season at Benfica then things would be better’. That’s probably true. Playing two consecutive years in the Portuguese league better prepares players for other, more demanding challenges. But the offer arrived and Benfica could not refuse. Today Swansea is a good option for him. In football, sometimes it is better to take a step back and then take two steps forward</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City’s Ederson is already one of the top three goalkeepers in the world]</b> Ederson is already one of the top three goalkeepers in the world. He may already be the best in the world, and much of that is down to his humility. I hope in that sense that he never changes. He also has a lot of work focus. He felt early in his career that nothing can be achieved without work, and he had a difficult time in Portugal. He only got to where he is now because of hard work, maintaining focus and giving even more than others do. He has already reached such a high level, but he can be even greater because he continues working in the same way. He knows he cannot stop to rest.<br /><br />Today he has the stardom, the success, but he has experienced failure, because it did not work at the beginning with Benfica. He was loaned to a team <b>[GD Ribeirao in 2011-12]</b> that maybe no one knew. But he went, played, worked, grew up and got a new opportunity to play for Benfica. He proved that he deserved to play and never left the team <b>[at Benfica]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[On Bernardo Silva]</b> Bernardo Silva is a player that enchants me, one that I like very much. Although he is not yet an undisputed starter of the national team, and because he depends a lot on how Fernando Santos will set up the team, Bernardo, for his charm, for his intelligence, for being balanced, is another important figure for Portugal</p>

  <p><b>[Nuno Gomes believes Lisbon is supposedly being considered as a potential location for all remaining 2019-20 Champions League matches]</b> For us Portuguese, I believe it is a good thing. After a lot of meetings <b>[<a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>]</b> understood it’s maybe better to do it in one place rather than everybody travelling around Europe. <b>[Lisbon]</b> is a good option, and I’m not sure if they already decided a final decision, but it’s true a lot of views and conversations are being held in order to maybe give Lisbon the final eight of the Champions League. I think it’s good for football to find a solution in order to finish the games that are missing because everybody is waiting for Champions League games</p>

The things look very easy for them. In regards of his season in <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>, I remember that he started very well, he started the season very, very well, the pre-season he scored a lot of goals and then he suffered a small injury that put him out for a couple of weeks<br /><br />I believe this experience, this first year allows him also to grow in terms of his style of play because with the ball, he’s a top talent, he always wants to go to the goal, he has always the eyes on the goal, the way that he receives the ball looking already to the offensive plays so in terms of what he learned being coached by a coach like <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a>, I think it’s very good for him<br /><br /><a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a> will give him things that he never experienced because he used to play a lot of offensive game and now he has to learn how to defend better, how to be a part of a team because he grew up in an environment that things were very easy for him. When you have difficult situations in front of you, you have to work harder in order to surpass those difficulties so I believe he will grow a lot with Simeone</p>

  <p><b>[Nuno Gomes says <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> star Federico Chiesa should ignore links with <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and remain in Italy]</b> In my opinion, a young player like him should stay in Italy. It would be his best choice. He is still 22 so another couple of seasons will make him improve before leaving to another country. But for sure he would be ready for <a href="laliga.html">LaLiga</a> or <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. He has already been an international many times and has much experience under his belt in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>, a very tough league. He will be ready for an adventure abroad but the choice must be his and Fiorentina’s<br /><br />When I watch Federico, I see his father Enrico who was such a great striker. I have almost never seen anybody shooting like him. His eyes were always set on the target to strike, he was amazing at set pieces. Left or right foot, the shot was so easy for him. When I watch Federico I see a bit of his father, the style, the speed, the easy way at shooting without any preparation and a powerful kick like his father. A lot in Federico resembles his dad Enrico.</p>

  <p><b>[Nuno Gomes says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> has ‘improved a lot’ after early <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> struggles]</b> For a while, <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> has not been at its usual level. Before 2000 and until 2005, all the best players were in Italy. Italian clubs were so strong and, in the nineties, they almost won every year <b>[in Europe]</b>, the managers were of the highest level. I experienced a lot of difficulties at the beginning because there was a lot less space to attack than in Portugal. Italian defenders were tactically so good and were able to do everything the manager requested. The defensive system is a united block, they all move together and even <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> struggled a bit when he arrived. He was used to drawing the ball to him, having space and time to think, while in Italy you have to be quicker in your mind, you have to think football. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> understood that and adapted and in so doing he improved. He saw he had to change his ways with less space than in Spain. So, he got closer to the box to maybe think more about scoring. He improved a lot.</p>
