  <p><b>[Marko Arnautovic is not looking for a way out of West Ham despite attracting interest from Manchester United and Chelsea]</b> Do you know what, he’s happy at this club. I don’t think he’s looking actively to go and leave. He’s loved here. I don’t see any reason why he should be leaving the club. Everyone knows what he’s capable of here and I think we’ll see him stay. If he does go, it will be a great loss to West Ham, but we always find a way to carry on. We always do. I don’t want him to leave. I don’t think the club will let him leave, because he’s our main player<br /><br /><b>[on Samir Nasri]</b> I think the manager has a good relationship with him. We know his class, he’s a classy player. He will bring something different to the squad and he has that experience too. It will be a great addition to the squad but it depends what the manager wants and what the owners want</p>

  <p><b>[Former Chelsea striker Carlton Cole believes Kepa Arrizabalaga got off lightly]</b> I was so upset with the Kepa incident. He is probably a good lad and just wanted to stay on the field. I wanted to see him do his best. It is pretty simple though, if the manager tells you to come off, you come off. There’s no excuse. I see my number go up and always thought ‘I go’. I may have had a bad game, but I go ‘see you later’, go down the tunnel, and then I deal with it. I have a go at the manager later on. The manager tried to cover him up after. I say don’t do that. Tell him off in public. Call him out. Don’t be a nice guy. It is time to be mean. That’s my criticism of Sarri. Any manager I had, if I did that I would be getting a shouting down in the changing room. He got dropped, but it felt like he got off lightly as he is soon coming back.<br /><br />Morata had a big ask, I rated him, and I still think he is a great striker. To be like Drogba at Chelsea, you have to have balls. He has tried his best, but it was hard for him because Diego Costa came in and replaced Drogba. Costa showed the same tenacity, skill and nouse. He made things happen. He was a nuisance to everyone. It was a step down to let him go for Morata<br /><br />I love my new role at West Ham. All I like to do is galvanise the youth. I was there one time, and I know what it meant, I had a few bad experiences with the older pros and thought I would never be like those people. So when the youth need your help, you can see it in different ways. Some say it, some do it with their body language. Then when you help someone, and they fulfil it on the pitch, it is the best feeling in the world. There’s a lot of protection for young boys now. We had to fend for ourselves as young boys. There’s still a lot of things going on outside football for these boys, so I am mentoring them to help them make it. In this generation of computers and social media, some of these boys are soft. They haven’t had people telling them they are rubbish. I am there to help people become bigger and better players than I was. I didn’t realise what I wanted to be when I finished playing. I didn’t want to be a coach. I thought they were talking rubbish a lot of the time. But it is hard, and I realise now all the ways they tried to make me a better person and pro. I am trying to be my own person, but, naturally, I have had Mourinho, Ranieri, Curbishley and Capello, so I have had top managers coach me, so I try to take a little bit of everything and distribute it how I feel fit. The end game is to become a manager like <a href="jimmy-floyd-hasselbaink.html">Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink</a> or Scott Parker. Parker started in the youth teams, and now he is managing Fulham, but you never know where it will take you. I didn’t see Scott Parker as a manager. I thought he was going to quit and relax in the Caribbean after a great career. No, he has worked hard and got his chance</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham academy coach Carlton Cole believes Declan Rice would be rolling the dice with his future progress]</b> I would urge to Declan to think twice about looking beyond West Ham at this stage in his career. He would should stay where he is for a few years because he is one of the main men in the team and that won’t be the case if he joins one of the big clubs before he is ready for that. Declan is only 20 and the danger of making a move now is that he could become just a number at one of the top clubs and will not realise his potential. He should learn his trade properly and West Ham is the perfect stage for him to do that. The top clubs will come calling if he is still playing as well as he has done this season a few years down the line, but this is not the moment for him to go to Manchester United or somewhere like that. If you roll the clock forward a few years and he has loads of England caps under his belt after giving plenty of good service to West Ham, then I’m sure they won’t stand in his way if a big club comes in for him, but it would be premature for him to make that move now. He’s had one good season and let’s wait and see where he is in a few years time. Declan is a sensible lad and knows that leaving West Ham now would be a risk for him<br /><br />Declan Rice is a top player and what I like about him is his temperament. He has had to fight for what he has got in his career so far and that will keep him humble. Some players get their break in the Premier League at a young age, but Declan was rejected by Chelsea for a professional contract with and had to get himself back up from that setback to go again. It wasn’t a certainty that he would get his pro contract at West Ham, but he fought hard to get that and he got his head down and tried his best. Look at where it has taken him. He has grown in stature and now he is a full England international. Sometimes rejection at the start of your career can help. Declan had his dream crushed at Chelsea, but it made him even more determined to come back and prove himself and he has done that now. He is a great example of young and aspiring footballers who may find themselves in his position this summer. So many players are in academies at Premier League clubs, but a lot of them won’t make it to the first team and they have to build their career again after that disappointment. You can have a great career in the game even if you are not playing for one of the top six teams in the Premier League and I proved that when I left Chelsea and went to West Ham, which was probably the best decision I made in my career</p>

  <p><b>[Carlton Cole says <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> inspiring English coaches as well as <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> youth]</b> It shows how far we have come that he got the chance. Hopefully they do us justice! Otherwise, no one is going to touch an English footballer again saying that went wrong! He has already done well at Derby, almost getting promoted. I am happy with how it worked for him. I always knew he would be a manager. It is in the blood. You could see it when you played with him. He studied the game a lot. He is very intelligent, I mean very intelligent. When you talk to him, you often find you come away having learned something. That’s why it is a perfect job for him. It is at a great time. There is less pressure because he can’t buy, but he has got the players.<br /><br />He has <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a> next to him as his assistant to help with the youth. The boys absolutely love Jody. It has just come at the right time. He has a year cushion and then he will be judged. You can’t judge him too harshly this year but, hopefully, he still does well. He can learn in that first year. I do not doubt that he will do well. He is a top man, I love him as a person and he has a great backroom staff. You can’t get relegated with that team. It is just about getting the right chemistry with the young boys being added in<br /><br />For Jody, you have to understand that the kids absolutely love him. He has an affinity with them. He has won stuff with them. He knows them inside out. To be coaching the first team just shows you there is a pathway not just for players but coaches too.<br /><br />Dream big, you never know, but it could be you who gets there. That’s why I have started my career to achieve a lot. Hopefully, in four or five years I will progress. I want to learn and be up there like they are. I see the hard work and graft they have put in, so I am definitely going to take a leaf out of his book</p>

  <p><b>[Carlton Cole hopes <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> will take his big opportunity to impress as <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s No.9]</b> I wish I was coming through at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> with a transfer ban. This is an excellent chance for <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a>. When I was out there, I was fighting for my life. Hopefully, these boys from the youth team can grasp this chance to make a good account of themselves. They have to have the desire to realise what a big chance this is. I would have loved this chance when I was back there. Can you imagine if I had an opportunity like this? I never had that. You need a run of games to show what you can do.<br /><br />You will see that these boys will definitely get their chances, the next question is, will they take it? For Tammy, he knows this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I hope he will take his chance. He is a good player. He still has a lot to learn but where’s the best place to learn it? Under someone who believes in you and who thinks you can do well for him. The thing is that <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> also has no choice but to believe in him. He is in a win-win situation, Abraham, but he must believe in himself. He has to do something for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> by the end of the year. This is a big stage. He was brilliant at <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> but this is a promotion. This is the big time<br /><br /><b>[Cole went on a series of loans at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> before signing for <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> in 2006. <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Manuel Pellegrini</a> splashed the cash to sign Sebastian Haller from <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> in the summer and Cole is confident that the Frenchman is capable of being a bit hit in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> From what I have seen of him so far, I think he is a top, top player. I think <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Manuel Pellegrini</a> has bought very well there. I think he can fill the void that we have been having over the last couple of years. <a href="andy-carroll.html">Andy Carroll</a> hasn’t been fit to play. He would have been our main go-to guy to hold up the ball and bring others into play. We were missing that. We know we have a focal point of attack and we can build off him. We have other players like <a href="manuel-lanzini.html">Manuel Lanzini</a>, Pablo Fornals is a great signing and prospect. <a href="jack-wilshere.html">Jack Wilshere</a> is like a new signing. <a href="declan-rice.html">Declan Rice</a> will keep improving and <a href="mark-noble.html">Mark Noble</a> spurring on the boys. So listen, we are looking good. Our defence is not too shabby as well</p>

  <p><b>[Carlton Cole says <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> can break the ‘curse’ of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s No. 9 shirt]</b> Tammy has the self-confidence to succeed. There was a curse on the No. 9 shirt and that’s the one he wanted so that shows me that he has the confidence to believe he can come in and do a job for the team. He’s doing that at the moment. Tammy right now doesn’t compare to <b>[Jimmy Floyd]</b> <a href="jimmy-floyd-hasselbaink.html">Hasselbaink</a> and <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> because they were class for their era. <a href="jimmy-floyd-hasselbaink.html">Hasselbaink</a> had his days as a No. 9 doing his thing; a renowned goalscorer. And obviously <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> did so well at every level right up to Champions League. He is very different to the number nines that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> usually have. I don’t see him as a big, powerful No. 9. He can move to the left and right and could easily play as a No. 10. He’s that good. But he’s being used as an out-and-out striker and he can do that job as well. He loves to score goals. He loves to get into the penalty area. He’s not one of those guys who will shoot from outside the box: he’s a goal-poacher<br /><br /><b>[The doubters are being silenced]</b> It’s high pressure, I’m not going to lie to you. When you’re playing for a team like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> some players grasp pressure different to others. Some players are comfortable being the main man and doing a great job for the team. As a No. 9 there hasn’t been the right man to take the club forward and hopefully if Abraham can continue doing what he’s doing and progressing he can definitely get that number nine curse wiped off</p>

  <p><b>[Carlton Cole says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and only other club planning an approach for <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> midfielder <a href="declan-rice.html">Declan Rice</a> have been told to get their hands off]</b> Rice is a massive player for us and we are so proud of what he’s done. He’s got England caps and is one of the main guys for them too, so he is massive for us. We’re keeping him so everybody needs to get their hands off. He isn’t going anywhere and we’re looking to build a team around him. That’s the main thing for us, to retain our talent. Declan raises himself to everything that is put in front of him. What a guy and what an achievement<br /><br />Maybe he has lost his way just a little bit because he’s not getting enough support around him. It reminds me of my time back in the day when I’d get the ball and there would be no-one around me. I’m seeing similarities in that but he will get used to it and used to shouldering the responsibility on how to lead the line. It is up to the manager to get the best out of him because he’s got all the qualities of a proper solid number nine. I’m a big believer that you make your own luck so if you work hard and the crowd can see you chasing down the balls and defending that alone gets them on your side. Then your luck starts to come because everybody is willing you to score. Showing that heart and love for the game and love for the club takes you over the line psychologically when maybe you’re not scoring as many goals as you want to. The fans will help you through and that’s where they play a massive role. But Haller must work hard and it will come for him. Just work hard and he will be fine</p>

We need some evidence of us being able to do it. When I say us, I mean the whole footballing community moving in the same direction. I don’t mean us as black, I mean us as white, black, whoever’s involved in football - to say there is evidence now to say this can happen.
