  <p><b>[Carlton Cole believes that Harry Kane could cement his reputation as a world-class striker if he moved to Real Madrid]</b> Harry Kane has done so well for himself. A lot of people are saying he’s world class but I don’t think he’s world class yet. I think he’s in great form but is he world class? I think Robert Lewandowski is, who does it year in, year out.<br /><br />Kane has been doing it for a while now but to be considered at a world-class level he needs to do it for longer and do it with England. I think he will get there one day, to a world-class level.<br /><br />It might take one more year but to say it now is a bit premature. If he does it again next year and with England, he is in the realm of looking world class form wise. He is the best in the Premier League right now, in terms of form but we will see at the end of the season.<br /><br />Romelu Lukaku isn’t world class either, Alvaro Morata isn’t. World class means Zinedine Zidane, Lionel Messi, Ronaldinho and Ronaldo. I may be from a different era but I think it can be an overused term. He is a very effective player for Tottenham right now.<br /><br />I am West Ham and Chelsea through and through, so I am not supposed to like Tottenham, but I respect him and where he’s come from. Spurs are a good team at the moment and you can’t knock them. It would be good to see him do it at another club.<br /><br />Ronaldo and Gareth Bale both showed they could do it in England and on the Real Madrid stage. Bale is world class now. Hopefully Kane can get to that level. He doesn’t have to leave Tottenham because they are a growing club but it would be nice to see him at a bigger club. Spurs are not the biggest club in the world. At Barcelona or Madrid, he can quickly prove that he is world class. Modric made that jump and he was quickly branded world class. In the Premier League, he wasn’t put in that category. Sometimes moving clubs can help. Doing it at more than one club proves that you can do it anywhere.</p>

  <p><b>[Carlton Cole has been impressed with Alvaro Morata’s start to life at Chelsea]</b> Morata is very different to Diego Costa. Costa was a troublemaker on the field, he had scandal about him. You look at him and you think, this guy wants trouble, footballing wise, or he wanted to get in the defender’s head. With Morata, you just have to look in his eyes. He is so determined when you look at him. When the camera is on his face, you see that this guy wants to do well. He wants to prove to people what he is all about and what he can bring to the game.<br /><br />I was surprised to see his pace, I didn’t know he was that quick, great technique and his finishing skills are on point. The same as Harry Kane really. Kane is surprisingly quick. Morata’s goal against Stoke City was like that <b>[Hernan]</b> Crespo goal in the Champions League final with AC Milan against Liverpool. That chip and curl, what a goal. Morata did that the other day. People didn’t rate it as much as they should. I was like ‘wow, that guy has confidence’. It was amazing and you don’t see that every day. Morata is bringing something different to the table to Costa.<br /><br />Costa disrupted a whole team but Morata just does what he is supposed to do and he adapted quick. That’s a sign he is a good player. Chelsea put their money where their mouth is with the transfer fee to sign him, scouted him heavily.<br /><br />I’d say Tammy Abraham on loan at Swansea has shown he is at the same level as Batshuayi. I would have given him a chance and promoted youth. We know he can score goals. I know Batshuayi can score goals as well but we should give our homegrown players a chance.<br /><br />They are both young players and can both be a threat but I can’t understand why there’s so many loan deals for the homegrown talent that they could use right now. Batshuayi is youth but the academy has produced. It would be better to give the second striker role to an academy guy. If they are good enough, they are old enough. And I think Tammy Abraham is good enough.<br /><br />I was fortunate to have had that opportunity. Yes, I had a loan here or there but I got my move to West Ham. Then I went on to play for England. Playing for your homegrown club though is a great thing. I would say it is actually worse to be signed as a back-up when you come from abroad.<br /><br />You want to move country to play regularly, not to be a second choice. When I went to West Ham I wasn’t first choice straight away but I made it into the team. I would be worried to sign for big money from abroad only to see another big name come in ahead of me the next season.<br /><br />What Abraham just has to do is keep doing what he’s doing. He’s scoring goals at Swansea and he’s working under a great manager that knows him from Chelsea’s academy. I’d say he just needs to keep on this path and keep his faith. I made 19 appearances at U-21 level and he can continue doing it at that level.<br /><br />He can forge a great career for himself. Even if he doesn’t make it at Chelsea as a first choice striker, then he can have a great career. He has to do what’s right for himself, his family and make sure he reaches his potential by playing every week. Like he is doing now. Harry Kane made it at Tottenham but he had to work for it, on loan, bad moment, but he made sure he is the man.<br /><br />My only problem with Conte is he needs to look at his youth more. He needs to trust his youth, Pochettino has done it. <b>[Harry]</b> Winks, <b>[Dele]</b> Alli, Kane. I don’t see why managers don’t look at it properly. Abraham should keep dreaming about Chelsea and aim to get as close to that goal as possible. He is young enough to aim for the England number nine shirt, one day, you never know</p>

  <p><b>[Umuh Muchtar repeatedly bashed Cole in the media]</b> They have a coach who trains you all week but then there’s a manager called Umuh Muchtar who books hotels and oversees the players. We call them player liaisons or club reps in England, but over there it is known as the manager. At Persib, this guy dominates the whole team.<br /><br />He won’t be at training and then he will still pick the team for the matchday. The coach who trains you doesn’t have much power, the manager picks everything. If the manager doesn’t like you or chooses another player on a whim, then you won’t play, even if you are the best in recent weeks and in training<br /><br />The guy had ties to the police, he provided them with arms and worked with the army. He was a domineering kind of guy. If he doesn’t like things, then he makes sure he does things the way he wants it. I didn’t get along with him because I tried to help teach them a different way to think about football, and even Essien was trying to do the same thing, but he didn’t understand that football is a meritocracy.<br /><br />He just decided on a whim that he didn’t like me. He didn’t sign me. The owners signed me but they weren’t based in the city I was in. They were in Jakarta. We tried to sort it out but they weren’t local, which is important, and the manager was local and he controlled the team. It was a recipe for disaster. We never resolved the issues.<br /><br />The team I played for were the biggest in Indonesia, they are the Manchester United of Indonesia, but actually they aren’t doing too well. It wasn’t just me. Even after I left they are hanging around in 13th place. That’s why I was a bit upset about the way I left. I didn’t want it to end that way. That one guy messed it up for everybody<br /><br />I had an injury after I left Celtic so I just wanted to know I could still play at a good level. I had a knee operation. My agent sorted something out in Indonesia through Michael Essien. Essien then spoke to me and they said they wanted me over there.<br /><br />We stayed in Jakarta for three days before signing. We got a feel for the country. Essien was keen for us to go over there because he wanted a friend around. I knew him from Chelsea when I was younger and faced him with West Ham. We had always kept in contact and he was keen to see me over there.<br /><br />Michael Essien maybe struggled more <b>[than I did at first]</b> but he now has a house over there and a Harley Davidson. He’s loving life. It was all fine at the point of signing, then my agent left and the dramas started. This guy then went crazy, as he had nothing to do with the deal.<br /><br />It may have been a crazy experience but it was one of the best of my life. I learned a lot about myself over there. I am grateful I got to be part of Indonesian football. The fans are unbelievable. The fans carry the team. They live and die football. It is in their blood. They love it.<br /><br />There were two fan deaths through hooliganism while I was there. You never see that in England. They could take it too far but they’re great fans for the most part<br /><br />I want to keep playing but now is the time to really take coaching seriously. I am a proud guy. Once my legs go, I don’t want to be overtaken by young kids. I don’t want to be the granddad of football. I want to just look at my other options in the game. I am only 34 years old so I can still play.<br /><br />John Terry is the same age and playing and coaching on the side. I want to do the same thing. John has played at every level. He was England captain. I have always looked up to him since I was young in the Chelsea youth team. I want to go down the same path but in my own way<br /><br />Kevin Nolan is another player that I know. He’s at Notts County and has been very successful. He just won Manager of the Month. I look at myself in that sort of ilk and I hope to do that. I have applied for my level two coaching badges. I start that in January. I’m working at Ask Godders Academy at the moment to help footballers who have dropped out of the game or youngsters who slipped through the net. I will get experience at this academy. It is one of the best academies in London. I have done talks and coaching sessions with them. It would be a crime to not share my knowledge of what I learned in football with these kids. I want to get involved in football and get as far as I can in coaching<br /><br />Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is my inspiration. He is a good coach, knows football and I want to get to that level, at least! There’s not a lot of black coaches out there. I will take it seriously. I know I can be a successful coach. I just hope for the chances when it comes to it<br /><br />Some say that the sport is racist, which is why there are few black managers and the game does have a problem in certain areas. But what I put it down to is that many black players have had bad experiences so far in their careers and so when they are asked, ‘Do you want to carry on being a coach?’ they say, ‘No, I will continue on with another part of my life. I don’t want to be involved in this anymore and being a coach could make it even worse for me’.<br /><br />Being one of the first black coaches to be successful could make your life worse personally, it might not be worth it. I look at it from another angle. I still don’t understand why more don’t just take it on.<br /><br />Les Ferdinand is coaching at Queens Park Rangers. Jimmy Floyd has done well. <b>[Chris]</b> Ramsey also at QPR, <b>[Chris]</b> Hughton … but I will follow my own path. I won’t accept the stereotypes. I will go into coaching off my own back and be successful, or not. I will do what I wanted to do.<br /><br />I won’t go into coaching for diversity reasons because there’s few black guys, or go into it because that’s what footballers do, or not do it because people may judge me. I want to do this and I want to be successful. I wanted to be a successful footballer and I want to be a successful coach on some level</p>

  <p><b>[Marko Arnautovic is not looking for a way out of West Ham despite attracting interest from Manchester United and Chelsea]</b> Do you know what, he’s happy at this club. I don’t think he’s looking actively to go and leave. He’s loved here. I don’t see any reason why he should be leaving the club. Everyone knows what he’s capable of here and I think we’ll see him stay. If he does go, it will be a great loss to West Ham, but we always find a way to carry on. We always do. I don’t want him to leave. I don’t think the club will let him leave, because he’s our main player<br /><br /><b>[on Samir Nasri]</b> I think the manager has a good relationship with him. We know his class, he’s a classy player. He will bring something different to the squad and he has that experience too. It will be a great addition to the squad but it depends what the manager wants and what the owners want</p>

  <p><b>[Former Chelsea striker Carlton Cole believes Kepa Arrizabalaga got off lightly]</b> I was so upset with the Kepa incident. He is probably a good lad and just wanted to stay on the field. I wanted to see him do his best. It is pretty simple though, if the manager tells you to come off, you come off. There’s no excuse. I see my number go up and always thought ‘I go’. I may have had a bad game, but I go ‘see you later’, go down the tunnel, and then I deal with it. I have a go at the manager later on. The manager tried to cover him up after. I say don’t do that. Tell him off in public. Call him out. Don’t be a nice guy. It is time to be mean. That’s my criticism of Sarri. Any manager I had, if I did that I would be getting a shouting down in the changing room. He got dropped, but it felt like he got off lightly as he is soon coming back.<br /><br />Morata had a big ask, I rated him, and I still think he is a great striker. To be like Drogba at Chelsea, you have to have balls. He has tried his best, but it was hard for him because Diego Costa came in and replaced Drogba. Costa showed the same tenacity, skill and nouse. He made things happen. He was a nuisance to everyone. It was a step down to let him go for Morata<br /><br />I love my new role at West Ham. All I like to do is galvanise the youth. I was there one time, and I know what it meant, I had a few bad experiences with the older pros and thought I would never be like those people. So when the youth need your help, you can see it in different ways. Some say it, some do it with their body language. Then when you help someone, and they fulfil it on the pitch, it is the best feeling in the world. There’s a lot of protection for young boys now. We had to fend for ourselves as young boys. There’s still a lot of things going on outside football for these boys, so I am mentoring them to help them make it. In this generation of computers and social media, some of these boys are soft. They haven’t had people telling them they are rubbish. I am there to help people become bigger and better players than I was. I didn’t realise what I wanted to be when I finished playing. I didn’t want to be a coach. I thought they were talking rubbish a lot of the time. But it is hard, and I realise now all the ways they tried to make me a better person and pro. I am trying to be my own person, but, naturally, I have had Mourinho, Ranieri, Curbishley and Capello, so I have had top managers coach me, so I try to take a little bit of everything and distribute it how I feel fit. The end game is to become a manager like <a href="jimmy-floyd-hasselbaink.html">Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink</a> or Scott Parker. Parker started in the youth teams, and now he is managing Fulham, but you never know where it will take you. I didn’t see Scott Parker as a manager. I thought he was going to quit and relax in the Caribbean after a great career. No, he has worked hard and got his chance</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham academy coach Carlton Cole believes Declan Rice would be rolling the dice with his future progress]</b> I would urge to Declan to think twice about looking beyond West Ham at this stage in his career. He would should stay where he is for a few years because he is one of the main men in the team and that won’t be the case if he joins one of the big clubs before he is ready for that. Declan is only 20 and the danger of making a move now is that he could become just a number at one of the top clubs and will not realise his potential. He should learn his trade properly and West Ham is the perfect stage for him to do that. The top clubs will come calling if he is still playing as well as he has done this season a few years down the line, but this is not the moment for him to go to Manchester United or somewhere like that. If you roll the clock forward a few years and he has loads of England caps under his belt after giving plenty of good service to West Ham, then I’m sure they won’t stand in his way if a big club comes in for him, but it would be premature for him to make that move now. He’s had one good season and let’s wait and see where he is in a few years time. Declan is a sensible lad and knows that leaving West Ham now would be a risk for him<br /><br />Declan Rice is a top player and what I like about him is his temperament. He has had to fight for what he has got in his career so far and that will keep him humble. Some players get their break in the Premier League at a young age, but Declan was rejected by Chelsea for a professional contract with and had to get himself back up from that setback to go again. It wasn’t a certainty that he would get his pro contract at West Ham, but he fought hard to get that and he got his head down and tried his best. Look at where it has taken him. He has grown in stature and now he is a full England international. Sometimes rejection at the start of your career can help. Declan had his dream crushed at Chelsea, but it made him even more determined to come back and prove himself and he has done that now. He is a great example of young and aspiring footballers who may find themselves in his position this summer. So many players are in academies at Premier League clubs, but a lot of them won’t make it to the first team and they have to build their career again after that disappointment. You can have a great career in the game even if you are not playing for one of the top six teams in the Premier League and I proved that when I left Chelsea and went to West Ham, which was probably the best decision I made in my career</p>

  <p><b>[Carlton Cole says <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> inspiring English coaches as well as <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> youth]</b> It shows how far we have come that he got the chance. Hopefully they do us justice! Otherwise, no one is going to touch an English footballer again saying that went wrong! He has already done well at Derby, almost getting promoted. I am happy with how it worked for him. I always knew he would be a manager. It is in the blood. You could see it when you played with him. He studied the game a lot. He is very intelligent, I mean very intelligent. When you talk to him, you often find you come away having learned something. That’s why it is a perfect job for him. It is at a great time. There is less pressure because he can’t buy, but he has got the players.<br /><br />He has <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a> next to him as his assistant to help with the youth. The boys absolutely love Jody. It has just come at the right time. He has a year cushion and then he will be judged. You can’t judge him too harshly this year but, hopefully, he still does well. He can learn in that first year. I do not doubt that he will do well. He is a top man, I love him as a person and he has a great backroom staff. You can’t get relegated with that team. It is just about getting the right chemistry with the young boys being added in<br /><br />For Jody, you have to understand that the kids absolutely love him. He has an affinity with them. He has won stuff with them. He knows them inside out. To be coaching the first team just shows you there is a pathway not just for players but coaches too.<br /><br />Dream big, you never know, but it could be you who gets there. That’s why I have started my career to achieve a lot. Hopefully, in four or five years I will progress. I want to learn and be up there like they are. I see the hard work and graft they have put in, so I am definitely going to take a leaf out of his book</p>

Tammy right now doesn’t compare to <b>[Jimmy Floyd]</b> <a href="jimmy-floyd-hasselbaink.html">Hasselbaink</a> and <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> because they were class for their era. <a href="jimmy-floyd-hasselbaink.html">Hasselbaink</a> had his days as a No. 9 doing his thing; a renowned goalscorer. And obviously <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> did so well at every level right up to Champions League. He is very different to the number nines that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> usually have. I don’t see him as a big, powerful No. 9. He can move to the left and right and could easily play as a No. 10. He’s that good. But he’s being used as an out-and-out striker and he can do that job as well. He loves to score goals. He loves to get into the penalty area. He’s not one of those guys who will shoot from outside the box: he’s a goal-poacher<br /><br /><b>[The doubters are being silenced]</b> It’s high pressure, I’m not going to lie to you. When you’re playing for a team like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> some players grasp pressure different to others. Some players are comfortable being the main man and doing a great job for the team. As a No. 9 there hasn’t been the right man to take the club forward and hopefully if Abraham can continue doing what he’s doing and progressing he can definitely get that number nine curse wiped off</p>

  <p><b>[Carlton Cole says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and only other club planning an approach for <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> midfielder <a href="declan-rice.html">Declan Rice</a> have been told to get their hands off]</b> Rice is a massive player for us and we are so proud of what he’s done. He’s got England caps and is one of the main guys for them too, so he is massive for us. We’re keeping him so everybody needs to get their hands off. He isn’t going anywhere and we’re looking to build a team around him. That’s the main thing for us, to retain our talent. Declan raises himself to everything that is put in front of him. What a guy and what an achievement<br /><br />Maybe he has lost his way just a little bit because he’s not getting enough support around him. It reminds me of my time back in the day when I’d get the ball and there would be no-one around me. I’m seeing similarities in that but he will get used to it and used to shouldering the responsibility on how to lead the line. It is up to the manager to get the best out of him because he’s got all the qualities of a proper solid number nine. I’m a big believer that you make your own luck so if you work hard and the crowd can see you chasing down the balls and defending that alone gets them on your side. Then your luck starts to come because everybody is willing you to score. Showing that heart and love for the game and love for the club takes you over the line psychologically when maybe you’re not scoring as many goals as you want to. The fans will help you through and that’s where they play a massive role. But Haller must work hard and it will come for him. Just work hard and he will be fine</p>

  <p><b>[Carlton Cole backs <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> Rule to help improve diversity within football hierarchy]</b> We might have to just take that and then prove ourselves to make sure that we are looked at in a serious way and we can do a good job. We need some evidence of us being able to do it. When I say us, I mean the whole footballing community moving in the same direction. I don’t mean us as black, I mean us as white, black, whoever’s involved in football - to say there is evidence now to say this can happen. If the <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> Rule is the only way that we can actually get in front of an owner so we can convince him I am the right man for the job, then so be it.</p>
