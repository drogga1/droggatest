  <p>[A-League clubs are ready to fight for more money and a greater say in the competition’s future] The time for engagement, decision and change is now upon us. Decisions to be made right now are going to affect the future of football in Australia for years to come.<br /><br />At this stage, we haven’t had any visibility on the strategic thinking. What we would like to see is a higher level of consultation with all of the key stakeholders to work through the criteria. At the core of any expansion, we must be confident that any new licences don’t compromise the mainstream integrity and the marketability of the competition<br /><br />While the A-League earns the lion’s share of revenue, it has almost the least amount of say<br /><br />[Di Pietro called for] all revenue raised by the A-League [to be] retained and invested to grow the A-League</p>

  <p>[Melbourne Victory chairman Anthony Di Pietro was delighted to welcome Marco Kurz, who will arrive at the club within a fortnight] Our panel of experienced football people including Mark Bresciano, Paul Trimboli and Rob Sherman, undertook a comprehensive recruitment process. Coupled with his international and domestic experience, Marco demonstrated outstanding qualities throughout. Importantly his passion for success and desire to win is aligned with our club’s ambition. We look forward to working together to bring excitement and success for the Victory family and are confident Marco will do an outstanding job in the high-pressure role</p>
