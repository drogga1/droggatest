  <p><b>[Criticisms of tactical disorganisation and uninspiring performances under Vadao were suddenly swept aside, all thanks to hat-trick hero Cristiane, who was one of the five to originally retire in protest when Emily Lima was sacked]</b> It was a fresh start for the whole side.</p>

  <p><b>[Vadao’s re-appointment followed the sacking of the team’s first ever female coach, Emily Lima, who was relieved of her duties after just 13 games in charge. Her dismissal prompted five players to withdraw themselves from selection for the national team, while an open letter criticising the Brazilian federation was published and signed by eight players, including stars such as Cristiane and Formiga]</b> We, the players, have invested years of our own lives and all of our energy to build this team and this sport to its strength today. Yet we, and almost all other Brazilian women, are excluded from the leadership and decision-making for our own team and our own sport</p>

  <p><b>[Brazil forward Cristiane thinks the USA star is the best in the world right now]</b> I think it’s Megan <b>[<a href="megan-rapinoe.html">Rapinoe</a>]</b>. To be honest, it’s difficult for me to judge, because I’m playing outside of Europe and USA, so I can’t follow all of the players. But I think it’s Megan, for everything she did at the World Cup</p>
