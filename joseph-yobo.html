  <p><b>[Joseph Yobo says his old club <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> is the perfect place for Nigerian compatriot <a href="alex-iwobi.html">Alex Iwobi</a> to deliver on his potential]</b> <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> is the perfect club for a brave player like <a href="alex-iwobi.html">Alex Iwobi</a> and I know it’s the right step to becoming a great player. The manager <b>[Marco Silva]</b> is building an amazing team and he believes so much in Alex to add him to his squad. Already he has started well by scoring two headed goals and it’s just the beginning of bigger things to come<br /><br /><b>[As far as Yobo is concerned, <a href="alex-iwobi.html">Iwobi</a> is in the ideal environment to build on the good start he has made]</b> He’s coming into a team full of good players, a traditional family club that is ready to back him on and off the pitch. Mentally it must be tough to leave a club like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> where it all started for him, but this is a strong statement of intent to challenge himself. I had a good time at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and I’m very pleased that he’s followed in the footsteps of myself, Yakubu Ayegbeni and Victor Anichebe. With the way he plays and his creativity, Alex has a big chance to blossom, succeed and grow into a great player with Everton</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> defender Joseph Yobo has backed <a href="alex-iwobi.html">Alex Iwobi</a> to make an impact at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> once he has fully settled in at Goodison Park]</b> Moving to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> was a good move for him because he wanted more game time. Unfortunately, it takes a longer time to settle down in a new environment because only a few players move to another club and settle immediately<br /><br />In between him adapting, he had a number of good performances for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. He was getting familiar with how <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> play and was becoming one of the key figures in the team before his injury.<br /><br />I think we should be patient with him because we can’t doubt his talent. He has unbelievable talent and work rate. I know he is going to achieve more with Everton</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> defender Joseph Yobo says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> deserve to be crowned 2019-20 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> champions whether the coronavirus pandemic brings the season to a premature end or not]</b> If I want to be sentimental <b>[as an Evertonian]</b>, I could have said I don’t want them to win it. But I love football and for the interest of global football, and the way <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have played, they deserve to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title – 25 points is not a joke. From the way they played last season, winning the Champions League and losing the league to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> by one point – on that note, it would be unfair if they are not crowned as champions</p>

  <p><b>[The defender revealed he was swayed by the dreams of <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a> for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> as well as his promise to make him one of the best in the world]</b> When I was at Olympique de Marseille I played at the back with <a href="frank-leboeuf.html">Frank Leboeuf</a>, former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> defender, so when he saw me he said, ‘Wow you are lightning-quick’ that I was strong and powerful. He said to me that the French League is good, that I’m playing for probably one of the biggest clubs Marseille but he thinks England would suit me so well.<br /><br />How I moved to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, we played against Ireland in a friendly game preparing for the 2002 World Cup and <a href="david-moyes.html">David Moyes</a> watched me. That game I played in the midfield with Jay-Jay (Okocha), so we were in the middle and we played against <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>, the former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> captain, and I was able to make a statement in that game. After that game, <a href="david-moyes.html">David Moyes</a> spoke to me that he wanted me to come to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and I made him understand that I wanted to go to the World Cup first because even at the World Cup there was something going on with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, a rumour that I was going to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, so I told my agent that I wanted to go to the World Cup and I’m glad my dream came true.<br /><br />At the World Cup, people said I was one of the best performers and there were offers from everywhere for me. My agent told me that we were going to England, London. I didn’t want to ask too many questions, where we were going, there were rumours of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and other teams but I went to Belgium and we took a flight and the flight landed in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. He told me <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a> wants to speak to me, so <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a> took me around the club, told me his dreams and what he expects from me and how good a player he wants me to be.<br /><br />Basically he wanted to make me one of the best defenders in the world, those were his words. He bought me lunch and sold the club entirely to me. He was a young manager, a former defender, one thing that struck me was he said he wants to make me one of the best defenders in the world, so we spoke with my agent and I decided to move to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> but they couldn’t reach a deal that’s why it was a loan.<br /><br />My first season with <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> was even very memorable because it was a loan deal, I had to impress to make it permanent for them to be able to pay what Marseille want. This is funny, that was the first time I saw a striker tackling a defender from the back in a friendly game for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, somewhere in Wales or Scotland. I had this ball, I was in control of the ball, the striker came from behind, tackled me, that’s how I was out for about four weeks, he didn’t take the ball, he was very aggressive, I got injured in the process, so that’s how I missed the first few weeks of my <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> career.<br /><br />The season started and <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> wasn’t doing so well, I don’t know what happened but we had a good team but we were still rebuilding at the same time. And I came into the team, we won about four, five, six games in a row and we kept about six, seven clean sheets in a row. And at that point the fans voted me the <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> Player of the Month, it’s something that I appreciate so much. That’s how my first season started, I made my mark immediately I came into the team and then I signed a permanent deal for Everton</p>
