  <p><b>[Brady was more than happy to do it the hard way and finish the job in front of their home supporters]</b> If you’d said we can take a play-off in front of our own fans then we’d have taken it. We did everything we needed to and now we’re off to France. I think it’s just Ireland as a whole, we never seem to do things the easy way. When things got tough we stuck with each other and ground out results</p>

  <p><b>[Robbie Brady acknowledged that Belgium are a top class team ahead of Saturday’s Group E encounter]</b> I’m not sure what they’re feeling. We know they’re a top class team and they’ll be coming in prepared. They’re obviously going to be coming to win, as we are. We’ll just be doing our part to get ready for them. I’m sure they’ll be wanting to pick up some sort of result but we’ll be concentrating on ourselves.<br /><br />It’s a fantastic stage. We’re delighted to be here. You have to relish it, you can’t let it pass you by. We did that <b>[against Sweden]</b>. Hopefully the pre-tournament jitters were shaken off a couple of minutes in and we can push on from here. We’ve got some experienced lads in the team and lads that have played at the top level. You’ve got to be clued in. Every team has players that can hurt you in a few seconds</p>

  <p><b>[Republic of Ireland goalscorer Robbie Brady after beating Italy 1-0]</b> People talk of an out-of-body experience with these goals and I was lucky to experience it. I’m stuck for words, still</p>

  <p><b>[Brilliant Robbie Brady is the future as Ireland look to forget French woes]</b> I grew up waiting to play at this stage, dreaming about it since I was a little kid. To go and do it in front of my family is the best feeling in the world. We’ve done it again. We roll on. The next game is Sunday. We need to regroup and go again.</p>

  <p><b>[Republic of Ireland goal-hero Robbie Brady has already turned his attention towards the 2018 World Cup after the Boys in Green were eliminated from Euro 2016]</b> It’s very disappointing and I’m just sad to see it finish now, to be honest. We gave ourselves a great chance early on and maybe tiredness showed, not only in legs but in a couple of decisions in the second half that cost us. I can’t fault anyone though, there’s no blame to be shed on any one person.<br /><br />Every one of the lads gave a great account of themselves throughout the tournament. Obviously it’s very sad to finish now, but I think there’s definitely positives to be taken. Personally, to get a couple of goals that I’ll always be able to look back on… it’s not just goals, there are different moments. Even at the end, just standing in front of the fans, it’s something you’ll never forget, so thanks to them for giving us that moment.<br /><br />You can see that we’ve got some quality players. You hear things about the future not being so bright, but I think we went out there and showed that we’ve got a bit about us today. We’ll be accepting nothing more than getting out of the World Cup group and representing on the big stage again, letting so many thousands of Irish fans show what they’re about as well</p>
