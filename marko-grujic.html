It’s a time in my life I know I’ll never forget</p>

I am aware that I have got a great chance, playing for the next six months in a big club, and thanking Mr. Klopp for everything he has done for me. He encouraged me many times over the past 18 months, and I believe that I will justify his confidence. Of course, I hope I will help Cardiff gain promotion to the Premier League.</p>

There are a lot of players in my position so we will see what happens in the next few weeks.

  <p><b>[Marko Grujic warns Reds they can expect a tough challenge against Red Star Belgrade]</b> It was the one I was hoping for, of course. My two favourite clubs playing together in the Champions League? Perfect!<br /><br />I got them tickets from Red Star. But I have some Serbian friends who will be in the Liverpool end as well, because they are Reds. I can’t lose really, can I? Whatever the result, people will be happy!<br /><br />They were always my club. When I played for them it was the proudest moment of my life<br /><br />Yes, it’s pretty crazy! That part of the stadium is very old, of course. It was left like that even when other parts have been developed, because of the history and tradition it carries. They didn’t want to change it. In a way, that is similar to Anfield - you don’t want to lose that feeling. It’s unique and that’s what you want. To walk down there and to see the police in the tunnel and the graffiti and all these things, it is pretty incredible. And then you can hear the noise from the fans above. For an opposition player I can imagine it will be quite intimidating as well; I will be interested to speak to my Liverpool team-mates after the game to see how they found it. It will be a special experience for them, for sure<br /><br />That’s why I’m looking forward to the game, to be honest. The atmosphere is one thing, but Red Star held Napoli to a draw, so they can play as well. It won’t be easy for Liverpool. The two away games, yes they were outplayed, but to draw 0-0 with Napoli is a good achievement. They are really good defensively, especially around their box, and especially in the Marakana they seem to be able to find a bit extra, maybe from the supporters and the atmosphere. I am not expecting a lot of goals this time.<br /><br /> was not born for the European Cup win. But my father and my brother told me all about that team and the great players, all the great nights. I watched all the videos. That was such a fantastic team, and of course after that final the players all went to Europe’s top clubs. They made history, but that was around the time that European football changed dramatically with the Champions League and all the money. Unfortunately for teams like Red Star, it was impossible for them to keep up. They had to sell their players, and of course they struggled as a result. For the club, just to be back on this kind of stage now is an achievement. It’s been so long, they are just happy to be here and having some of the best players and teams in Europe coming to Belgrade to play against them. Their dream was to come back to the Champions League. Even in the two games against PSG and Liverpool, they lost 6-1 and 4-0 but the supporters are not angry or disappointed with the team. They understand. They are still supporting the team and enjoying the games. They will for sure make a special atmosphere<br /><br />The manager will text or call after a good game, which is good. He talks a lot about Germany and the Bundesliga, because he is still very interested in that of course. His son lives in Berlin too so we have spoken about the city and things to do there, for example. He was joking with me because Hertha took a point off Borussia Dortmund earlier in the season, and he was not too happy about that! He was happier when we beat Bayern Munich, of course, and now we have been drawn against them in the DFB Pokal as well so he’s already looking forward to that - hopefully I can play in that and make him happy with the result<br /><br /><b>[A Hertha player for now, his dream is to be a Liverpool player, a proper Liverpool player, in the future]</b> That hasn’t changed. I would love to one day be a Liverpool player. That is why I have gone on loan, to prepare my body and my mind for the highest level, and we all know that the highest level is clubs like Liverpool, Barcelona, Real Madrid. My dream and my ambition is to be part of Liverpool going forward, hopefully next season and beyond, but I know I have to work hard and deliver on the pitch with Hertha this season first</p>

But, if I could choose myself, I would stay with Hertha for another year, or maybe even two years, to make a very good name for myself by improving all my qualities. And that’s only possible if you play every game.<br /><br />Hertha is my favourite. I would love to stay here longer. And if Liverpool ever wanted to sell me and I could decide, it would be great if Hertha made an offer. Most of all my self-confidence has increased due to the match practice. My defensive behaviour has also improved a lot because of the games<br /><br />Of course it would be great to be there.

  <p><b>[Grujic warns Liverpool to expect rough ride in Wales]</b> Liverpool will know what is to come. It will be a direct style, some long balls and then pressing to try and attack the second ball in the opponents’ half. They rarely change. Some people criticise Neil Warnock because of the way his teams play. He’s seen as someone who plays only long-ball football or a direct style, but he always has a clear plan. And most of the time, it works. It’s about security. He doesn’t want to lose many balls in the middle, he wants to play long and then to press high and win the ball closer to the goal. That’s what Cardiff will do on Sunday.<br /><br />It was a good experience for me to work under him. He’s really popular with the players, a very funny guy who knows how to motivate people. For me, I needed someone like him at that point in my career. Before every game, he focuses a lot on defending and that’s how I look at football as well. If you defend well, then you will always have a chance even against a good team. My first meetings before I signed, he was very funny. I met him in the stadium and he told me I was bigger than I sounded on the phone! He spoke a lot with me and my father as well, and told me immediately that I would play. He’s a direct guy, says what he thinks. What he did with us in the Championship was great. We were not expected to get promoted but he got us playing to a specific style and it worked. And then look at this season. Look at a team like Fulham, who spent much more money than Cardiff but got nothing to show for it. Cardiff still have a chance to stay in the league, and I am really hoping they can do so because it’s a great club and I really enjoyed my time there. I will be interested to see the result</p>

I am very settled here<br /><br /><b>[<a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha</a> went into the winter break 12th in the table]</b> It was a difficult start.

I know improvement is the only thing that can help me. And it’s why I could accept that I needed to go somewhere to play regularly this season. I needed minutes, I needed to learn the game, when to defend, when to attack, where to be on the pitch. I want to improve every part of my game. Defending is a big part, because when you look at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, they defend like hell! Every player is fighting for every inch of the pitch, which is so impressive. Sometimes I get tired just watching them! Jordan, Gini, Fab, Milner - they are all huge role models for a player like me. The job they do is so underrated, and their levels are so high. They play with such intensity, every game. That is what I have to aspire to. Next season, who knows, hopefully I am ready to jump up with the team. That is what I hope for.<br /><br /><b>[Grujic was in Madrid when <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were crowned European champions back in June]</b> I had a video chat with <a href="dejan-lovren.html">Dejan Lovren</a> from the party, though. so I got to experience a bit of the atmosphere at least! And just being there before the game, that was so special. The whole city was red<br /><br /><b>[Was it difficult, then, to head out on loan once more a few weeks later, to turn his back on the chance to be part of further success this season?]</b> No. It would be easy to get frustrated and wonder why you are out on loan, but I don’t see it that way. We are talking about the best team in the world, don’t forget. And they expect to win every game. Their standard is as high as it can be, and not every player can be there right away. There are some great young players, such as Trent or <a href="joe-gomez.html">Joe Gomez</a>, who can do it, but others have to get there in a different way. I look at <a href="harry-wilson.html">Harry Wilson</a>, an unbelievable player, and myself quite similarly. We are striving to get to that level, but we needed to go and play football to do it. It doesn’t just happen overnight. It’s better for me, at this age, to be playing. If I am 25 or 26, then yes, it’s time for me to see if I am a rotation player at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or whatever. But, at 23, I have to make an impact, I have to learn. I have to play regularly, I have to test myself, learn about my body, what it can handle. It’s about finding out who I am, what kind of player I am</p>

Everything is still open. The <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> is a good league and over the past two years I’ve gained a lot of important experience and I feel like I’ve improved as a player<br /><br /><b>[Grujic has enjoyed seeing <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> steamroll their way to within touching distance of a first title in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> era]</b> It’s been an unbelievable season for the club and I feel very proud to say I am part of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Having waited so long to win the title and with it being so close, I can imagine how all the fans in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are feeling right now. It’s bit unfair for the team as it was 99 per cent certain they would win it. They played so many great games and built up such a big lead at the top. Now they have to wait. The timing is bad luck but that’s how it is. We shouldn’t think too much about football at this time because there are more important things in life like people’s health</p>

  <p><b>[Marko Grujic is refusing to give up on his dream of being a regular <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> player]</b> Of course that means a lot - I am still a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> player and I want to be, one day, a regular <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> player. For me it’s still a dream to play for the club so we keep in touch<br /><br />The guys have been unbelievable so far this season and they really deserve it <b>[to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b>. Of course the fans have been waiting for this for so long so it would be special for the guys. Hopefully, soon we will see <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Hendo</a> <b>[<a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a>]</b> lifting the trophy</p>

  <p><b>[Grujic, meanwhile, has never given up on his dream of becoming a first-team regular for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, but knows how hard it will be to work his way into <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s side]</b> I still hope for that, of course. You can’t just give up on your goals. In fact, I’m probably working harder now than I’ve ever done before in my life. I know it’s going to be tough. I’m not stupid. I know that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> right now are an unbelievable team, the best team in the world. So, I know that I have to be at a very high level if I want to have a chance. That’s why I watch as many of their games as I can, to learn and to see the level. I know improvement is the only thing that can help me. And it’s why I could accept that I needed to go somewhere to play regularly this season. I needed minutes, I needed to learn the game, when to defend, when to attack, where to be on the pitch. I want to improve every part of my game<br /><br />Defending is a big part, because when you look at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, they defend like hell! Every player is fighting for every inch of the pitch, which is so impressive. Sometimes I get tired just watching them! Jordan, Gini, Fab, Milner - they are all huge role models for a player like me. The job they do is so underrated, and their levels are so high. They play with such intensity, every game. That is what I have to aspire to. Next season, who knows, hopefully I am ready to jump up with the team. That is what I hope for</p>
