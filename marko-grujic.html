I said I could come but only to visit the city - because I had already decided to join <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha</a> at that point.

So, so good. Role models<br /><br /><b>[He left dreaming of starring at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, of showcasing his talent in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> I still hope for that, of course. You can’t just give up on your goals. In fact, I’m probably working harder now than I’ve ever done before in my life<br /><br /><b>[Grujic had spent the previous campaign with <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha Berlin</a> and found a club - and a city - where he could settle]</b> I love it here. I have been very lucky in my career to experience some beautiful cities: Belgrade, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and now Berlin. From the first minute I came to <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha</a>, I felt very welcome. I am very settled here<br /><br /><b>[<a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha</a> went into the winter break 12th in the table]</b> It was a difficult start. We lost some games and, as a young team, our confidence dropped. But we knew if we could continue to work hard, we could improve our position<br /><br /><b>[One of <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Jurgen Klinsmann</a>’s first acts was to tell Grujic he would play a key role]</b> Of course, it’s exciting. Two Jurgen Ks as your two managers, eh?! They’re both big names, and it is big for me to work under such coaches. He (Klinsmann) is a proper legend in Germany. He was very positive when he came in and gave me a lot of confidence, so to be able to learn from him and work under him is an honour<br /><br /><b>[As for <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, he remains in regular contact. Grujic knows that if he performs well, there will be a WhatsApp message coming his way]</b> It sounds small but for a young player it means a lot, believe me<br /><br /><b>[He freely admits himself, he has a lot to do if he’s to become a first-team regular at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>]</b> I know it’s going to be tough. I’m not stupid. I know that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> right now are an unbelievable team, the best team in the world. So, I know that I have to be at a very high level if I want to have a chance. That’s why I watch as many of their games as I can, to learn and to see the level. I know improvement is the only thing that can help me. And it’s why I could accept that I needed to go somewhere to play regularly this season. I needed minutes, I needed to learn the game, when to defend, when to attack, where to be on the pitch. I want to improve every part of my game. Defending is a big part, because when you look at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, they defend like hell! Every player is fighting for every inch of the pitch, which is so impressive. Sometimes I get tired just watching them! Jordan, Gini, Fab, Milner - they are all huge role models for a player like me. The job they do is so underrated, and their levels are so high. They play with such intensity, every game. That is what I have to aspire to. Next season, who knows, hopefully I am ready to jump up with the team. That is what I hope for.<br /><br /><b>[Grujic was in Madrid when <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were crowned European champions back in June]</b> I had a video chat with <a href="dejan-lovren.html">Dejan Lovren</a> from the party, though. so I got to experience a bit of the atmosphere at least! And just being there before the game, that was so special. The whole city was red<br /><br /><b>[Was it difficult, then, to head out on loan once more a few weeks later, to turn his back on the chance to be part of further success this season?]</b> No. It would be easy to get frustrated and wonder why you are out on loan, but I don’t see it that way. We are talking about the best team in the world, don’t forget. And they expect to win every game. Their standard is as high as it can be, and not every player can be there right away. There are some great young players, such as Trent or <a href="joe-gomez.html">Joe Gomez</a>, who can do it, but others have to get there in a different way. I look at <a href="harry-wilson.html">Harry Wilson</a>, an unbelievable player, and myself quite similarly. We are striving to get to that level, but we needed to go and play football to do it. It doesn’t just happen overnight. It’s better for me, at this age, to be playing. If I am 25 or 26, then yes, it’s time for me to see if I am a rotation player at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or whatever. But, at 23, I have to make an impact, I have to learn. I have to play regularly, I have to test myself, learn about my body, what it can handle. It’s about finding out who I am, what kind of player I am</p>

It’s honestly hard to get a chance<br /><br />I hope that will happen in the next few months. I’m sure we will sit down and discuss what is best for the club and what is best for me.

Is the best thing to stay in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and wait for a chance or is it time to have another loan or move to another club? At the moment, I don’t know the answer.

Having waited so long to win the title and with it being so close, I can imagine how all the fans in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are feeling right now. It’s bit unfair for the team as it was 99 per cent certain they would win it. They played so many great games and built up such a big lead at the top. Now they have to wait. The timing is bad luck but that’s how it is. We shouldn’t think too much about football at this time because there are more important things in life like people’s health</p>
