  <p><b>[The National Women’s Soccer League has announced that the Boston Breakers will cease operations]</b> In the best interest for the long-term viability of the NWSL, we will operate with nine clubs in 2018 to ensure a stronger league where all parties involved are aligned and committed to the core mission of continued growth and development as we move into our sixth season.<br /><br />We do not doubt the fan support or interest in women’s soccer in Boston or New England, and the measure taken by the Breakers organization does not reflect the passion we have seen from our fans. We sincerely thank you for your years of commitment, and we look forward to one day returning to the city of Boston</p>
