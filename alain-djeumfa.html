<blockquote>
  <p>[Alain Djeumfa has refused to criticise his players amidst controversy surrounding the Indominable Lionesses behaviour in their World Cup game against England. The Cameroon side reacted angrily to England’s second goal in a 3-0 win, scored by <a href="ellen-white.html">Ellen White</a>. White was adjudged offside but VAR overturned that decision] I think that’s wrong, I think that’s your feeling. Ultimately I think my players were examples, and occasionally when you are in a state of shock you can lose your cool. I don’t think the players refused and I think they showed professionalism<br /><br />[He claimed that England’s first goal, scored from an indirect free-kick six yards out by <a href="steph-houghton.html">Steph Houghton</a> after a back-pass, was the catalyst for his players’s feelings, but again praised their efforts, while condemning the officials] Once we conceded the opening goal from the indirect free-kick in the penalty area, which I thought was the wrong decision, I realised it was slipping away. Then we had to make sure we didn’t concede another goal in the opening 20 minutes. Unfortunately the officials wanted something else and from that moment on, the girls perhaps lost their temper. We need to take our hats off, despite the refereeing mistakes, for the performances. Football is all about fair play and we showed fair play, that’s football<br /><br />[The Cameroon boss believed his players may have had justification if they had stopped playing] We might have had a moment to walk off but thank God I was able to remain calm, because I know what I am like as a person. Ultimately I was able to keep my cool. There was a lot of passion going on but I was able to keep calm</p>
