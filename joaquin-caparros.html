  <p><b>[Arsenal told it will take £35m to land Steven N’Zonzi]</b> Is that a rumour or is it true? Has Unai Emery called you? Well, as a successful man, Unai Emery knows what line the club keeps. If he wants N’Zonzi, he will have to call and put the bid in. And the bid is the clause. If you put that bid in, then there are no more negotiations <b>[over the fee]</b>. We could even extend the contract, if the coach gives the green light. Everything is possible</p>

  <p><b>[Michy Batshuayi is among the transfer targets being considered by Sevilla]</b> For Sevilla, few footballers are out of reach. It is true some of them could be economically impossible, but other ways can be found to sign him. Everything is open, and we can’t say no because then maybe they can come and we can get them. Absolutely nothing is discarded.</p>

  <p><b>[Sevilla’s sporting director Joaquin Caparros has warned that the worst anyone can do is piss off Lionel Messi]</b> Messi is not to be pissed off. Messi is like a lion. A lion has to be caressed and you can put your hand in his mouth and he will not bite. But if you touch his claws, a lion can tear your head off<br /><br />Our goal is to be in the Champions League with the players we have, with hungry kids. We have to be among the top four but we will never give up anything</p>

  <p><b>[Seville will trigger the purchase option in Andre Silva’s loan from AC Milan]</b> The fans can rest assured, the player will stay with us with a contract for many seasons. We have the will and the opportunity to keep the player here. Milan can say what they want, they’re looking at him again as are many other clubs who want him, but no-one can do anything. We have this option to buy and at the end of the season, or even before, we’ll exercise it.</p>

  <p><b>[Sevilla manager Joaquin Caparros has confirmed he has been diagnosed with chronic leukemia]</b> It doesn’t impede my work. I am going about my daily life - on a day to day level, for training. I want to enjoy my work. I want to thank the players and the chairman. I am not receiving any treatment, everyone can be assured that I am not receiving any treatment</p>

  <p><b>[Andre Silva’s future will not be at Sevilla]</b> Andre Silva won’t be ready <b>[to face Atletico Madrid on Sunday]</b>. This a matter to discuss. He had a good start to the season and now he’s gone two months without playing. I assume Portugal won’t call him up. It would be bad for him and his recovery. I imagine they will take Sevilla’s medical data in good faith and that UEFA will agree with that. I hope Portugal don’t call him and that they respect our medical reports. If he goes with his national team this summer… the people of Seville won’t understand. He has an issue with his patella that is being treated. I don’t think they’ll call him up. Surely the medical report of the club that is paying him will be prioritised. The only thing that would see the player’s reputation called into question is whether he ends up with his national team at the beginning of June. We are not stupid</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> coach <a href="joaquin.html">Joaquin</a> Caparros says <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a> is a born winner who deserves to become Spain’s record caps-holder]</b> He’s a born winner, with a great personality since he was young. He’s always had a great talent that has allowed him to reach these figures. He arrived at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> at a very young age and if it wasn’t for his personality and clarity of ideas he wouldn’t have achieved so much <b>[in his career]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[Caparros says the player has always demonstrated the right attitude when it comes to chasing honours]</b> All the youth coaches at <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> were really on the lookout for <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a>. He always wanted to play and he listened very attentively to the older players, you would always see him with exemplar professionals like Pablo Alfaro, Javi Navarro or Pep Marti. It’s no coincidence that he’s got this far <b>[in his career]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[Caparros believes more recent criticism of Ramos’ form for Madrid, particularly in 2019, is to be expected of someone who has delivered much to a demanding fan base]</b> Winning everything is in the DNA of the club and <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a> is a <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> icon. Therefore, it’s normal that the focus is on him. The hunger of <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a> to overcome every kind of situation serves him well in confronting negative spells. Criticism is normal at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> but, from my point of view, the problem is more collective than individual in regards to Sergio</p>
