  <p><b>[<a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> coach <a href="joaquin.html">Joaquin</a> Caparros says <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a> is a born winner who deserves to become Spain’s record caps-holder]</b> He’s a born winner, with a great personality since he was young. He’s always had a great talent that has allowed him to reach these figures. He arrived at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> at a very young age and if it wasn’t for his personality and clarity of ideas he wouldn’t have achieved so much <b>[in his career]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[Caparros says the player has always demonstrated the right attitude when it comes to chasing honours]</b> All the youth coaches at <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> were really on the lookout for <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a>. He always wanted to play and he listened very attentively to the older players, you would always see him with exemplar professionals like Pablo Alfaro, Javi Navarro or Pep Marti. It’s no coincidence that he’s got this far <b>[in his career]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[Caparros believes more recent criticism of Ramos’ form for Madrid, particularly in 2019, is to be expected of someone who has delivered much to a demanding fan base]</b> Winning everything is in the DNA of the club and <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a> is a <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> icon. Therefore, it’s normal that the focus is on him. The hunger of <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a> to overcome every kind of situation serves him well in confronting negative spells. Criticism is normal at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> but, from my point of view, the problem is more collective than individual in regards to Sergio</p>
