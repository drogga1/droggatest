He has to breathe the game, he has to understand when it’s time to make a sub or take off his best player because the team needs a different kind of player. The perception is different from the sideline. They’re making out football to be an exact science. If that’s the case, the coach may as well go to the cinema. If you mechanise everything, you no longer have thinking players. If the players are used to going through that door and the door is locked, they’ll end up banging their heads against it. If the players are used to thinking for themselves, they’ll try to find another way out</p>

  <p><b>[Massimiliano Allegri believes the tactics that dominate Italian football are bullsh<em>t]&lt;/b&gt; When the ball gets to <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, <b>[Paulo]</b> <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a>, Ronaldinho, <b>[Clarence]</b> <a href="clarence-seedorf.html">Seedorf</a> or <b>[Andrea]</b> <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Pirlo</a>, I have to put the other players in a position to get the ball to them. Once they have the ball they decide what to do with it, what the best decision is. My son is eight and every now and then we go on YouTube and watch the great players, the amazing things they do in attack and in defence, because football is art. In Italy, the tactics, schemes, they’re all bullsh</em>t. Football is art and the artists are the world-class players. You don’t have to teach them anything, you just admire them. All you need to do is put them in the best condition to do well. I love it when I see a great player do something amazing. On the bench, I’m a spectator watching a show put on by someone, and that someone is a player<br /><br />In my ignorance I don’t even have a computer. I’ve got an iPad that <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> gave me. I watch games on it, pull up some stats. Fortunately I’ve got a good memory and I manage to remember what happens in games.

  <p><b>[Massimiliano Allegri speaks about growing up watching horse racing]</b> Federico Tesio, one of the greatest horse trainers ever, always used to say you need to go and see the horses in the morning and watch how they move their legs. It’s the same thing with players. You go and see the players and you watch how they move their legs. That’s how you find out whether they’re in good shape or not. Then you go inside <b>[the training facility]</b>, you get the stats and see if they confirm what you saw or not</p>

  <p><b>[Allegri on his future plans]</b> In September I need to come back. If I don’t I’ll get too used to being on holiday and I’ll never work again! I still have three more months of holiday and that’s good for me<br /><br /><b>[when quizzed whether he has been approached by <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> to replace Thomas Tuchel]</b> I won’t speak about my future, because there isn’t anything to talk about for now, and also because it would be disrespectful to the other coaches to do so<br /><br /><b>[he said of his philosophy]</b> Football is a question of mentality. You need to be strong mentally and make sacrifices. <b>[Cristiano]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is an example of that. There are good players with lots of talent who stay at the same level because they don’t have the mental strength<br /><br />Right now, <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, since he left <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, has made gigantic leaps forward. The great managers understand what kind of team they have in front of them, what kind of players they have, and to make them play as well as they can</p>
