This season it will be, right from the beginning, important to get points and compete against those rivals. One of the intriguing things is that it’s not like last year. You’re playing against five or more teams that are competing for the Scudetto, so it will be much more competitive.<br /><br />The club has already moved to acquire young, promising players - the likes of Douglas Costa, the likes of De Sciglio, and so on and so forth. We have already strengthened our team. We have won the past six Scudetti in a row. Obviously winning the seventh one won’t be easy. Certainly we’d like to compete for that, and the other teams aren’t standing pat watching us in the market and not competing.<br /><br />They’re out to nip on our heels and get to where we are, so we had to strengthen the team. We have a month left and if the opportunity arises to add pieces that strengthen the club, so be it.

  <p><b>[Allegri happy with Juventus new boy’s debut in thrilling win]</b> Cristiano Ronaldo held out well physically, has only been training with us for seven days and did really well. It’s a pity he wasn’t able to score a goal. It depends on the characteristics of the players near him. Ronaldo had several shots on target today, Sorrentino made several saves, there were also some good movements that were not rewarded by the midfielders. Those are movements that must be read from the back with the ball provided in the right spot. I was most impressed that Ronaldo settled in to the team, he was very happy in the dressing room and had his chances. The main problem tonight was we let the concentration levels drop and we simply cannot afford to do that.<br /><br /><b>[On Sami Khedira]</b> Khedira is a player beyond reproach. He scored nine goals last season, immediately got one today. I heard a lot of criticism since he’s been at Juventus and he always replied on the pitch. He’s one of those players who understands the tempo of the game and you miss him when he’s not there. Joao Cancelo had a good first half, then after the penalty - which can happen - he let his head drop and almost seemed to feel guilty. These things can happen, the important thing is to react to them. When you have as much quality as we do, including Alex Sandro and Cancelo at full-back, you need to finish off the game earlier. We had the chances and dominated possession, but didn’t finish it. It’s a different approach to the attack and supply when Ronaldo is there compared to <b>[Mario]</b> Mandzukic. I saw some positive things, others less positive. In the first half we got stretched out and there was no reason for it. We had to remain organised. We were caught napping on the equaliser and did better with Bernardeschi and Mandzukic coming on towards the end. We need to find balance, but the most important thing is not to fall asleep when we’re doing well</p>

It’s much easier to get kids passionate about that rather than explaining tactics to them.

Empoli are tough to play against, as they had one centre-forward, two trequartistas and the wingers that had pace, so we had to be wary of the counter and that is how they scored the goal. In the second half, we created many chances and deserved the victory, but we have to tip our hats to Empoli for being so well-organised and impressive. I left at the end because there were five seconds to go and we would either win or equalise, there was no other option</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus may be comfortably clear of their rivals at the top of Serie A but their 2-0 loss against Atletico Madrid in the first leg of the Champions League last 16 has prompted concerns for Allegri’s future]</b> I met with the president yesterday for dinner. We are two intelligent people who have built something important in these five years together. There is no quarrel. We talked, we ate well, and we decided that, given how things are going, we’ll talk about the renewal of the contract after the season, as we have always done</p>

If we do go through, it’s not as if we’ve won the Champions League, as there are other games. We need calm and to take it one game at a time. If we manage to overturn the first leg result, it will be extraordinary. After that we either think about the quarter-finals or ending the season on the right note.</p>

He’s a lovely guy and suffered so much, out of action for practically a year with that injury, so he deserves it.<br /><br />I expected a different Juventus. We did not put in a good performance, we made some mistakes and then the first goal came out of nowhere. Much like the Coppa Italia defeat to Atalanta, however, we picked the right time to lose, because it’s just before the break for international duty, so we have time to unplug and rest. Inevitably, the effort we put in against Atletico Madrid <b>[in the Champions League]</b> on Tuesday night weighed on us. We ran some risks in the first half but did better after the break. Once we seemed to be in control, that’s when he conceded and the game changed. You can’t play every game to the best of your abilities. I think, if anything, this defeat can do us good and wake us up. We thought that we’d already won the Scudetto, but that is not the case. We need another five wins and must now hope that Napoli drop some points. It’s impossible to win every game, I’ve said that since the start, so no need to make a drama out of it. We’ve played 28 games, won 24 and drawn three. That’s not bad</p>

I’ve always said that to win the Champions League, you need to reach a certain stage in good form and with good fitness levels. We’ve been in a bit of an emergency situation for a while and that can only be sustained for so long. We were missing four or five players tonight. Daniele Rugani and Leonardo Bonucci had good games for 50 minutes or so, but we lost our unity and organisation, giving Ajax the advantage. <b>[Matthijs]</b> De Ligt was meant to be man-marked, but he got away.

We had a lot of players struggling with fitness issues and the two legs were only a week apart. We had a young player like <b>[Moise]</b> Kean in the second half, but there’s a knock-on effect, as it allowed <b>[Frenkie]</b> De Jong more time on the ball and Ajax took control.

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo has been likened to Zlatan Ibrahimovic by Massimiliano Allegri]</b> In terms of mentality, he is stronger than anyone else. Every day he finds personal objectives to hit and he can find them within himself. A player who has won everything he has at the age of 34 will find it difficult to feel hungry, but he is deadly in that sense. He has this determination that is incredible. We should all learn from Ronaldo, and I too have learned, because it’s not everyone who gets to work with the best player in the world.<br /><br />For example, on Saturday morning we have a game between ranks in training. He has fun, but his fun is winning the game. I explained it to him, and I’ve written the same about Ibra in the book, his idea of fun is winning, but I told him not everyone is like that and for some there’s fun in a back-heel flick, a cheeky move, etc. And then later you bring that into the match situation.<br /><br />I had Ibra at Milan, who every day would get angry about a misplaced pass and I told him that if everyone was as talented as him, there would be no problems. I told him he was the one who had to put himself at the disposal of the others, just as the best and most talented must always do with his peers. It’s difficult for the others to climb up to that level, so you must have the humility to not make it difficult for whoever is below you. That’s true of life and not just in football, so in that sense Ronaldo is very good</p>
