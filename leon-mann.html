<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Football Black List announces new LGBT+ award]</b> We need to recognise those experiences that are different within the black community. We will now have an LGBT+ award at the Football Black List. Intersectionality is vital to recognise, to celebrate, to support and show that people within our black community have different experiences. We’re at a point now where the talk has got to move to what are we going to do now and when? I really hope there are some leaders watching this who begin to get it, and understand that dynamic of change. If as a leader you’re failing to make that change happen, then you need to become accountable.<br /><br />I do understand some people are at a different part of their journey. It’s our duty and it’s what any right-thinking organisation should be doing - challenging those unacceptable views, and educating people and being part of the change. It’s a really proud moment. Black LGBT+ people are central to our community. Black disabled people are central to our community. We bring people together to celebrate the achievements of our community and that includes every single area of our community</p>
