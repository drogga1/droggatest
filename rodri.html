In the last five or six years City have changed the story - not only in Manchester but in England. I love the City, I love Manchester and it’s becoming more blue! I am a lucky guy because I have been playing with lots of teams different kind of playing.

I don’t watch too much football, but in England I try to watch City matches. Since Pep has arrived, it was quite a radical change to the way City play. They have become one of the most feared teams in Europe. City don’t just play pretty football, they can hurt you in the final third and score goals. They have a real respect in this country and Europe. I think City are in the top two or three teams in the world. They make even good teams change their style of play when they come up against them and that is a good indication.<br /><br />Who else makes the top three? I prefer to talk about City but football is about opinions. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> having won the Champions League, you have to say they are up there. City have achieved an awful lot and what they have won in England is fantastic. I think they are just a small step away from reproducing that in Europe.

Let’s see how I can learn. You take a look back and see what he won, and you want to win the same things. I need to look at what he says and teaches me - that’s why I came here. He has already told me what I have to do with the ball, how can I find my team-mates, many things. I cannot explain now but you will see over the season. I will adapt to this team. We don’t talk much after the game but before he told me what I have to do on the pitch, how I focus on the defensive and offensive side. It’s not easy, I have to adapt my way of playing to the team.

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s record-breaking signing Rodri Hernandez says he is strong enough to cope with the demands of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> after moving from <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>]</b> The only truth was I had a later development. I wasn’t developed like my team-mates. It was one or two years later, so I wasn’t big and strong when I was 16 or 17 but I decided to move for many other reasons. I’m happy for that because maybe I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t move to <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> in that moment. Football is changing now. It’s getting more physical, of course in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. It’s good for me to have that physique in the position I play. One of the things the team can get is more physical. We have lots of players that are great or small. You never know if it’s good or bad but having a mix of players is always good. You don’t win only playing good, you need more things and that’s why teams are changing their philosophy. I noticed years ago that I had to become both a defensive and attacking player if I wanted to be good enough to be in Manchester<br /><br />I watched the big teams in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> the most. I like the way they play. I think they’re the only team in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> that plays differently and shows another type of football<br /><br />I didn’t sign here because Pep is here. I come here because I think for my career it is the best team and where I think I’m going to win. Pep being here helps me to make the decision, but it wasn’t a big part of the decision<br /><br />I thought when I arrived from <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> I thought I ran a lot. When I arrived at Atletico, I thought ‘oh no’. I ran a lot, and then here against <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> I ran a lot again. It doesn’t matter where you are, you have different kinds of play but you have to do your best. Football is getting more equal, you have to run a lot in my position. I waste all my energy in matches<br /><br /><b>[<a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> famously declared during his first season at City that he is ‘not a coach for the tackles’ and in Rodri he has added a midfielder who prefers to win the ball in other ways too]</b> I’m not used to tackles. I steal the ball in another way. I see other players always go down or tackle but I’m very big. If I go to ground I waste a lot of time before I can go again so I have another way to steal balls. I like to look to players like me and I always consider that <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a> has been in the top five or six midfielders. You don’t stay six years at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> always playing if you’re not a good player. He gave the team what no-one gave - the strength, the power to steal balls - and that’s important<br /><br />When you play in that position, it doesn’t matter how old you are or how good you are, you have to lead the team because you are in the middle. You know where your team-mates are, whereas wingers don’t look at all the pitch so midfield needs to lead. I’m young but I think I can have this role in this team. I know I have great players like <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> but in my role I have to lead in these situations<br /><br /><b>[Having to got to know the playmaking legend with the national team, Rodri set out his ambition of helping Silva to land the trophy he’s not yet delivered for City, the Champions League, in his final year at the club]</b> He’s a great guy and I think he’s been one of the greatest Spanish players in the last 10 years. He has one year left here, let’s see what happens. I will try to learn as much as possible because he’s one of these players with high quality and he is helping me a lot here in Manchester. A dream for me would be we have success together and we win the Champions League. When you arrive at this level there are only five or six teams that compete with you at such a top level. It’s our goal of course, winning trophies in every competition we play in. But there are many factors to consider. You have to do a good season and be in the exact place in the exact moment. Let’s see how the season develops but I look at people and they are great players that have won many things and want to win the Champions League</p>

He’s a very important player for the team and it’s going to be tough without him. We’ve lost two big players. Leroy and now Aymer. It doesn’t look very good but let’s see what it is. And then we have to keep on working. This is football, this is how it works but I think we have enough in the team to cope with it.

But we lost because of our mistakes, and we can learn from that and not repeat it again in the next matches. I don’t know if people trust us or not, but we are a team. We are always a team, when we win and when we lose. You’re going to see the best version of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. Normally when you get these matches, in the next one you kill the opponents. So that’s what we’re going to do in the next match, we’re going to kill our opponents.

I would like to score in a different situation, of course. But the good thing about today is that we tried all the time. We weren’t good in both areas, we weren’t very effective defensively or offensively, and that’s the most important part of football - don’t let in goals, and score them! Today wasn’t good for us. We have to keep going. We have the best players in the world, so people have to be calm. We are the champions, and we are going to fix this situation</p>

The Spaniard said on the back of a 2-1 defeat to arch-rivals United]</b> We are pissed off by it but there is no point (talking) for us. We have to keep fighting and don’t focus on these things. It is other people’s jobs - we can’t scream. Some decisions can change matches and VAR is there for getting decisions (right). It is not an excuse for us<br /><br />I would tell the supporters to stay behind us because we have other things this year, other cups. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is like this - physically and mentally we have to get the team back because we are a bit down now. Things are not going as we want and we have had lots of injuries as well. It’s difficult but we have to fight until the end. It’s been a tough beginning to the season. We have other cups, other goals which are interesting</p>

  <p><b>[Rodri feels fortunate to have worked with ‘two of the best’ in <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> &amp; <a href="diego-simeone.html">Diego Simeone</a>]</b> <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a> and <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> are two opposites. To be just 23 and to have had two of the best coaches of this era work with you, it has helped me to grow a lot, in the defensive phase and in the offensive. We know that each of them has a different way of watching football, but they are both winners, they work 24 hours a day to improve the players <b>[…]</b> both are very good. <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a> is consistency and perseverance. <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> is innovative, growing day by day<br /><br />City is an exciting project, one of the biggest clubs in Europe. It is a dream to be here at an individual level, a challenge to grow as a player and a new experience in a new league like <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, which has a great impact on a global stage. I’m really happy<br /><br /><b>[On his role models]</b> <b>[<a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine</a>]</b> <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> was an idol when I was little, but it is true that given my characteristics, I do not have the profile of <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>. He played from three-quarters forward, with more imagination and less responsibility. In my place on the field, I have more responsibility. I look at <a href="xabi-alonso.html">Xabi Alonso</a>, <b>[Sergio]</b> <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Busquets</a>, players who have been a great example of how to improve.<br /><br />On an individual basis I can say that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are the best team I have faced. They dominate at both ends of the field, they are very aggressive. They dominate the lines well and that makes them a fearsome team. They are very good, but anyone can beat him so we are going to fight until the end. I don’t know if the goal is to beat <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, who are European champions, as I think you always have to focus on yourself. If we focus on <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> too much we are wrong. We would better looking at ourselves and play as we did at Atleti under <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a>, game by game. You can’t stop competing and that’s what <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> instils in us every day, that every game is a final</p>

  <p><b>[Rodri also spoke about using tactical fouling as a method to suppress the counter-attack]</b> We have lots of offensive players and many other teams try to counterattack you and a lot of the time you’re alone but it’s good for me. I am learning new things, how to go, when to stay, when I have to do a tactical foul, when I have to jump. It’s good for me to learn these things. And for the team it’s good because we need those offensive players to be able to play our game</p>

  <p><b>[Rodri says <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> preparing to push ‘reset’ button ahead of 2020-21 campaign]</b> Every season this team does a reset and tries to fight for everything and this is not easy, when there are people here that have won this competition four or five times. For me is the first time, but the rest need to regenerate and renew their motivation every season. That’s the only way to keep growing and improving<br /><br />It’s a surprise for me! I’m not used to scoring goals but if it happens and it helps the team and it is a final and to win it, it’s something fantastic. But what makes me happier is that we’ve won a trophy and personally I’m growing and feeling very involved in this squad full of great people and amazing professionals<br /><br /><b>[About welcoming <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> to the Etihad]</b> It’s been a very important week for us, but this is not over yet. We still have a few months of the season to go and that great result in the Champions League and the fighting spirit of the team says lots of good things about us, a team that never surrenders. Winning the Carabao Cup three times in succession speaks a lot about our ambition, and our collective desire to keep winning</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> midfielder Rodri salutes <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s amazing campaign]</b> Sometimes football is like this. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have been amazing this season in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. They have focused their entire mentality on <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> only and in these situations the only thing you can do is clap. But we’ve had many problems this year. We have had lots of injuries and important players out but it’s not been a bad season for us - we’re second. OK, it’s not where we want to be but sometimes it’s like this and we have to keep going. I think we are proud of the season we’ve done. We already have two titles (Community Shield and Carabao Cup) and we have a chance to get another two including the Champions League.<br /><br />For me it’s a dream. You never know if you’re going to have the experience of playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> for this huge club that is City. I am so, so happy to have made this decision and it’s been an incredible year for me. I’ve learned a lot, I’ve won a title and we’re still alive in other competitions. The environment of the stadiums, you feel that the people here in England breathe football. For me it’s incredible and I’m so happy</p>

  <p><b>[From <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> midfield to university homework, Rodri is making the most of lockdown]</b> It’s a very difficult situation for everyone, not only in Spain, but around the whole world. We don’t know exactly what’s going on, how many people are infected, nobody knows what’s going to happen next. We all have someone close, a friend or a family member, who has been touched somehow by the coronavirus, so it’s not easy. We try to spend our time in the best way possible. I used the time to do homework from my university degree, as there are exams in a few days’ time. On top of that, obviously, I have been training and keeping fit. I’m sure it’s going to be helpful in the future one way or another. You never know. When I finish my career as a player I’d like to stay in contact with the sports world<br /><br />To me, <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> is the best coach in the world, his success speaks for itself. It helps me a lot that he played in the same position as me. It’s not easy for me as a young player, coming from <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>, to fit in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> with such competition, <b>[where it’s]</b> so strong physically, with great teams, but it has been an amazing experience this first season. I have learnt a lot and I have enjoyed it because we have won two trophies so far <b>[Community Shield and Carabao Cup]</b> and we are still able to win two more, <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup and the Champions League. I try to learn every day from him. He has helped me a lot, especially tactically. It’s been the first time I played alone as a holding midfielder, so I have to adapt to the new situation. I’m happy because I fit very well with the team and the club. I feel I’m growing every day.<br /><br /><a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a> is now playing more often as a centre-back so that he can have a bigger picture of the game. He has helped me a lot from the back, where to find the spaces, etc. What I learnt the most from him is the experience he has. He’s 35-years-old, he has been at the club for seven seasons now, so I listen to him a lot and try to learn a lot from him</p>

  <p><b>[Rodri says <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> are better than <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> but Champions League progress isn’t guaranteed]</b> I don’t trust any scoreline against Madrid, even though we won 2-1. It is Madrid and they are far from finished. We have a better team and we showed it in the first leg, but there is one step to take. We have to respect our opponents, we have to go for the victory because, if not, we will be in trouble. Eliminating Madrid, who have won three Champions League titles in a row and have been so powerful in recent years in Europe, would give us a lot of morale and confidence to say that it can be done. But there are great teams in Europe, not just Madrid<br /><br /><b>[Rodri swapped <a href="diego-simeone.html">Diego Simeone</a> for <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>]</b> Many people think that they are polar opposites and that they have nothing in common, but I see similarities. They are very intense, very hard-working, they make you do your best every day, they take training as if it were competition because it is an opportunity to learn, they love you 100 per cent. From there, each one has his way of understanding football and putting it across. I am lucky because working with both of them has made me a more complete player</p>
