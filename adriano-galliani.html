  <p><b>[If Baggio is Raffaello, who was <a href="marco-van-basten.html">Marco van Basten</a>?]</b> Leonardo da Vinci. He was everything. Engineer and artist<br /><br /><b>[Beyond the pitch, they were Galacticos before the term was invented]</b> They were two great teams that played a crucial role in the evolution of the sport. But I coached the best team in history<br /><br /><b>[he looks back on those times with a wry smile]</b> I was a young coach. And, as you know, Mr Nobody can’t have a past, he can only have a future. They asked me how can I be expected to coach footballers if I never played at a professional level. I used to say to them, ‘I didn’t know that if you wanted to be a jockey, you had to have been a horse in a previous life<br /><br /><b>[Berlusconi had worked hard on <a href="arrigo-sacchi.html">Sacchi</a>, boasting to him of Van Basten and <a href="ruud-gullit.html">Gullit</a>’s arrival]</b> He was very passionate, he wanted football to be played in the right way. I liked him, I liked his energy, his enthusiasm. His big thing was always that he didn’t just want to win, he wanted to show everyone you could win by playing well, that you could be good at winning<br /><br /><b>[Galliani had felt the need to forewarn the assembled hacks that]</b> <a href="ruud-gullit.html">Gullit</a> is used to saying what he thinks. What will happen if Milan don’t qualify for Europe? That’s an absurd question, we’ll see what happens at the end of the season. If, if, if … hey, if my mother had a cock she’d be my father<br /><br /><b>[Talking now, <a href="arrigo-sacchi.html">Sacchi</a> denies there was ever any problem getting his new charges to adapt to his tactics]</b> There wasn’t resistance as such, it was more a little bit of scepticism. The players weren’t really sure where this was all leading. <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Paolo Maldini</a> was 19 at the time of <a href="arrigo-sacchi.html">Sacchi</a>’s arrival: It was intense. I used to get home at night feeling exhausted. It was a disaster. Everything was really difficult<br /><br /><b>[He would stay with Milan for another season, but by early 1991 there was a progressively chilly atmosphere at the club. <a href="arrigo-sacchi.html">Sacchi</a> would claim that the hunger was no longer there]</b> If someone’s hungry and they have something to eat, look what happens. And then look what happens if it’s the first time they’ve eaten anything in years<br /><br /><b>[Pressing high up the pitch: it all seems so obvious now. Looking back, <a href="arrigo-sacchi.html">Sacchi</a> makes a telling point when asked about the Dutch trio and whether we have a tendency to place too much emphasis on them at the expense of the rest of that glorious group of players]</b> It wasn’t just the Dutch, or the squad, though they were magnificent. It was the system of play. The system was ultimately the leader out on the pitch; it never got injured or tired. It wasn’t the players who won all those big games. It was the way we played</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> CEO Adriano Galliani has claimed Mauro Icardi’s agent, Wanda Nara, is the victim of ‘machismo’ in football]</b> The Icardi saga has been amplified by the machismo that governs the world of football. Whenever Wanda Nara opens her mouth, a hurricane is unleashed. Yet if great agents like Mino Raiola or Jorge Mendes behaved in the same way, no one would complain. Icardi, however, is a very good striker. If I could, I’d take him right away<br /><br /><b>[However, <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> and city rivals Intermilan have fallen far short of Juventus in recent times, something Galliani hopes will change soon]</b> Intermilan won the Treble in 2010, and the following year <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> won the Scudetto. Since then, there have been eight years of Juventus domination. I hope the city of Milan can return to its golden era of the 1960s, when both teams won two European Cups. I hope that it also becomes the locomotive of Italy in football terms, as it has in terms of the economy<br /><br />I’m emotionally attached to Vincenzo Montella, who is the last coach to lift a trophy with Milan. I still have the picture on my phone of when we lifted the Supercoppa in Doha in 2016. We’ll go out at the Franchi taking everything in our stride</p>

  <p><b>[Milan chief executive Adriano Galliani says Zlatan Ibrahimovic did not want to leave the club when he was sold in 2012, conceding that the striker was moved on in order to balance the books]</b> Ibra certainly did not want to leave Milan. He was sold to balance the books. He has always been the one to decide his destiny, except on that occasion. Together we won the Scudetto his first year, the last for Milan before Juventus started their record-breaking run, and the Supercoppa Italiana in 2011. In January 2012, it was all done for Alexandre Pato to join PSG and we’d bring Carlos Tevez in from Manchester City. What a dream pairing, Ibra-Tevez! The whole deal fell apart and who knows what could’ve happened? I think we would’ve continued winning, as at that time we were still in front of Juve. History changed, Milan finished second and in the summer of 2012, the old guard moved on<br /><br /><b>[Galliani admits that Ibrahimovic was not happy at being forced to leave]</b> He wasn’t talking to me for a while. Once he got over the disappointment of having to leave Milan, he gave an interview in which he spoke highly of me and our relationship</p>

The 2020-21 season could begin in February 2021, the same thing the following year.<br /><br />After that, you can also go back to old habits, but I’m sure that in two years we will be convinced that this represents a good solution.

Only the virus can decide the timing. It’s very difficult, because one day we must return to training with the football and that’ll take another four weeks before they are ready to play, so I don’t know when the league could resume<br /><br />What I can say is that with the debts that some clubs have and the loss of revenue, it would be a dramatic situation. Several Italian clubs risk bankruptcy without new revenue. Nobody is able to sustain a long-term suspension of football</p>
