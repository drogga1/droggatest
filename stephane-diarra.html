<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Le Mans starlet Stephane Diarra admits that he is flattered by reported interest from the Premier League]</b> I’m still young and the most important thing is to play. My goal is to play as many games as possible. It’s good to know that several clubs follow you, but leaving Le Mans this winter? I don’t know. I need to stay focused on my season. I’ll watch what is going on and we will see<br /><br />There have been ups and downs in my career but I adjusted quickly to Ligue 2. There was a little dip when I was at Rennes where I didn’t play at a high level. But at Le Mans, when I was on loan, everything started going in the right direction. I have to progress in a lot of areas but especially on efficiency – that’s the biggest point for me. I have to do more and work on my final ball. Things are good today but not good enough</p>
