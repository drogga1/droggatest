  <p><b>[Jose Juan Macias scored more goals than any Mexican in Liga MX this season. He helped Leon into the Liga MX final]</b> The team isn’t complete. I have absences, injuries. I would’ve liked to have everybody in shape. At the same time, I know the XI I’m going to put out there. Obviously I’d really like for the team to once again have those finer details that we were able to show in the regular season. We showed them against Xolos as well, but with America we were stuck a bit<br /><br />I have a tactical idea that I’ve been expressing in the team. I’ve achieved that at other clubs as well, but not at this level. I’m going to give everything for this title. I’ve been looking at Tigres from A-Z</p>
