  <p><b>[An open letter signed by Barcelona’s eight (living) current and previous presidents]</b> With <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> we <b>[Barça]</b> began to play differently, breaking new ground and innovating. With him, both as a player and coach, we established our own style on the field, what is traditionally known as ‘total football,’ the Barça style everyone admires. The arrival of <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> altered the history of Barça. He contributed decisively to a change of mentality. He got us to keep our heads up and to see that no opponent was invincible, that we could attain what we were aiming for. <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> was an icon who explained, better than anyone, that Barça is more than a club. He did it simply and based in reality, and always moving forward. Without <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>’s unabashed and non-conformist spirit, we quite possibly wouldn’t have become the greatest club in the world. So, again, thank you, Johan.

In fact, on Tuesday he received medical discharge from the Club’s Medical Services and, therefore, Ernesto Valverde can already count on him. The 20-year-old will be able to play again, three and a half months after the rupture of the tendon of the femoral biceps in his left thigh, an injury that occurred against Getafe on September 16. Despite the need for an operation in Finland, Dembele quickly started his recovery process and began doing specific work at the Ciutat Esportiva on December 6, ending on January 2. Before the injury, he played against Espanyol and Juventus in his first games as a Blaugrana. Despite just a few minutes, he registered his first assist to Suarez, for Barca’s fifth goal against their rivals in the derby. #DembeleIsBack is now a reality.</dt>

The team also scored in 37 consecutive matches in the league, the run only coming to an end last Sunday against Athletic Club. In his 96 games as Barca coach Valverde has seen his team score 233 goals whilst only conceding 78 (45 clean sheets).<br /><br />Leo Messi is top scorer in the Valverde era with 74 goals, followed by Luis Suarez on 47, Coutinho (18), Dembele (17), Paulinho and Pique (9) and Rakitic (8). With regards to assists, Leo Messi leads the way again with 32 then come Suarez (25), Jordi Alba (23), Sergi Roberto (13), Dembele (12) and Coutinho and Rakitic (11).
