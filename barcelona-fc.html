  <p><b>[An open letter signed by Barcelona’s eight (living) current and previous presidents]</b> With <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> we <b>[Barça]</b> began to play differently, breaking new ground and innovating. With him, both as a player and coach, we established our own style on the field, what is traditionally known as ‘total football,’ the Barça style everyone admires. The arrival of <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> altered the history of Barça. He contributed decisively to a change of mentality. He got us to keep our heads up and to see that no opponent was invincible, that we could attain what we were aiming for. <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> was an icon who explained, better than anyone, that Barça is more than a club. He did it simply and based in reality, and always moving forward. Without <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>’s unabashed and non-conformist spirit, we quite possibly wouldn’t have become the greatest club in the world. So, again, thank you, Johan.

  <p><b>[Barcelona looking to to cut wages with <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> suspended due to coronavirus]</b> Among the measures adopted, it’s worth noting those related to the workplace are motivated by the need to adapt the contractual obligations of the club staff to the new and temporary circumstances that we are experiencing. It is about the presentation of the different relative files in the sporting field (football and other professional sports), as well as for the rest of the non-sporting personnel. These files will be processed before the Treball Department of the Generalitat de Catalunya, once the club has shared all aspects related to these measures, and their scope, with all its staff, both sporting and non-sporting. Basically, it is a reduction of the working day, imposed by the circumstances and the protection measures carried out, and, as a consequence, the proportional reduction of the remuneration provided for in the respective contracts. Measures that the club wants to implement scrupulously follow the formal labour regulations, under the criteria of proportionality, and above all fairness, and with the sole objective of resuming the activity of the club as soon as possible</p>
