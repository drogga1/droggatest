  <p><b>[Manchester City have signed Argentine centre-back Nicolas Otamendi to a new deal that runs until 2022]</b> At the club I’m really enjoying my experience since the first day I got here. I’m very happy to be staying here a couple more years. I think that nowadays, for the way I have improved, I’m in a really good moment. But I can still improve. The players keep learning day by day, and I try to be a better player after every single game.</p>

  <p><b>[Nicolas Otamendi has suggested that the busy festive fixture schedule could be key to Manchester City’s title hopes]</b> We’re entering into a very demanding month, with games every three or four days. The most important thing is trying to recover well after the games. Obviously, the physical effort and the fatigue will be there, but we have to keep paying attention to the small details that make the difference and help to win games. Our main focus after every game will be to recover well, keeping in mind that we have another one just three or four days later and be in the best shape as possible. December is very important due to the huge amount of games and creates a difference on the table. If a team manages to get a big amount of victories and points increases heavily their chances to be champions at the end of the season. We all know and we are aware that this month is so important for us. Afterwards, there will still be a lot to come and we’ll see if we are on top at the end of the season …</p>

  <p><b>[Nicolas Otamendi praised Argentina for struggling through their torrid early form at the Copa America to book a semi-final showdown with bitter rivals Brazil]</b> We knew it would be difficult from the beginning. It took time to take off, we got better. Now we are in the semi-finals against an opponent where it is a clasico and we hope it will go in favour of Argentina.<br /><br /><b>[Otamendi came out on top in an absorbing duel with Venezuela striker <a href="salomon-rondon.html">Salomon Rondon</a> as a previously porous Argentina backline showed signs of finding their feet]</b> We knew it was going to be a difficult, hard and very intense match. The important thing was to keep discipline, with very strong players like <a href="salomon-rondon.html">Rondon</a> who hold <b>[the ball up]</b> well. We controlled the game very well for most of the time. Maybe from dead balls the opponents had a few chances. The goal in the second half gave us a cushion. We were attacking and we knew how to keep organised well. It’s a great victory for us</p>
