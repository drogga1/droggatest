<blockquote>
  <p>[Nicolas Otamendi praised Argentina for struggling through their torrid early form at the Copa America to book a semi-final showdown with bitter rivals Brazil] We knew it would be difficult from the beginning. It took time to take off, we got better. Now we are in the semi-finals against an opponent where it is a clasico and we hope it will go in favour of Argentina.<br /><br />[Otamendi came out on top in an absorbing duel with Venezuela striker Salomon Rondon as a previously porous Argentina backline showed signs of finding their feet] We knew it was going to be a difficult, hard and very intense match. The important thing was to keep discipline, with very strong players like Rondon who hold [the ball up] well. We controlled the game very well for most of the time. Maybe from dead balls the opponents had a few chances. The goal in the second half gave us a cushion. We were attacking and we knew how to keep organised well. It’s a great victory for us</p>
