  <p><b>[Claudio Taffarel says <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> midfielder <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Arturo Vidal</a> represents a greater threat to <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a>’s hopes of reaching the last 16 of the Champions League than forward Carlos Tevez]</b> <a href="carlos-tevez.html">Tevez</a> is a very smart Argentine, but <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Vidal</a> is Juventus’ biggest threat. He’s an amazing midfielder. You cannot afford to lose sight of him. Lose him for one moment and he shows up in front of goal. <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Vidal</a> is among the five best players in the world in his position. He is Chilean, but he would be great for the Brazilian national team as well</p>

  <p><b>[Despite <a href="dunga.html">Dunga</a>’s arrival at the coaching helm breathing life into the national side, Taffarel claims his players are still recovering from the embarrassing World Cup display 7-1 semi-final rout at the hands of Germany]</b> For us, it was never easy either. Yeah, we won the fourth World Cup title, but before reaching that point, we experienced some difficult challenges. Where was it that the fans threw eggs at our head? In Bahia? You know, we were criticised at times. We experienced mistrust within the group, which wasn’t so tight knit at times and we got past that<br /><br />This team <b>[in 2015]</b> is an excellent group, we have impressive players. For you guys who are just seeing what is happening on the field, you don’t know what happens behind the scenes. But for those of us who are working with this team and who lived through the ‘94 World Cup, we see the same potential now. We see their will to work together and do their best. They’ve experienced many challenges. They lost the World Cup, they suffered that unforgettable loss, and they are still carrying all that weight. I believe that, step by step, they will rebuild that confidence in themselves and will bring a lot of joy to everyone</p>

  <p><b>[Claudio Taffarel on Silvio Gazzaniga’s <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup trophy]</b> The 1994 title was remarkable for my career and having that special moment with the trophy was the most important thing. We all know that so many great players have also raised it and I had that privilege. It is amazing. Besides being very beautiful, the trophy has great meaning and we knew the weight that it represents</p>

  <p><b>[Roma and Brazil shot-stopper Alisson can become the world’s best goalkeeper]</b> I’ll always respect the career of <b>[Gianluigi]</b> <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a>, who has been brilliant. But I believe that Alisson, as a goalkeeper, is more technical with a different posture. He always stands assertively and is confident in what he does. Alisson is really impressive. In the time that we worked with him at Internacional and with the national squad, we knew he would reach a high level. There is more time needed to see if he can reach the top or not, but he has the qualities to stay on top and become the best goalkeeper in the world, without doubt.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool continue to be heavily linked with a summer swoop for Alisson, but the Brazil international is ‘very happy at Roma,’ according to his international predecessor Claudio Taffarel]</b> Alisson is very happy at Roma and the rumours of a transfer are just rumours. I don’t know what will happen, but he said he’d be content to remain at Roma.</p>
