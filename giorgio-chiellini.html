  <p><b>[On Gonzalo Higuain]</b> You always expect strikers to be a bit egotistical, but instead I met a generous person. As a player he’s even stronger than I expected: a real animal on the pitch with extraordinary qualities. If you had a ‘Higuain Cam’ on him throughout the match, you’d see that in 90 per cent of the attacking moves he is alone in the box and that’s not because the defenders are falling asleep. Before the ball arrives, he makes two or three movements and counter-movements to shake off his marker. Pay attention next time.<br /><br />All this talk about his weight is ridiculous. Gonzalo is explosive and has such strength in his legs. If he sees a chance, you can’t keep up with him over 10-15 metres. He’s remarkable. He may have had a reputation elsewhere, but so far his attitude with us has been perfect</p>

He’s always made the difference wherever he’s gone<br /><br />Being bitten by Luis Suarez? It should have earned him a red card, which is what I was saying to the referee. Afterwards though I felt no anger towards him, and I even thought the heavy suspension he got was a bit much. For me, what happened during the game stopped at the final whistle. When I saw him in the Champions League quarter-final I greeted him with no problem, I was only thinking about the Barca game</p>

We had a decent game and could’ve taken the lead with Federico Bernardeschi, but then they scored on a fantastic Robert Lewandowski assist. We must build on the second half performance, as we are still trying to construct a new identity for this Italy side.

If he works with this attitude, he’s better than a year ago<br /><br />I’ve had the pleasure of playing in defence with Lilian Thuram and <b>[Fabio]</b> Cannavaro.

But he is only 25 years old and there is too much responsibility for him.<br /><br />Cristiano Ronaldo? He’s amazing. His decision to prove himself again at 33 was huge. His winning mentality managed to fill the gap left in the group by Buffon’s farewell. Cristiano is a beacon and point of reference, he leads with a positive attitude. In addition to his goals, assists and shots, he’s an exemplary figure. I see him calm and he works with a smile on his face. Juve unbeatable? Absolutely not: if we don’t face the matches in the right way or use our heads, we become vulnerable like everyone else. Barcelona and Real Madrid taught us that</p>

It’s not so much that he comes first to training to make a difference, but rather it’s the way he works: he pushes you to improve yourself. On top of that, he’s smart: he arrived in a different league and country but immediately tried to understand the dynamics of the city and integrate. He’ll be back for his national team and he’ll be able to play even more than me: I have to manage myself.<br /><br /><b>[On Joao Cancelo]</b> Cancelo?

  <p><b>[Giorgio Chiellini claims that Cristiano Ronaldo’s arrival at Juventus has had a similar impact to that of Andrea Pirlo]</b> I think Cristiano Ronaldo has noticed what an important team he has behind him, particularly at Valencia. He’s helping us raise the bar, but we showed to always be a team at Mestalla and in any case, a match like that increases your self-esteem. He works in a way that we lacked before. He gives conviction to his environment. For example, Pirlo gave it to us in Italy and now Ronaldo is giving it to us on an international level. He’s a player who improves the whole team around him. He’s also filled the personality void left by Buffon’s farewell. It was like he’d never left. He’s crucial on and off the field. We elevate each other, highlighting our strengths. Our qualities come to the fore with people like him.<br /><br /><b>[Chiellini added on a side yet to suffer a domestic defeat this season]</b> Are we unbeatable? We’ve had some players out, but we’ve always been good at finding alternative solutions. I’m always wary because when everything is fine, a bad surprise is always around the corner and it normally comes in the form of injuries. We did well in Milan and Florence. We have a great squad and it’ll come in handy, especially at times when not all of us are at 100 per cent. We’ll prepare for our match against Inter <b>[on Friday]</b> without looking at the table but while knowing that it’ll be a very difficult match.

Ronaldo is a decisive player, we knew it: in the fundamental moments he manages to bring out that extra something he has inside.

Because Ronaldo, aside from what he does on the pitch - and only a crazy person would question him because he scores goals and creates them - has been important for us because he has been an example on how to better ourselves. After many years dominating in Italy, we could assume we’d reached our maximum, but thanks to Cristiano, we are doing even more than we thought we could - searching for new limits. We have reached two Champions League finals but, in order to carry on growing, we needed the best. He has helped us with his work ethic because whoever is near him feels admiration and we are always trying to ‘rob something’ from him because he is an example</p>

I would like to have a managerial career as a director. <b>[I am approaching it]</b> with great calm because I think that the biggest mistake us footballers make once our careers are over is to think of being immediately ready. When you retire, for the luckiest between 35 and 40, you think you know everything about football. But then you enter the world of work where those of your age have done at least 15 years at a good level. And even if you go one step below, you find people who are 10 years younger than you but 10 years more experienced. So you have a gap to compensate and you have to be humbly aware of it. You have an important know-how from a footballing point of view, but you have to put in the other pieces. It’s like a puzzle. You don’t have to be in a hurry. One step a day<br /><br /><b>[Asked about coaching]</b> It is nice to pick a squad or train players for 30 minutes, but I do not like the life of a coach. Choosing a system is no longer enough, coaches have to be psychologists and motivational leaders too. Directors can be like an administrator of a company that has to manage at least 50 or 60 people. It is an all-encompassing life, accepting pressure and sacrifices of all kinds. It’s not a kind of responsibility that I feel inside me now<br /><br /><b>[Discussing his Euro 2020 prospects]</b> Yes, <b>[I will be there]</b> if nothing happens. I will arrive nice and fresh. <b>[Italy coach Roberto]</b> Mancini called me the night I got hurt, and I said to him, ‘Coach, I will be back in the spring.

If I caused an extra two or three goals, I wouldn’t live anymore. He is very technical and could be a striker, we are opposites.

He was someone else who lived like a king at night. During his last season with us, when his performance levels had dropped, <a href="luciano-moggi.html">Moggi</a> went to him and said: ‘Paolo, please stop staying at home in the evening. Go back to your old ways!’ <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Vidal</a> was a bit like that<br /><br />I still remember an American tour, we were in Miami the night before the last training session before leaving and we were given a free pass.

Head coach <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> couldn’t wait to kick him out of the squad and make an example out of him. Instead, after 10 minutes when Arturo still looked drunk and didn’t even see the ball go by, he ended up running like crazy and beat everyone else by 20 metres. What can you say to a person who, among other things, brings joy to a squad, as well as being someone who drives the team on and is both a fighter and a great champion?</p>

They just want to enjoy their football, but it always takes time to settle in a new environment, especially when you’re moving countries. He’s done very well in Italy, and now he’s adapting to English life and English football well. He’s a workaholic. He does some mad things with the ball, and he’s probably the strongest guy I’ve ever come across as well. I mean, Yerry <b>[Mina]</b> is a big unit but Moise can more than hold his own in that battle! I was so pleased when he got his first goal, because you could see the emotion in his face. He’s worked so hard, firstly to get his move and then since. I’ve been there myself and I know how it feels. I know he has the hunger</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> defender Giorgio Chiellini admits he is delighted to be lining up alongside <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> - affirming that he prefers having the record-breaking striker as a team-mate than an opponent]</b> Unfortunately he scored a lot against us. Luckily he’s now a teammate of mine. He’s on another level, you can see it and I think it’s fair to admit that. He gave <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> a lot. When you have such a champion it’s a shame if you don’t make the most of him<br /><br /><b>[Chiellini also had warm praise for long-time colleague <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Gianluigi Buffon</a>, who at 42 is still going strong for the <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a> between the posts]</b> He’s an older brother. In the last 15 years he’s the person I have seen most on earth. He’s a person who always manages to bring out the right words in decisive moments to change the fate of a season. He’s a splendid person who has taught me a lot. We are different but as he was able to come up with words in the decisive moments</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> star Giorgio Chiellini says that is planning on reassessing his future after next season as the defender says he’s hoping to continue on with his playing career]</b> Next year I’ll see how I feel. I’ll play for another year, then let’s see. I could play for another year after that, I would like to continue in football because it’s my life. I would prefer a management role than as a coach, but in life you never know<br /><br /><b>[Chiellini says that he has seen greatness while watching <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> work as he expressed his admiration for the Spanish manager]</b> I think he has something different to the other. I saw the first two episodes of the City documentary, in which he talks to the players and you see his charisma, mentality. That makes him special. For a football lover, two episodes of the City documentary are enough to understand the greatness of mind. I wasn’t lucky enough to meet him, but I think he has something extra<br /><br /><b>[The defender has remained on as captain even with <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a>’s return, and he says he is glad that the honour came to him later in his career]</b> Being captain, on the one hand, is more tiring than being a phenomenon, but at the beginning you have less pressure. There are many who are 17 years old with many expectations that ruin a career</p>
