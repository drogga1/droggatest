  <p><b>[Juventus legend Giorgio Chiellini sets out retirement plan]</b> <b>[I will play]</b> a couple of years - not more. I would like to have a managerial career as a director. <b>[I am approaching it]</b> with great calm because I think that the biggest mistake us footballers make once our careers are over is to think of being immediately ready. When you retire, for the luckiest between 35 and 40, you think you know everything about football. But then you enter the world of work where those of your age have done at least 15 years at a good level. And even if you go one step below, you find people who are 10 years younger than you but 10 years more experienced. So you have a gap to compensate and you have to be humbly aware of it. You have an important know-how from a footballing point of view, but you have to put in the other pieces. It’s like a puzzle. You don’t have to be in a hurry. One step a day<br /><br /><b>[Asked about coaching]</b> It is nice to pick a squad or train players for 30 minutes, but I do not like the life of a coach. Choosing a system is no longer enough, coaches have to be psychologists and motivational leaders too. Directors can be like an administrator of a company that has to manage at least 50 or 60 people. It is an all-encompassing life, accepting pressure and sacrifices of all kinds. It’s not a kind of responsibility that I feel inside me now<br /><br /><b>[Discussing his Euro 2020 prospects]</b> Yes, <b>[I will be there]</b> if nothing happens. I will arrive nice and fresh. <b>[Italy coach Roberto]</b> Mancini called me the night I got hurt, and I said to him, ‘Coach, I will be back in the spring. When June comes, I will be as fresh as a rose’. Playing as captain of <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> and the national team, with 500 games for <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> and 100 for the national team, it gives you a different serenity. I would like to enjoy the Euros like I am enjoying the final wonderful years as a footballer</p>

No - even if I did someone harm. On Bergessio, in 2013, I made a reckless tackle and I was so sorry. I told him I was sorry a thousand times but I couldn’t give him back the piece that I broke. He stayed out for three months and when he came back, he started a manhunt against me - until he was sent off for elbowing me.

  <p><b>[Chiellini explains why he hugged Koulibaly after late own goal]</b> I think back to our embrace on the Allianz Stadium pitch after his own goal on August 31. The way I am, that gesture of mine almost displeased me; perhaps it would have been better to hug him in the locker room and keep this moment just between us. But it happened spontaneously. I looked for Kalidou, going to him on crutches. The night before, he sent me a ‘good luck’ message. With him, I have always had a wonderful relationship. Such a strong player, such a good person and in the 92nd minute of a crucial game, he makes a mistake like that! Seeing the look on his face melted me. I felt I had to say a few words of comfort, nothing more: ‘You are the best, everyone makes mistakes, keep on working the way you do and everything will pass<br /><br /><b>[Chiellini also revealed he and <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Koulibaly</a> were in regular contact when the Italian was ruled out for six months with his cruciate ligament injury]</b> Of course I suffered, like everyone else, but it was also beautiful.

  <p><b>[Chiellini says Injuring Salah in Champions League final was a <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Ramos</a> masterstroke]</b> Critics can say that he is impulsive, not tactical at all and that because of him there are eight or 10 extra goals conceded a season. If I caused an extra two or three goals, I wouldn’t live anymore. He is very technical and could be a striker, we are opposites. However, he has two characteristics almost no-one has.<br /><br />The first is knowing how to be decisive in important games. He makes interventions beyond any logic, even with injuries that he causes with almost diabolical cunning. Salah’s was a masterstroke. He always said that he didn’t mean to injure him, but he was aware that falling that way and without letting go of his grip, nine times out of 10 you can break your rival’s arm.<br /><br />The second is the force he transmits with his presence. Without him, stars like <a href="raphael-varane.html">Raphael Varane</a>, <a href="dani-carvajal.html">Dani Carvajal</a> and <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> seem like kids from the Primavera team. Without him, Madrid becomes defenceless.<br /><br /><b>[Chiellini pointed to the stunning 4-1 home Champions League loss to <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> in 2019 as an instance that his loss was critical to Madrid]</b> After the first match, they gave him a two-game ban because he was honest: he said that in life you have to choose and had looked for a card to wipe his record before the quarter-finals. With him at the Bernabeu, they can be sure that they would not have lost by a three-goal margin. I’d bet whatever you want</p>

  <p><b>[Giorgio Chiellini has claimed that only a taste for alcohol prevented former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> team-mate <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Arturo Vidal</a> from reaching the very top of the game]</b> A footballer isn’t a devil or a saint. The distinction to be made is quite another. That is, between those who are real and those who are fake. Someone like <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Vidal</a> sometimes went out and drank more than they should’ve. Everyone knew it. It can be said that alcohol was a bit of a weakness for him. However, that doesn’t put into question whether he is a champion or which type of person he is. Weaknesses are part of human nature. What matters are the consequences they can have on a squad<br /><br />The great Arturo didn’t show up for training a couple of times a year or, when he did, let’s say he was rather merry. However, he never slacked. On the contrary, I think that sometimes, certain ways of being can make you stronger. Unfortunately, I didn’t get to know Paolo Montero that well. He was someone else who lived like a king at night. During his last season with us, when his performance levels had dropped, <a href="luciano-moggi.html">Moggi</a> went to him and said: ‘Paolo, please stop staying at home in the evening. Go back to your old ways!’ <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Vidal</a> was a bit like that<br /><br />I still remember an American tour, we were in Miami the night before the last training session before leaving and we were given a free pass. The next morning, Arturo was nowhere to be seen. He was in bed, and they had to pull him out by force. That day we tried the new training shirts. We were all dressed in black and it was 40 degrees. Head coach <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> couldn’t wait to kick him out of the squad and make an example out of him. Instead, after 10 minutes when Arturo still looked drunk and didn’t even see the ball go by, he ended up running like crazy and beat everyone else by 20 metres. What can you say to a person who, among other things, brings joy to a squad, as well as being someone who drives the team on and is both a fighter and a great champion?</p>

The one thing nobody has been able to change, however, is his outlandish attachment to cigarettes.

  <p><b>[Chiellini reveals he admires <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> for 2014 World Cup bite during Italy v Uruguay clash]</b> The truth is, I admire his mischief, because if Suarez were to lose that, he would become an average player. Nothing strange happened that day in the 2014 World Cup. I marked <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Edinson Cavani</a> for most of the game, another complicated guy to keep up with, and we held nothing back. Suddenly, I realised I’d been bitten on the shoulder. It happened, that’s all there is to it, but that is his strategy when fighting with body-to-body contact and, if I may say, it’s mine too<br /><br />Suarez and I are similar and I like facing strikers like him. I called him a couple of days after the game, but he had no need to apologise to me. I too am a son of a b*tch on the field and proud of it. Mischief and a little bit of malice are part of the game, I wouldn’t call that cheating. You need to be intelligent to overcome your rival. <br /><br /><b>[Chiellini said of <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> coach Maurizio Sarri]</b> You can only go and talk to him in his office before taking a shower, still wearing your playing kit, because otherwise you’d stink of smoke!</p>

  <p><b>[Vidal hits back at former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> team-mate Chiellini’s alcohol claims]</b> A footballer isn’t a devil or a saint. The distinction to be made is quite another. That is, between those who are real and those who are fake. Someone like <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Vidal</a> sometimes went out and drank more than they should’ve. Everyone knew it. It can be said that alcohol was a bit of a weakness for him. However, that doesn’t put into question whether he is a champion or which type of person he is. Weaknesses are part of human nature. What matters are the consequences they can have on a squad</p>

  <p><b>[Giorgio Chiellini on <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> vs Neymar]</b> I think that <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> is better than <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> because he’s more consistent. The future belongs to him. He’s a truly unique player. He was an unstoppable striker and was only 18 years old. That year, we faced them in the semi-finals. Now he’s 21 and he’s already a world champion. Allure, technique, instinct, he doesn’t miss anything. He’s a player who exudes something, who is a priceless masterpiece</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus captain Giorgio Chiellini believes <a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Leonardo Bonucci</a>’s decision to join <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> in 2017 was illogical]</b> His year at Milan was different, a choice certainly wrong because he was not made at peace with himself, therefore not in a lucid way. Leo was shaken for a thousand reasons. I was sorry because everything happens in the weeks when we didn’t see each other. I’m sure if it had happened at another time I would have made him think about staying. Like <b>[Antonio]</b> <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> in that July 2014, they always leave when I’m not there<br /><br />With Leo I spoke that everything was already established … something without logic from start to finish. I could have understood if he had gone to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, but to that Milan? Fortunately, fate wanted everything to come back in order<br /><br />If I think back to the <a href="leonardo.html">Leonardo</a> I was two or three years ago, I would not have made certain decisions. The decision to go to Milan, as everyone knows, made me mature as a man. It was a big chance and perhaps too big for the man I was at the time. The young <a href="leonardo.html">Leonardo</a> was a bit too fiery. When you meet someone who gives you good advice for your own, you must have the humility to listen</p>

  <p><b>[Giorgio Chiellini admits that he expected <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> to pass through <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> when he arrived as a free agent from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in 2012]</b> I remember when he came. Three or four days into the retreat, my team-mates and I looked at each other and said: ‘This guy is really good’. He came as a free agent from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, he was very young, and we thought he was just one of many passing through. One of those who clubs use to do work on the market. However, nobody expected such a champion. Paul moved around with incredible physique, he was magical, impressive. And to say that the first games he played out of position, in front of the defence to ease <b>[Andrea]</b> <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Pirlo</a>. But knowing him, in the time to come it became clear that the role had limited him. Paul could not open his stride and free his physical and technical arrogance, what would allow him to become the formidable box-to-box player we know</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus captain Giorgio Chiellini insisted <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> forward <a href="moise-kean.html">Moise Kean</a> was completely different to Mario Balotelli]</b> <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Balotelli</a> only has the shot. There are those who now compare him with <a href="moise-kean.html">Moise Kean</a>, a boy who appears rebellious and unmanageable, but is completely different from Mario. Of course, in <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> youth he was punished many times, but when he played in the first team he always showed himself very respectful towards the group. Sometimes he does not hear the alarm and arrives late, but they are behaviours that can be changed without difficulty<br /><br />He’s 19 and coming to a whole new country, new culture, language, way of playing. It’s hard, you know. It feels like we put a lot of pressure on players who don’t ask for it. They just want to enjoy their football, but it always takes time to settle in a new environment, especially when you’re moving countries. He’s done very well in Italy, and now he’s adapting to English life and English football well. He’s a workaholic. He does some mad things with the ball, and he’s probably the strongest guy I’ve ever come across as well. I mean, Yerry <b>[Mina]</b> is a big unit but Moise can more than hold his own in that battle! I was so pleased when he got his first goal, because you could see the emotion in his face. He’s worked so hard, firstly to get his move and then since. I’ve been there myself and I know how it feels. I know he has the hunger</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini admits he is delighted to be lining up alongside <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> - affirming that he prefers having the record-breaking striker as a team-mate than an opponent]</b> Unfortunately he scored a lot against us. Luckily he’s now a teammate of mine. He’s on another level, you can see it and I think it’s fair to admit that. He gave <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> a lot. When you have such a champion it’s a shame if you don’t make the most of him<br /><br /><b>[Chiellini also had warm praise for long-time colleague <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Gianluigi Buffon</a>, who at 42 is still going strong for the <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a> between the posts]</b> He’s an older brother. In the last 15 years he’s the person I have seen most on earth. He’s a person who always manages to bring out the right words in decisive moments to change the fate of a season. He’s a splendid person who has taught me a lot. We are different but as he was able to come up with words in the decisive moments</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus star Giorgio Chiellini says that is planning on reassessing his future after next season as the defender says he’s hoping to continue on with his playing career]</b> Next year I’ll see how I feel. I’ll play for another year, then let’s see. I could play for another year after that, I would like to continue in football because it’s my life. I would prefer a management role than as a coach, but in life you never know<br /><br /><b>[Chiellini says that he has seen greatness while watching <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> work as he expressed his admiration for the Spanish manager]</b> I think he has something different to the other. I saw the first two episodes of the City documentary, in which he talks to the players and you see his charisma, mentality. That makes him special. For a football lover, two episodes of the City documentary are enough to understand the greatness of mind. I wasn’t lucky enough to meet him, but I think he has something extra<br /><br /><b>[The defender has remained on as captain even with <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a>’s return, and he says he is glad that the honour came to him later in his career]</b> Being captain, on the one hand, is more tiring than being a phenomenon, but at the beginning you have less pressure. There are many who are 17 years old with many expectations that ruin a career</p>
