  <p><b>[Arsenal managing director Vinai Venkatesham says the club’s owner Stan Kroenke is committed to bringing Champions League and <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> glory to the club]</b> Stan and <a href="josh-kroenke.html">Josh Kroenke</a> are in sport because they’re passionate about sport and because they want to win. So when I talk about the strategy around making our fans all across the world proud of their football club and competing to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and the Champions League, that doesn’t come from <a href="raul-sanllehi.html">Raul Sanllehi</a> <b>[head of football]</b> and that doesn’t come from me. That comes from our owners. They’re hugely ambitious around where they want to take this football club and they remind us of that all the time. They’re massively involved. Between Raul and I, we probably speak to the owners pretty much every day and we have detailed, in-person meetings with them I’d say pretty much every month, whether we alternate between doing them in London or the States. They’re hugely involved in what we do, they are hugely knowledgeable about sport. It’s well-known that they have an American Football team, an NBA team, an NHL team, an <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> team and a lacrosse team, so they know sport and they’re really, really passionate about <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. They’re really passionate about how we can move the club forward, but they’re also realistic. They know we’re not going to go from where we are at the moment to delivering our ambition overnight, and they know that there’s going to be a whole load of work along the way to get there</p>

You don’t get a chance to play in major European finals often and Miki has had it taken away from.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal’s managing director Vinai Venkatesham has refuted claims that the club only have £40 million to spend this summer]</b> I don’t recognise this £40m figure, I have read it a lot. That doesn’t come from us, that doesn’t come from the club. The numbers never come from us. We never ever, ever, ever talk about how much money we have to spend because that’s the least helpful thing you can do. Raul’s job is hard enough, if you go into a negotiation and everyone knows how much money you’ve got, it doesn’t really help.<br /><br />It is true that our funds are more limited after three years in the Europa League, but the budget isn’t £40m. We have the budget to make a difference but this is a particularly tough window and we’re in the middle of it. I sense and understand the frustration, but there is a huge amount of misinformation out there in the market. I read and am sent articles about players we’re supposed to have missed out on and they’re players we’ve never even talked about. I get why sometimes it’s hard for fans to understand what we’re doing, but I’d say that’s because about 85% of what you read just isn’t true</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal director hints at quiet January transfer window for Gunners]</b> Well listen, we’ve just been through the transfer period in the summer, that’s what we always call the main transfer window. We were very aggressive in that transfer window, signing a number of new players that we’re very excited about, predominately targeting young players that we believe can grow and develop with us over future years. When we look forward to January, we’ll see when January comes. I’d say that we always treat the summer window as being the more strategic window.<br /><br />The January window is the one where you need to be a bit more tactical, maybe responding to an injury or another demand. But really our work is done in the summer and we’re really pleased with what we did in the summer. Listen, as I’ve said, we’ve been really focused over the summer, we made some defensive reinforcements signing <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> from <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> from Celtic. We’re looking forward to seeing how those players progress and how they do over the course of the season. The players that we look for are the players we believe will make the biggest impact on the pitch from a sporting perspective.</p>

  <p><b>[Unai Emery has been given a vote of confidence by the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> hierarchy following the club’s poor run of form]</b> We are as disappointed as everyone else with both our results and performances at this stage of the season. We share the frustration with our fans, Unai, players and all our staff as they are not at the level we want or expect. Things need to improve to meet our objectives for the season, and we firmly believe Unai is the right man for the job, together with the backroom team we have in place. We are all working intensively behind the scenes to turn things around and are confident we will. We never take our fantastic support for granted. We hope we can all stick together and get behind the team in this challenging period, as together we are stronger</p>
