  <p><b>[Former Italy international Dani Osvaldo has admitted that he lacked the discipline to keep himself going in elite football]</b> I am not a big fan of the daytime. I smoke a lot, I went to play football yesterday with friends and I almost choked to death. Cristiano Ronaldo likes to go home and do 150 press-ups, but I like preparing barbecues instead. Football gave me the chance to help my family and earn so much, that I can afford to not work again. It allowed me to travel and get to know different places and people. It changed my life but it also took my freedom away from me, and I can’t give up my freedom. Still, I love football and won’t deny it<br /><br />I used to smoke at training camps with the Italian national team, and even the coach used to come up and ask me for a light. <b>[Boca coach Guillermo Barros]</b> <a href="guillermo-barros-schelotto.html">Schelotto</a>, instead, threw me out of Boca because it surprised him that I smoked. If that bothers you, come over and say it to my face. If you want to kick a player out with the record I had when I arrived at Boca, we’ll sit down for a coffee and he can tell me ‘let’s look for the best way you can leave’, you don’t go public with the fact I smoked a cigarette. He showed no respect and he was a coward. There were 12 of us who smoked but I was the one who was kicked out. He saw them. So? He told them they couldn’t do it, that’s all. He didn’t even tell me. But I’m glad I was smoking a cigarette at that time, because if not I would have ripped his head off: he put me on the pitch for a minute and a half in the game <b>[against Nacional]</b> as if I was 14 years old</p>

  <p><b>[Dani Osvaldo has opened up on his retirement from football]</b> Would I like to be like Messi? No. I’d like to play like him, but he has no life. It’s as if he lives in a golden prison. He couldn’t go somewhere and quietly drink something. Maybe he doesn’t care about it, but I do. I imagine him buying the biggest TV in the world, but then he’s never in his living room to use it. Failing that, he probably drives a Ferrari, knowing he lives 15 minutes away from the Barcelona’s training ground.</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Mauro Icardi</a>]</b> I have no problem with <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a>. That was not the main reason I left Inter, but I am not going to reveal what it was. But it certainly wasn’t because of Icardi</p>

  <p><b>[Former Italy internationa Osvaldol, who last played in 2016, has been out of the game since in order to focus on his music career with band Barrio Viejo]</b> I hope he doesn’t call me because you can’t say no to Diego. It would put me in trouble. If he calls me, we’ll see. For now, all I know is that on September 21 I’m playing with Barrio Viejo.<br /><br />My exit from football was a circus, Who are you to tell me I can’t smoke? My father? I smoked all my life and I still played for the Italian national team. He was a nefarious technician for Boca, but the rest of my experience at <a href="boca-juniors.html">Bombonera</a> was excellent.</p>

  <p><b>[No-nonsense coach <a href="guillermo-barros-schelotto.html">Guillermo Barros Schelotto</a>, who drummed Daniel Osvaldo out of the club following that infamous Libertadores transgression]</b> There were 12 of us who smoked in that Boca team and I was the one who got kicked out. And Guillermo saw them do it, you know? He used to tell them they couldn’t, that’s all. He didn’t even tell me. He’s lucky I was smoking a cigarette then because if not I’d have ripped his head off.

Guillermo had no respect and was a coward<br /><br /><b>[Football took a back seat, with the nocturnal lifestyle of the rock star not usually conducive to maintaining prime physical fitness]</b> I’m not much of a fan of the daytime. I smoke a lot, yesterday I played with some friends of mine and I almost choked. Today everything hurts</p>
