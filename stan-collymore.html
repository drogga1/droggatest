  <p><b>[Stan Collymore has claimed that only Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have had better careers than Wayne Rooney in the past decade]</b> If you take out the big two, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, he has had as good a career as anybody in the world over the last decade. You don’t break Sir Bobby Charlton’s England or Manchester United’s goal records without being something very special. So huge congratulations to Wayne Rooney for achieving both, for a fantastic career that has seen him win virtually every trophy.<br /><br /><b>[Rooney’s showings for the Three Lions]</b> It is a little disappointing that we couldn’t see him at his best for England in terms of winning trophies or getting to finals and semi-finals</p>

<p><br /><br />Being ‘My’ club I was so excited to get there ( Steve Gough of Cannock Villa was waiting at San Fran airport with the Cannock Villa flag!) so I got to the hotel , did a medical and Ugo was the first person to come and say hello, the first person to take time to welcome me to the club I supported as a kid. I was nervous, he knew it, and rather than be the alpha male that many of us players can be around each other, he showed me around, we hung out over the coming days and he was instrumental in helping me settle in. Going to Villa was my dream so for him to see that and just offer calm, cool friendship is something I’ll never forget.<br /><br />He was already great friends with Bozza and <a href="dwight-yorke.html">Dwight Yorke</a> but wasn’t as loud as them or me, just cooler than cool at the back with a big smile but always up for fun and a laugh</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool can forget the title until they start keeping clean sheets]</b> They’ve got <b>[Mo]</b> Salah, <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane, <b>[Adam]</b> Lallana and <b>[Roberto]</b> Firmino so they’re always going to score goals and are incredibly entertaining to watch but they concede too many. The one thing Jurgen Klopp has never proven is that he can put out a team to defend and get clean sheets on the spin. Which, for all Manchester City’s attacking intent this season, they have been able to do that as well. I just wish that they could have the back of the team and the goalkeeping part of the team as good as the front. Then they would be a title threat. But not until they get that right. I think that until he addresses the defensive weaknesses in the way he puts teams out I think it would be right to question somebody that’s on whatever he’s on - plus a six-year contract. That just comes with the territory of being manager of Liverpool.<br /><br />They’ve got a lot of money in from Coutinho. I think he’s bought exceptionally well with the two frontmen, Mane and Salah, that have come in. They have been absolutely outstanding. But there are questions about Matip, questions about both goalkeepers. They haven’t got the kind of resources Manchester City have got or even Manchester United. But if you can buy eight or nine out-of-10 players in the front part of the team, why can’t you do that in the back part of the team?</p>

  <p><b>[The scene: Anfield. The date: April 3, 1996. Two teams meet in what will go down as the greatest Premier League game of all time]</b> Wherever I go in the world it staggers me how many people come up and talk about that game. I’ve just been putting on Instagram the mural around the corner and there are loads of comments: Collymore closing in! People have asked me many times: ‘How do you feel?’ and I say my head exploded. It just does. The noise was deafening. The banners all suddenly start to go up. Kevin Keegan draped over the advertising hoardings. So many iconic moments<br /><br />I remember being on the training ground at Melwood a couple of days before and it being impressed upon us by Roy Evans how important the game was to stay in the title race, that we could score against Newcastle because Kevin Keegan’s philosophy was: ‘they score three, we score four’<br /><br />And it was all set up to be a classic. Two very attacking teams, two teams that weren’t great at defending. I don’t remember being particularly nervous. I think it was just more excitement to try and get out there and narrow the distance between us and Manchester United. I think Newcastle struggled in some games quite early. We scored after a minute or so. I remember the assist for Robbie Fowler. I used to break down the left quite a lot and put a cross in for him. He scored after two or three minutes. And then they got back into the game and the first goal. Then it was Jason McAteer down the right, who was really good crosser of the ball. I just flung my leg out, hit it and thought if I could get an assist and a goal on the night and we can win the game, happy days. But even now I have to pinch myself when again I watch the game and how it ended. Andy Gray said this in his commentary: ‘Stan Collymore’s been chucked out onto the left wing, nobody can see him, John Barnes can!’ I’m literally out of camera shot because Ian Rush came on the pitch, played up front with Robbie Fowler and I got stuck out onto the left wing. And I just remember Barnesy and Rushy dicking about on the edge of the box, it was like what are they doing? I was like pass it and John Barnes did. And I didn’t think anything other than just get this shot on target.<br /><br />If you look at the goal again, it beats Pavel Srnicek at his near post. Anybody tells you that you’re supposed to shoot across the goalkeeper. It left my boot and could quite easily have gone into the side-netting and we wouldn’t be having this conversation and it would have been an entertaining 3-3 draw. But the noise from the Kop and to score a winning goal at the Kop End in such a big game was incredible. It really was incredible<br /><br />If you compare it as a 90-minute football match to any other game that’s been played at Premier League level, I honestly don’t think you’ll find one from minute one to the last kick of the game that had so much quality, so much attacking talent, so many very good goals and performances. That’s why we’re here now. It still endures 20 odd years later. A game between two teams that neither of them won the title<br /><br />This is why neither team won the league even though both were equally talented to the Manchester United side at that point. The difference was they had somebody in Sir Alex Ferguson that took the defensive side of the game particularly seriously<br /><br />In 1996 that Liverpool were still quite by some way ahead of Manchester United in terms of European titles and domestic titles. Liverpool as a sporting city wasn’t prone to overstating things. But the day after the game they had in all of the tabloids celebration editions of the paper. It probably wasn’t until a couple of days after that we realised how good the game was and players from both sides were talking about it. And you think: well if John Barnes has said that’s as good as he’s played in then you know it’s a pretty good game</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool remain a long way from being Premier League title contenders]</b> I’m not getting too carried away with the idea that Liverpool will be Manchester City’s main rivals for the Premier League crown next season. They might have beaten them three times this term and that Champions League quarter-final might still be fresh in the memory but, by my ­reckoning, only three Liverpool players get into City’s starting line-up: <b>[Virgil]</b> van Dijk, Mo Salah and Andy Robertson. And I include Robertson only ­because City’s Benjamin Mendy has been out injured. That shows how far they still have to go.<br /><br />This season Liverpool have been near-perfect up front, easily a nine out of 10. In midfield it has been seven out of 10, with room for a dominant new ­addition - hopefully, Naby Keita will be that man. At the back, they have been a six overall and an eight in recent weeks and, even though Dejan Lovren has stepped up to the plate, I’d like to see at least one more central ­defender of Van Dijk’s quality brought in. Someone who’d purr like a Rolls-Royce alongside the Dutchman, the way Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic did together for so many years at Old Trafford. And I don’t care what anyone says, Liverpool need a new keeper as well. Another right-back, too, because Trent Alexander-Arnold is still young and Nathaniel Clyne has been a bit hit-and-miss</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool should be looking to sign the likes of Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli this summer]</b> The pressure is on the Fenway Sports Group - and now they have to deliver for Jurgen Klopp. Liverpool’s owners need to use the Champions League Final as a platform to build a squad that is capable of standing squarely toe-to-toe with those being ­assembled in Manchester. The first XI put together by the ­affable German has shown that, on its day, it can compete with the very best. It has dismantled ­defences across Europe. It has shredded a lot of reputations in the ­Premier League as goals have rained down. But, for all of their promise in the second half of this season, Liverpool do not have the strength in depth of their two great rivals<br /><br />If the Reds are to close the gap, they need genuine A-listers as back-up. And I believe now is the time to strike. By reaching two European finals in three seasons, Klopp has shown he can manage. And now FSG have to demonstrate their commitment too by using the £75m-plus generated by this run and back their man in the transfer market. I am not talking about signing the likes of Andy Robertson - as good as he has been. I am talking about wandering into White Hart Lane, plonking £150m on the table in front of Daniel Levy and saying: ‘I’ll give you that for Christian Eriksen, Toby Alderweireld and Dele Alli’. I would still like the owners to give the green light for three or four marquee signings</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich and Robert Lewandowski will be looking to prey on Fabinho]</b> You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to work out that Virgil van Dijk’s absence from Liverpool’s back four for the visit of Bayern Munich is a major blow. The Dutchman is big, physical, good in the air and can bully you, and there aren’t many central defenders who read the game better than he does. He’s good on the deck and chips in with big goals from time to time, too, so Bayern won’t be sorry he’s suspended. And certainly the Germans’ star striker, Robert Lewandowski, won’t have lost any sleep at the prospect of facing Joel Matip and, potentially, Fabinho instead. Now, I’m not saying the Pole would have been worried about facing Van Dijk because, as a striker, you’d never go into a game thinking, ‘I’m not going to play well because I’m up against someone so good’. But on the flip side, you can really have your appetite for a game whetted when the defenders you’re up against aren’t first choice or, in Fabinho’s case, even naturals in that position. The message in Bayern’s team meeting will be simple, with Niko Kovac telling his men: ‘If Fabinho plays at the back, we prey on him’. So Liverpool’s hope must be that in a one-off game without Van Dijk they can muster through.<br /><br />So the focus has switched for perhaps the first time this season from Mo Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane to those at the other end of the pitch. Whoever plays in Liverpool’s back four tonight need to keep things tight, knowing that a loss by the odd goal, while not ideal, is not irreparable in Munich. Against Manchester United on Sunday, however, I fear the damage a defeat could do and I’d go as far as to say all bets are off in terms of the title if should Liverpool lose that game. They will have Van Dijk back for that one but in games between the two sides, as we all know, anything can happen. But if they can get through tonight with a clean sheet despite their issues at the back then the confidence they will take into the weekend could be absolutely vital.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk is the best centre-back in the world]</b> Van Dijk reads the game better than any other defender in the Premier League and is a bit old-school in that respect. I’d put him in the Rio Ferdinand bracket when it comes to his reading of situations - he sees the danger, acknowledges the danger and has the physicality and athleticism to be able to deal with it. Some players can read the game but don’t have the pace and some have the pace but not the instinct. He has the lot and on top of that he exudes a calmness that rubs off on the rest of his side’s back four. I see in Van Dijk someone who is unflustered and will go on, either with Liverpool or another club, to win many, many titles. And by the time he hangs up his boots, we could be talking about him in the same venerable tones as Sergio Ramos if he gets the chance to win as many titles either at Liverpool or elsewhere.<br /><br />Van Dijk has to be worth at least £175m of anybody’s money and, while it’s easy to throw around statements such as ‘best in the world’, I really believe he is</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City have been told that they should be looking to sign Liverpool centre-half Virgil van Dijk at any cost]</b> I know Pep Guardiola has said he’ll prioritise a full-back and a defensive midfielder in the summer. But if I was him the first person I’d be targeting is Virgil van Dijk. I’d offer John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi plus £150 million for the Dutchman and I wouldn’t stop until Liverpool accepted my offer was simply too good to turn down. I know Jurgen Klopp has a long-term contract at Anfield and that if Liverpool don’t win the Premier League, they will finish probably finish second and won’t want to be selling their best players. Especially not to their rivals. But Van Dijk is one of those incredibly gifted athletes and would make any defence on Planet Earth significantly better. And if City want to become the dominant force they say they want to, then going all out for him would be a no-brainer.<br /><br />I go back to Celtic fans saying, ‘This guy is the real deal, he’s a Rolls-Royce’, because having watched Henrik Larsson in recent seasons, they know what players of that calibre look like. Van Dijk has to be worth at least £175m of anybody’s money and, while it’s easy to throw around statements such as ‘best in the world’, I really believe he is</p>

  <p><b>[Collymore urges Klopp to buy Ruben Neves]</b> I don’t buy into the theory that Liverpool will automatically be Manchester City’s main challengers next season just because they ran them so close this time. Turning a 25-point deficit into just a one-point deficit in the space of one season is an incredible achievement. Some clubs take three, four, five, even 10 seasons to close those sorts of gaps. But if Jurgen Klopp’s men were to lose to Tottenham in the Champions League final, having been pipped by City in the Premier League, then it would be a massive hammer blow for them mentally and could have an impact on them going again next term.<br /><br />So the question Klopp will be asking himself now is, ‘What do we need to do to win the league?’ He’ll know he needs a couple of marquee signings - Ruben Neves would be fantastic for Liverpool - and for his squad not to drop points in such games as the games against Manchester United and Everton</p>

The front three of <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a>, <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a> and <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, plus the form of <a href="gini-wijnaldum.html">Gini Wijnaldum</a> and <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a>, will give them the edge, however slight. The fact <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> beat <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in such extraordinary circumstances in their semi-final as well will mean the feeling in their dressing room is quite simple. They will believe they shattered a stronger glass ceiling that night than anything they’d have to break if they were to beat <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, and that will give them huge belief. That’s not disrespecting <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>’s side, but to have overturned a 3-0 deficit against a team containing, for many, the greatest player of all time will make them think they can come back from any possible scenario.<br /><br />The only minor niggle in my mind is the three-week break, because the outcome will also depend on which team has managed best to stay on the bridle.

But I’ve been involved in enough finals and seen enough to know you want momentum and that a little break can just blunt your tools a bit. If the break has had any sort of impact then it will narrow the gap because <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are more of a gung-ho, express themselves team and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> more pragmatic.

I also heard he was very, very confident and the sort of whom it could be said that: ‘If he was chocolate, he’d eat himself’. I don’t mind that, actually, because the best players need to have an unbelievable inner-belief if they’re going to go on to be the very best. But it’s all about channelling that inner-belief on the field and, off it, making sure you don’t give critics a reason to have a go at you.<br /><br />It’s about making sure ‘confident lad’ doesn’t bleed into ‘Jack the lad’ because that’s when the problems can start. His decision to go out to a casino on Friday night, having been stood down from international duty through illness, wasn’t the biggest crime and there was no suggestion he was steaming drunk. But you have to know the right time to do things when you’re in the spotlight and learn that if you do want to socialise, particularly in such circumstances, your best bet is to do it at home with family or friends.<br /><br />Maddison reminds me a bit of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s old Spice Boys, a group I was referred to alongside but never actually tagged in. <a href="jamie-redknapp.html">Jamie Redknapp</a>, <a href="jason-mcateer.html">Jason McAteer</a>, Phil Babb and <a href="david-james.html">David James</a> were all very talented players but if ever they had an off-day then the Spice Boys narrative would be dragged up.<br /><br />Maddison is lucky that in <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> and <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a>, he has two managers who are good at dealing with young lads.

But a lot of people have rightly pointed out that they have not been playing well and so now it’s an ­opportunity to take a step back, refocus and go again. Not only will they do that in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, I think you’ll see a concerted effort in the Champions League and there could be a cracking night at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> next week, almost Barcelonaesque, when <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> arrive for the second leg 1-0 up. I think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> might go stronger in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, too. Of course, it won’t be the starting XI you would expect in the league, but one or two more senior players may figure</p>

  <p><b>[Stan Collymore feels he has a solution to the problems facing football in the coronavirus outbreak]</b> It would be an absurdity, even in these exceptional circumstances, if the season were to be voided. And a club that have a 25-point lead and need just two wins from their remaining nine games were ­denied the right to be determined champions of England. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have quite obviously been the best team in the country this season by miles and they deserve to be recognised as such for the first time in 30 years. So wherever this season goes after the coronavirus pandemic has wreaked its havoc, whether we now finish the ­campaign or complete it down the line, nothing should deny them their title<br /><br />My solution for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> would be to get all 20 teams to 29 games as quickly as possible. It would take just two matches - <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> versus <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> versus <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. <a href="sheffield-united.html">The Blades</a> and <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">the Villans</a> could even have played behind closed doors this weekend, given that no one from either side has tested positive for Covid-19. Then, at least, everyone would have played the same number of fixtures and we could say that whatever ­position each team was in after 29 games was the position they had finished in. Now, I know that would lead to ­problems with relegation. Because teams will say, ‘Well, hang on, look at our run-in, it’s easier than theirs and we think we’d have got out of trouble’.<br /><br />So to avoid any complaints or even litigation, the best thing would be to not relegate anyone. And I don’t want to detract from the success <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>, West Brom, Coventry, Rotherham, Crewe and Swindon have enjoyed this season. So to keep things fair, I’d promote them all and play with two extra teams in each division next season. The key to that working would then be for five teams to go down in a year’s time to reduce the numbers in each division to what they traditionally are. This would be the fairest solution, as far as I can tell, because simply ­restarting the leagues when the World Health Organisation says it’s OK would probably delay next season… and that comes with its own set of problems. So let’s get everyone to the 29-game mark and if the pandemic doesn’t show signs of abating any time soon, then let’s just call it - and hand <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> the trophy they so richly deserve</p>

The conscience he has shown football these past couple of weeks is more important than any trophy he will ever lift for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Henderson has been the driving force behind the Players Together campaign and no one should underestimate the work he will have had to put in. A few might say, ‘What are you ­talking about, Stan? It will only have meant him calling a few of his mates.’ Yes, he’ll have had a couple of numbers through England, but even in the best of times, ­getting hold of the rest of them wouldn’t have been easy - and in a lockdown it will have been even harder. Don’t underestimate either how much work will have had to go into having chats with everyone and ­working out with 19 other fellas the mechanics of what you need to do and the right vehicle for the support you want to give. That isn’t easy at all. Then you have to make sure the money gets to the right places - the NHS and other community initiatives set up to help people during the coronavirus pandemic - and again it’s not something that’s straightforward. The way Jordan has conducted himself has been exemplary<br /><br />Four or five years ago, many - ­myself included - questioned what he brought to the team… but we know now what it is. He isn’t a great orator like <a href="kenny-dalglish.html">Kenny Dalglish</a>, <a href="graeme-souness.html">Graeme Souness</a> and <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> and maybe doesn’t wear his heart on his sleeve as they did. He certainly doesn’t have the bells and whistles of a <a href="kenny-dalglish.html">Dalglish</a> and he might not have a stand named after him in years to come, but heroes come in all forms and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans remember theirs. Henderson will go down as the quiet man who got things done - both on the pitch and off it</p>

  <p><b>[Stan Collymore offers his verdict on season resumption plans]</b> I’ve changed my mind and, if we do reach a stage where a line has to be drawn through the season, then I see no option but for the three teams at the bottom to go down<br /><br />I say that with a heavy heart ­because it would mean my club, <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>, being relegated with <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> and <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>. Although the caveat is we’d have to level the playing field by making sure all top-flight clubs had played 29 matches<br /><br />That would mean <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> versus Villa and Manchester City-Arsenal being played behind closed doors. And if Villa win, great, they stay up. But if they lose, they’re down - tough luck and lump it<br /><br />I know people will argue the clubs signed up to a 38-game competition and that they shouldn’t be relegated if the season isn’t fulfilled, but we’re never going to get a perfect solution. I’d argue teams shouldn’t be in that position after 29 games, so they only have themselves to blame</p>

  <p><b>[Stan Collymore says Werner isn’t <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> &amp; would’ve flopped at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> The deal to take <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is a perfect arrangement for all concerned. Perfect for the player, perfect for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">the Blues</a>, perfect for <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a>, who are trousering £53million, and perfect for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as well. He’s a good, solid striker with promise - an all-rounder who holds the ball up well, is mobile, gets into the box and scores goals. But the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans sobbing about missing out on him can spare me the tears because he’s not <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> or <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and the way some have reacted, you’d be forgiven for thinking he was some sort of reincarnation of both. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are the European champions, world champions and soon-to-be <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> champions, and there would be massive pressure on him as the summer’s marquee signing at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> on the back of all that. Add in the fact that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> already have arguably the best-balanced front three in the world and I’m struggling to see where Werner would have fitted in. I wouldn’t have seen him displacing any of them and, given everything that team has done together, I could even have seen him flopping. Why? Because walking into that dressing room would have been massively intimidating for a 24-year-old. At <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, though, he will look around and see <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> and <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Olivier Giroud</a>, and think, ‘Yes, good players, but I’ll have that challenge’. He knows he’s not the finished article yet and that’s what <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will be looking for even if they aren’t the sort of signings <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> is fabled for making.<br /><br />As for the notion that <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> couldn’t justify Werner’s fee, I’m sure there is an element of the Kop boss not wanting to appear gaudy or louche in the current climate. He’s not a Billy Bullshitter after all.
