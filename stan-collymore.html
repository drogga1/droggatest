  <p><b>[In the wake of <a href="ugo-ehiogu.html">Ugo Ehiogu</a>’s death, former <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> teammate Stan Collymore paid tribute to the late defender]</b> I joined Villa straight after the 96/97 season ended and immediately went with the gaffer, Brian Little to San Francisco to meet up with my new team mates on a post season 2 game tour against LA Galaxy and San Jose</p>

<p><br /><br />Being ‘My’ club I was so excited to get there ( Steve Gough of Cannock Villa was waiting at San Fran airport with the Cannock Villa flag!) so I got to the hotel , did a medical and Ugo was the first person to come and say hello, the first person to take time to welcome me to the club I supported as a kid. I was nervous, he knew it, and rather than be the alpha male that many of us players can be around each other, he showed me around, we hung out over the coming days and he was instrumental in helping me settle in. Going to Villa was my dream so for him to see that and just offer calm, cool friendship is something I’ll never forget.<br /><br />He was already great friends with Bozza and <a href="dwight-yorke.html">Dwight Yorke</a> but wasn’t as loud as them or me, just cooler than cool at the back with a big smile but always up for fun and a laugh</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool’s title credentials have been questioned by Stan Collymore]</b> The big worry I have for Liverpool going into the new Premier League season is that they were great last time out, firing on all cylinders – but they still came up just short. Can Klopp’s front three of Roberto Firmino, Mo Salah and Sadio Mane be better than they were last season? Is James Milner going to get better? Is Jordan Henderson going to get ­better? And will Virgil van Dijk have a better season than the last one?<br /><br />Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson? Maybe the attacking full-backs can improve, but will that be enough to surpass what City bring this year? That’s why I’m having Liverpool to hover around the same standard as last season and, if they do, it will still mean them winning a ridiculous amount of points. But, for the Reds to win the title, City will have drop a whole load of points – and I just don’t see that happening</p>

  <p><b>[Stan Collymore claims Manchester United paid double his true worth for Harry Maguire]</b> Manchester United finally got their man on Monday with the £80m capture of Harry Maguire but they have paid double his true worth. United unveiled their big-money buy on a six-year deal from Leicester after a lengthy pursuit which started last summer after the World Cup. I like and respect England stopper Maguire who is a very good player, leader and influence in the dressing room. But the 26-year-old is not in the same class as Liverpool’s Dutch stopper Virgil van Dijk. For a British central defender with leadership qualities, Harry fits the bill. But if you want premium quality to push you to a title or Champions League then Van Dijk is your man. Maguire, even in an expensive market, is overpriced and United have played twice the price of his realistic value in my view to make him the world’s most expensive defender<br /><br />His price tag means he now eclipses Van Dijk, 28, who became the world’s costliest defender when he joined Liverpool from Southampton in January 2018 for £75m. But that has proven to be worth every penny. I remember people talking about Van Dijk back at Celtic and saying this guy is a Rolls Royce. He is now looking a bargain because the Dutchman has to be worth £200m to a Barcelona, Real Madrid or PSG as he is that influential and that good. Maguire is going to have to step up and then some to prove himself as good a signing</p>

  <p><b>[Stan Collymore says Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial should be looking at scoring ‘20 league goals at a minimum’ this season if the club is to challenge in the top four]</b> I had Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s boys ­missing out on the top four before a ball had been kicked this season. But their start – a thumping 4-0 win over Chelsea, along with the performances of Paul Pogba, Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Harry Maguire in particular – did hint that they might just surprise one or two of us. I’m not going to get carried away by one result and say they are now nailed on for the top four. The game against Wolves will be a ­bellwether to all of that. Success or failure for United this season will depend on their big characters – Pogba, Maguire and De Gea. But also to a certain extent on Rashford and Martial.<br /><br />A couple of seasons ago I wrote that Manchester City’s England forward Raheem Sterling needed to start producing the sort of ­football we knew he was capable of far more consistently. Now it’s time to send the same message to the United frontmen. Manager Solskjaer is ­looking for players he can put his money on, players he knows he can rely on, and those two need to step up to the plate. They will be full of confidence after their goals against Chelsea last weekend and I want to see both of them going north of 15 goals. Last season in the league it was 10 apiece – and that’s not going to help United get to the sort of areas in t he table they really should be. Ideally, both should be looking at 20 league goals as a minimum in a 38-game season, which is the benchmark for all top strikers</p>

  <p><b>[Stan Collymore urges <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> to make a definitive decision on his best position]</b> If <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> isn’t careful then, sooner rather than later, he is going to find himself cast as the modern-day <a href="theo-walcott.html">Theo Walcott</a>. Someone who isn’t seen as an out-and-out winger or straight-up No.9 but a Jack of all trades as a forward and master of none. That’s why now is the perfect time for him to decide whether that’s the way he wants to go. Or would he rather be a player who lives or dies as a No.9. If he’s happy to play anywhere if it means being an England regular then that’s his call. But if that is the case over the next five to 10 years then I worry about the negative impact such a decision could have on his club career because of the message it sends.<br /><br /><a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> could well be forgiven for thinking, ‘Well, if this lad doesn’t have the confidence to back himself as England’s main No.9 then why should I back him at arguably the biggest club in the world? I’ll go out and buy an off-the-peg goalscorer in that case, someone who knows exactly what they are and what they want to be’. There’s no way <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> can toddle off with England every few months and play out wide and then go back to Old Trafford and play like <a href="ruud-van-nistelrooy.html">Ruud van Nistelrooy</a>. So there’s a potential problem brewing for him. And at 21, maybe now is the time for him to say, ‘You know what, I might not get into the next three squads if I say I’ll only play as a No.9. But if that is the case then I’ll go back to Carrington during international breaks and say, ‘Gaffer, teach me everything I need to know about operating within the width of the 18-yard box and playing with my back to goal’</p>

If you’re looking for weaknesses, maybe you could point to <a href="adrian.html">Adrian</a> being out of contract in the summer and <a href="divock-origi.html">Divock Origi</a> being slightly disappointing in his performance and the fact he had to go off.

  <p><b>[Stan Collymore says James Maddison has been warned that he is in danger of emulating the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> ‘Spice Boys’ of the past]</b> When James Maddison arrived on the scene at <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a>, I heard from a few people what a great young talent he was. I also heard he was very, very confident and the sort of whom it could be said that: ‘If he was chocolate, he’d eat himself’. I don’t mind that, actually, because the best players need to have an unbelievable inner-belief if they’re going to go on to be the very best. But it’s all about channelling that inner-belief on the field and, off it, making sure you don’t give critics a reason to have a go at you.<br /><br />It’s about making sure ‘confident lad’ doesn’t bleed into ‘Jack the lad’ because that’s when the problems can start. His decision to go out to a casino on Friday night, having been stood down from international duty through illness, wasn’t the biggest crime and there was no suggestion he was steaming drunk. But you have to know the right time to do things when you’re in the spotlight and learn that if you do want to socialise, particularly in such circumstances, your best bet is to do it at home with family or friends.<br /><br />Maddison reminds me a bit of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s old Spice Boys, a group I was referred to alongside but never actually tagged in. <a href="jamie-redknapp.html">Jamie Redknapp</a>, <a href="jason-mcateer.html">Jason McAteer</a>, Phil Babb and <a href="david-james.html">David James</a> were all very talented players but if ever they had an off-day then the Spice Boys narrative would be dragged up.<br /><br />Maddison is lucky that in <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> and <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a>, he has two managers who are good at dealing with young lads. And I’m sure they will have a conversation between themselves about how best to make things work for him. I’d imagine Rodgers and <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a> will put an arm round him and guide him in the right direction. That direction should see him cutting out the chat to the likes of Jeremy Clarkson on Twitter and making sure he is just known for his football. Because if he doesn’t do that then the likes of <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> and <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> will be well passing him in double quick time.<br /><br /><a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a> is actually a very good example of someone who curbed his ways - he is now the captain of <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> and someone who does and says all the right things. He has learned to play the game on and off the pitch, and that’s exactly what Maddison must do now</p>

  <p><b>[Stan Collymore says <a href="son-heungmin.html">Son Heung-min</a> went ‘over the top’ with his emotional reaction to Andre Gomes’ injury in a problem symptomatic of today’s footballers]</b> I am not saying <b>[Son and Aurier]</b> shouldn’t have been upset or shown distress, because these are normal human emotions. The way Son reacted made it look like he thought football – the referee, the authorities, fans at home and in the crowd, opponents – was going to come down on him like a ton of bricks, even though we could all see he didn’t deliberately go out to cause Gomes’ injury. For a while now, I have been bothered that players and managers seem to think they must show an extreme version of their emotions because of the comeback they will get if they do not. Nowadays, footballers seemingly have to go over the top to present themselves before the court of public opinion and that needs to stop<br /><br /><b>[Collymore played down the seriousness of Gomes’ fracture-dislocation and talked up his own quick recovery]</b> His fracture will likely be an inch or two long, not too bad. The bad part of the injury will be the fact the ankle ligaments have been strained and torn - they will need a lot of massaging to stop them going gluey and to ensure they grow back, which they will. I had a titanium plate fitted to get me back playing again and I did it in six weeks and two days, which I was very proud of</p>

He can fill in centrally and still make up width and that is a nod to the exceptional tactics of <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, who knows his two young full-backs will sometimes get overloaded and need a bit of help. I was one of those who looked at Henderson and <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a> and wondered if they’d be the two who could hamper the team. Milner has been round the block and has always been a great pro, but I wasn’t sure he’d add another dimension.<br /><br />I was with a lot of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans who also wondered if Henderson should even be in the team, let alone be captain.

Any team that has lots of mercurial characters and youngsters needs a glue to bind it together and those two have done that and then some for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. And if - if - <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> do end up being crowned champions this season there is no doubt that they will have been two of the most important drivers of that.<br /><br />Henderson, in particular, given the way he has grown into the captaincy.

  <p><b>[Stan Collymore says <a href="alex-oxlade-chamberlain.html">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> can become England’s new Gazza]</b> We still desperately need a player who can run with the ball from the halfway line to the edge of the opponents’ box next summer. A Paul Gascoigne-type figure. I know that sort of player doesn’t grow on trees, but it’s what we’re ­crying out for. <a href="james-maddison.html">James Maddison</a> is a passer, <a href="harry-winks.html">Harry Winks</a> a fire-starter with his little passes, <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> arrives in the area, <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> plays too high up for this to be his job and it just isn’t <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a>’s game. The one man who can do it is Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain<br /><br />Now, I’m not comparing him to Gazza, but what I am saying is that he gave us a taster last week of his ability to run with the ball and commit midfielders and defenders – and that’s not something any England player has done well for a long time. <a href="james-maddison.html">James Maddison</a> and <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> do it from time to time, but not in the same way as the Ox, who can run past players at pace, draw three or four to him to like moths to a flame, and then pop the ball off. He can do something special. <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> has it in the locker as well, albeit in slower motion, but <a href="alex-oxlade-chamberlain.html">Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> is ahead of him in the pecking order as things stand. My one concern about the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> player is that he’s very one-footed, but what he will do in tight games is get shots off from ­distance and that can cause ­problems and open ­up ­opposition defences.<br /><br />The fact is, if we go the distance next summer, the ­majority of our games will be in the British Isles. So we will want to play on the front foot and get at people. That’s why I’ll be closely watching the Ox over the next few months – ­because he can show just how good he is at that. I won’t say he’s a shoo-in to start for England, but he’s ­certainly a shoo-in for the squad, if fit. He can offer ­alternatives and, more ­importantly, he’s a player who can get people out of their seats</p>

  <p><b>[Stan Collymore says Talk of emulating <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s ‘Invincibles’ had become an unwelcome distraction for Liverpool]</b> Now all the Invincibles talk will stop, which will serve <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> well because I don’t think that helped. The notion that they have lost will make the players sit up and realise they’ve got to win just four games to lift <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title. There will be a real focus on the other tournaments, too. There was so much talk about ­Jurgen <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s men going unbeaten and winning the league. That was becoming the overriding story of the season – could they be the best <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> team ever and get 100-odd points? To be fair to <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> and his players, it has not been them who have been talking about this. Now they can say we still have work to do in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, which will take us into April, we’ve still got <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup and the Champions League<br /><br />What <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a> and his team-mates will have learnt from that defeat is unless you are at your very best and completely switched on for every match, anybody in the top flight can trip you up – including any team in the bottom three. They will look at that and redouble their efforts in the three remaining competitions. Historically any sportsman or woman who has suffered a shock defeat, all great champions all get back to basics and doing what got them to the top in the first place. If <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> had been playing well and ­winning games for the last five or six weeks, we would not even be discussing this right now. But a lot of people have rightly pointed out that they have not been playing well and so now it’s an ­opportunity to take a step back, refocus and go again. Not only will they do that in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, I think you’ll see a concerted effort in the Champions League and there could be a cracking night at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> next week, almost Barcelonaesque, when <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> arrive for the second leg 1-0 up. I think the Reds might go stronger in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, too. Of course, it won’t be the starting XI you would expect in the league, but one or two more senior players may figure</p>

  <p><b>[Stan Collymore feels he has a solution to the problems facing football in the coronavirus outbreak]</b> It would be an absurdity, even in these exceptional circumstances, if the season were to be voided. And a club that have a 25-point lead and need just two wins from their remaining nine games were ­denied the right to be determined champions of England. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have quite obviously been the best team in the country this season by miles and they deserve to be recognised as such for the first time in 30 years. So wherever this season goes after the coronavirus pandemic has wreaked its havoc, whether we now finish the ­campaign or complete it down the line, nothing should deny them their title<br /><br />My solution for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> would be to get all 20 teams to 29 games as quickly as possible. It would take just two matches – <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> versus <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> versus <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. The Blades and the Villans could even have played behind closed doors this weekend, given that no one from either side has tested positive for Covid-19. Then, at least, everyone would have played the same number of fixtures and we could say that whatever ­position each team was in after 29 games was the position they had finished in. Now, I know that would lead to ­problems with relegation. Because teams will say, ‘Well, hang on, look at our run-in, it’s easier than theirs and we think we’d have got out of trouble’.<br /><br />So to avoid any complaints or even litigation, the best thing would be to not relegate anyone. And I don’t want to detract from the success <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>, West Brom, Coventry, Rotherham, Crewe and Swindon have enjoyed this season. So to keep things fair, I’d promote them all and play with two extra teams in each division next season. The key to that working would then be for five teams to go down in a year’s time to reduce the numbers in each division to what they traditionally are. This would be the fairest solution, as far as I can tell, because simply ­restarting the leagues when the World Health Organisation says it’s OK would probably delay next season… and that comes with its own set of problems. So let’s get everyone to the 29-game mark and if the pandemic doesn’t show signs of abating any time soon, then let’s just call it – and hand <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> the trophy they so richly deserve</p>

The conscience he has shown football these past couple of weeks is more important than any trophy he will ever lift for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Henderson has been the driving force behind the Players Together campaign and no one should underestimate the work he will have had to put in. A few might say, ‘What are you ­talking about, Stan? It will only have meant him calling a few of his mates.’ Yes, he’ll have had a couple of numbers through England, but even in the best of times, ­getting hold of the rest of them wouldn’t have been easy – and in a lockdown it will have been even harder. Don’t underestimate either how much work will have had to go into having chats with everyone and ­working out with 19 other fellas the mechanics of what you need to do and the right vehicle for the support you want to give. That isn’t easy at all. Then you have to make sure the money gets to the right places – the NHS and other community initiatives set up to help people during the coronavirus pandemic – and again it’s not something that’s straightforward. The way Jordan has conducted himself has been exemplary<br /><br />Four or five years ago, many – ­myself included – questioned what he brought to the team… but we know now what it is. He isn’t a great orator like <a href="kenny-dalglish.html">Kenny Dalglish</a>, <a href="graeme-souness.html">Graeme Souness</a> and <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> and maybe doesn’t wear his heart on his sleeve as they did. He certainly doesn’t have the bells and whistles of a <a href="kenny-dalglish.html">Dalglish</a> and he might not have a stand named after him in years to come, but heroes come in all forms and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans remember theirs. Henderson will go down as the quiet man who got things done – both on the pitch and off it</p>

  <p><b>[Stan Collymore offers his verdict on season resumption plans]</b> I’ve changed my mind and, if we do reach a stage where a line has to be drawn through the season, then I see no option but for the three teams at the bottom to go down<br /><br />I say that with a heavy heart ­because it would mean my club, <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>, being relegated with <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> and Bournemouth. Although the caveat is we’d have to level the playing field by making sure all top-flight clubs had played 29 matches<br /><br />That would mean <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> versus Villa and Manchester City-Arsenal being played behind closed doors. And if Villa win, great, they stay up. But if they lose, they’re down – tough luck and lump it<br /><br />I know people will argue the clubs signed up to a 38-game competition and that they shouldn’t be relegated if the season isn’t fulfilled, but we’re never going to get a perfect solution. I’d argue teams shouldn’t be in that position after 29 games, so they only have themselves to blame</p>

  <p><b>[Stan Collymore says Werner isn’t <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> &amp; would’ve flopped at Liverpool]</b> The deal to take <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is a perfect arrangement for all concerned. Perfect for the player, perfect for the Blues, perfect for <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a>, who are trousering £53million, and perfect for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as well. He’s a good, solid striker with promise - an all-rounder who holds the ball up well, is mobile, gets into the box and scores goals. But the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans sobbing about missing out on him can spare me the tears because he’s not <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> or <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and the way some have reacted, you’d be forgiven for thinking he was some sort of reincarnation of both. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are the European champions, world champions and soon-to-be <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> champions, and there would be massive pressure on him as the summer’s marquee signing at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> on the back of all that. Add in the fact that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> already have arguably the best-balanced front three in the world and I’m struggling to see where Werner would have fitted in. I wouldn’t have seen him displacing any of them and, given everything that team has done together, I could even have seen him flopping. Why? Because walking into that dressing room would have been massively intimidating for a 24-year-old. At <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, though, he will look around and see <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> and <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Olivier Giroud</a>, and think, ‘Yes, good players, but I’ll have that challenge’.
