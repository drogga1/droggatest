<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Christiano Francois played with friends and neighbors, hoping to rejoin an organized team again, but his life would soon take a turn]</b> His livelihood has been ravaged <b>[by haitian earthquake]</b>. We didn’t know him as a person or a player, but we wanted to help<br /><br /><b>[As a player]</b> The skill set was very raw. The athleticism was there, but he needed to apply the technical and tactical applications<br /><br /><b>[While embracing a new culture and language, Francois retained strong ties to his past. He would bring a Haitian flag to every match and, once play began, entrust it to fellow students, who waved it after each of his goals]</b> He was very open about the struggle at home. People rallied around him. He always kept one eye on Haiti and he always talked about wanting to give back</p>
