  <p><b>[Kyle Edmund talks about <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s title success and <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a>’s footballing IQ]</b> When it happened, one side of me was like ‘wow, we’ve done it’ but then I was thinking it’s not that surprising because we were kind of going to do it with that lead. We had to sit and wait with that lead all through lockdown, but the way it’s turned out is just how it is with no fans watching and another team winning. The dream was always like doing it by winning at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> with the fans, but I think in the circumstances I don’t think anyone really cares. We’ve won the league after a lot of people reminding us how long we haven’t had it which is fair enough but at least we’ve got it now<br /><br />I was watching the game and texting a few mates and then when <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> scored that penalty I was like, ‘surely that’s it now’ and then the videos start to come out on social media with the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> players and all the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans. I even contemplated going up to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> in my car and joining in with the celebrations but I had to play in the Battle of the Brits the next day so I was like, ‘I don’t think this is a good idea’. I guess the players have the remainder of the season to enjoy it now.<br /><br />I honestly think the way they’re playing it’s not like they’ve just scraped the title. The way they’ve been playing the last few seasons, there’s no reason why they can’t keep going and they’ve proven that they have consistency, so I think it’s a massive opportunity to have more good seasons. The morals and the standards that <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has set, I don’t think anyone will be relaxed or go through the motions next season knowing they’ve already won it. That squad is a proper squad that win a lot of football matches<br /><br /><b>[His IQ of football was so high you don’t have to explain too much]</b> I remember it was in between the first and second leg of the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> tie. I think they were playing Bournemouth at home that weekend and I got to go up there. Because of the way <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a> training ground is set up with all the houses surrounding it, there isn’t much privacy so they put that green screen around the training pitches. There were strictly no cameras allowed. There were only players and coaches, and amazingly <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> asked me if I wanted to watch the session. He even came up to me during the session and started talking a little bit about tennis and football. I was like a little kid that day, I couldn’t believe the access I was getting.<br /><br />We were talking about different players and he was talking about <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>, whose English is not amazing but it’s OK. They have a few Portuguese speaking players so you could explain a drill and sometimes you might have to translate it, but he said with <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> you don’t have to explain it. You just do the drill and he picks it up like that. He was basically saying his football IQ was so high you don’t have to explain too much. To hear that from <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> was pretty cool</p>
