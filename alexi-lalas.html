  <p><b>[Alexi Lalas was right to speak in favor of USA Soccer’s national anthem policy]</b> It’s a privilege, it’s an honor and it’s a choice to represent your country. And it comes with responsibilities and expectations. I know nowadays sometimes the national anthem is viewed as background noise, or is a reminder to some of the real problems we have as a country. But I look at it as a unique moment when we come together, we honor and celebrate being citizens of the greatest country in the world. And I think it’s a tradition that should be preserved.<br /><br />I have been in stadiums where I have stood for the anthem where everybody has booed, where flags have been burned, where I’ve been called every name in the book. I have never served in the military, I have represented my country on the field. I know that pales in the comparisons to the men and women in the armed forces who serve our country, and some who have paid the ultimate price.</p>

<bt><br />Damn right, I'm going to stand, I'm going to put my hand over my heart and I am going to sing. And I believe that all U.S. national team players should be required to do that because just because we live in the land of the free, doesn't mean we are free to do anything that we want

&gt; <b>[Former LA Galaxy general manager Alexi Lalas - the man who brought David Beckham to MLS - believes the club have a chance to sign Zlatan Ibrahomivic]</b> I think they do have a chance. And whether it's this summer or maybe a year from now I still think there's going to be interest.<br /><br />The David Beckham thing didn't happen overnight. There was a relationship that was fostered and cultivated over the years and then when that perfect moment came they were ready to act, not just with the money but with the entire package<br /><br />There's a lifestyle issue that is very, very attractive to people and the opportunity for him to come into this market in North America and just inject that Zlatan brand to a public that, while many soccer people know, the people outside of soccer maybe don't know. And that can be very attractive to people that are concerned and cultivate a brand

&gt; <b>[Alexi Lalas gives Bruce Arena 'A-plus' for revitalizing USA]</b> If you were to grade Bruce Arena in 2017, he would get an A-plus. What was the mandate? You go in there, and you right the ship. The federation believed it was an emergency situation and they were in danger of not qualifying for the World Cup.<br /><br />I just get the sense there is a renewed belief and hope and confidence - from the outside, in terms of how we view this team, and more importantly how the players view themselves in relation to Bruce Arena and what they're trying to do

&gt; <b>[Alexi Lalas calls out USMNT in epic rant]</b> What are you guys going to do? Are you going to continue to be a bunch of soft, under-performing, tattooed millionaires? You are a soccer generation that has been given everything, you are a soccer generation on the verge of squandering everything.

&gt; <b>[Alexi Lalas explains his epic tirade against the USMNT]</b> To see us at this point where it could go two different ways, this precipice if you will, I just felt that given the problems that occurred over the last week with the two qualifiers, it was topical and that's why I decided to do it. It was an emotional reflection of where we are and where we hope to be. I am a human being - I can confirm that - and as such I have emotions and I have reactions and I have feelings, especially when it regards something that I hold near and dear, which is this team.<br /><br />As far as the individuals mentioned, they were by design because ... the premise was based around a time for leaders to step up and to lead. I believe that that group I mentioned, including Bruce Arena, are at least from the outside, who the leadership of the group is. That's in a nutshell why those people were singled out<br /><br />I'm in the entertainment business. How I say something is just as important as what I say - I don't make any apologies for that. I recognize that when that red light goes on and I'm on camera, I am performing. Now that doesn't in any way mean that it is any less genuine or honest or authentic. I believe the things that I say, how I say them. The words that I choose are calculated and they are designed to have a desired impact and affect. If this is news to anybody out there, I think they're being disingenuous and pretty naive<br /><br />I fully believe that this team will figure out a way to get the results that it needs in order to qualify for the World Cup, but certainly you'd have to agree that they need to improve in order to do that in the next two games. When they do that, I will shower them with love.

&gt; <b>[Will calling off monitor be off-putting?]</b> It's disingenuous for me to say that it's ideal - it's not ideal and we recognize that. These are decisions that other people make and they make them for a reason. The ideal is that you're at the stadium and you're calling it, but life doesn't always work out like that and you have to make some very tough decisions. Ultimately this is a business.<br /><br /><b>[On Aly Wagner]</b> She works incredibly hard and that's just what jumps out at you immediately. The way that she is able to distill that work into providing interesting and insightful comments during a game, that's what you want. She's also not afraid to have an opinion

&gt; <b>[Christian Pulisic is attracting interest from the likes of Chelsea and Liverpool]</b> <b>[Pulisic]</b> is one of the phenoms in the world, he just happens to be American. There's going to be pressure to win, and to deliver. He's a very young player so he's still getting better. He's still physically growing, he's growing as a soccer player. There's a lot of pressure on his shoulders to lead us <b>[USMNT]</b> into the Promised Land. But if you're the man, you're gonna take it and say: 'Yeah, on my watch, we're going to make sure we qualify for the next World Cup. I am going to lead this team by example'.
