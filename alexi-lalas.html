  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="andriy-shevchenko.html">Andriy Shevchenko</a>]</b> You saw this great trajectory, this explosion and potential, and then there was a moment that was never specified, when he began going downhill and petering out.

  <p><b>[Christian Pulisic is attracting interest from the likes of Chelsea and Liverpool]</b> <b>[Pulisic]</b> is one of the phenoms in the world, he just happens to be American.
