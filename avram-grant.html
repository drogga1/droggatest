  <p><b>[Avram Grant revealed he thinks he was harshly treated by <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> owner Roman Abramovich]</b> Roman Abramovich said it was my fault that <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> missed the penalty and that we had not started the season so well. I was not there at the start of the season, but it is the job of a manager to be guilty<br /><br /><b>[He believes he deserves credit for the way he handled his time with Abramovich’s millionaire princes]</b> I have no point to prove. I was very close. The Champions League final went to the last kick. I can only be proud of what we did at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.<br /><br />It was one of the best seasons for the club and we were very close to winning the Champions League for the first time in the club’s history. Sometimes it takes time to build a team.<br /><br />It took <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> and <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a> more than a year to put their influence on the players at their clubs. We did it in a very short space of time and I am proud</p>

  <p><b>[In his interview for BBC’s Match of the Day 2, Grant described the relegation with <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> the ‘most sad day’ of his career in football]</b> I’m also sorry for the supporters, the people in the club and the players. Maybe this game was the story of our season. It’s a tough day.<br /><br /><b>[Asked about his future, Grant added]</b> My future is not important now. All I care about is the commitment to the team and the fans. It’s a big club and I’m sure they will back to the Premier Leagued</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on John Terry]</b> JT was a very good player. He could read the game, he had everything; he could play very tough, good with the head, a great leader, could finished game after game after game without making any mistakes. If he did make mistakes, you could be sure he’d be better in the next game. A good character, good player, and one of the best ever for England, for sure</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on Frank Lampard]</b> A great professional and a great player. He wasn’t quick, couldn’t dribble, but was very clever. Football today has become more aggressive, with more movement, everybody knows about tactics; you need players who are very intelligent, who know how to do the right thing at the right time. Football is all about scoring goals, and when <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> is in the box, give him one chance, the ball is inside (the goal). He’s a top professional, his training was very good, he’d always stay behind after training</p>

  <p><b>[Avram Grant reveals what he told Terry after <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> captain’s missed penalty in 2008 Champions League final]</b> a good way, Jose likes to be the centre of everything, the star. My approach is I am the director of a movie - the stars are the players. When I was hugging John I said, ‘I’ll never forget our first chat and how you helped the team get out of a bad situation. You can be proud’. We were really unlucky, we deserved to win, but nobody gets trophies because of ‘deserve’. If <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> scored when he hit the bar in extra time, it would have been one of the most beautiful team goals in a final - but this is history, huh?<br /><br />Reading my notes back made me proud of everything. You see only the result and the result was clear, but I consider more what brought us there. The training, the mentality, everything. No doubt, it was a great season</p>
