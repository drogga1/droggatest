  <p><b>[Avram Grant revealed he thinks he was harshly treated by <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> owner Roman Abramovich]</b> Roman Abramovich said it was my fault that <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> missed the penalty and that we had not started the season so well. I was not there at the start of the season, but it is the job of a manager to be guilty<br /><br /><b>[He believes he deserves credit for the way he handled his time with Abramovich’s millionaire princes]</b> I have no point to prove. I was very close. The Champions League final went to the last kick. I can only be proud of what we did at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.<br /><br />It was one of the best seasons for the club and we were very close to winning the Champions League for the first time in the club’s history. Sometimes it takes time to build a team.<br /><br />It took <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> and <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a> more than a year to put their influence on the players at their clubs. We did it in a very short space of time and I am proud</p>

  <p><b>[In his interview for BBC’s Match of the Day 2, Grant described the relegation with <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> the ‘most sad day’ of his career in football]</b> I’m also sorry for the supporters, the people in the club and the players. Maybe this game was the story of our season. It’s a tough day.<br /><br /><b>[Asked about his future, Grant added]</b> My future is not important now. All I care about is the commitment to the team and the fans. It’s a big club and I’m sure they will back to the Premier Leagued</p>

  <p><b>[Ghana coach Avram Grant has shed light on Tuesday’s friendly win over Uzbek side Bunyodkor]</b> It is always good to win. But obviously, we do want to take some lessons from this game because we tried some things that are a bit new. It’s good to see how the players implemented those things here<br /><br />Gyan is an amazing striker. Look at his stats compared to the minutes he played. His career is amazing so I’m not surprised he scored. He knows how to do it. He knows how to put the ball in the net</p>

  <p><b>[Coach Avram Grant says he hopes to guide Ghana to win the ultimate at the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations]</b> It’s not a secret. We came here to do something good. It’s okay to say we want to win <b>[the Afcon title]</b> but it would be unprofessional to think we will just get it.<br /><br />Of course, I hope and I believe it will happen. First we need to qualify and decide what we want. We need to win games and show great mentality. In football you need to show over and over and again. We were in the final the last time and we want to be there again. This time when we get there, it would be a different story<br /><br />It has been very good. The players have showed good spirit, the quality is good. We will be ready for the first game. I am very happy that the spirit has not changed. We started two years ago really well until things that did not concern football began to affect us. We don’t want to dwell in the past too because during this training camp the preparation has been good. It’s not been perfect but the basics have been great<br /><br />The blue shirt served me very well by the way. I remember that I wore the shirt in the last moment and my wife called me and said what is it with this shirt and I said we lost the match but then we won against Algeria and she said okay stay with that</p>

  <p><b>[How can Ghana qualify from Afcon Group D?]</b> We played against Uganda and we drew at home, and we’re facing important game in Egypt, who we will meet again at the Afcon. There are two more games against them. But the Africa Cup of Nations is different and the draw is very difficult. Anyway, every group is difficult but this group is very difficult<br /><br />As you know, African countries are better all the time. I was very surprised by the level of quality of football at the last Afcon, so I think it will be very tight</p>

  <p><b>[Ghana coach Avram Grant says his team is poised to go for broke against Uganda in their Africa Cup of Nations group opener on Tuesday]</b> A lot of people talk about pressure but we do not see it as a negative word. I believe pressure is good and let you perform. On Tuesday, you will see a team that will give everything on the pitch. I know my players better now than I did two years ago and they are a good group of players with a will to serve<br /><br />They <b>[Uganda]</b> are a tough team. It’s not easy to play against them. We had difficulties in the last game against them in Ghana. But we are not looking at the past too much; we are learning from the past but living in the present</p>

  <p><b>[Ghana coach Avram Grant is looking forward to a different quarter-finals performance at the Africa Cup of Nations]</b> The two teams <b>[DR Congo and Morocco]</b> that qualified from Group C are good and it’s going to be a tough game anyway. I hope the pitch in Oyem <b>[for the quarter-final clash]</b> is better. I would have liked to win but now we have to focus on the quarter final. It was a game decided by one mistake. They scored from a fantastic free-kick but we dominated after that. Unfortunately we didn’t score, but I’m happy with my players’ attitude. This is football. On Sunday, it is a different story and it would be a tough game. Asamoah Gyan injury is not looking good but we will see what happens and I hope he will be better. We will have a scan &amp; then we will know better.</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a>]</b> JT was a very good player. He could read the game, he had everything; he could play very tough, good with the head, a great leader, could finished game after game after game without making any mistakes. If he did make mistakes, you could be sure he’d be better in the next game. A good character, good player, and one of the best ever for England, for sure</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>]</b> A great professional and a great player. He wasn’t quick, couldn’t dribble, but was very clever. Football today has become more aggressive, with more movement, everybody knows about tactics; you need players who are very intelligent, who know how to do the right thing at the right time. Football is all about scoring goals, and when <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> is in the box, give him one chance, the ball is inside (the goal). He’s a top professional, his training was very good, he’d always stay behind after training</p>

  <p><b>[Avram Grant has set foot in Indian Football]</b> It is always difficult. I always like to build for myself. From the training, choosing the players, choosing the system, choosing the players that can fit the system. When you come in the middle of a season, it is more difficult because you have a game and you need to improve. The work is a little bit different.<br /><br />It was not a secret that the team did not score goals. We were working on this in training. And also the mental side that needs to improve. The players responded to it very well. I need to more time to think about how they are. How they are under pressure, how they are when winning or when losing. We tried to put in some modern stuff that will improve the team. The team responded very well. Every individual is better. But we need to continue with this process. To analyze players, I need more time<br /><br />I don’t think about this <b>[playoffs]</b> too much. The target is to win as much as we can and what will happen will happen. <b>[Indian football]</b> is very interesting. <b>[I was]</b> curious to see what’s happening. I was watching the development of the Indian league since it started. I agreed with owner John <b>[Abraham]</b> to come and see for a short time how it is. I am very happy that I am here. ISL impressed me. It is better football than I thought. Many teams are playing good football. The players who come here are experienced. The Indian players have a lot of ambition, they are hard workers<br /><br />There are good talents <b>[in India]</b> but also because they are starting football very late, they are a lot of things to improve. If Indian football wants to be good, they need to open academies. I think they are trying</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United and Chelsea managers Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte have set a bad example with their childish bickering]</b> Nobody needs to say what they said. Football is a game of emotions and sometimes even coaches need to be good examples with things that they don’t need to say. I’m sorry about this because they are two top managers and they have done this, but it will be settled on the pitch between the players of Manchester United and Chelsea. The coaches will not play. They are mature people and I’m sure that they don’t want to fight with each other. They did what they did and they will finish with this. The only fight in football needs to be on the pitch.<br /><br />I think Chelsea played well. They did a lot of counter attacks. They hit the post twice. Barcelona is Barcelona. They know how to hold the ball. It doesn’t matter which coach is in charge. The system is the same, they have the same identity, but I’m not sure if Barcelona will qualify. Chelsea can be a good counter-attacking team and like they did to Barcelona when they won the Champions League, they can do it again. Part of my job when I joined <b>[Chelsea]</b> as a director and then as a coach was to build a style of play, but it’s difficult to build one style of play when the coaches are changing. On the other hand, even Real Madrid don’t have a style of play - they change from time to time according to the players they have. I have a feeling that Chelsea will win in Barcelona</p>

  <p><b>[Avram Grant reveals what he told Terry after <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> captain’s missed penalty in 2008 Champions League final]</b> a good way, Jose likes to be the centre of everything, the star. My approach is I am the director of a movie - the stars are the players. When I was hugging John I said, ‘I’ll never forget our first chat and how you helped the team get out of a bad situation. You can be proud’. We were really unlucky, we deserved to win, but nobody gets trophies because of ‘deserve’. If <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> scored when he hit the bar in extra time, it would have been one of the most beautiful team goals in a final - but this is history, huh?<br /><br />Reading my notes back made me proud of everything. You see only the result and the result was clear, but I consider more what brought us there. The training, the mentality, everything. No doubt, it was a great season</p>
