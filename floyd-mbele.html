  <p><b>[Orlando Pirates could not confirm nor deny whether Giovanni Solinas could soon join the club as the new permanent head coach]</b> The last time I checked, Solinas had a contract with Free State Stars. It’s only now that I’m hearing from you that he has parted ways with them. It’s a work in progress <b>[the search for a coach]</b>. I cannot tell you who we are hoping to rope in at the moment, but I can assure you we have more than one coach on our list. Unfortunately, I cannot give names.<br /><br /><b>[Mbele tried to discount Giovanni Solinas]</b> The thing is, Pirates is a big club. The person who comes here must be capable of handling the pressure that comes with the job and also fight to produce results going into the second round.<br /><br />The season is not over yet. We still have a long way to go. This is an ambitious team. We go for whatever is on offer year in and year out. We never limit ourselves to just one trophy. Sure, we’ve already missed out on winning either or both of the MTN8 and the Telkom Knockout titles, but we can still push for something this season. We still have a fighting chance</p>

  <p><b>[Orlando Pirates are reportedly eyeing a coach who is currently in charge of a national team at the ongoing 2017 Africa Cup of Nations]</b> That’s a difficult question. It would be ideal to find someone as soon as possible. Some people may be employed at the moment, so that’s why we can’t say when it <b>[the process]</b> will be completed.<br /><br />Micho <b>[Milutin Sredojevic]</b> has done well for himself. We are happy that he has come through the club to show his abilities. But there has been no contact. The interest is coming from all over the world. There are those we might be looking at, so it’s a mixed bag</p>
