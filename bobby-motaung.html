  <p>[Kaizer Chiefs football manager Bobby Motaung says their three new signings were done with the consultation of their head coach Steve Komphela] All the signings were done in consultation with coach Steve Komphela and his technical team. Our plan is to have a strong team that will compete fiercely in the second half of the season and beyond.<br /><br />We welcome the player [Ntshangase] to Naturena. We are positive that the three acquisitions we’ve made thus far will make our supporters happy. We have been working tirelessly for the past few weeks to negotiate and finalise these new deals</p>

  <p>[Football manager Bobby Motaung has responded to reports that Kaizer Chiefs are interested in signing Mamelodi Sundowns attacker Khama Billiat] Khama is a Sundowns player and if there was any need to sign him, we would do what the same way we did with [Leonardo] Castro. We engaged Sundowns for the player [Castro]. At Chiefs, we engage clubs for all our needs. We don’t wait or hide in the corner. Billiat is an excellent player that everyone would want to have in their team, but let’s respect the fact that he’s a Sundowns player.</p>
