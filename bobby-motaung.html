  <p>[Kaizer Chiefs have confirmed that they will not deny Lorenzo Gordinho the opportunity to move to Europe if Aalborg BK wants to sign him] We are happy with the opportunity Gordinho got. Yes, we gave him permission to go there and we will wait to hear what Aalborg say. We wouldn’t have allowed him to go for trials if we didn’t want him to try his luck in Europe. We are happy for him and we wish him the best of luck. We don’t doubt his talent, and it is for that reason he was one of the four players who went to train with Fulham.</p>

  <p>[Kaizer Chiefs are remaining calm over the future of centre-back Erick Mathoho, whose current contract is up at the end of the season] I will speak to Mathoho and his agent sometime this week … no pressure. His future [at the club] is safe.<br /><br />I have been overseas. I haven’t been to work, but maybe there will be an update later in the week</p>

  <p>[Kaizer Chiefs team manager Bobby Motaung believes that his side stand a good chance of winning this season’s Premier Soccer League title] There’s nothing in it. We are one point behind the leaders. Apart from Mamelodi Sundowns who have games in hand, anybody in the top five at present could win the league. That’s what makes this season so interesting and exciting. We have two goals in the second round. We are challenging for the league and the Nedbank Cup. The turnaround at the end of the year has given the players inspiration and motivation. We believe we can achieve our goals. We are still in with a chance.<br /><br />We will make an announcement on players either on Monday or Tuesday<br /><br />[on Ismael Olivier Toure] I was looking for a left-sided defender. He was not what we wanted and we sent him home, releasing him back to his club in Ivory Coast. We took him to the airport and he disappeared. He acted unprofessionally. He is not our player or our concern</p>

  <p>[Kaizer Chiefs football manager Bobby Motaung says their three new signings were done with the consultation of their head coach Steve Komphela] All the signings were done in consultation with coach Steve Komphela and his technical team. Our plan is to have a strong team that will compete fiercely in the second half of the season and beyond.<br /><br />We welcome the player [Ntshangase] to Naturena. We are positive that the three acquisitions we’ve made thus far will make our supporters happy. We have been working tirelessly for the past few weeks to negotiate and finalise these new deals</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Football manager Bobby Motaung has responded to reports that Kaizer Chiefs are interested in signing Mamelodi Sundowns attacker Khama Billiat] Khama is a Sundowns player and if there was any need to sign him, we would do what the same way we did with [Leonardo] Castro. We engaged Sundowns for the player [Castro]. At Chiefs, we engage clubs for all our needs. We don’t wait or hide in the corner. Billiat is an excellent player that everyone would want to have in their team, but let’s respect the fact that he’s a Sundowns player.</p>
