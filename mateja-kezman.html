  <p><b>[Sergej Milinkovic-Savic has no agreement in place to leave Lazio this summer]</b> They are proving successful at present. Lazio have three big games to go and nobody has talked about any negotiations at this moment. The Biancocelesti have the opportunity to get their best result of recent years by qualifying for the Champions League. It’s only normal there is enormous interest in Sergej between some top European clubs, but we do not have any agreement with any club.</p>

  <p><b>[Lazio ace Milinkovic-Savic offered bumper €8m-per-year PSG deal]</b> Many teams were after Sergej and we presented a couple of very interesting offers to Lazio. He could have earned much more elsewhere - in France they offered him €8 million. But, in the end, we accepted the club’s decision not to sell without any arguments. They have rejected all the offers and we never pushed for a transfer because he is happy in Rome.<br /><br />President Claudio Lotito and sporting director Igli Tare explained that they want to aim for the Champions League and that Milinkovic is a key player to reach this goal. That is also his goal. He stayed because he wants to bring the Champions League to Lazio. And he is only 23, and under coach Simeone Inzaghi he is improving day by day - another year here will do him good</p>

  <p><b>[Sergej Milinkovic-Savic’s new contract at Lazio does not include a release clause]</b> Sergej, Lazio and we in his entourage are all very happy with his new contract. We’re looking forward with positive energy. The club is strong because they kept all of last season’s players, there’s a serious project and they want to play in the Champions League. So, everyone just has to concentrate on doing their best and making all the Lazio fans happy. No-one talked about a release clause, Sergej is very happy in Rome. He’s been here for three years and he loves the club and the city. He’s concentrating on recapturing his best form.</p>

  <p><b>[Have Man Utd dodged a €100m bullet as Milinkovic-Savic’s form nosedives at Lazio?]</b> Sergej loves Lazio, I’ve said it several times and I repeat it. He’s worn the Biancoceleste shirt for three years and he loves the club as they brought him to Italy, just as he loves his fans and team-mates. If he stayed, it’s because he believes in these colours. I’ve already said many times that we received many offers, but the idea of Lotito and <b>[sporting director Igli]</b> Tare, from the beginning, was to keep Milinkovic for another year. It was figuring out how to do it. We worked on it and ultimately Sergej said he was very happy to stay for another season. We’re not people who only think about money…</p>

  <p><b>[The perfect <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> replacement? Why <a href="sergej-milinkovic-savic.html">Sergej Milinkovic-Savic</a> would be a €90m gamble for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>]</b> All young players have ups and downs. People often forget that he’s not a striker. His job isn’t to score. He does a lot for the team during a game</p>
