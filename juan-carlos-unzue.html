  <p><b>[As former <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> goalkeeper coach Juan Carlos Unzue says about Sylvinho]</b> He was always willing to bring something to the group, regardless of his personal situation, whether he was starting or not. This kind of player is ideal to become a coach. He did not lack ambition, but he accepted his role</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> assistant coach Juan Carlos Unzue has revealed he has been diagnosed with motor neurone disease]</b> I insist I am coping well, I feel privileged to be able to have lived the life I have and now I feel privileged about what I will be able to do about ALS, which is a disease that anyone can get. I will try together with the Luzon Foundation to help improve the quality of life. We want to create a series of challenges or events that allow us to raise money for research. Hopefully in the not too distant future we will find a solution. <br /><br />People have a great capacity to adapt to life. I have met other sick people who are very much eager to continue living, despite the difficulties, because life is worth it. We at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> C. F. wish to send all of our affection and best wishes to Juan Carlos Unzue. We will be there for him and his family in the battle against this illness and offer all of our support and strength.</p>
