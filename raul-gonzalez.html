Schalke, for me, is a great adventure, and I wanted to experience new sensations away from Real Madrid<br /><br /><b>[Raul returned in the Bernabeu Trophy last summer and played 45 minutes for his former side as Madrid paid homage to their homecoming hero against the striker’s new side, Al-Sadd.

  <p><b>[Former Real Madrid and Schalke star Raul believes Manchester United are favourites to take this season’s UEFA Europa League crown]</b> I think there are favourites like Manchester United. They’re the team to beat. They are still in the process of creating a team. I think with the help of Mourinho, and the new signings, they still need a period to adapt. There’s also Roma, who are playing well. Lyon are another team, but Manchester United and Roma are the strongest teams with the most options. Personally, I would like to see a Spanish team, Celta Vigo, win the title. If that’s not the case, then I would like to see Schalke.<br /><br />Gladbach have started to win matches in recent weeks, and they’re playing better, while Schalke has had a bit of an irregular year, though they have improved since the winter break. I think it’s going to be a great tie. I know people think Gladbach are the favourites, but they will have to play two tough matches</p>

  <p><b>[Zinedine Zidane’s La Liga and Champions League-winning squad of 2017 is the best in Real Madrid’s history]</b> A League and European Cup Double after 59 years? What we have to do is try not to leave another double for so long. There are many challenges left. Next year, there are the European Super Cup, the Supercopa Espana, the Club World Cup… The important thing is for the team to keep their sense of union. I congratulate Zizou on how he’s managed this squad. <b>[They must]</b> keep working and fighting to continue giving joy to madridistas. I think this is the best squad in Madrid’s history, but the presence of Zidane is very important. He was the key element for how he managed everything. Without his humility and simplicity, it wouldn’t have been possible. Keeping 24 players happy is almost impossible and he’s succeeded in doing that. He deserves tremendous credit.</p>

With 15-year-old boys, then the Juvenil side and at the beginning with a lot of uncertainty, because you don’t know if you are going to have the ability to transmit <b>[your ideas]</b>.
