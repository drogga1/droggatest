  <p><b>[Video Assistant Referees <b>[VAR]</b> are set to feature at World Cup 2018]</b> The IFAB unanimously approved the use of video assistant referees at its 132nd Annual General Meeting that took place at FIFA’s headquarters in Zurich today. This landmark meeting, chaired by FIFA President Gianni Infantino, represents a new era for football with video assistance for referees helping to increase integrity and fairness in the game. Prior to taking its decision, the members of The IFAB was presented with the results of the independent analysis of the use of VARs conducted by Belgian university KU Leuven since the beginning of the VAR experiment in March 2016. The philosophy of VARs is ‘minimum interference - maximum benefit’ which aims to reduce unfairness caused by ‘clear and obvious errors’ or ‘serious missed incidents.</p>

  <p><b>[IFAB approves use of five substitutes per match once football returns after coronavirus outbreak]</b> The temporary amendment comes into force with immediate effect, and has been made as matches may be played in a condensed period in different weather conditions, both of which could have impacts on player welfare</p>

  <p><b>[Why has the five-substitute rule been introduced?]</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has had a far-reaching impact on daily life, including sport, around the world. As many countries begin to emerge from this situation, the focus is slowly turning to the resumption of football competitions that have been affected by the virus. When competitions resume, matches may be played in a condensed period (e.g. to reduce the impact on future competitions) and in different weather conditions, both of which could have an impact on player welfare</p>

  <p><b>[Handball rules updated by IFAB for 2020-21 season]</b> ‘Accidental’ handball by an attacking player (or team-mate) is only penalised if it occurs ‘immediately’ before a goal or clear goal-scoring opportunity. If an attacking player accidentally touches the ball with their hand or arm and the ball then goes to another attacking player and the attacking team immediately scores, this is a handball offence. It is not an offence if, after an accidental handball, the ball travels some distance (pass or dribble) and/or there are several passes before the goal or goal-scoring opportunity</p>

  <p><b>[Five substitutes to be allowed next season]</b> Following the decision taken on 8 May 2020 to give competitions scheduled to be completed in 2020 the option of allowing teams to use up to five substitutes, the IFAB Board of Directors had agreed to review whether to extend this option further. On the basis of this in-depth review based on stakeholder feedback and analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on competition calendars, the IFAB Board of Directors has approved to extend the option to competitions scheduled to be completed by 31 July 2021 and international competitions scheduled in July/August 2021. The main reason for the temporary amendment to Law 3 - The Players was the impact on player welfare of competitions being played in a condensed period and in different weather conditions. The recent review has shown that the reasons for the temporary amendment remain valid and the impact on player welfare is likely to continue into 2021.</p>
