  <p><b>[Federico Macheda: The rise and fall of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s teenage title hero]</b> <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> wanted me to go on loan; I could see that was sensible. Many <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs came in for me, including <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and Sunderland. But I wanted to play in Italy, in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>. <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> did not agree and said I should play in England, where he could keep an eye on me. He said he didn’t have the same power in Italy.<br /><br />I insisted on Italy and that was the worst mistake of my life. I should have listened to <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a>. <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a> had been in the Champions League play-off that season; they had a good team. But we went down the table and I started to get strong criticism, with people saying: ‘He’s come from Man United; who does he think he is?’. For the first time in my life my confidence dropped. I began to ask myself: ‘Am I good enough?’ And I started to get injured<br /><br /><b>[Reflecting on a career that started so brightly but quickly became a battle to establish himself]</b> When I made the step up to the <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> first team, I had to give three times as much as what I had already. I didn’t, which is the only regret I have. I’ve learned a lot from that mistake. I advise the younger players to listen to close relatives and friends, and to surround themselves with people who really love them. It’s never easy to manage pressure. You just have to focus on what you do on the pitch, and don’t worry too much about what the media is saying</p>

  <p><b>[Federico Macheda opens up on his <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> career]</b> I don’t regret anything. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> was a very beautiful experience for me and I still have many fantastic memories of my time there. Memories that I still take with me everywhere I go. In Manchester I grew up not only as a player but also as a man and I will always cherish those wonderful memories of my time playing for the biggest club in the world<br /><br />I wouldn’t make that decision again. I once said that going to <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a> was a mistake because it was a negative experience for me but it’s part and parcel of a footballer’s career. Sometimes you take a good, sometimes a bad decision. That one was a bad one. But it was a good lesson, which taught me a lot<br /><br />We all know that it’s hard for anyone to establish themselves at a club like that but I left a blueprint on United’s history. Remember that during my time there <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> had many great players so it was difficult to play regularly. Of course I would have loved to play longer but I have no regrets because I gave my best, tried my hardest to excel but like everyone knows I was also a bit unlucky with injuries. After that, the club and I went separate roads and I took my own career path<br /><br />No one knows how my career would have panned out if I hadn’t scored that goal (against Villa). But I had a lot of bad luck with injuries in the years after that famous goal and it wasn’t easy to cope physically and mentally.<br /><br />An Italian team I’d love to play for? <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a>. I’d choose <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> over Inter, Milan and <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> because I am Laziale</p>
