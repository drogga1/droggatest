  <p><b>[Federico Macheda has acknowledged that snubbing the advice of legendary Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was the worst mistake he ever made]</b> I had a few runs of games but I needed to be playing every week. Fergie wanted me to go on loan; I could see that was sensible. Many Premier League clubs came in for me including Everton and Sunderland. But I wanted to play in Italy, in Serie A. Fergie did not agree and said I should play in England, where he could keep an eye on me. He said he didn’t have the same power in Italy. I insisted on Italy and that was the worst mistake of my life.<br /><br />I should have listened to Fergie. Sampdoria had been in the Champions League playoff that season; they had a good team. I was going to replace Antonio Cassano and play up front with <b>[Giampaolo]</b> Pazzini. I started well and scored straight away against Udinese, then started against Milan, Napoli, Juventus, Roma. But then they sold Pazzini to Inter Milan. I was only 19; I couldn’t take the responsibility that he had.<br /><br />We went down the table and I started to get strong criticism, with people saying: ‘He’s come from Man United; who does he think he is?’ For the first time in my life my confidence dropped. I began to ask myself: ‘Am I good enough?’ And I started to get injured</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United striker Federico Macheda’s latest attempts to reignite his career have seen him join Panathinaikos on a three-year deal]</b> It’s a great pleasure to be here. I’ve been looking forward to signing. Panathinaikos was my first choice. When Panathinaikos proposes, you don’t deny it. The manager convinced me. When you have the coach’s confidence, it’s a big deal. To Panathinaikos I have the greatest motivation I have ever had. I’m thinking about what I’ll accomplish day by day. I have the traits as a man to be a leader in this group and to help my Nearoteroys team-mates<br /><br />I have worked with the most successful coach, Sir Alex Ferguson. He was always there for me. I’m proud to have worked with the top</p>

I didn’t, which is the only regret I have. I’ve learned a lot from that mistake. I advise the younger players to listen to close relatives and friends, and to surround themselves with people who really love them. It’s never easy to manage pressure. You just have to focus on what you do on the pitch, and don’t worry too much about what the media is saying</p>

  <p><b>[Federico Macheda opens up on his <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> career]</b> I don’t regret anything. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> was a very beautiful experience for me and I still have many fantastic memories of my time there. Memories that I still take with me everywhere I go. In Manchester I grew up not only as a player but also as a man and I will always cherish those wonderful memories of my time playing for the biggest club in the world<br /><br />I wouldn’t make that decision again. I once said that going to <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a> was a mistake because it was a negative experience for me but it’s part and parcel of a footballer’s career. Sometimes you take a good, sometimes a bad decision. That one was a bad one. But it was a good lesson, which taught me a lot<br /><br />We all know that it’s hard for anyone to establish themselves at a club like that but I left a blueprint on United’s history. Remember that during my time there <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> had many great players so it was difficult to play regularly. Of course I would have loved to play longer but I have no regrets because I gave my best, tried my hardest to excel but like everyone knows I was also a bit unlucky with injuries. After that, the club and I went separate roads and I took my own career path<br /><br />No one knows how my career would have panned out if I hadn’t scored that goal (against Villa). But I had a lot of bad luck with injuries in the years after that famous goal and it wasn’t easy to cope physically and mentally.<br /><br />An Italian team I’d love to play for? <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a>. I’d choose <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> over Inter, Milan and <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> because I am Laziale</p>
