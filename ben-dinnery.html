  <p><b>[Ben Dinnery of Premier Injuries - a website that specialises in injury data from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> - believes it would be wrong to deduce too much from the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> games, while also debunking the reported spike in injuries]</b> Obviously, all eyes have been on the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, and while initial weeks of the resumption showed an increase in the season average - to be expected as players acclimatise to the rigours of playing competitive football again - numbers are inherently in line with that of previous seasons at the same stage<br /><br />The report of injuries, and the understanding of what constitutes an injury can be debated. I’ve seen the 250 per cent increase touted; I also saw reports of there being eight muscle injuries on the opening weekend. Simply not true<br /><br />Only one hamstring was accurate - <a href="giovanni-reyna.html">Giovanni Reyna</a> - and his withdrawal was more of a precautionary measure as he returned to team training three days later and was named in the matchday squad the following weekend. The others were fatigue-related or impact (dead leg). Injuries were actually down last weekend<br /><br />Principles regarding training intensity and recovery will be similar if not identical to before the pandemic. Training sessions will be timely, intense and focus around the technical, tactical and physical aspects of the sport<br /><br />Players have had a long period of remote conditioning and then reintegrated through a periodised phased re-integration process to prepare them physically, mentally and tactically as best as possible while also endeavouring to mitigate injury risk<br /><br />Fuelling strategies pre, during and post games are imperative to ensure optimal performance. On average, players will have finished fuelling three hours prior to the start of the game to allow for gastric emptying and for the food to be converted into glycogen and stored in the muscles to fuel exercise for the game<br /><br />Players may take on a weak carbohydrate drink before and during the game to top up glycogen levels and to avoid dehydration. Regular small amounts of fluid will help to delay dehydration and a reduction in performance</p>
