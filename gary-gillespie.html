  <p><b>[Gary Gillespie says <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> is the best defender I’ve seen]</b> Normally it is the players that catch the eye, the players that score the goals, that dribble and beat people, that create opportunities and I think it speaks volumes that he’s even being talked about as winning the Ballon d’Or, the fact he’s a centre-back. For me, he’s the best <b>[defender]</b> I’ve seen, absolutely. He’s right up there, outstanding in every department <b>[and]</b> in one-on-one situations, and that’s so key these days, with the way that modern teams play. Sometimes you are left in one-on-one situations and you just need to look at his stats last season: I think they were that not one player dribbled past him. I just think that’s phenomenal</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Gillespie says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> title winner sees similarities with 80s icons]</b> I think if we played the team back in the 80s on the pitch we played on we’d possibly win, but I think if we played them on these pitches I don’t think we’d have a chance to get near them. They’ve got world-class players across the pitch - the similarities are they have world-class players in good areas of the pitch, players who can make a difference. The guys that they’ve got, <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> and Mane and <b>[Roberto]</b> <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>, we had Barnes, <a href="peter-beardsley.html">Peter Beardsley</a> and a goalscorer in <a href="john-aldridge.html">John Aldridge</a>. A bit like <a href="alan-hansen.html">Alan Hansen</a> at the back, you’ve got <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a>. It’s difficult to compare different generations but this lot are very, very good<br /><br />Of course they can but is it likely? I think possibly not. I think probably not because they’ve got too many games. It’s all about winning the titles for me. Winning tournaments and winning the competitions. If it happens then it would be lovely. But they still have to secure the title first. The way we were brought up is that you just have to focus on the next game and take it from there. They’re playing a quite intense style but they manage games very well as well. They dictate the pace of the game through the pace they have.</p>
