  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk has been tipped to become one of the Premier League’s defensive greats]</b> I’ve been asked a lot in recent weeks: Just where does Van Dijk stand, in relation to the likes of John Terry, Rio Ferdinand, Jaap Stam even, who are up there as the greatest centre-backs in Premier League history. Honestly, ability-wise and technique-wise I would put him top. He’s got absolutely everything. But to become a living legend you have to be successful and win trophies and medals on regular basis… not just a one-off. Terry and Ferdinand, they had immense quality, but they also had longevity. Virgil, he’s probably ahead technically, but he needs to show it with trophies.<br /><br />I read those statements by Virgil van Dijk talking about former players like Kenny and Graeme Souness, Phil Neal, and it is clear he gets it. They became legends because of their desire to win and what they achieved for this club, and I’m sure he feels the same. The current team has strong characters who can deliver trophies - and he’s definitely one of them.</p>

  <p><b>[Gillespie challenges Reds to finally win Premier League]</b> The longer it goes on without Liverpool winning the title, then the team that last won it becomes better and better, and our ­reputations grow. That’s nice from our point of view, but I can tell you every single player from 1990 wants nothing more than this team to win the title again.<br /><br />We know what it means, for the fans and for the club, and we know how it feels. It elevates you if you are ­successful. There are players from my era who are legends because of that, because they were serial ­winners, and I would say this team would get the same from the fans. It is a chance to become legends.<br /><br />There are ­comparisons between the squads - they are pretty much the same in many regards. There is a real strength in depth in Jurgen Klopp’s squad, and we had that, a quality ­running throughout it, even outside the first 11 players. There seems to be a belief and ­confidence too, not just in individuals, but in each other. I look at them and really do think they have got strong enough characters in there, like we had, to do it… and now would be as good a time as any to break that spell without the title.<br /><br />Every game now there is an unbelievable ­expectation and ­pressure. But that is where the work of the manager and staff comes in, and the building they have been doing, even in pre-season. We went away in the summer for a tour, and it was more team-building that results based. They are doing the same going to Dubai now for a break. It brings them together. It makes them believe in each other. From my experience, when it comes down to it, there will be moments when you have to trust your ­team-mates completely. Klopp’s team have that - they believe in each other. We lost a few games that season, but not the ­belief we had. That will be the most important thing.</p>

  <p><b>[Talk of Liverpool blowing a bid for the Premier League crown has been branded nonsense]</b> I’ve been on social media today and I’ve picked up this tweet. In the last 10 games Man City have dropped 12 points Liverpool have dropped seven. City have lost to three of the teams outside the top six, Liverpool have drawn with two. And it’s perceived that we are bottling it? It’s all about perception. People can write what they like but anybody that thinks that because Liverpool have drawn the last two games, that’s them blown it and they’re out of it, the pressure’s got too much for them… nonsense, absolute garbage, just like it was garbage when Man City were seven points behind, they were out of the title race. Nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. People who have never been in football and don’t appreciate it and don’t understand what winning leagues and winning titles is all about make stupid remarks. Come May that’s when it’s handed out and if we’ve got the points we’ve won the league. And if we haven’t, so be it.<br /><br />Are we of the belief that the Premier League is the hardest league in the world? So any time that you go away from home in the Premier League you are going to face a tough team. There are going to be ups and downs all the way to the end of the season. What you have to put into perspective is that we didn’t lose the game. Two games where we’ve not played well - Leicester and west Ham - we didn’t lose. Sometimes these points are good points. Especially the Leicester game I thought was a good point for us because we could easily have lost that</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool legend Gary Gillespie has been extremely impressed with Sadio Mane this season]</b> I would have let someone else kick him! He’s been fantastic this season, I think that’s his highest goal tally for Liverpool and he does look a threat. They are so versatile up front. Sadio Mane is thought of as a left or right winger but he can play anywhere along that front line. To be fair I think all three of them can. Firmino has had a little bit of a quieter season, certainly Salah has had a quieter season, but Mane, he’s come to the fore and really has probably been - out of the three of them - the most consistent and the best.<br /><br />I think a big shout-out to Adam Lallana yesterday, that’s as near back to his best he has been since all his injuries. If he can play at a regular basis on that level then Liverpool have got a really good player coming back into the side</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool are showing the same form Manchester United did during their dominance of the Premier League]</b> Winning when playing badly]&lt;/b&gt; is the mark of a championship-winning side. How many times did we see Manchester United do that in their pomp? At times, you look at these sorts of scenarios and think ‘yes, they didn’t play very well and yes they were exceptionally lucky at the end’. But that’s what it takes sometimes to win the Premier League. Right throughout the season, you’re going to have a balance. Sometimes you’re going to play well and not get the result, but sometimes you’re going to play poorly and get that little bit of luck.<br /><br />Liverpool have got these sorts of players but Mane was a bit quiet yesterday. You had flashes but he has been the one inspiration this season that has taken up the mantle. There’s always that little bit of brilliance within him or the likes of Firmino, just that one turn or little pass which can be the difference. We have got players there. I would just like to see them have a couple more players in the middle of the park with that sort of ability to change a game. I’m sure Jurgen has identified that and come the summer, that might be where you strengthen, that area of the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool fans will still see trophyless season as success]</b> The mood on the red side of Merseyside is that we can’t quite believe how good we’ve played and how we’re going to come up that little bit short. It’s been a fantastic season and I don’t think many Liverpool supporters will complain if we don’t win anything because it’s been such a spectacular season. It’s something to build on and look forward to the future because I don’t think this is the end for Liverpool, it’s not a one-off. This will be sustained for the years to come. It’s not if we win the league again, it’s when.<br /><br />You would have to be the utmost optimist to get anything out of the game but in reality it’s going to be very difficult because you don’t have your main striker and your best player. It’s going to be almost impossible but stranger things have happened in football. You can only hope and pray for them. Our tie with Man City a few years ago we were 3-0 up going to the Etihad and you were thinking ‘maybe City have still got a wee chance because you never know what can happen’. But Barcelona have got so much experience that even if Liverpool do get an early goal, I can’t see them panicking or really being influenced by the crowd maybe another team might have been. They are special nights at Anfield but it’s going to have to be a hell of a special night to get Liverpool through to the final</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Gillespie says <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> is the best defender I’ve seen]</b> Normally it is the players that catch the eye, the players that score the goals, that dribble and beat people, that create opportunities and I think it speaks volumes that he’s even being talked about as winning the Ballon d’Or, the fact he’s a centre-back. For me, he’s the best <b>[defender]</b> I’ve seen, absolutely. He’s right up there, outstanding in every department <b>[and]</b> in one-on-one situations, and that’s so key these days, with the way that modern teams play. Sometimes you are left in one-on-one situations and you just need to look at his stats last season: I think they were that not one player dribbled past him. I just think that’s phenomenal</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Gillespie says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> title winner sees similarities with 80s icons]</b> I think if we played the team back in the 80s on the pitch we played on we’d possibly win, but I think if we played them on these pitches I don’t think we’d have a chance to get near them. They’ve got world-class players across the pitch - the similarities are they have world-class players in good areas of the pitch, players who can make a difference. The guys that they’ve got, <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> and Mane and <b>[Roberto]</b> <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>, we had Barnes, <a href="peter-beardsley.html">Peter Beardsley</a> and a goalscorer in <a href="john-aldridge.html">John Aldridge</a>. A bit like <a href="alan-hansen.html">Alan Hansen</a> at the back, you’ve got <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a>. It’s difficult to compare different generations but this lot are very, very good<br /><br />Of course they can but is it likely? I think possibly not. I think probably not because they’ve got too many games. It’s all about winning the titles for me. Winning tournaments and winning the competitions. If it happens then it would be lovely. But they still have to secure the title first. The way we were brought up is that you just have to focus on the next game and take it from there. They’re playing a quite intense style but they manage games very well as well. They dictate the pace of the game through the pace they have.</p>
