  <p><b>[FC Cincinnati coach Ron Jans claims he was quoting lyrics a hip-hop song]</b> FC Cincinnati was founded and operates with three core values: (1) being inclusive and family-friendly, (2) having a strong and visible presence in the community, and (3) winning on the field.<br /><br />When club leadership was made aware of the allegation, we were very surprised as building a caring and committed culture has been a focus of Ron’s leadership. We want to fully understand the nature of the incident and allow for an environment for our players to speak freely to any locker room issues. Therefore, while both the Club and <a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a> work together, Ron will step away from the team during the investigation.<br /><br />While the investigation is undertaken, the Club is also committed to ensuring every member of the club has a deeper appreciation and awareness for differences in cultures and backgrounds, and will institute training for every member of the organization. The Club will not have further comment on this matter until the conclusion of the joint investigation with MLS</p>

  <p><b>[Former FC Cincinnati coach Ron Jans says that he stepped away from the club because he wouldn’t know who to trust anymore]</b> This is very disappointing. I really had a great time there, but in a few days everything changed. I’ve heard things during the investigation which made me feel that íf I returned, the dressing room might still be divided, so I wouldn’t know who to trust anymore. Therefore the club and I decided this is the best option because I can’t go back to working the way I was used to. During the investigation, several things were mentioned of which I thought, ‘really?’ Come on. There’s nothing to it…<br /><br />As far as I know, <b>[the investigation]</b> not that important anymore because I decided to step down. But I don’t know all the ins and outs. This is bad enough already. But I think the worst is behind me. It struck me. The lawyers told me it wasn’t looking good<br /><br /><b>[As for Jans, the former PEC Zwolle, Heerenveen and Groningen boss says he plans to return to the Netherlands]</b> I have to say goodbye to everybody and return to Cincinnati to handle the last few things. I didn’t see it coming. It’s a very difficult situation, but I feel strong. I had a great time here and I don’t think it was in the official club statement, but I want to thank everyone within the club and most definitely all the fans and the owners. It was a great experience, but unfortunately with a very abrupt and bad ending. The season was about to start and everything looked well. Unfortunately, life comes with disappointments and this is one of them</p>
