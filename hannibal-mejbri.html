  <p><b>[Man Utd complete £9m signing of AS Monaco wonderkid Hannibal Mejbri. The player’s father had previously signalled the relationship with Monaco had broken down]</b> Something bad happened. For our family, it was very hard to live. It’s a real shock, a trauma. Mistakes were made. From there, I consider that the relationship of trust between the club and our family is destroyed. Something broke. It’s hard to keep working with people when there’s such a lack of trust</p>
