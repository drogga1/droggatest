  <p><b>[Jorge Villafana makes most of U.S. minutes but heading back to bench in Liga MX]</b> I was surprised, but everything comes at the right moment. I’ve been waiting and working hard and right now with the new coach who got the job I knew that I might get an opportunity and I did. I’m really happy that I’m here and try to take it day by day and enjoy the moment.<br /><br />You always try to work hard, even if you’re not playing, you keep working hard, training hard. You have to be ready for every opportunity that comes your way. I think this call for the national team is going to help, even if it’s not now, for the future.</p>

  <p><b>[Longtime friends, USMNT hopefuls Greg Garza and Jorge Villafana set to face off in MLS Cup]</b> I’ve known Greg for a long time, way back. I remember the U-23s with <b>[former Timbers coach Caleb Porter]</b>. I’ve known him for a long time. He’s a great person, an amazing guy. A great football player. He has a lot of the same qualities that I have. We’re good with the ball and going forward.<br /><br /><b>[Villafana said of Berhalter’s hiring]</b> I love it. I’ve seen the way he was when he was at Columbus, the way he worked with the team, the style of play they had. I like it. When you have that style, when you have the ball, you create more opportunities. The U.S., right now, more than anything needed a coach, and I think Gregg is a great hire that will do good for the U.S. going forward. Every player has to adapt to the way the coach wants you to play. It all depends on what he wants you to do and the role. Right now, I would be happy to get called up, but I’m focusing on doing my job with Portland and my game. And when my time comes, I’ll be proud to represent my country and I’ll do it proudly. It depends what the coach wants you to do. I’d be more than happy if <b>[Garza]</b> got a call too, in the future</p>
