<blockquote>
  <p><a href="wendell-lira.html">Wendell Lira</a> won the Fifa prize for the best goal of the year in 2015, his twisting bicycle kick for Goianesia in their match against Atletico-GO beating a <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> goal for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> into second place<br /><br />As a lower league player <a href="wendell-lira.html">Wendell Lira</a> was part of the terrible statistic in Brazil, where 82% of footballers earn less than $250 a month. Only 60 Brazilian clubs have a full calendar for the whole year, meaning that for six months many do not have any contract and do not receive money<br /><br />E-games are not a hobby to <a href="wendell-lira.html">Wendell Lira</a>.

All of them refused.<br /><br />As a last option, Lira was asked if he would like to step in. At first he refused because he felt it ‘would be shameful to play against the best player in the world’. But he eventually accepted and, playing with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, won the match 6-1. ‘I didn’t know how good I was,’ he remembers<br /><br />When <a href="wendell-lira.html">Wendell Lira</a> went back to Brazil, he signed a contract with Vila Nova, a club in the Second National Division. With knee problems, at 27 years old, after playing for 11 clubs, including Goiás, URT and Fortaleza, he decided to retire from football six months later to become a gamer and YouTuber</p>
