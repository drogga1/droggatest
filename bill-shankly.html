  <p><b>[Why do <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> wear red &amp; have they always had that colour for their home kit?]</b> We used to play in white shorts with red stripes, white stockings with red tops and white piping on the jerseys. But we switched to all red and it was fantastic. The introduction of the all-red strip had a huge psychological effect</p>

I wanted <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to be untouchable. My idea was to build <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> up and up until eventually everyone would have to submit and give in</p>
