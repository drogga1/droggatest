Certainly, I have the record of being Monaco’s youngest player and youngest scorer. But I would only be half remembered. Great players always want to leave a great mark. That’s what I want to do in Monaco. But after that, anything in football is possible. For now, I really want to impose myself here and do something good here<br /><br />I want to be a great player. I have a clear idea of what I want to do. I’ve had a plan for my career since I was young. My family and my club have prepared me for all this.

But anything is possible.<br /><br /><b>[Speaking about the use of VAR]</b> I am for video technology but to have to wait two minutes after a goal is too long</p>

Is it an attractive club? Of course. Their image has been a little bit tarnished after their defat to Barcelona, but the players are still the same. They are still here. The same ones that have made Ligue 1 suffer so much. They are great players and they are at a turning point of their project. We will see what they will do, we’ll stay tuned.<br /><br />If we can win the Champions League? We are in the quarter finals and we kicked City out. Of course <b>[winning it]</b> is possible.

  <p><b>[Monaco star Kylian Mbappe claims he is the luckiest player at the club because of his close relationship with top striker Radamel Falcao]</b> I think I’m the luckiest player in our squad. Because I’m at the start of my career and get to play alongside a top striker like Radamel. He’s made his mark on the history of the game and scored a huge number of goals.<br /><br />My personal highlight was the away leg of the Manchester City tie, because it was my first start - I heard the music as we walked out onto the pitch and it was really special. I took real pleasure from that experience. Since I was a boy, I’ve always dreamt of playing in the Champions League. I would watch all the games; even now I still watch all the Champions League games. So playing in it was an immense pleasure for me<br /><br /><b>[On Juventus]</b> Juventus are a great club. Everybody knows their history, the great players who played there, the great players who still play there. They’re a great team, and they eliminated Barcelona who were also among the favourites. They showed they have what it takes to win the competition. But we also have qualities and we’ll do everything we can to get to the final.<br /><br />Buffon? He is a goalkeeper who has made his mark on history, one of the best in the world. I’m glad I’ll play against him. You work every day to play against players like him. When you do, you want to give your best to beat them</p>

  <p><b>[Kylian Mbappe’s uncle Pierre Mbappe has put Europe’s top clubs on red alert after mentioning the likes of Juventus, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Barcelona as possible transfer destinations for his nephew]</b> Are Juventus an option for the future? Yes, Juve are, as well as the two teams in Manchester, PSG, Real Madrid, Barcelona… in the future, they could all be options. You never know, but my nephew is already at a great team and he’s very happy at Monaco. When the time comes <b>[to discuss a possible move away]</b>, we will talk with our family. We are football people, I do not think Kylian will need an agent for discussions over his future<br /><br /><b>[When asked about Juve specifically]</b> He’s been following Juventus for a long time now, well before the draw came in. He always watches Juventus, Barcelona, Real Madrid…What does he like about Juve? The history, their record, their mentality, their capacity to defend as a team and their ability to continue to win over the years while relying on young talents like Pogba, Morata or Dybala. And he likes Buffon. I wouldn’t be surprised if he asked him for his shirt after the game</p>

Until then, nothing will disturb me and I think that I’m going to continue like that until the end of the season. There will be two months, two and a half months, to make a decision as to what I’m going to do, so no, the rumours won’t affect me.</p>

If Real Madrid win, I think it will be Cristiano Ronaldo but otherwise, I think it would be good for Buffon to win the Golden Ball.<br /><br />The one who made me love football was Zidane. Afterwards I developed several idols but really Zidane was my very first idol.<br /><br /><b>[commenting on the comparisons he has invited with fellow legend Thierry Henry]</b> It’s flattering to be compared to Henry, but as I said and I repeat: ‘everybody writes his story’. Thierry has made his career and it was immense, I think it would not be fair to compare an 18-year-old who has not done anything yet. If I make a great career, I would not want to be compared to an 18-year-old who has not done anything yet</p>

We follow the current situation of AS Monaco closely. Today, we, Ultras Monaco 1994, are standing to react to an affair that concerns one of our players.<br /><br />These last few days, we have learned with stupefaction and indignation the numbers spoken about by the media concerning Kylian Mbappe, but also about his salary demands to extend his contract with our club. We don’t believe that any player is worth so many million euros<br /><br />We believe in a football as the people’s game, and so values like the love of the shirt and respect for the club that formed you in life. We can’t accept that one of our players is permitted to act like this and demand such sums without having proven himself in more than a few dozen matches at the professional level<br /><br />We stand equally to remind Kylian Mbappe and his group that no one is above the institution of AS Monaco<br /><br />So, we hope that our leaders will take the necessary decision to impose themselves in order to close this affair if these excessive salary demands were to be confirmed, taking into account that it is not essential to strengthen the squad to win the title. Since their arrival, they have proven their competence and we fully believe in them to fight for a team capable of defending our crown, with or without Mbappe</p>

It will be extraordinary to play with him <b>[Neymar]</b>, but I came for the project. I have entered into a dressing room where I have the fewest titles to my name. I have a lot to learn and prove. In Paris, I will be able to learn and improve while winning. I am hungry for titles. I want to win, starting right now. For me, it was important to come back to my town.

His talent is already incredible, but he can still reach a new level. That he can fulfill his dreams is what I wish for him. He managed to do it. In addition he is a friend, so it’s all good.<br /><br />We have this passion for football. All that talk about prices or whatever, it does not concern us. What concerns us is just on the pitch. We want to play as we have always played since we started in football, both of us in our home cities. It’s not a matter of value or principle, it’s just a matter of passion, feeling, that love of the game.</p>

There is only one club in the city, so the kids naturally head towards PSG. For me, the Parc was a place where I came when I had pocket money!.<br /><br />No-one can understand the emotion I feel today. It’s a sense of extreme pride. It’s the town I’ve known, in which I’ve grown up and developed and where a part of me stays. Here, I’m not Mbappe, I’m just Kylian<br /><br />I reflected along with my parents and my representatives, weighed up the pros and cons, and I decided to join PSG, because it is a project that will allow me to learn while winning. Learning is fine, but you also have to win - you only have one career. I’m hungry for titles, I’m a competitor, I want to win right now. Through hard work and humility, we will achieve our goals and this dream of winning the Champions League</p>

He transforms you. You have to adapt, but it will make you a better player.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether he could repay that favour by helping Neymar to improve]</b> That is going to be complicated as he is already at the top of world football. The idea is to keep him at that level. We will do everything we can to keep him there because he can win us titles<br /><br />The coach will make the decisions and we have to adapt. It is continuity, though, like I had at Monaco, which makes things easier. If I am asked to play in a different position then I think I can still do the same things</p>

We have 11 players on the pitch. People expect more from me and that’s normal. When you have good players, it’s reasonable to want them to make a difference. But I think we have a quality squad with a lot of good players. It’s not just one player who will make the difference, but everyone will. I really can’t wait to play this crucial game.

He’s really a great player who is going to help PSG move up another level. We’re thrilled to have him. We hope that he feels good here, because then he’ll be capable of doing great things.<br /><br />Edinson is the perfect team-mate for players like myself and Neymar. He is always available, he’s very mobile, and he has an amazing shot on him. He’s a natural goal-scorer, a true professional and a very good person as well. He’s one of the best strikers in the world<br /><br />Our aim is to go as far as possible and to win the competition, so I don’t pay much attention to the records. I think I’ve broken quite a few records now, but I’m so focused on winning I don’t worry about all these different records. I don’t know if that’s a good thing or not, but my one real obsession is to win that trophy. That’s all that matters to me.<br /><br /><b>[Mbappe win the European Golden Boy award]</b> You work hard all year for this kind of award. I see it as a source of motivation to keep on working and to try to achieve more. I felt at home here straight away. It’s been really ideal for me to settle in to a new team. Everyone has talked to me, we joke about as if we’ve known each other for years already. The guys have also looked to protect me, they’ve really tried to do everything possible to enable me to focus on giving my best on the pitch.<br /><br />It’s a very demanding environment here. You have to raise your game to the level of those around you. Then you have to maintain that high level, and by doing this I think I am improving naturally. I really think I’ve progressed since I’ve been here. This is just the beginning, so hopefully I can keep going now and keep getting better</p>

With Ronaldo in the league, people will be passionate again about Serie A. I already follow Serie A, but with Ronaldo in the league I will now follow it with more passion. Ronaldo brings something great to Juventus, although the Bianconeri did not lack much to be complete. Ronaldo will give them an extra force in the finals and all the great teams will have to study Juventus more carefully. It is also a great opportunity for Ronaldo - it’s a win-win situation for both Juventus and Ronaldo. Together they can achieve their goal in the Champions League. PSG-Juve in the final? Where do I sign?<br /><br />Of course Liverpool is one of our main rivals, but I have good feelings about it. I think we’re ready to do something big and positive. Our group is complicated, but this is the challenge facing the champions who want to win it because it is the most prestigious trophy in Europe. Against Napoli it will be tough, <b>[Carlo]</b> Ancelotti makes his team play well with a certain philosophy and high pressing. Also in Napoli their fans are spectacular. My memories from there aren’t really pleasant. In a friendly in 2016 with Monaco we lost 5-0 to Napoli, so I know exactly what I’m talking about.

We know that we have very good players, but this whole ‘Fantastic Four’ thing, all that, it is not our thing. We want to help the team to win, we want to win trophies and we leave superlatives used to describe us to someone else<br /><br />It is going to be throughout the entire campaign and not across three or four matches that you will see if we are capable of making defensive efforts when the team needs us above all</p>

  <p><b>[Mbappe believes the rest of <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>’s team - outside of their star-studded attacking line up - do not get the credit they deserve]</b> We talk too much about the front four. We wanted to show that we are really a good team. Having matches of this intensity makes us feel good, we are happy. I think we talk a little too much about the front four, that we are a team of four but we play with eleven!</p>
