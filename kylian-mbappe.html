  <p><b>[Mbappe flattered to have <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s attention in Golden Shoe battle]</b> Instead of just putting my head under the covers and waiting calmly for the end of the season, I was trying to outdo myself. I saw that I could maybe win the top goalscorer in Europe award. But, facing off against me, was <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. I would score twice on a weekend, he would go and score three. I would score three, he would score four! It was so crazy that I spoke with Ousmane (Dembele) about it. ‘This is crazy! Is he doing this on purpose?’ He responded to me: ‘Of course he is looking at you!’. I said to myself: ‘Ah, not bad, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is watching me … ‘ It is flattering to see that such a player is not overlooking you</p>

  <p><b>[Asked about his future following <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>’s 6-1 Coupe de la Ligue quarter-final rout of Saint-Etienne on Wednesday]</b> I am ready to play football first. Because we are in January. We start the final sprint, where we can compete for trophies. I think it’s not the right time to make some waves. The club are calm, serene, everyone is walking in the same direction so talking about external things of the pitch would not be realistic or good.<br /><br />I don’t know if they reach another level but I know they love to play together. They play all four with great complicity especially Kylian and Mauro. It’s obvious and it’s necessary. If you play with four strikers, it’s necessary that they try to find themselves on the pitch. They try to put each other in the best conditions. They give the ball to make an assist or to find a guy in a better position. They did great tonight. We speak a lot about the four strikers but you know that for me it’s all about the team, we need to play as a team with the 11 players. That’s football</p>

  <p><b>[Mbappe was quick to stress that he believes there’s been too much talk about him and his three team-mates playing together]</b> I think above all that we are talking a bit too much about us playing with four attackers. I feel like we are playing with four attackers in a five-a-side team. But we are playing with 11 men. We know that we have very good players, but this whole ‘Fantastic Four’ thing, all that, it is not our thing. We want to help the team to win, we want to win trophies and we leave superlatives used to describe us to someone else<br /><br />It is going to be throughout the entire campaign and not across three or four matches that you will see if we are capable of making defensive efforts when the team needs us above all</p>
