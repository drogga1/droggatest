  <p><b>[<a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> vs Wolves. Just how far they lag their rivals will become clearer after their two-game trip to the Far East, though captain Jamaal Lascelles is looking forward to the challenge]</b> We are travelling to China and it’s going to be a great experience playing in a completely different country with different surroundings and environment. We are very thankful to be taking part. Winning games will put a marker down and set an example for what we are going to do during the new season. I do think every game we play, especially in pre-season, will push us toward a good start of the season. We will be looking to win the games</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> captain Jamaal Lascelles has praised the tactics of <a href="steve-bruce.html">Steve Bruce</a>. The ex-Sheffield Wednesday boss watched from the stands as his new club beat <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> 1-0 in Shanghai]</b> We set up in a different formation today which I think suited us perfectly with our personnel. All of the instructions he gave to us we tried to do them to the best of our ability. We’ve had him for two days now in training and straight away we’ve picked up and we’ve adapted very quickly. When a new manager comes in you are always going to want to impress. The workrate has always been there because that’s what type of group we are</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> captain Jamaal Lascelles admits talk of <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> and <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> moving to <a href="newcastle-united.html">St James’ Park</a> had him refreshing Twitter every day]</b> It seemed like it would be a fantastic thing from what I was first reading on Twitter. At first I was seeing us linked with <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> and <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> and all this stuff. But the longer it goes on… well you don’t necessarily doubt it but you realise there is no point every day waking up and just refreshing Twitter. So you just get on with your job. If it happens, it happens and if it doesn’t, it doesn’t<br /><br /><b>[on the possible arrival of new owners]</b> It’s a tough one because as players we don’t know if it’s a positive or a negative thing. If people come in are they going to bring a whole new squad and a new manager? Or are they going to come in and just do up the training ground and add a few players?<br /><br />I don’t know too much about <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup other than it would be massive to win. <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> has rested players ahead of this game so he obviously sees the importance of it too. It would be amazing to win some silverware and I know how much the fans would appreciate it. We have put ourselves in a great position in the league and a top-half finish would be fantastic. But I wouldn’t swap that for <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup. No way</p>
