  <p><b>[Newcastle captain Jamaal Lascelles is paying little attention to speculation suggesting that he could be a summer transfer target for Chelsea and Everton]</b> When you’re flicking through Twitter or people say there’s rumours about this, that and the other you’re aware of it but I don’t take any notice. I’m a Newcastle player, I’m happy here, I’m the captain and things are going really well. You hear about rumours, but I’m just concentrating on Newcastle.<br /><br /><b>[He has cast doubt over his potential involvement in World Cup Russia]</b> I thought I had a chance of sneaking into the friendly games but I didn’t. It’d be a nice way to finish the season here, going to a World Cup, but Gareth Southgate likes who he likes. He picked his team last time and there’s a lot of competition in my position. Whoever he decides to go for, it’s up to him and congratulations to the players who do go</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle United captain Jamaal Lascelles has issued a rallying cry to the club’s fanbase]</b> It would help if everyone came together and put all that bad energy into positive energy, helping us get three points.<br /><br /><b>[On Mike Ashley]</b> I know fingers are being pointed at him. He’s a nice guy. I like him. If everyone in Newcastle stopped the negativity and tried to form a unity it would help. It’s important that everyone’s together, especially when we’re down at the bottom of the table. If you’re always hearing negativity and you’ve got the fans against Mike it just creates a big negative mess. It doesn’t help. It affects the chemistry in the changing room. But when 52,000 Geordies get behind us, it gives such an uplift. My message is stick with us. The fans are entitled to sing about Mike Ashley, but it does impact on us<br /><br />The club feels more united now. Our dressing room’s strong - it’s not like when I first came here and there was a clique of French lads, a group of Spanish lads, the English lads and another group in the corner - but we’d be a much better club without all the negativity and bad energy</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle United captain Jamaal Lascelles says he hopes the club can keep current boss Rafa Benitez at St James’ Park]</b> You just need to look at his history. His stats do the talking. We finished first in the Championship, then 10th in the Premier League without spending a lot of money, and more points this time without spending money. It’s important as players we had someone like that. He dug us out of a bad situation. He’s a perfectionist; even in training everything has to be right. The players think the same <b>[as the fans]</b>. We all want him to stay. Since he has been here, he’s been great. Hopefully we can sort some business out and tie him down. We don’t have a clue whether he’s staying or going. It’s not down to us, but hopefully he stays.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> vs <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>. Just how far they lag their rivals will become clearer after their two-game trip to the Far East, though captain Jamaal Lascelles is looking forward to the challenge]</b> We are travelling to China and it’s going to be a great experience playing in a completely different country with different surroundings and environment. We are very thankful to be taking part. Winning games will put a marker down and set an example for what we are going to do during the new season. I do think every game we play, especially in pre-season, will push us toward a good start of the season. We will be looking to win the games</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> captain Jamaal Lascelles has praised the tactics of <a href="steve-bruce.html">Steve Bruce</a>. The ex-Sheffield Wednesday boss watched from the stands as his new club beat <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> 1-0 in Shanghai]</b> We set up in a different formation today which I think suited us perfectly with our personnel. All of the instructions he gave to us we tried to do them to the best of our ability. We’ve had him for two days now in training and straight away we’ve picked up and we’ve adapted very quickly. When a new manager comes in you are always going to want to impress. The workrate has always been there because that’s what type of group we are</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> captain Jamaal Lascelles admits talk of <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> and <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> moving to <a href="newcastle-united.html">St James’ Park</a> had him refreshing Twitter every day]</b> It seemed like it would be a fantastic thing from what I was first reading on Twitter. At first I was seeing us linked with <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> and <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> and all this stuff. But the longer it goes on… well you don’t necessarily doubt it but you realise there is no point every day waking up and just refreshing Twitter. So you just get on with your job. If it happens, it happens and if it doesn’t, it doesn’t<br /><br /><b>[on the possible arrival of new owners]</b> It’s a tough one because as players we don’t know if it’s a positive or a negative thing. If people come in are they going to bring a whole new squad and a new manager? Or are they going to come in and just do up the training ground and add a few players?<br /><br />I don’t know too much about <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup other than it would be massive to win. <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> has rested players ahead of this game so he obviously sees the importance of it too. It would be amazing to win some silverware and I know how much the fans would appreciate it. We have put ourselves in a great position in the league and a top-half finish would be fantastic. But I wouldn’t swap that for <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup. No way</p>
