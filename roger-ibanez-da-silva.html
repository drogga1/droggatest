<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Roma have announced the signing of Atalanta defender Roger Ibanez da Silva on loan with an obligation to make the move permanent in the summer of 2021]</b> I’m really happy to be here. Roma has everything I want in a club – it’s a huge side. I am certain that I will be happy here<br /><br /><b>[he said of his time at Atalanta]</b> I gained a lot of experience. They really helped me to improve a lot. In Italy the defensive approach is very important and so, from this point of view, this past year has been really useful for me. I think I’ll be able to settle in well playing for Roma. I’m quick and I have good technique. I’m also good in the air. But only on the pitch can I really show my ability. Before I played as a centre-back I was also a central midfielder, and I can still play that role as well. I spoke with <b>[manager Paulo Fonseca]</b> and he told me that he likes the qualities I have and how I would fit in at Roma – and that’s why I wanted to come here</p>
