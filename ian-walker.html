<blockquote>
  <p><b>[As Ian Walker, who was a substitute goalkeeper for England at Euro 96, recalled, <a href="bryan-robson.html">Robson</a> was enlisted by <a href="terry-venables.html">Venables</a> to keep an eye on the players on their night out]</b> I don’t know what it was, but <a href="bryan-robson.html">Bryan Robson</a> was standing there with a pint, and he was wearing one of those shirts with a round collar, and someone grabbed it and ripped it. All he had left was the little round collar: the rest of it had gone. And he just carried on drinking like nothing had happened! He was supposed to be looking after us, so from then on it went a bit mad. And then someone found a dentist chair in another room. So of course - bang! - straight away we’re on it. I think Gazza went on first, then I had a go, then <a href="teddy-sheringham.html">Teddy Sheringham</a>. Then it all went off, just bedlam.<br /><br />I was first in the chair because it looked like a laugh. Then a few of the other lads did it. It was good for team spirit</p>
