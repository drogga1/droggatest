  <p><b>[Ziyech offered brick wall warning ahead of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> move but is backed to shine by El Ghazi]</b> You have to think about your muscles with so many games. I thought I was big and heavy, but sometimes you run into player and you think: is that a wall? But <a href="hakim-ziyech.html">Ziyech</a> is going to do well at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, 100%.<br /><br /><b>[El Ghazi has already joked in a farewell video to <a href="hakim-ziyech.html">Ziyech</a> at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> that the Blues-bound star needs to get himself to the gym]</b> It was a joke anyway. <a href="hakim-ziyech.html">Ziyech</a> has his qualities and he shouldn’t have to be physical. He’s agile and can move well, because he’s so thin. Going to the gym doesn’t mean going to Basic Fit <b>[Dutch gym chain]</b> to become a powerhouse. You can also work your core, train your abs, pull ups. It doesn’t make you a bodybuilder. Being in the gym doesn’t just mean pumping and pumping.</p>

  <p><b>[Anwar El Ghazi: <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> winger says he cannot help but watch relegation rivals’ games]</b> Yeah definitely, absolutely <b>[my heart sunk]</b> when I saw the end result. I got a text message, I wasn’t watching the game, we were in the hotel. My father messaged me and he was swearing, saying how unbelievable football is. He said <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> lost the game against Bournemouth 4-1 and I was like ‘is he serious?’. It’s crazy, football is crazy. It will be really tough until the last game<br /><br /><b>[Focus shifts to Thursday’s trip to Everton]</b> We won the game against Crystal Palace and we are looking forward to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> now, three more finals to go. To be honest I am doing that, maybe because I am a football freak, but I definitely look at who other teams are playing. I understand the coach as well because at the end of the day we control only our own performances. But of course we are going to check who is playing <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>, <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> and Bournemouth.</p>
