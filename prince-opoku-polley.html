  <p><b>[Former Ghana international Prince Opoku Polley has waded into the Black Stars’ 1992 Africa Cup of Nations captaincy saga, saying defender Anthony Baffoe should have rejected the armband for the final clash with Cote d’Ivoire]</b> If Tony Baffoe had rejected the captaincy, it would have helped the entire team to win the trophy. Immediately they named him <b>[Baffoe]</b> to lead us, the spirit of the team faded. During the penalty shoot-out, Tony Baffoe was the one who blew the last penalty away. Truth to be told, he blew it away because he was under pressure. I never thought he <b>[Baffoe]</b> can lead the team. If I were him I would have rejected it. I have exhibited that before. I remember we were playing against Liberia and with the absence of both <a href="abedi-pele.html">Abedi Pele</a> and <a href="anthony-yeboah.html">Tony Yeboah</a>, they wanted me to lead the team but I told them to give it to <a href="emmanuel-frimpong.html">Frimpong</a> Manso since he was a senior player and interestingly Manso grabbed the match-winner for us. <a href="anthony-yeboah.html">Tony Yeboah</a> was at the top so he <b>[Baffoe]</b> should have rejected it and supported him. Tony Baffoe got the opportunity to play for the national team through <a href="anthony-yeboah.html">Tony Yeboah</a>. So stripping him of the captaincy in the final means the authorities lost hope in Tony Yeboah<br /><br /><b>[Ghana won the Afcon title in 1963, 1965, 1978 and 1982, and were hoping to make it a quintuple of titles at the tournament in Senegal]</b> What I keep saying is that, I’m proud to share the pitch with <a href="abedi-pele.html">Abedi Pele</a> but I think he couldn’t promote unity among us. I strongly believe that we could have won even a world cup with the squad at our folds if we were united. I think his <b>[Abedi]</b> leadership style declined due to the division between players</p>
