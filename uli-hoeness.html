He goes well beyond the limits of physical challenges with players - he pushes players to ridiculous levels, well past the limit. For him it’s natural to squeeze the body of a professional player like a lemon, to its final drop. It goes well beyond the player’s body getting unhealthy. This can lead to a team’s short revival, but it also leads to long-term disaster. Felix Magath has proved that at every club he’s been. I would never want to treat human beings like he does. He should ask himself why all the players at clubs where he worked throw a massive party when he leaves. Even when he was successful, they still had a blast once he was out the door</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness has seemingly ruled out signing Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez by claiming that his side must focus on building around youth, rather than experience]</b> Everyone is talking about building a new team and how Bayern Munich’s future must be shaped. And then Bayern does exactly that - signs young players between 20 and 22 - and is criticised once again.<br /><br /><b>[On alluding to rumours of interest in Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez]</b> But you can’t build a new team with €100 million transfers for 29 and 30-year-olds. That isn’t a policy. Either we go down this road with all these young players, all getting a chance to play, or we don’t go down this road<br /><br /><b>[Bayern have already secured Corentin Tolisso, Kingsley Coman, Niklas Sule and Serge Gnabry this summer - all four players are 21 or 22 - along with Sebastian Rudy]</b> I fully support what’s been done so far - it’s highly satisfactory and it all makes sense. Sule, Rudy, Gnabry and Tolisso are players with huge potential for the future. As chairman of the supervisory board I’m very pleased with our transfer policy up until now because it was implemented with great care. I said that if we wanted to strengthen this team then we had to buy the very best players. And to get them is difficult enough. In no way was I saying we would do this. I only wanted to point out that we have a very good team and if you want to strengthen, you have to spend a huge amount of money and you still don’t have any guarantee of winning the Champions League. If we wanted to buy our way to the Champions League title, we would have to throw a lot of money at it. I don’t think anything at all of alibi signings, we’ve spoken about this internally</p>

  <p><b>[When Matthias Sammer stepped down as Bayern Munich sporting director for health reasons, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge revealed that the Bavarians would take their time before deciding upon a replacement]</b> I really don’t like everything reported on the premise that whoever takes on the job should be afraid of Karl-Heinz Rummenigge or me. It’s actually the opposite. Every young manager can only benefit from our experience. There aren’t any better teachers around who know exactly how everything works. Instead, it’s reported it didn’t work out with Lahm because of the power-hungry Hoeness and Rummenigge…I can still foresee Philipp <b>[Lahm]</b> assuming a role at the club when he feels ready, which obviously isn’t the case at the moment. He’s still only 33 and has loads of time<br /><br />We will make an announcement within the next six weeks.

I found it impossible that the DFB president had to get involved to solve the Ozil and Gundogan issue. Özil should have been forced to give an explanation, that was no small matter. He is a well-marketed product, who is represented by his agency much better than he is as a player. Joachim Low should have gone to Arsenal more often and had a look at him. He probably would not have taken him to the World Cup for sporting reasons, and then we would have been spared the whole drama.</p>

The only mistake was that the steak did not hit the wall. He did not even eat the steak, he should have slapped it against the wall and everything would have been fine.<br /><br />I have a lot of thoughts but I do not have the approach of a solution on how to be at the top without commercialisation. I have great respect for the work of SC Freiburg, but it is clear that they are never going to win the Champions League. I do not want to buy a player for €80 or €100 million, but if you want to keep up with Manchester City, Liverpool or Barcelona, ​​then you have to do things I do not like. We brought Lucas Hernandez, but the good thing is that we can do that from our deposit account. At Bayern, the players earn the most, but this year we’ll make the biggest (financial) win in our history</p>
