  <p><b>[Uli Hoeness on new Fulham manager Felix Magath]</b> I knew Felix would pop up again somewhere, but not in Germany. I knew his only chance would be abroad, where they don’t know him well. He goes well beyond the limits of physical challenges with players - he pushes players to ridiculous levels, well past the limit. For him it’s natural to squeeze the body of a professional player like a lemon, to its final drop. It goes well beyond the player’s body getting unhealthy. This can lead to a team’s short revival, but it also leads to long-term disaster. Felix Magath has proved that at every club he’s been. I would never want to treat human beings like he does. He should ask himself why all the players at clubs where he worked throw a massive party when he leaves. Even when he was successful, they still had a blast once he was out the door</p>
