I could tell he’s a really special manager. One little example: When we were 15 points ahead, it was in February or March - we lost against City. We could have gone 18 points clear but still we were in a very good position. He was very hard on us, very angry. He made everyone aware that everybody had to give their all. The training was very hard that week, he was almost punishing us. We were 15 points ahead! But that showed me he was a really good manager</p>

  <p><b>[Robin van Persie has claimed Manchester United stepped away from the principles that made them successful after Sir Alex Ferguson retired as manager in 2013]</b> A lot changed quickly after Ferguson, even the little things. Manchester United started to use social media, suddenly. It is their opinion, it is their club, they can do what they want, but you could see that a lot of things were moving and changing. Sir Alex was more old school. He said no to social media, we are football players and we play football, not too much commercial stuff. Then you could see there was more commercial stuff going on, there was more social media. I’m not saying that is bad because if you look around now, how the world is going, in a way it is a good connection as well because you can connect with your fans, but it was changing. They stepped away from what was successful, but maybe some people have been too harsh in their judgement of United since Ferguson left<br /><br /><b>[Van Persie believes United’s eagerness to change their managers since Ferguson’s departure has hampered the club in their efforts to develop an identity]</b> How do you judge success? If you play for Manchester, the bar should be raised very high, but sometimes it is a little bit harsh because United did win some cups (since Ferguson retired). They did win the Europa League and just because they didn’t win the league for the last few years, that can happen. You have fantastic teams in Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal, so it is not easy. Do you judge them based on how they didn’t win the Premier League or do you judge them that they did win a few trophies over the years? Do you judge them that they don’t play attacking football enough? What is your measurement, how do you see it? <br /><br />Manchester United should always play attacking football. They should play with wingers who create, will make something happen. Play with a No.10 in the Rooney-style role, who will create and score goals, box to box. That is my opinion, that is how I like to see it. That is what I want to see from all the top teams, but you have to realise there is only a certain amount of trophies available and you can’t win them all. I think if you look at City and Liverpool, how they play, you can see the philosophy of the coach. One year, you will win one trophy, the next you might win nothing, then the next you might win three, but if you play from that idea to play attacking football, that is what I see in Liverpool and City now and that should be a target of Manchester United as well. Not just trophies, but a philosophy and with Solskjaer now, I think they have that back. He wants to attack, he wants to shoot, he wants to create. Give him the time to develop the team</p>

  <p><b>[Robin van Persie says Alexis Sanchez has struggled at Manchester United because he is not happy]</b> He doesn’t look very happy to me. He looked happy at Arsenal. He doesn’t look happy now. What I’ve seen and felt over the years is that how you feel mentally, how your life is, has a big influence’. If you’re happy, you’re 50 per cent fitter, you create more and you enjoy yourself… so he should find a way mentally to change that. It’s a different time. Over the past couple of years a lot has changed. There are a lot of impressions from fans, from social media, he is constantly getting hit about his wages. It’s negative, so he starts negative, and maybe that is difficult<br /><br /><b>[Sanchez was lured to United by Mourinho last year and the Portuguese boss was sacked in December amid poor results and criticism over his perceived brand of defensive football]</b> For him it was difficult because he was coming into a defensive playing team. I came into a team with all the mature players there already: Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Michael Carrick. At Arsenal I was one of the older ones, captain, and here I could just come in and have fun, because the guys sorted all the other stuff beside it. Mentally, I was just having fun. I was happy, I was just enjoying it, really. I did not think about the consequences. I was not using social media back then, so I was not really bothered about what people said. When I went outside it was all positive so I was in my own little bubble of being happy<br /><br /><b>[Solskjaer was installed as interim manager in December before the United great signed a permanent deal in March as the club eventually finished sixth and 32 points off the pace]</b> When you play for a club like Manchester United, the fans are used to attacking football and risks. I don’t really think the fans were disappointed about not winning the league. You can miss out on winning the league because you have great teams in this league. It’s maybe the way they played that the fans were not really happy with. United is like a beast. In a positive way, when you are doing well. It is so huge. It is fantastic, a great place to be. But when it goes wrong, when you’re having a bad period as a player or a coach, it’s tough. It’s a tough place, lots of pressure, everyone demanding not only a win, but they are demanding attacking football. 77,000 people want to be enjoying it.</p>

  <p><b>[Robin van Persie has revealed he had several chances to leave Arsenal before he finally quit to join Manchester United in 2012]</b> You know that once you make a move like that, stuff like that happens. You have to take it on the chin and move on. You have to live with the consequences, you have to live with the choices you make and deal with them as a man. Don’t take it all too personally and don’t take yourself too seriously. This is my life, this is what I did and some people are happy with it, some people are not. That’s life. The first game against Arsenal was mentally tough. It was at home in Manchester and I scored after three minutes. That was a very mixed feeling at that time because it was so soon. Afterward, I played six or seven times <b>[against Arsenal]</b>, but that’s <b>[what happens]</b> if you make a move like that<br /><br /><b>[The criticism that followed Van Persie as he gave up the Arsenal captain’s armband to join one of their great rivals soured his relationship with the club’s fans]</b> Arsenal gave me the chance to play in the Premier League as a young kid when I was having a difficult time with Feyenoord. In my last period there, I was playing in the reserves. Arsenal saw something in me and they gave me that chance. It was a gamble from their point of view, an expensive gamble, and I took the chance with both hands. I stayed there for eight years, we had some great moments together and I’m still very proud of that period. I had chances to go before I left Arsenal. I could have gone to Italy, I could have gone to Spain, but I wasn’t really open to it. I extended my contract two or three times at Arsenal and I’m still behind <b>[that decision]</b>, like I am still behind my move to Manchester<br /><br /><b>[Alexis Sanchez has scored just three Premier League goals for United]</b> He is still a wonderful player, still a great player. He needs to find a way to be happy again. If you are happy, you want to create and have fun. He had that in his first couple of months from what I saw and he needs to find that again. He can still play, he is still a fantastic football player. He just doesn’t really look happy and the reason why this is… I don’t know. I can only guess, but from distance, he looks unhappy and he needs to find a way to be happy again</p>

He was making the game, creating, he wanted the ball constantly. He was just a joy to watch. He runs a lot. I think the stats tell you as well that he ran the most of all players, so that tells you that he’s alive, he’s there, he wants to play, he wants to create. He’s just a very positive player who’s having fun, you can see he’s having fun.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United striker Robin van Persie has elaborated on his controversial transfer from Arsenal in 2012, likening his Emirates Stadium exit to a husband separating from his wife]</b> You can compare me being at Arsenal to being married. Me and my wife - Arsenal - were married for eight years. After eight years, my wife, possibly got a bit tired of me. Those are the facts. If Arsenal are not offering you a new deal… you can have different views on things but the fact is Arsenal never offered me a new deal. Then you have a look around. I was ambitious. I still wanted to win the league. That is life. I ended up having three options. One option abroad disappeared quickly. Then it was City or Manchester United. What people don’t know, during the transfer, loads of things are happening behind the scenes. You have to take a lot on and make a choice based on what your targets are but also deal with the facts. One of the main facts was that Arsenal got tired of me. That was the starting point - they didn’t offer me a new deal. We had loads of chats with Wenger, with <b>[former Arsenal chief executive]</b> Ivan Gazidis. They gave me no decision to make</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United star Robin van Persie has backed Alexis Sanchez to recover from a nightmare spell at Old Trafford]</b> He doesn’t look happy to me. I can’t properly judge it because I am not working with him but when I see him play I rarely see him smiling. Of course, I get it when you are playing you need to be serious and you want to win but after you score a goal you can smile, because that is the point of football. We all play football because we like it and if you like something you should smile<br /><br /><b>[Van Persie believes that the pressure of performing at Old Trafford can be too much even for players of Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez’s ability]</b> I think in the first couple of months after his move he was happy and he was playing well. Mentally he needs to find that happiness again because if you are happy then you are fitter, you want to create and you want to have fun. So I think he should find a way to be happier again. I don’t know if it’s the pressure. Pressure is something you can’t see or touch but he has to manage that in his head. But he is still the same great player. He has it all: he’s fast, he can assist, he can dribble, and he can score. There is just a lot of negativity around him from fans and people who have opinions on social media. Maybe it’s all become a little too much for him. He just needs to block it out, find his true happiness and just enjoy football</p>

I would play him not as a defensive midfielder, and not as a number 10 but in between - <b>[the]</b> number eight position.

Just go at them and try to win the ball high, play in their half, play positive. I would like to see a better game plan. It is like in the first 25 minutes of the game, you could see they were dropping back a lot, quite deep. If you choose as a coach and as players to do that, it’s fine, but then you need to have runners. You need to have at least two runners once you get the ball which I didn’t see</p>

And I get it if you’re the manager of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> during this period of time. So he’s searching for words, maybe he chose a few wrong ones there. Because as a player, what does that mean, ‘sorting the players’ heads out’, what does that mean?<br /><br />If you’re a player you’re a little bit like, ‘my head is fine’. Even though you can see the players are low in confidence, he needs to find a way to reconnect again and to get their confidence high. As a manager, when you’re team is low in confidence get them up, when your team is too high in confidence, when they are becoming a little bit too much, you have to get them back to the middle again. At the moment, based on this interview, and based on what I’ve seen in the game, I’m not sure if he really knows how to find the buttons there</p>

As a player, you want to have that feeling you have to sprint back, and now you see a couple of players that jog back. There’s a danger there.

Today it looked very much like, ‘Get the ball to Martial and see what he can do’. That’s what it seemed like. I know a lot of the boys in that changing room, I’ve seen a lot of them grow up.<br /><br />They’re kids who want to do well, they’re desperate to play, they’re desperate to be the best in their position, they’re desperate to do great in a <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> shirt. But it’s just not happening at the moment and that has got to be sorted out and the consistency is the biggest problem at the moment. I think he’s used 10 players under 22 this season. That’s a lot of young players. But they need consistency, they have got to find it somehow and that is the job of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</p>

I was out with that for four months. You can’t really do much, you have to just rest and let it heal. But it is a difficult one because it always stays a little bit like a weak spot. Even now, it is not that I’m in pain or something, but it’s a sensitive area. So you have to be really careful with that. They will miss him so much.

Now, I don’t think people really know if he’s a six, if he’s a number 10… that’s a big difference.<br /><br />I have the feeling people judge him a bit unfairly.

There’s constantly rumours, you have the agent constantly giving interviews, you have the coach answering questions almost every day, every week. There’s a lot going on beside the main event, and the most important thing is football.<br /><br />I know how it works, especially if you’re injured.
