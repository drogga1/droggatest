<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Nick Blackman interview: Racially abused in England, Spain and Israel]</b> I have experienced racism quite a bit throughout my career in England, Spain and Israel. The issue is that when I have had these experiences of racism in the past, I’ve taken it to the police or referees and nothing has come from it. So when it happened again, I was of the mindset that I may as well keep quiet and not say anything because the investigations will close due to a lack of evidence. There needs to be more support and there needs to be more action if we are going to clamp down on this<br /><br />I have had a couple of occasions when I have gone to take a throw-in, and when I had my back to the crowd, I could hear monkey noises. I’ve played in away stadiums and they are abusing their own black players. It doesn’t add up and I do not understand why<br /><br />We were a couple of weeks ahead of the UK <b>[going into lockdown]</b> and being on my own was tough, especially with the weather. As of now still, the athletes out here have had to stay in quarantine so we’re only allowed to go to training and the games while the rest of the country is going out and enjoying the weather! We’ve only got about 10 days left, so I can get back to normal soon.<br /><br /><b>[Blackman accepts that he will not be able to make it back to England this summer]</b> Slim to none. We’ve got such a fast turnaround <b>[until next season starts]</b>. The equivalent of the League Cup starts on August 8, then we have Champions League qualifiers and then the league resumes. If I came to England, I would have to do the 14-day quarantine. If I came back to Israel, I would have to do the same. So it’s something I have to get my head around</p>
