  <p><b>[Gerard Lopez claims <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have held discussions with Nicolas Pepe’s representatives, but not with Lille]</b> I know there have been discussions with the player, not with us as a club. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have players in those positions and I read that maybe there were players who could leave, or not. I am not particularly focused on <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. But it is true that there have been discussions with agents.<br /><br /><b>[Pepe did not want to have to decide his future during the tournament and Lille have decided to respect his wishes]</b> We had two offers before the Africa Cup of Nations. We’ll see after that, my position was to see if we could not do something before it, we had two proposals before it, I had two clubs. The agents, with whom we have good relations, have asked us a little time to look at other options. It is not Lille who discusses alone.The player has of course the right to have preferences. At the beginning of the Africa Cup of Nations, he said that being in a competition like this and having your mind to something else, it’s complicated. It is a big career choice. In his head there are things going on. We agreed to wait until the end of the Africa Cup of Nations</p>

In terms of departures and arrivals, if a player leaves, we will go and get what we need. For Nico, it is almost done and he could have left last summer.</p>

  <p><b>[Lille president Gerard Lopez has now confirmed that Napoli have met the club’s asking price for Nicolas Pepe, freeing them to press ahead with transfer talks]</b> Last year we asked Pepe to stay with the promise that we would sell in this transfer window. We received offers that satisfy us economically from four big clubs. <b>[Napoli chairman Aurelio]</b> <a href="aurelio-de-laurentiis.html">De Laurentiis</a> has satisfied our request for €80m. Now it is up to the player to decide where he wants to go. He must make that decision based on the offers that his agents have received from the four clubs. On Monday, Pepe will return from vacation and I believe that by the middle of the week he will have made a decision</p>

  <p><b>[Lille president Gerard Lopez confirms Nicolas Pepe to Arsenal for €80m]</b> I think it should be done in the next 24 hours. It is €80m fixed, plus some other details. In talking with Nico and his agents, things focused on the certain clubs that we wanted to focus on, the two projects that interested the player</p>

  <p><b>[Selling Boubakary Soumare could offer Lille a rapid route to balance their precarious budget, although president Gerard Lopez has made no secret of his belief in the Paris-born player]</b> He’s one of the very best at his job. He’s technical, with incredible physical power and wins a great deal of possession. He’s a modern No.6 or 8. We’ll see him in the France team very soon. He’s a clear vision of where he wants to go and he’s working very hard to get there<br /><br /><b>[Lopez pointed out, remembering a 2-2 draw in which he excelled]</b> He dominated <a href="tanguy-ndombele.html">Ndombele</a> last season. And <a href="tanguy-ndombele.html">Ndombele</a> is not just anyone, since he signed for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>. Bouba will also go to a big club</p>

  <p><b>[Lille president Gerard Lopez labelled <a href="gabriel-magalhaes.html">Gabriel Magalhaes</a> an absolute machine]</b> It’s true that he would like to go and try something else out. We haven’t taken that decision yet, but he’s received a number of offers. I feel he’s closer to one club than others, but nothing’s done yet so we’ll see. I wouldn’t want to say any more as I respect the player too much. The mechanism I have in place, and we saw that work so well with Nico <b>[Nicolas Pepe]</b>, is that I have a certain price in mind for a player, and at the end of the day it’s the player’s choice to go and play where he wants to play. That’s the respect that I have for them<br /><br />I feel he is among the top five dominant central defenders in Europe right now. His statistics, which aren’t well covered outside of France, shows that his percentage for winning duels is pretty unheard of in a league that’s extremely physical. He’s an absolute machine, so to me, he’s well on his way - if not this year - to potentially a really big club. I’m certain he’s on his way to the Brazilian national team at some point. He’s been linked to two clubs in the UK and he’s clearly been linked to other clubs that have either enquired or moved forward with proposals for him, but we’re not in a hurry and we’re not playing right now. The player isn’t on the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Lille owner Gerard Lopez has rejected claims that the values of elite players such as <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> will not plummet following the coronavirus pandemic]</b> I think that the price of the best players will not drop because the rich clubs will fight to sign these stars. The upper end of the market - players who have a price of more than €60m or €70m - won’t move too much because there aren’t many players who make up that level. But I don’t think that there will be a mega transfer of €130m or €150m this summer, even if we’re not immune from a surprise.<br /><br />In fact, Lille have received three definite offers in the last two weeks, including a couple from England. I don’t think that any price drop will penalise the club because we have young players who have a lot of potential and who will be in great demand. Only three or four players will leave, not 10, so this won’t influence our transfer window</p>
