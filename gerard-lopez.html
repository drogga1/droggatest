  <p><b>[Lille owner Gerard Lopez has confirmed Barcelona’s interest in Nicolas Pepe]</b> It’s true. Several big clubs are interested in him. Some clubs have contacted us directly after the transfer window to know what the state of play is.<br /><br />I want him to stay until the end of the season as a minimum. We’ll certainly sell (players in January). We’re starting to have players who are not happy with their game time. If we can, we’re going to sell players who have good qualities but less game time. We’ve got five centre-backs, for example.</p>

  <p><b>[Lille president Gerard Lopez says he is sure winger Nicolas Pepe will leave the club]</b> Pepe has a lot of quality with his speed and strength. He’s determined around goal and always dangerous.<br /><br />This summer, I think we will sell four to five players, no more. All clubs are forced to balance their accounts except perhaps one.I would say yes, it is sure he will leave. He enters a price range that can no longer be paid. There is a career choice to make for him, I think he will have the choice</p>

  <p><b>[Lille president wants Arsenal &amp; PSG target Nicolas Pepe to stay in Ligue 1]</b> This is not a secret: we have had many approaches for Nicolas Pepe and we will never be able to match the salary he can get elsewhere. It’s clear that he will go to a big club. I want him to go to a club that gives him the means to go beyond what Lille can do. The country doesn’t matter. This is not an invitation to PSG but I would be very happy to see Nico continue to develop in Ligue 1 and France. There is only one club <b>[in France]</b> that can afford to have a player like him. But he is heavily followed by teams in all leagues. Nico is very thoughtful and has a very Cartesian approach to football, he will make the best choice</p>

  <p><b>[Lille president Gerard Lopez has distanced the club from rumours they will hire Jose Mourinho]</b> Just look at the list of clubs that send scouts to all our games. It’s the cream of European football. We are the most scouted club in France. Jose Mourinho is a friend of Luis Campos but it is a pride that he is there and that he speaks well of Christophe’s team. But since he is not going to stay long without a club, he also looks at players in particular<br /><br />Luis has received absolutely huge offers I have seen the offers and I know what he can be for other clubs. For me, he is the best recruiter in the world. But he’ll be there next season and he’ll be there for a long time. He is also my friend and he totally believes in this project. He proved it by refusing this type of offers</p>

We’ll see after that, my position was to see if we could not do something before it, we had two proposals before it, I had two clubs. The agents, with whom we have good relations, have asked us a little time to look at other options. It is not <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a> who discusses alone.The player has of course the right to have preferences. At the beginning of the Africa Cup of Nations, he said that being in a competition like this and having your mind to something else, it’s complicated. It is a big career choice. In his head there are things going on. We agreed to wait until the end of the Africa Cup of Nations</p>

He’s technical, with incredible physical power and wins a great deal of possession. He’s a modern No.6 or 8. We’ll see him in the France team very soon.

  <p><b>[<a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a> president Gerard Lopez labelled <a href="gabriel-magalhaes.html">Gabriel Magalhaes</a> an absolute machine]</b> It’s true that he would like to go and try something else out. We haven’t taken that decision yet, but he’s received a number of offers. I feel he’s closer to one club than others, but nothing’s done yet so we’ll see. I wouldn’t want to say any more as I respect the player too much. The mechanism I have in place, and we saw that work so well with Nico <b>[<a href="nicolas-pepe.html">Nicolas Pepe</a>]</b>, is that I have a certain price in mind for a player, and at the end of the day it’s the player’s choice to go and play where he wants to play. That’s the respect that I have for them<br /><br />I feel he is among the top five dominant central defenders in Europe right now. His statistics, which aren’t well covered outside of France, shows that his percentage for winning duels is pretty unheard of in a league that’s extremely physical. He’s an absolute machine, so to me, he’s well on his way - if not this year - to potentially a really big club. I’m certain he’s on his way to the Brazilian national team at some point. He’s been linked to two clubs in the UK and he’s clearly been linked to other clubs that have either enquired or moved forward with proposals for him, but we’re not in a hurry and we’re not playing right now. The player isn’t on the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a> owner Gerard Lopez has rejected claims that the values of elite players such as <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> will not plummet following the coronavirus pandemic]</b> I think that the price of the best players will not drop because the rich clubs will fight to sign these stars. The upper end of the market - players who have a price of more than €60m or €70m - won’t move too much because there aren’t many players who make up that level. But I don’t think that there will be a mega transfer of €130m or €150m this summer, even if we’re not immune from a surprise.<br /><br />In fact, <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a> have received three definite offers in the last two weeks, including a couple from England. I don’t think that any price drop will penalise the club because we have young players who have a lot of potential and who will be in great demand. Only three or four players will leave, not 10, so this won’t influence our transfer window</p>
