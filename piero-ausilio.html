  <p><b>[Intermilan sporting director Piero Ausilio confirmed the Serie A club have made an ‘official approach’ to Manchester United for Romelu Lukaku]</b> We had a meeting with Manchester United for Lukaku. It was an official approach between two important clubs. We’ll see what happens. All the players we’re following are targets we’ve agreed with Antonio Conte. We want to satisfy his request within certain financial parameters</p>

  <p><b>[Inter Milan sporting director Piero Ausilio has confirmed that the <a href="inter-milan.html">Nerazzurri</a> have submitted an official bid for Christian Eriksen]</b> We just made an official bid to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> to sign <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> and now we’re waiting. Many clubs are interested but we are confident trying to get a top player like Eriksen<br /><br />As a top player, he has attracted the attention of the most important clubs in Europe. His contract is expiring in June, we are trying our best. But, I repeat, it is very difficult because we are talking about a great footballer and in these situations it is normal for many clubs to consider him. We will do everything possible<br /><br />We’ve reached a basic agreement with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> for <a href="victor-moses.html">Victor Moses</a>. We are evaluating the situation, it could be an opportunity, but it’s better to wait before saying more. <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Olivier Giroud</a> is also a possibility, if we sell one of our forwards on the transfer market</p>

  <p><b>[Inter sporting director Piero Ausilio has insisted that star forward <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a> is not for sale and that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> must pay the Argentine’s €111 million (£97m/$121m) release clause if they wish to sign him]</b> As far as Martinez is concerned, there is only one way that he will leave Inter and that is by paying his clause. A clause that everyone knows – there is no point in hiding – is demanding, because it has both deadlines and commitments that must be kept very precise. It is a clause that expires in the early part of July so it won’t last for a long time. And it is the only possibility that exists to take Lautaro away from Inter today<br /><br />He is an important asset of the club, and let’s not forget that he still has a three-year contract with Inter. Inter are not going to sell their most important players. We intend to keep them and eventually strengthen in the transfer market, and this also applies to Lautaro<br /><br />Many clubs have contacted us to address the Lautaro theme. Among these, the most determined one, with whom we have a friendly and cordial relationship, is <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. I don’t hide this. And I know that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> knows perfectly well what our intentions are. Inter have no intention of selling <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a>.

  <p><b>[Inter yet to make <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a> future call while reiterating <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> must meet Lautaro release clause]</b> He’ll stay with us until the end of the season, then we’ll decide about his future with <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. He’ll have the opportunity to show his skills. If <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> want him they know that they must pay his release clause. We didn’t speak with Lautaro about <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> because we want to keep him<br /><br />We have perhaps gone even beyond expectations. We have rebuilt with a great coach like <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> and we are still running in three competitions. With <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> we have always chosen the players to fit the club. There are no low prices. Indeed some have increased. It seems that everyone is afraid to take the first step and I feel that concern. I think things will go on for a long and the fireworks will take place in September</p>

  <p><b>[Mauro <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a> has signed a contract to stay at <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> on a permanent basis]</b> I know that the boy is happy to stay in Paris. <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> can exercise the option to buy him and that expires on May 31. There is a figure that has obviously been affected by the health emergency, so we will see. We talk with <a href="leonardo.html">Leonardo</a> often and I know the player has signed a contract that would allow him to stay there. We will find a solution<br /><br />We always liked him but he will not come, I know the reasons and there are several. I know the opinion of the boy and his entourage. It’s true he has a clause, but he will not come. <br /><br /><b>[Lautaro Martinez is said to be at the top of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s list of summer targets but Inter are confident he will still be part of <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a>’s side next term]</b> We have invested in him since he was very young because we thought he was ready for the first team. In recent years he has developed a lot and can improve further thanks to <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>, the playing system and a partner like <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a>. He is an important asset for the club, there is a €111 million (£100m/$123m) clause he could leave for but it is very tough because it has very specific deadlines and is only valid until July 7. Inter do not need to sell, nor do we want to sell our best players, but we want to strengthen ourselves. I know there is interest from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, but we have not entered into any negotiations with them because they know our stance. We imagine Lautaro at Inter and he still has a three-year contract with us</p>

  <p><b>[Inter sporting director Piero Ausilio distances the Italian club from Vidal]</b> I don’t feel like making any final considerations, let alone for <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Vidal</a>. Right now he’s not an opportunity for us. We already have a very strong central midfield. <b>[Christian]</b> <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Eriksen</a> arrived in January and, like anyone else who arrives in January, he needs time, not just to settle on a technical level.
