  <p><b>[The new Pogba or Gerrard? Inter’s €28m signing Roberto Gagliardini just taking hype in his stride]</b> We believe in Gagliardini and don’t count the number of Serie A games he has played, but how he played them. We are fully aware with a young player we must have the patience to let him make mistakes, grow and improve. You can’t start to doubt Gagliardini’s quality because Inter signed him rather than someone else.</p>

  <p><b>[Inter sporting director Piero Ausilio has confessed that his decision to sell Philippe Coutinho to Liverpool ranks as one of the greatest regrets in his career]</b> It was a great regret for me to have to sell him – perhaps one of my greatest regrets in over 20 years at Inter. I have splendid memories of Coutinho, both as a footballer and of the lad himself. When he got here, it struck us how outstanding he was immediately - he was serious and wanted to work and you could see that he had all that was needed to go on and do what he has done so far.</p>

  <p><b>[Inter have no reason to fear losing Mauro Icardi in the near future]</b> There are no figures, there have been no meetings, there is only the desire and the pleasure of moving forward together. We will talk about it at the end of the season. There is no problem, as he has another three years on his deal, this is the important thing. Icardi is important for the club and he knows it. He has already renewed his contract three times since he came to Inter. We’re happy to keep him with us for many more years.<br /><br /><b>[On Luciano Spalletti]</b> We are very happy with his work, beyond the individual matches, for us there is no problem. Spalletti is the present and the future of Inter. We have nothing to worry about</p>

  <p><b>[Inter Milan are planning to put a new contract to Mauro Icardi]</b> From our side, there is the desire to improve his terms and renew his contract, while on his side there is collaboration. Since he has three years left to run on his contract, it’s possible that we do it in a few days or in a few months, but it’s not a problem<br /><br />The team has character. To achieve important things also takes quality, and Inter have shown themselves to have that in recent games. We are trying to improve. Inter is aware of the work it has done so far. We are coming off a positive season in which the goal was to return to the Champions League, and we succeeded. We will now play our cards in the Champions League and in Serie A. The work of the last few weeks is the basis for building an even stronger Inter. We have included several new players who arrived after the World Cup and it was inevitable that there would be some initial difficulties. We are aware of the need to be strong and we want to prove that in the derby</p>

  <p><b>[Inter refusing to give up on Luka Modric dream]</b> I didn’t believe it until the end, but at the same time I don’t see why you can’t dream. All I said last summer was: ‘We’re here, if Real Madrid think they can make this happen then let’s talk about it’. We did not feel like starting a negotiation because we knew what our chances were. Could we go again or has the dream ended? We’re talking about very important players with huge quality, but you can never say never in football.</p>

  <p><b>[Inter reiterate stance on Jose Mourinho return]</b> Mourinho? He is not a shadow. It does not surprise me that we talk about him in a time when media and everyone need to say something. We work in a more rational way. Our project has been ongoing for a year-and-a-half with Spalletti and will go on with him for many years.<br /><br />Suning <b>[Holdings Group]</b> is ambitious. They want an Inter that returns to winning ways, not one that is content to be second, third or fourth. What we can say to the fans is that we are working hard to get Inter back to winning ways as soon as possible</p>

The club has been clear. Fabregas? There are important figures involved.<br /><br />In this position we have only two players, Jorginho and Fabregas, so for me it would be really a problem without Cesc. I want him to stay, I don’t know the final decision of Cesc and the club of course. But for me it’s very important and if Cesc will go I think that we need to buy another player, and it’s not easy because, technically, Cesc is a very important player. And I think that in the market it’s very difficult to find a player with his characteristics</p>
