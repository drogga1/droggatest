  <p><b>[Lebron James on potentially teaming up with <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> to establish an <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> side in Florida]</b> There’s some interest in both sides. David has become a good friend of mine over the last few years and I think it would be great for this city to have a football club, for sure. The research is still being made out but I think it can be huge. I think this is a great town for soccer. There are a lot of soccer players here. There is a lot of great youth soccer here</p>

  <p><b>[When did LeBron James get involved with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>?]</b> I am thrilled to be working with <b>[FSG founders]</b> John Henry and Tom Werner. These guys, like me, have a passion for sports. You can see the drive and commitment they have for their teams. For me, this is about being in business with an organisation that loves sports as much as I do.<br /><br /><b>[James subsequently compared <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to the Dallas Cowboys, the New York Yankees and - perhaps annoyingly so for Reds fans - <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> Any time you have so much history and so much power behind their story, there is great potential to continue that expansion. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are definitely one of those clubs. They really are like Man U - and the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Yankees. There are some teams and logos you see, no matter where you are in the world, and you know exactly who they are and what they mean. I see <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in that group<br /><br /><b>[Does LeBron James go to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> games?]</b> To be at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> and see 40,000 fans screaming at the top of their lungs, the whole game, was an unbelievable experience for me<br /><br /><b>[He joked of the meeting with <a href="kenny-dalglish.html">Dalglish</a>]</b> King Kenny is something else! His accent is very strong. So it was very difficult to understand what he was saying</p>

  <p><b>[With the NBA season postponed, superstar LeBron James had time to shout out some of his favourite footballers]</b> Favorite soccer players? I’ve got a few of them.

Straight up, every player on <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a>, <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, those guys are legends, man.
