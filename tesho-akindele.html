<blockquote>
  <p>[On why he choose Canada] I think it’s really great to see - I haven’t been playing for that long, I think I’ve been with the team for four years - but I’ve seen so many changes in the quality of the team, and the competition level too. I think when we first started we had a really good core group of guys but maybe not so many people fighting to get into the squad. Now, I think every camp is a real fight even to get called into the squad because we do have so many young players. I think the fact that there are so many young players means that everybody’s memory is fresh. Nobody has really harsh memories of a time with Canada struggling to win games or getting beat really bad in Honduras. Nobody remembers that because we’re all young. That was before our time. We’re here with a fresh slate and want to make our own identity.</p>
