  <p><b>[Canada attacker Tesho Akindele says there’s once again a buzz around the Reds]</b> It’s always just great to have a chance to represent your country. I think right now it’s a special time with the new coach. You always want to put your best foot forward and first impressions are important, so I’m looking to make a good first impression at this camp<br /><br />I view us as improving. There’s a lot of young players coming from all over the place, Europe and other leagues, that are playing quality minutes and they’re already professional at a young age which is something I don’t think Canadian players have been able to do for most of the history of the team, <b>[aside from]</b> maybe one or two. So, it’s kind of cool that we have so many young guys coming in with actual experience<br /><br />At least the first goal has got to be to get out of the group - before that even score a goal. The last two Gold Cups we haven’t scored a goal, and that’s just below expectations, of course, if you look at the teams we’ve had. So, score a goal first and then get out of the group. One step at a time like that<br /><br />I think at this point I’m pretty used to flying. I don’t think it’ll affect me too much. I remember <b>[Sebastian]</b> Giovinco he came back from Italy <b>[in 2015]</b> and scored a goal, like, the same day. Nobody can have any excuses after he did that. I think I’ll be all right</p>

  <p><b>[On why he choose Canada]</b> I think it’s really great to see - I haven’t been playing for that long, I think I’ve been with the team for four years - but I’ve seen so many changes in the quality of the team, and the competition level too. I think when we first started we had a really good core group of guys but maybe not so many people fighting to get into the squad. Now, I think every camp is a real fight even to get called into the squad because we do have so many young players. I think the fact that there are so many young players means that everybody’s memory is fresh. Nobody has really harsh memories of a time with Canada struggling to win games or getting beat really bad in Honduras. Nobody remembers that because we’re all young. That was before our time. We’re here with a fresh slate and want to make our own identity.</p>
