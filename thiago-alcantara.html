  <p><b>[Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago Alcantara has welcomed the prospect of Ousmane Dembele joining the Bundesliga champions from Barcelona]</b> Dembele is a great player. But I am not the sporting director who decides if a player will be bought or not. As a football player and one who played against him I can say: ‘He is a very good footballer’. I would like to play with all the great players who would love to come to Bayern.<br /><br /><b>[Thiago acknowledges more changes will be necessary for Bayern to compete at the same level next term]</b> It’s a radical change, many important players left the club. It can always be a complicated year if important players leave. That’s football. From my point of view, we have a great team. But, regarding the players who left, we will have to make reinforcements to achieve our goals next season<br /><br /><b>[The Spain international also praised £68 million signing <a href="lucas-hernandez.html">Lucas Hernandez</a>]</b> He is a great player who really wanted to come to Bayern. I saw him at Atletico Madrid and the French national team. Physically, he is a machine, very strong! A very passionate player. He comes as a world champion with big experience. He is here to have some fantastic years</p>

Thiago Alcantara took a different tone to his boss, claiming that a wide player of Gareth Bale’s quality would be welcomed with open arms]</b> It’s pretty easy to say actually whether he would be welcome at Bayern Munich. We’ve just spoken about these three players: <b>[Arjen]</b> Robben, Franck Ribery and Gareth Bale. All three play mostly in the same position, on the wing. Players who are similar to <b>[Bale]</b>, Robben and Ribery, have written part of the club’s history at Bayern and if somebody like Gareth Bale wants to come, then, as I said, every player who wants to join the club and who wants to support and help the club is more than welcome</p>

We will have the door open to you. Robben, Ribery and Bale play in similar positions on the field and we lost Robben and Ribery in our midfield, two historic members of this club. If Gareth Bale wants to come, any top player who wants to come here is welcome</p>

  <p><b>[When your father is a professional footballer, you quickly get used to moving from one place to the next and having to make new friends time and time again. It was no different for Bayern Munich star Thiago Alcantara]</b> I have a collection of great memories from my childhood because I was with my brother all the time. We are very close and the difference in age was less than two years. He was my shadow and it was awesome. We had different great moments, playing in all the cities where my dad played after the games, at school playing with friends<br /><br /><b>[His performances did not go unnoticed elsewhere and he eventually ended up joining Barcelona at the tender age of 14, snubbing Real Madrid in the process]</b> I was playing in a team in my hometown of Vigo. My mom didn’t allow me to play on my dad’s former team because my dad had some issues when he was a player. My mom didn’t allow me or my brother to go there. So we played in a team and my friends from school were there. We had a great season. We beat Real Madrid. We beat Celta. We beat Deportivo. We beat all the teams in Spain. One game when we played Barcelona, after the game, my dad said, ‘Thiago, I didn’t want to tell you before but they want you to be part of Barcelona next year. So what do you think?’. At that moment, you get shocked because Barcelona was a great team. Also at that time, he told me about Madrid and other great clubs. But my decision was very precise<br /><br /><b>[His move to Barcelona saw him team up with some of the best players around in his age category, but there was one youngster in particular that stood out]</b> At that time, it was a guy from Israel who impressed me the most, Gai Assulin. He was my age and he was one step quicker than me, all the time. He reached the second team but then he didn’t reach the first team, and he was not consistent in the first division. At the end, he was playing in the second and third division in Spain. But he was the biggest talent that I saw at La Masia<br /><br /><b>[After impressing at Barcelona’s famed academy, Thiago eventually made the step up to the first team]</b> As a professional, I’m not a guy who could get impressed with players, but I have a lot of respect for them. The amount of respect at that moment was, ‘Wow!’ You are excited to play against them, to learn with them, to fight with them. This is very exciting. But I always look at their behaviour, how they are on the field, how they are in the locker room. For me, that was more important. I have respect for a guy because of how he is, not because he’s a football player<br /><br /><b>[With players such as Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben having left the club, Thiago is now one of the more experienced heads at Bayern and he is looking forward to taking on the extra responsibility that comes with it]</b> The players we have now have to take this role. Before, those legends were there. Very young people are coming, people with experience but also who are younger than us. We have to lead them in some way and, also, learn from them. It will be a great mix and we are very excited about it.<br /><br /><b>[Both Robben and Ribery completed a full decade at Bayern, but Thiago does not know just yet whether he could achieve the same]</b> I’m just trying to enjoy this job, this passion that I have, to leave with this feeling every morning when I wake up. You have to keep going that way. In three years, you never know. I don’t want to make plans. I hate plans. Let’s live today and live tomorrow</p>

  <p><b>[Thiago Alcantara feels Pep Guardiola has only become better and more magical over time]</b> I always make the comparison that the coach works like the players. When you put a player in a great team, he gets better and he makes all team-mates better as well. With the years, he got better as a coach, not just because of experience but he also got better players and he could do better things with them on the pitch. He got more magical, more experienced, more tactical, more everything<br /><br />He was at the Under-16 practice. I was there with my team-mates, and he was just teaching us how to play a positional game. We were in training and he saw that two or three of us were a little bit different. He came with us and said, ‘What you did with the ball was great but try doing it this way’. You always take seriously what people with experience say to you. You could feel that he was very concerned about tactical things, technical things. You could see he was very good and he was Pep Guardiola, a former player. You just respect that and you have to learn from that. The passion and the commitment to this sport, I think, is the biggest thing he taught me. But at that time, you couldn’t tell that he would be fabulous in the future<br /><br /><b>[Bayern appointed Niko Kovac as their new head coach in 2018 after caretaker spells from Willy Sagnol and Jupp Heynckes]</b> Niko’s a young trainer. He wants to win all the trophies possible with Bayern, to keep growing with the club. He’s doing a great job and we like him. Pep goes straight to the tapes and tries to explain how they’re opening spaces, why you’re doing things. Niko’s more direct with that. He wants to give you more freedom. He wants you to make your own decisions during the games</p>

  <p><b>[Thiago Alcantara expects to spend many more years at Bayern Munich]</b> I feel as a part of the club, I can fully identify with this idea. A player can’t have as a motto: ‘I’ll play for 90 minutes, and that’s all I’m interested in’. I always say: <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> is like a big house where everyone lives closely together under the same roof.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed further on whether he could be sticking around for the foreseeable future]</b> Both parties must make this decision. I feel fantastic, my family are very happy. The quality of life is incredibly good in Munich, so why not?<br /><br /><b>[Thiago believes there is still plenty left for him to achieve in Bavaria]</b> Winning. That’s why I’m here, that’s what I play for. It was the same when I took to the pitch for my small home club: I compete to win. Of course it’s more fun if it’s a good game. But in my view sport is always about being better than your opponents. It’s a contest<br /><br />Bayern are a big club with a central idea. That’s important. Take Ajax: they’ve had their own culture since <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Johan Cruyff</a>. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> adopted this philosophy with <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>, and both clubs have been living by this idea for many decades. Bayern represent a large family, that’s unique. And we’ve had a philosophy of our own for about a decade, similar to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. We want to dictate the game with the ball. We should look for players according to this idea. It’s also important to consistently pursue it in the youth section</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich feels like home for Thiago Alcantara despite being a product of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> &amp; Guardiola]</b> My son is Bavarian. He was born here, so you do feel some ties and roots here. More than an international club, it’s a family club. You can move about easily here, be friends with everyone that works here at Sabenerstrasse. It makes it feel like home<br /><br />Of all the coaches we had here, and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, he was the one with the most intensity, most concentration. You had the same tension training as playing. You’re attuned to learn and hone your game. With other coaches, training sessions can be a bit more light-hearted, but with Pep it’s always concentration.<br /><br />My style is not only because of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. There is also the Brazilian idea of a pivot. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> gives you the philosophy to understand the game of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. The rest, you pick up along the way. For me, there are so many variations in football. It’s not necessarily about controlling the game. It’s about controlling your action.<br /><br />It’s that your actions are well-coached, and executed in the best manner possible, against the opposition. That’s control. If it’s a long ball, it has to be in a controlled manner. You dominate a rival through execution. You do every play with the goal in view. That, to me, is control - that everything you have trained comes off</p>

  <p><b>[Thiago Alcantara talks about life during the coronavirus pandemic]</b> First of all, here in Germany, we’re allowed to go to the parks and forests to run and walk. That has been a good point for us, for the sports guys, that we can maintain our body, working and running<br /><br /><b>[He also described Bayern’s cyber-training sessions]</b> But also, the club made something amazing, like a video chat with all the team and the trainers. We can have really good at-home training sessions with them.<br /><br />Looking at it in the sporting way, we run, we bike and then we do all the strength training, mobility, stretching - all the functional training we can do. But also, I think it’s about adapting to the situation, adapting to this strange situation with family and friends<br /><br /><b>[He described the social aspect of Bayern’s cyber-training]</b> We’ve mostly been staying in touch with these video chats and trainings. We have five or 10 minutes before or after where we talk with each other. It’s nice to see they’re good, having a good time. But we also by call each other regularly, for sure<br /><br /><b>[Asked what he is doing to stay sharp]</b> So, I’m watching old games-not just from our team, but from other teams-and making reviews from our tactics and preparing for when football comes back<br /><br /><b>[Thiago stressed that he wants to be ready when the season eventually resumes, even if the games are held in empty stadiums]</b> Even if we don’t play in front of a crowd, which is very important for us, even then we must be ready.

For me now, I’m focused on that<br /><br /><b>[He focused on the uncertainty of the situation rather than the stress of being home]</b> For me, it’s more the uncertainty than stress at the moment.
