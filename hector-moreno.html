  <p><b>[Hector Moreno on visiting <a href="luke-shaw.html">Luke Shaw</a>, whose leg he broke, in hospital]</b> I went with <a href="phillip-cocu.html">Phillip Cocu</a> to the hospital. I was nervous and it was very difficult at first, but he was very kind to me and didn’t blame me. He had seen the images and said it was part of football. That made me smile</p>

  <p><b>[After being held out of training as a precaution Tuesday, Mexico center back Hector Moreno returned to training Wednesday]</b> The truth is all our opponents have grown from before. Costa Rica, the United States, Honduras, they’ve got players who are playing in Europe, in MLS, here in Mexico. They’ve grown, they’ve matured and are strong national teams, as is Mexico.<br /><br />Obviously we’re happy. We’re going to try to win the four. It would be brilliant, we’d be practically qualified and you’d go to the Confederations with a feeling of satisfaction. But right now we’re thinking of the next games</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico fortunate to escape Trinidad and Tobago with three points]</b> It’s really tough to play pretty football on these types of fields and these types of opponents. I think the team tried to do it, but also you have to be ready because because, it’s happened to us in the past, the last games against Trinidad and Tobago were 3-3 and 4-4. So we knew that it was important to keep a clean sheet and after that look for a goal on a play, and we got it.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico breaks another ‘curse’ with Trinidad and Tobago win]</b> Fortunately we’ve gotten the points, which is the most important thing. The team has gotten really important results in tough places, because if I’m not wrong it had been <b>[13]</b> years since Mexico had won here and they’re always tough places because of the field, the ball, the opponents feeling very comfortable here. But at the end of the day, we played a great match, a very smart match, and we take the three points, which is the most important.</p>

La Real, at the same time, has achieved an agreement with the player until June 30, 2021. The Mexican defender will arrive to San Sebastian tomorrow</p>

  <p><b>[Hector Moreno started again for Real Sociedad]</b> I haven’t thought about leaving at all. Obviously, there are situations that you have to go through, but you know you have to support and help the team however you’re asked. It’s normal that the people who play in my position also deserve to play. In soccer anything can happen, but my head is here because I’m really happy with La Real and in San Sebastian and my family is as well</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico’s 104-cap defender Hector Moreno admits ‘I didn’t know how to defend’]</b> I realised when joining Roma that I didn’t know how to defend. I joined Pumas at the age of 15 and didn’t know how to defend. When I moved to Roma, it came to my attention that I still didn’t know how to defend. I’ve never learned so much as in those seven months at Roma. They would explain things to me in training and I’d say: ‘How is it possible that I didn’t know this?’ I always worked with coaches who preferred to focus on attacking football</p>

What happened, happened, it was tough, I had to put my life on pause<br /><br />I think I could’ve stayed and been able to compete in any part of Europe. <b>[The move to Qatar]</b> was for a thousand reasons, obviously the economic element was also an influence, thinking about the future for my family and for me</p>
