  <p><b>[Hector Moreno on visiting <a href="luke-shaw.html">Luke Shaw</a>, whose leg he broke, in hospital]</b> I went with <a href="phillip-cocu.html">Phillip Cocu</a> to the hospital. I was nervous and it was very difficult at first, but he was very kind to me and didn’t blame me. He had seen the images and said it was part of football. That made me smile</p>

  <p><b>[Hector Moreno started again for Real Sociedad]</b> I haven’t thought about leaving at all. Obviously, there are situations that you have to go through, but you know you have to support and help the team however you’re asked. It’s normal that the people who play in my position also deserve to play. In soccer anything can happen, but my head is here because I’m really happy with La Real and in San Sebastian and my family is as well</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico’s 104-cap defender Hector Moreno admits ‘I didn’t know how to defend’]</b> I realised when joining Roma that I didn’t know how to defend. I joined Pumas at the age of 15 and didn’t know how to defend. When I moved to Roma, it came to my attention that I still didn’t know how to defend. I’ve never learned so much as in those seven months at Roma. They would explain things to me in training and I’d say: ‘How is it possible that I didn’t know this?’ I always worked with coaches who preferred to focus on attacking football</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico star Hector Moreno reveals how close he was to joining <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> Things surely would’ve been different <b>[without the injury]</b> because there weren’t only talks with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, but I had the possibility of signing before the World Cup<br /><br />Even when I was injured I had the chance to sign for another team and also when I returned, but I didn’t think I was prepared to leave, it was difficult, but I wouldn’t change it for anything<br /><br />I felt really good in all aspects, the tactical layout and my teammates helped me stand out. What happened, happened, it was tough, I had to put my life on pause<br /><br />I think I could’ve stayed and been able to compete in any part of Europe. <b>[The move to Qatar]</b> was for a thousand reasons, obviously the economic element was also an influence, thinking about the future for my family and for me</p>
