<blockquote>
  <p>[Bengaluru FC suffered a 3-1 mauling at the hands of East Bengal at the Kanteerava Stadium] I am really sad for the fans. They came here hoping for a win and they have encouraged the team and the team also tried to do their best. But at the moment, we are not so paced to play as we like from the first minute. You can say it was a tactical mistake. We played with two strikers and that was the right thing. It became a mistake as things changed after the first goal. It balanced out later but I am not so sure that tactics is the most important aspect in that part of the game. Tactics is how you go into the field and I fielded a team that was confident enough to win the game but it is a shame. We are working hard and trying to change things after all those draws. East Bengal punished us at the worst moment when the team was looking to go up again but again, that is football.</p>
