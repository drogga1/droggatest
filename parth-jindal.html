  <p><b>[Bengaluru FC suffered a 3-1 mauling at the hands of East Bengal at the Kanteerava Stadium]</b> I am really sad for the fans. They came here hoping for a win and they have encouraged the team and the team also tried to do their best. But at the moment, we are not so paced to play as we like from the first minute. You can say it was a tactical mistake. We played with two strikers and that was the right thing. It became a mistake as things changed after the first goal. It balanced out later but I am not so sure that tactics is the most important aspect in that part of the game. Tactics is how you go into the field and I fielded a team that was confident enough to win the game but it is a shame. We are working hard and trying to change things after all those draws. East Bengal punished us at the worst moment when the team was looking to go up again but again, that is football.</p>

  <p><b>[The Bengaluru FC CEO was clear about the ambitions he expected his team to fulfil in the league]</b> It’s been a strange season and not the easiest to deal with given the kind of success we have always been used to. Football, however, has taught us enough to realize that there will be phases where things get tough. What is encouraging and important though is the willingness of the team to put this run behind and get the season back on track.<br /><br />While we are focused on developing players, we also want to win every competition we take part in. Our position in the League makes it almost impossible to retain the title but we want to finish as high as we can<br /><br />We’ve got our AFC Cup campaign off to the perfect start and the immediate goal is to get out of the group stages. Then there is the Federation Cup that we want to bring back to the Garden City. Importantly, we want to do everything to secure another season in AFC competition. I cannot imagine a Bengaluru FC season without AFC games in it! I’ve said this many times before but will say it again, the ultimate dream would be to win the League with 11 Indian players on the field</p>
