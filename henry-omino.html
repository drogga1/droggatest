  <p>[Western Stima head coach Henry Omino has conceded Kenneth Muguna’s imminent departure is a blow to his team.] Muguna was an asset to us, we had developed him and we knew his potential and ability. Too bad that he will not be with us next season, I admit that it is a blow to us but we have to move on and consider ways to fill his gap. It will not be easy but we will do our best. His move will be beneficial to him and us at large and remember we cannot deny anyone a chance to develop.</p>

  <p>[Western Stima head coach Henry Omino has challenged new signing Moses Arita not to think that he will automatically be the first choice striker] Arita is a good player who is experienced, and we all know he is capable of doing great things for us. We know his quality and we are happy that we managed to secure his services. He will definitely improve us in the offensive department that is for sure. However, it is not going to be easy for him, he has to work for it, he has to show that he deserves to be in the starting lineup for us.</p>

  <p>[Western Stima are ready to continue with their fight in Kenyan Premier League without the services of their top goalkeeper Gabriel Andika] Andika is a good player, but sometimes we cannot prevent a player from moving to a club he feels is good for his career. We have good goalkeepers who can replace him effectively. He is a good goalkeeper and I know his qualities. We wish him all the best as a team. This year we want to continue doing better with hopes of finishing among the top teams.</p>

  <p>[Western Stima have completed the signing of former AFC Leopards and Gor Mahia defender Jackson Saleh on a one year deal] He is a good player, who is experienced and we believe he will be a good signing to us. We want to do better this year and that is why we are bringing in players we feel will be helpful.</p>
