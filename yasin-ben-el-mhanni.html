  <p><b>[Yasin Ben El-Mhanni previously set the internet ablaze with some brilliant trickery]</b> I’ve doubled for Neymar, I’ve doubled for Cristiano Ronaldo and done their skills on camera, which was great. It was mind-blowing, really, to see people that you look up to on the pitch, and meet them in real life, in person. It gives you something to aspire to. I had to show them how to do a set of tricks. The directors would tell me what tricks to do, and I’d have to demonstrate it to them. Then they’d have to do it themselves.<br /><br />Street football gives you the chance to learn and teach myself things rather than being coached. I was basically learning from YouTube, watching matches and players like Ronaldinho, Lionel Messi, Robinho and Cristiano Ronaldo, trying to interpret what they do. Growing up on the streets, everything is just war. Everything is right, so you just do it.</p>

  <p><b>[The Toon trickster, Yasin Ben El-Mhanni, came from futsal and street football into the Championship but he had to fight against his family’s better judgement to make it]</b> If I was being totally honest, they told me to enjoy my football but they wanted me to study. My mum and dad wanted me to go to university, but now they’re supportive, really supportive. My dad told me to stop playing, sometimes in the mornings he’d be like: just forget it. Where are you going? I’d be going to the park to train. He’d say, ‘just forget it, you’re 19’..<br /><br />His mentality was different, he used to say: ‘If you haven’t made it at 16 then you’re not going to make it if you’re not in a club.’ He used to tell me all the time <b>[to]</b> just forget it, just go and study, you need to do something now before you get too old and you can’t do anything<br /><br />I went to West Brom, Queen’s Park Rangers, I was at Chelsea as well. Chelsea was the last trial I had before I signed to Newcastle. About three or four weeks before he told me there’s a bunch of clubs really interested in you that want to get you to sign. But he said they haven’t sent anything through yet but I’m talking to them. Newcastle was one of the clubs and I always had my mind set on them, I wanted to go there. So, when he told me that Newcastle wanted me to come and sign and everything was sorted, still I couldn’t believe it.<br /><br />Going up on the train, I actually couldn’t believe it, I was sitting with Godfrey Torto I was saying: I’m actually going to go and sign for Newcastle! This is a joke!<br /><br />He was telling me this is where it’s got you but this is only the beginning you can’t take this for granted, you really need to knuckle down, because I had a chance at Barnet. Going to where I am now at Newcastle is a massive step and I’m putting my head down and just trying to focus. I want to be able to play first team football, and hopefully one day I can be a part of Newcastle’s first team and actually be able to run out on that pitch on a regular basis<br /><br />What a stadium, the first time I ran out on it, mate the feelings, the feelings! I was so nervous, but it was a relief and that’s where my eyes are set right now - I want to be a Newcastle player<br /><br /><b>[He had made mistakes in the past which included rejecting Watford - while he was at Barnet - as well as falling out with his mentor]</b><br /><br />A new manager came in, because at the time Edgar Davids was there, a new manager came in and he just wanted to start fresh so I got released. Then me and Godfrey kind of fell out because I didn’t speak to him for about six months when I was at Barnet because I played against Watford, I did really well and they wanted me to come in and he was telling me that I should go to Watford and see what happens there. I didn’t want to, I wanted to stay so me and him stopped talking and then I went with another agent and things didn’t really go that well. So I built up the courage to apologise to Godfrey for what I did to him in the past</p>

  <p><b>[El-Mhanni was also released from Barnet, but unfazed, went on trials with West Bromwich Albion, Queens Park Rangers and Chelsea before signing for Newcastle United]</b> My dad told me to stop playing <b>[after Barnet released me]</b>. He’d be like: just forget it, you’re 19. One manager might not like you and another might like you - that’s how it works.<br /><br />I’ve been on trials to places managers aren’t keen on me. I’ve performed, done what I had to do and trained well, but sometimes you’re just not what they’re looking for. I still I couldn’t believe it, going up on the train I was sitting with Godfrey and I was saying: ‘I’m actually going to sign for Newcastle! This is a Joke!’ He was telling me: ‘This is where it’s got you but this is only the beginning, you can’t take this for granted</p>
