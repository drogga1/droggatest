  <p><b>[Southampton have confirmed Jay Rodriguez will sign for West Brom]</b> Rodriguez departs after five years at St Mary’s, moving to the West Midlands to seek more regular first-team football. The forward arrived at Saints from his hometown side of Burnley in 2012. He went on to make a total of 126 appearances and scoring 35 goals in his time with the club. Everyone at Southampton Football Club would like to thank Jay for his hard work, dedication and the significant contribution he made to our success over the past five years. He leaves with our very best wishes for the future.</p>

  <p><b>[Jay Rodriguez has left West Brom and returned to hometown club <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> in a deal reportedly worth a figure rising to £10 million]</b> I was desperate for us to get promoted last season and the disappointment of that narrow miss cut deeply. The club did everything it could to persuade me to stay and this has not been an easy decision by any means. But at this stage in my career, I found the chance to play again in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at my hometown club too good to turn down and I hope everyone will respect that</p>

  <p><b>[Jay Rodriguez, a team-mate at St Mary, remembers <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a>’s debut against West Brom]</b> I knew then. I said to my mates in the changing room that this guy was top class and could play anywhere. He could probably play anywhere on the pitch and be the best player. He’s an unbelievable talent</p>
