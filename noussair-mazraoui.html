  <p><b>[Ajax star Noussair Mazraoui has revelled in his side’s incredible 4-1 win over Real Madrid]</b> I made that tackle and thought: ‘now I should keep the ball in play, so Real would think it’s out and stop playing’. I didn’t know whether it stayed inside <b>[the line]</b> or not, but when we scored after that, I knew the VAR would double check that moment. In the end it was a goal. Great. We’ve made some history. We made Amsterdam proud. It’s a humiliation for Real Madrid and a big win for us</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> star Noussair Mazraoui to observe fasting against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> Hotspur]</b> I will be fasting. I’m used to it. Are you allowed to eat when you have to deliver a heavy effort? People have different opinions about that, but this is my choice. I feel pretty energetic during the Ramadan. I don’t feel it while playing football. On Wednesday we play at 9 pm. I can drink at 9.15 <b>[after sunset]</b>. If I’m playing, I can walk to the side to drink a sip. If I’m playing<br /><br /><b>[But he is not bothered about his limited playing time ahead of Wednesday’s crucial fixture in Amsterdam]</b> It’s exactly like what the coach said. We have more than eleven players and we’ll need everyone. That’s what you experience during the final end of the season. I’ve been suspended twice lately and I’ve missed a couple of games due to an injury. Therefore it’s important</p>
