Every manager can think the way they want and maybe some managers prefer to score one goal, then get the whole team back and counter-attack. Our philosophy is to continue trying to score more goals because it is the best way to win - playing well and scoring goals</p>

We dominated the game for 60 minutes and then lost the game. We didn’t score the important second goal. You must understand the boos (from the fans) because the last five games we played here we didn’t win. If you don’t win at home your fans cannot be happy. You cannot concede three goals in every game. Unfortunately for us we are doing the wrong things. We are not in our best moment but need to keep fighting.
