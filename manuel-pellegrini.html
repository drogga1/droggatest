Our philosophy is to continue trying to score more goals because it is the best way to win - playing well and scoring goals</p>

He is one of the world’s most respected football coaches and we look forward to working with him. It was important that we appointed someone with knowledge and experience of the Premier League, who already has an understanding - not only of the teams and players we face - but of West Ham United and our ambitions. Manuel brings a reputation for attacking football and getting the best out of his players. We believe he will attract new talent to the London Stadium as well as improving the current squad. Above all, he is a winner, who knows what it takes to succeed at the highest level and is driven to continue that success. Manuel is the first West Ham United manager to have a Premier League title on his CV, and we believe that his experience, quality and proven record of taking teams forward quickly will ensure that he is successful here<br /><br />We have listened to fans who asked us to be ambitious. We hope they agree it is an exciting appointment. Manuel will shortly announce the names of the new staff he will bring in and he will then get down to shaping the squad he wants.

  <p><b>[Jack Wilshere is considered to be a £100 million player by Manuel Pellegrini]</b> Jack is just 26 and has the quality to play in the national team. In football, the most important thing is the quality. That, you cannot buy. You either have it or you don’t. After that, there are a lot of different things that you must add to your quality. We are talking about fitness, not having so many injuries. But I’m sure it is in his mind to return to the national squad.<br /><br />We knew before that he was not a player who would be available for every game every week. But also that he is a player of a quality that is not easy to bring to West Ham at a price we could afford. Maybe players of the quality of Wilshere at this moment can cost £100 million, £90 million, £70 million - good creative midfielders are very expensive. He wanted to play at West Ham, we took the risk and it has not been a good month for him but we have the second part of the season and I hope he will play most of the games</p>

The young players that are able <b>[could]</b> play some more as well in the next games.<br /><br />I was very happy with Lucas Perez that he took his chance. We have a squad here and continue to work with the players that we have got. We hope that he will continue to play games in a row. He got a few minutes the other day, good minutes for him and he has worked this week without a problem<br /><br />Maybe the results were not what we expected at the start of the season but we improved as a team. The trust of the players is bigger after back-to-back wins now. We must continue trying to recover from the bad start. When we finish the first round (2018) we will see where we are. If you started the table after those first four games we would be in sixth, just one point behind Chelsea but we still need to recover from that bad start</p>

He has now the last six months and I hope he will be able to do it.<br /><br /><b>[When pressed on whether he sees Carroll as a potential starting option for his side]</b> If he can work in the normal way, of course he can be an option to start in our XI. Not only Andy Carroll but every player can be a starter when they work the whole week and week by week. For the moment, I think he can be a very important substitute. We know what he can give to our team. Near the box, he is dangerous. All the other defenders must be worried when they see Andy near their box.</p>

We hoped it was just a pain and that he could adjust for two or three days but for different things it has been longer than we expected. It is very difficult to know when he will be back. Maybe the doctor can answer better than me - yesterday he did a medical examination and when we get the results we will know.</p>

Tottenham? You should never think that a team four or five points behind you are not involved in the title. Of course they are. City have to play the final of the Carabao Cup which will suspend a game. If they make the semi-final of the FA Cup they must suspend another game. They have midweek with the Champions League. So it’s not easy to compete in all the competitions. I talked about this four years ago. The major problem was that we were involved in all the competitions. We won one League Cup in that moment. We then went out of the FA Cup in the quarter-final against Wigan. If we’d continued in that FA Cup, I don’t think we would have been able to play all the games. We didn’t have time to do it</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini has told midfielder Declan Rice to study the likes of Sergio Busquets, Fernandinho and Frank Lampard]</b> You can see how he has improved from the beginning of the season. So there is no reason why he will not continue improving. As a young player, the more games you play and the more you work every day with good players, of course you will improve. There are a lot of players who he must see if he wants to improve in that position. Both those players who played some years ago and those who play in this moment. We are always trying to tell him which players he can see. I think that Busquets, the number five for Barcelona, is a player to see how easy it is for him to build up his team with one or two touches. He’s one of the best holding midfielders in the world, he never gives a bad pass and never gives a ball with a problem. Fernandinho is another player from whom he can learn a lot and if you see, some years ago, I think he must see how Frank Lampard played in that position. There are so many players that, if a professional player wants to learn, he can find the information to improve. Declan is a player who always listens to what you say and wants to learn more. If he continues to improve the way he is improving, he can probably reach the same level.<br /><br />For every player, of course the more goals you score the better, but I think Declan has another duty that is more important than scoring goals. Maybe in set pieces or from shots from the edge of the box he can score, but I think he must continue improving his view of the pitch and giving us good build-up and making solutions with the ball at his feet</p>

  <p><b>[Declan Rice’s future at West Ham is considered to be a matter of price]</b> It is just a matter of price, if it is a good deal for the club, player and he improves his career then we can do it. But I don’t know about anything there.<br /><br />He must continue to do what he is doing now. He knows he must improve but that is why he is always listening and improving. When he plays ore games, he will keep on improving. Declan doesn’t feel any pressure in the national squad or here. He tries to improve every week. That’s very good for him<br /><br />We are not talking in this moment about the future, same as with Nasri or any other players. He has a calf injury so we will see if he is available Saturday</p>

  <p><b>[Manuel Pellegrini has stressed the importance of West Ham maintaining their home form]</b> We have improved at home in the second part of the season. We lost some important points at home, especially at the beginning of the season, but we must continue trying to add points when we play here at home. After that, if we win our next three home games, it may be a successful season. I think, when the team plays well and the fans enjoy the game, everyone is thinking about us winning the game</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini has outlined what Chelsea attacker Callum Hudson-Odoi needs to do in order to succeed in his his career]</b> I think <b>[he is a]</b> very good player. He’s just starting his career. I always say about those young players starting that it’s not so difficult to arrive, a lot of good players with technical conditions arrive to play in the first team. But after that you must keep it. At the beginning any little good thing a young player does, people will say how good they are, but after that they will demand more. The second step for a young player will demonstrate the divide, which will be top players and which will not. I think that he has all the condition to be a top player. So it will depend on the mentality and ambition where he can arrive.<br /><br /><b>[One player who Pellegrini believes has reached the top of his game is Chelsea’s N’Golo Kante]</b> Kante, yes, I think he is a top player. When he was at Leicester, he demonstrated the way he can play. He has grown because he came to a more difficult team. He continued to demonstrate what a big player he is. All the good players in that position, I think Declan and every other player, must see him and the ways in which they can improve</p>

He is, of course, a player who has had a brilliant season, who is 20 years old and an English player who has a lot of qualities. Maybe some of the big teams, or all of them, will want him. But that is one thing - the other is whether he will stay here or he goes, and I cannot say at this moment.</p>

You cannot concede three goals in every game. Unfortunately for us we are doing the wrong things. We are not in our best moment but need to keep fighting.
