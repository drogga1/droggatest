  <p><b>[Santi Cazorla has voiced his support to Spain coach Vicente del Bosque]</b> We’re all very happy with Del Bosque and he has the confidence of the entire squad. You have to credit what we’ve done. We’ve had a tough road. In a match, anyone can get the better of you. That Slovakia defeat was a tough day, but we knew we had to stick together and stay calm and that’s what we’ve done. The failure in Brazil is forgotten now. We have to learn from our mistakes. We’ve got a new generation and we’re thinking about the future.</p>

But the sensations I have keep getting better and I’m feeling optimistic about the future. The objective is to play some part with the team before the season ends, but we have to take things carefully.<br /><br />After being out for so long it will take a while to get back into form, it’s a real struggle, but when you have been out like I have, you also notice pains elsewhere - apart from what I’ve had with my tendon. But all of that must mean that I am doing things right, and I hope to be back as soon as possible<br /><br />I hope the club gives him a good send-off; he has given his life to Arsenal.

  <p><b>[Santi Cazorla has revealed his big regret at not being able to say goodbye to Arsenal’s supporters while also revealing Arsene Wenger’s special contract gesture]</b> No, they didn’t want to. They were very good, very honest. My idea was to do at Arsenal what I eventually did here <b>[at Villarreal]</b>. I knew whoever was going to sign me would have to see me first: nobody just gives you a contract. Pre-season with Arsenal, let them see me, then we all decide. But they couldn’t wait to finalise the squad. They said they’d help any way they could otherwise. I understood it, respected it. I’m eternally grateful. The people love me there and I’ll always have a connection with Arsenal, so much affection. Not being able to say goodbye playing at the Emirates is like a thorn in my side. If I had to leave, I wanted it to be in front of the fans.<br /><br />Arsene always supported me. He renewed my contract before the first operation, which was an incredible gesture. He called me in: ‘Santi, I’m going to give you the optional year. It’s here, sign it, have your operation with peace of mind.’ That helped me focus on my rehabilitation without fear. I’m eternally grateful for that<br /><br />Half-times killed me, because it got cold, I’d be crippled at the start of the second half and the pain got worse and worse. That night, I cried; it had become too much. I had to stop. Then the problems started. I picked it up in the operating theatre and then there was the fact that the wound was open. I’d work on the bike and a couple of stitches would come out. Because it was an open wound, bacteria can enter, so another bug gets in. At night, a yellow liquid would come out. Every time they sewed me up, it split again; more liquid. They did a skin graft but they didn’t see what was inside - the bacteria eating away, eating away. They never found out which bacteria it was. They’d said to me: ‘Don’t worry about playing football, concentrate on regaining a normal life, being able to play with your son or go for a stroll.’ But I didn’t attach too much importance to that because by then I’d already decided to come to Spain, where they told me completely different things. I’d got tired - I’d gone through two or three months of operations. I went to Vitoria the next day and that’s when they found the bacteria - two in the tendon and another in the bone. They didn’t know how much of the tendon the infection had eaten. Mikel <b>[surgeon Mikel Sanchez]</b> said: ‘I’m going to have to open you up until I find the tendon.’ They told me they’d have to open, open, open, open and when they did, they saw I had lost 10cm. I’d been lucky, they said, it could have been more. When he had to rebuild the tendon, he realised how bad a condition the bone was in. He could put his finger in it. It was like Plasticine. That’s even more dangerous</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal lacked the belief required to challenge for the Premier League title]</b> We needed to believe in ourselves more. To believe that we were capable of competing with the big sides in the Premier League and not just settling for third or fourth.<br /><br />We needed to have made that leap to try and battle it out for the title. There were seasons where you felt like we were in with a shout but then through various circumstances it wasn’t to be. But I think it’s all about having that self-belief, that right mentality. To say ‘we believe in this team, we know we have a great squad and we can go toe to toe with the big English clubs’. I believe that they will do that and for sure they will keep on improving in the future. They are going to have a great season, they have a great team and I wish them all the best<br /><br /><b>[Cazorla believes that the appointment of Unai Emery has the club heading in the right direction]</b> I think it’s a club that can improve quite a few things. I gave him all the information I could to try and help him out during his period of settling in and I think he’s very happy and I think he’s a great manager for Arsenal. But everyone really does have to be patient, when you think you’ve had the same manager for 23 years <b>[sic]</b>, a manager who became a real symbol for the club on a worldwide scale and the fans have to show a little patience with Unai, and the team because there has been a lot of changes. I believe that if they do things in the right manner, Arsenal have everything required to be a massive club. I’m sure that in the coming seasons Arsenal will be making that step up in quality which will hopefully enable them to be on a level playing field and able to fight for the title and other big trophies</p>

I’d like to thank all the people who were always there during the difficult moments. I’m going to enjoy it, I plan to give my best as I always have done with the national team. This had already been a really nice season but I didn’t expect it to end this way. If someone had told me this was going to happen, I wouldn’t have believed them. I was out injured for two years and after something like that it is very hard to return to the top level.

I will finish the season and see what my body tells me because every day I wake up the sensations are different. I always said that I was returning here to play at my best level and when I see that I am not at 80% I will step aside and give way to younger players. At the moment I am happy, but the age shows, injuries can happen and it gets harder and harder. I will not make any decision right now, but it is clear that playing in Europe is attractive for any player. I will decide this summer</p>
