  <p><b>[New boy Cazorla says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> must replace Van Persie and Song]</b> It’s clear that Van Persie is a great player and obviously we would all have preferred it if he had stayed. Song has gone as well and there are still 10 days left in the transfer market<br /><br />I do not know if we will sign anyone but obviously it’s important to replace players like that because they were so important for the team.<br /><br />It felt really good making my debut. Of course, it was not the result any of us wanted, but we had chances and we did well.<br /><br />It’s a long season, so we can build on this. I had one chance and so did a few of my colleagues and that was the key to the game. We had complete control but that final step just eluded us</p>

  <p><b>[Santi Cazorla reveals how injury almost led to foot amputation]</b> The medical professionals told me it was OK, the problem was that it did not heal and the wounds would reopen, and become infected. He saw that I had a tremendous infection, that I had damaged part of the calcaneus bone and it had eaten the achilles tendon. There was eight centimetres of it missing<br /><br /><b>[Cazorla, having undergone a last bout of reconstructive surgery on the injured tendon in May, is now on the road to recovery. Having signed a recent contract extension that ties him to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> until June 2018, he hopes to play for <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsène Wenger</a>’s side again in January]</b> Everything that I have gone through has not been as simple an injury as people have believed. Nobody trusted me but I do, I still do, although the pain keeps me cautious</p>

  <p><b>[Santi Cazorla speaks after being unveiled at <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> in quite a unique fashion]</b> I am eternally grateful to <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> for giving me unconditional support during these two years and always opening the doors for me. It’s a club that for me is an example and that always does things well despite the difficulties. I’ve always said that giving up was not an option. It is true that I still have some pains that prevent me from being 100 per cent, but I work daily to remove them. Every day I have better feelings, but I am very demanding and I want to keep improving. Now it’s time to give everything for this shirt and this club</p>

  <p><b>[How former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> ace Santi Cazorla resurrected his career at <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> after injury nightmare]</b> They told me, ‘If you get to walk again with your son in the garden, be satisfied. <b>[They]</b> saw that I had a tremendous infection, that I had damaged part of the calcaneus bone and it had eaten the Achilles tendon. There was eight centimetres of it missing!<br /><br /><b>[Instead, Cazorla fought tooth and nail for nearly two years - saying goodbye to the Emirates in the process - in order to return to the pitch]</b> I always felt the support of everyone from Arsenal: if there’s something I’ve taken away from there above all else, it’s the fans’ affection. The thorn in my side, the regret, is not having been able to say goodbye on the field, the way I’d have liked<br /><br /><b>[Even more remarkably, he earned a Spain recall in May and made his first international appearance for 1302 days when he started in a 4-1 win over Faroe Islands the following month]</b> Playing a single game at a top level was a very long way off, so imagine the national team… Unthinkable. This was difficult for me to take in, so unexpected after everything I’d been through. Now I take it as a new challenge, a new hope. I’m here for purely sporting reasons. They said that to me, ‘It’s what you bring’. Maybe it’s more special in my case, because of the injury, but that’s not the reason I’m here, although it could be an example for players my age - don’t give up. There have been all sorts of moments, times you consider throwing in the towel, but I knew it was a long run and if I didn’t make it, I didn’t want to blame myself or think I could have done more</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> star Santi Cazorla has backed <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> to become a great coach at the club]</b> Yes, I believed he would become a manager in the future. Even when I was playing with him, he showed great leadership in dressing room. Some say it’s a gamble for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to appoint him, but I believe it’s a reasonable challenge. He also worked as a coach under <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>. I believe he can become a great coach<br /><br />It’s not easy for any manager now to be like <b>[Arsene]</b> <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> or <b>[Sir Alex]</b> Ferguson. I can’t anticipate how long he’ll stay at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, but I believe he can also make great career at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, and he’s a proper one for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I hope Mikel leads <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> well<br /><br /><b>[His final three years in the English capital were plagued by injury and he feels he still has unfinished business at the club]</b> I don’t know if it’s possible or not, but I want to play one more game for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> before I retire. It was a deep regret that I could never have a proper goodbye. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> was the biggest club I ever played for. I’m proud that I was an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> player. I’m especially grateful for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans who supported me even after I left the club. I wish I can be part of the Gunners family in the future again<br /><br /><b>[Cazorla has scored nine goals in the 20 appearances he has made for <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a>]</b> If my form is good, that’s thanks to my club, Villareal. Many people are helping me, and I’m grateful for my club. Our aim for this season is to return to European competition for sure. We have done well in Europe in the past, and I believe we can do well now, too</p>
