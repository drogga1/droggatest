  <p><b>[Jarrod Bowen has been touted with a move to the]</b> No bids for Jarrod, nothing has come to me. As is well publicised, there’s been a new and improved offer put to Jarrod and his representatives so we’re just waiting to hear back on that. Again, I haven’t sat with Jarrod. It’s really down to his representatives and the football club to get to the bottom of that. We’ll just concentrate on the football<br /><br />I can see both sides of it. I can see that Jarrod is really enjoying his football and I can also see the side that if he doesn’t accept a deal then something has to be done really.<br /><br />At the minute we are where we are. We all know the situation. He’s got this year and an option (for a further 12 months) so hopefully he gets sorted one way or the other in the next few weeks.<br /><br />All I can do is concentrate on the team and concentrate on Jarrod while he’s here. Hopefully he’s here for a long time. If he’s not then he’s not. I don’t worry myself with that too much</p>

  <p><b>[On losing Jarrod Bowen and Kamil Grosicki in the January transfer window]</b> Initially it gives you a sense of pride that you’ve done something right with these players, for example with Jack Marriott at Peterborough or at Doncaster with John Marquis going to Portsmouth. My advice to players is for them to try and be the next one. That’s always been the way I think as a coach, so can we create more of these players that the club can sell on for many millions of pounds for years to come<br /><br />Bowen and Grosicki were two of the best wide players in the league and their stats backed it up, so to lose them was difficult. When Jarrod said he wanted to leave, I could see it in his eyes in my office. I don’t think anyone was going to stand in his way to go and fulfil his dream of playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. It did have an effect on the group and if you add that to the injuries that we had, it definitely hit the group and affected us<br /><br />Jarrod is an exceptional talent. One great thing about him is his everyday behaviours that people don’t see. They see him on a Saturday and what he does on the pitch but during the week he’s so robust, never misses a training session and is always the best trainer. He’s a really humble boy and I’ve got no doubt that he’s going to go on to bigger and brighter things. Who knows, he might even get an England call-up one day</p>

  <p><b>[On leaving <a href="neil-doncaster.html">Doncaster</a> following last season’s play-off heartache]</b> It was a very difficult decision. I went on holiday a couple of weeks after the play-off defeat to Charlton and I don’t think I spoke to my wife or my parents for about a week - I just felt so low because I felt we were going to do it. Marquis scored so late to take the lead in the tie but then to concede maybe two minutes later and lose on penalties is the worst way for it to happen. I just felt sick. But I got back to work straight away and brought three players in to <a href="neil-doncaster.html">Doncaster</a> before <a href="darren-moore.html">Darren Moore</a> went there, so I had no intention of leaving and I was ready to have another push the season after<br /><br />When I got to about 25/26 I started thinking about training sessions and started asking questions to managers and coaches. When you’re a player, you don’t really enjoy the sessions and you walk off the training ground questioning what you’ve just done. It made me start to think that football doesn’t last forever. When I went to Scunthorpe I started to ask Nigel Adkins a lot of questions because I had huge respect for him and then, when I went to Peterborough, I learned so much from Darren Ferguson<br /><br />Coming to the end of my contract there I was starting to coach, working on my A Licence and then I realised this might be the next step for me. Management wasn’t really on my mind, it was more coaching and helping but the way it panned out, I was thrown into the deep end at Peterborough and it was probably the best transition for me to be assistant to two different managers and then move into the management game myself</p>

  <p><b>[On adapting to life in England after leaving Belfast]</b> I wanted to come home the first year I was at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>. I was staying in digs and I was so homesick and I didn’t enjoy it. To be honest, self-doubt was telling me I wasn’t good enough to be there. I saw older pros like <a href="john-hartson.html">John Hartson</a>, Iain Dowie, Julian Dicks and I thought there was no chance I was ever going to get into the team<br /><br />My mum and dad were the ones who kept me there. Once a week they’d phone me and tell me it would be a waste of time to come back, the Troubles were happening in Northern Ireland and I wouldn’t want to get sucked into it. I ended up staying and the second year I improved but that initial year was the making of me because I could easily have just gone home</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Gardner scored twice to rescue a point for <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a> and deny Hull after the visitors led twice in a 3-3 draw at St Andrew’s]</b> I thought we could’ve been more than 2-0 up in the first half. We had some really good chances. Mallik Wilks had a couple where he didn’t get his shot off<br /><br />I just felt the early goal in the second half put them in the ascendancy a little bit, they got their tails up. We conceded off a shot on the edge of the box, which is disappointing, and then the other two we conceded are just criminal. People making a free run into the box and not being tracked. This is a tough place to come and it’s another point on the board. Yes it does feel like a defeat but we’ve got to take the positives out of it into Middlesbrough</p>

  <p><b>[Mallik Wilks’ stoppage-time strike earned Hull a vital 2-1 victory over Middlesbrough in the battle to beat the drop in the Championship]</b> It’s a big win, there’s no getting away from that with six games to go. We’ve come back in a good place, before the lockdown we had so many injuries. We were unlucky against Charlton and <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a> but have got the win today. It wasn’t pretty and I think the ball has a migraine! But when you’re playing a <a href="neil-warnock.html">Neil Warnock</a> team who want to get the ball forward, I thought we defended very well<br /><br />It’s never easy to come back from 1-0 down, especially here as we haven’t had the best of runs at home, but the group showed character to come back. It was a great free-kick from Herbie and it was nip and tuck over who would switch off from a second ball, and fortunately for us we got the win</p>

  <p><b>[West Brom secured a thrilling 4-2 victory over Hull to move closer to a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> return]</b> I think some of the goals are unacceptable. The first one we tried to bring it down rather than head, we switched off for the third and the fourth was a sucker punch. In an attacking sense we were excellent. The second goal was the worst. Jordy (De Wijs) knows himself, he made a mistake and hopefully he doesn’t make any more. We’ve worked hard on attacking set-pieces. We’re seeing benefits of that. Every ball (George) Honeyman put in we were so close. The work has gone in and we’re looking better defending and attacking set plays</p>

  <p><b>[Goals from Famara Diedhiou and Jamie Paterson gave Bristol City a 2-1 win over relegation-threatened Hull in their first match since sacking head coach Lee Johnson]</b> The players are giving everything. We are fighting for our lives, but we need to be better defensively. Performances since lockdown have been so much better. We have more players fit and have been in every game.<br /><br />We cannot dwell on this result because games are coming thick and fast. There is another huge one against Millwall coming up. We had chances tonight and are getting into dangerous areas. I can’t fault the effort the players are putting in</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Leonard’s second-minute stunner sealed Sky Bet Championship play-off hopefuls Millwall a narrow victory at beleaguered Hull]</b> It’s a disappointing goal to concede so early in the game We’ve made a real habit of that obviously in the last six games, conceding first in five of them, and that’s obviously a concern for us. The first half, there’s no point in me pussyfooting about, wasn’t good enough from all of us, really<br /><br />The second half we were better. We huffed and puffed a little bit, but the whole day we were disappointing. But the beauty of this game and the beauty that we all know now is that we’ve got three games to go now. We know what we need to do to stay into this division. It’s very, very clear for all to see and we need to try and react at Wigan</p>

  <p><b>[Wigan scored seven goals in an incredible first half as they thrashed fellow Championship relegation battlers Hull 8-0 at the DW Stadium]</b> It has hurt us, and all I can do is apologise to the fans on behalf of everyone in that dressing room because it’s nowhere good enough, and I’m so, so sorry for that. We didn’t get going at all. We concede in the first-odd minute, giving ourselves a mountain to climb, and then we seemed to concede every time Wigan went forward. We’re stood there at the sideline thinking ‘Is this ever going to stop?’<br /><br />We just didn’t get to grips with it at all. We just didn’t turn up. We all felt embarrassed. We’re all hurting. We have worked so hard this season, and to get done like we did today is unacceptable, from everyone<br /><br />There’s not much you can say when you’ve just got beat 8-0. But I’ve just got to go and look at it now with the players and we have to try to pick a team that’s going to get three points against Luton (on Saturday). We have two huge games coming up over the next week or so, so I’ll try to prepare the team to try to get the results</p>
