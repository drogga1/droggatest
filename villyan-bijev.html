  <p><b>[How meeting <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> legend <a href="kenny-dalglish.html">Dalglish</a> began Bijev’s winding journey to ‘indomitable’ Sacramento]</b> It was the last day I was there and I actually had a flight already booked to go back home to California. I was only able to play the first half. I started that game, played the whole first half and had a hat-trick. I was leaving at half-time, went back to the locker room to change and grab my stuff and start heading to the airport. On the way to the locker room, my agent and <a href="kenny-dalglish.html">Kenny Dalglish</a> meet me on the way and Kenny’s like: ‘Hey look, we think you’re a great player, we really want to sign you, what do you have to say about that?’. I’m just starstruck. He said it and I’m thinking: ‘Without a doubt, yes’. There was never any hesitancy on my part. It was never a hard decision. I didn’t even think twice. I immediately said, ‘Yes, absolutely I want to’. So I signed the contract and I got a week to go home, pack up all my stuff, take care of everything, and fly back to England and start my journey<br /><br /><b>[Back home, he was a star, but now he was the youngest player on the Dusseldorf squad]</b> I was always frustrated because, talking to people, I couldn’t really say exactly what I wanted to say. A lot of times I had a hard time finding the words to try to translate. And if someone did speak English and I was able to speak English with them, a lot of other times they didn’t speak it well enough to even understand fully. So not being able to express myself was definitely frustrating. I missed home a lot. I know a lot of players who have gone overseas talk about being homesick and how difficult it can be. And I definitely experienced that as well<br /><br /><b>[Bijev’s dream of being a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> star did not become a reality]</b> I think for any top club, if you can even bring in one, two or three guys from the second team it’s amazing because you’re constantly looking for the best and the best players in the world constantly want to play for you. So I think for a club like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, they constantly want the best players. If they have the best players and they can bring them through, great, and if they don’t, they’re going to get the best players from anywhere around the world<br /><br /><b>[Bijev had grown accustomed to as he reflects on a dark day for the country’s footballing reputation]</b> I didn’t personally experience anything like the England event while I was there, so I can’t really speak on that too much. It did seem like an isolated incident and was unfortunate to see because that’s not the kind of thing you want to hear about or the kind of things you want to happen, especially in a sport like soccer. But my experience there, it was good. It was hard. Playing first division soccer anywhere, even especially in Europe is really difficult. The first team I was going to was in Sofia. It was a great club and Sofia, it was amazing to see where I was born and kind of where my parents grew up and the culture that I come from, from that aspect. I had a Bulgarian agent who was great. My dad introduced me to him. And he brought me over and said: ‘Score a lot of goals here and we’ll move you on’. Unfortunately it didn’t quite pan out that way. It’s a great league to play in and great country to live in. It just didn’t work out the way I had originally planned. Then because of that I made the decision that I wanted to come back to the States and refocused my goal to play in MLS<br /><br /><b>[He started the club’s 2020 home opener against FC Tulsa before the season was halted due to the coronavirus]</b> I think we know that nothing’s guaranteed. If you look at past USL franchises that move up to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> and new <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> franchises that start, very, very few USL players continue on or are signed to the new franchises. So, if we’re being realistic, everyone’s not talking about it like we’re all guaranteed anything. Still, Bijev has found relative stability in Sacramento. He lives just hours away from his family, who frequently have the opportunity to watch him play. He is playing for a club that he believes is the best he’s been with so far, for a variety of reasons. In Sacramento, Bijev has found team-mates he can connect with and that understand his quirky California references. And he has found a fan base that appreciates not giving up despite facing a few setbacks. There is a reason Republic FC are called ‘The Indomitable Club’.<br /><br />The most special moment was signing that first contract. That was just the biggest relief and a culmination of everything I believed in my life to that point, coming to fruition. Everything I worked for, everything that my family had invested in me. All this time and energy and effort we had put into building me up to be the best soccer player I could possibly be, and then signing that contract just made it like: ‘Wow, it was all worth it’. <b>[Sacramento]</b> not giving up and persevering with those goals is something else that I really wanted to be a part of because a lot of other teams, they give up, or they’re not able to put in the work necessary to reach their goals but Sacramento never stopped. That’s why they say they’re an indomitable club, an indomitable city. And I just think those are characteristics that I really wanted to associate with.</p>

  <p><b>[Villyan Bijev recalls <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a>’s ‘incredible’ first impression at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> One of the times I trained with the first team was <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a>’s first week. His quickness on the ball, I think, stood out to me more than anything. The amount of touches he gets in the small spaces in a small amount of time was definitely incredible and something I hadn’t seen before. Skrtel, even in training, tackles like a madman. If you saw him coming, it just made you completely uneasy. He would slide-tackle without a care in the world. He was hard-hitting and would do his job, no matter what. So, I’d say his grit and his strength and ability to just go into tackles stood out as well. <a href="pepe-reina.html">Reina</a>, amazing goalkeeper. His shot-stopping from like point-blank range was super impressive. I think like his reaction time was absolutely amazing. Those guys probably stood out the most. It’s no surprise that these guys had the careers that they had<br /><br />I think Sterling was with the second team when I first signed. He was really young at the time but he was still really fast. He was by far the fastest guy on the team, even though he was one of the youngest<br /><br />While I was there, we trained in different places. You’d get a text either the day of or the night before letting you know, ‘Hey we need you in at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a> at this time tomorrow morning; just be there’, and I would say, after the loan, during the year-and-a-half that I was there, I probably trained six to eight times with the first team and every time it was an amazing experience. I know <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> really wanted to integrate the younger players in with the older more experienced veterans so they could learn from them. I just think that was absolutely invaluable because, growing up in Fresno playing there, I had no notion of what it was like to be a professional other than what I saw on TV. When there’s no pro team, to look up to and to train with and to learn from, it makes it a lot harder. So, then being able to go there and transfer over and train with those guys, it was amazing just to see the level that they train at on a daily basis<br /><br />I’d definitely say out of all the places I’ve been so far, Sac has done the best for me. I am really close to home. My parents are able to come to the games. I grew up to two-and-a-half hours from here and came to Sacramento as a kid a lot for tournaments and just to visit as well. So, that made it a lot more familiar to me. It was a lot easier to just open up. I’ve been able to make the best connections with the fanbase here as well, which helps a lot. When you know fans are supporting you, I’ve also had experiences where, for example, in Bulgaria, I went a couple of games without scoring a goal. And then, all of a sudden, you’re not a fan-favourite anymore, the fans don’t even want you to play and that can make it extremely difficult to kind of get motivated. Whereas here, I’ve always felt like they’ve had my back. I really want to play for them I want to perform for them. The coaches I’ve had here have been some of the best I’ve had.<br /><br />We have two years to win a USL championship, that’s kind of what’s on the forefront of our mind because after two years, there won’t be Sac Republic USL; it’ll be an <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> team now. We have two years of opportunity to win the USL championship and add to the history of Sac</p>
