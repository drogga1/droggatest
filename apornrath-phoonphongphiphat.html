<blockquote>
  <p>Thai Prime Minister <a href="prayuth-chan-ocha.html">Prayuth Chan-ocha</a>, who has been in power since a military coup in 2014, told reporters on Sept. 24, adding that he would stay on to ensure that policies launched by his military government would be carried out as planned. His message confirmed what critics and political peers had long suspected – that he would be unwilling to give up the reins of power. Constitutional amendments made by the National Council for Peace and Order, the ruling junta, in 2017 allow an unelected person to become prime minister<br /><br />Ramkamhaeng University politics lecturer Boonyakiat Karawekphan said that Prayuth now had ‘two choices to retain power’. The first is to stand in the election as a member of a political party and try to win a majority in the lower house. The second would be to wait for an invitation to retain the position from a winning party that supported him, making him an unelected prime minister<br /><br /><a href="prayuth-chan-ocha.html">Prayuth Chan-ocha</a> has managed to secure the support of the Phalang Pracharat Party, a pro-military, conservative body founded early this year. The party will be led by Industry Minister <a href="uttama-savanayana.html">Uttama Savanayana</a>, Three other ministers from Thailand’s military government joined the party<br /><br /><a href="prayuth-chan-ocha.html">Prayuth Chan-ocha</a> is also getting support from Sam Mitr, a group known as the ‘trio’ formed recently by Deputy Prime Minister <a href="somkid-jatusripitak.html">Somkid Jatusripitak</a> and former transport minister Suriya Juangroongruangkit<br /><br />Many in the business community are also keen for Prayuth to stay on, hoping that he will maintain the country’s main economic policies, including significant investment in the Eastern Economic Corridor, a brainchild of the junta designed to spur sluggish growth. For the public, however, the major concern is not if or how Prayuth retains power, but focuses on how he would manage to rule if required to compromise with groups that have different aims and expectations<br /><br />Section 44 is in the preliminary constitution imposed after the NCPO <b>[National Council for Peace and Order]</b> staged its coup. It empowers the military, particularly its head, to intervene in any national issue. Prayuth has used this rule in a number of cases, including the removal of high-ranking government officials. He claims this was done to solve problems quickly, while critics argue it is an infringement of democracy<br /><br />Under the constitution, the NCPO <b>[National Council for Peace and Order]</b> will be automatically dissolved following the election of a new government, meaning the administration will no longer be supported by a powerful group of generals<br /><br />Earlier in September, King <a href="king-rama-x.html">Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun</a> endorsed the last two bills required for the country to hold a general election, which is now expected to take place between February and May 2019</p>
