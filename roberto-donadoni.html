  <p><b>[Donadoni says Normality slowly returning to Parma]</b> Now we have these administrators and finally know who to call for answers. I hope the club can begin again from Serie B, but much will depend on what the administrators say on April 15. They earned themselves this draw. We lacked some sharpness and a cool head, as otherwise we could’ve made more of our chances and won it. Against teams like Inter, you need to be more clinical. But our only focus is to end the season in a dignified manner</p>
