<blockquote>
  <p>After Georges St. Pierre routed Nick Diaz with a unanimous-decision victory (50-45, 50-45, 50-45) in the UFC 158 main event, the two were cordial in the octagon and appeared to put their rivalry in the past<br /><br />Everyone seemed to know what was in store - the final installment of the Diaz show. Diaz proceeded to provide a litany of excuses for 10 minutes as to why he didn’t perform the way he wanted against St. Pierre. Among them were that his training partners didn’t help him enough in preparation for St. Pierre, that his stomach hurt and that he never adjusted to three-hour time difference from his home<br /><br />Nate Diaz’s teammate Jake Shields approved Georges St. Pierre’s hand wraps, but then wanted to see them again. The Quebec athletic commission informed Shields that St. Pierre’s gloves were already on and that wouldn’t be possible. … <a href="dana-white.html">Dana White</a> said the UFC confiscated the hand wraps to analyze them after the fight, and there was no sign of anything illegal. Diaz complained, however, about one punch that he claimed didn’t feel right and opened a cut<br /><br />Nate Diaz went on to admonish St. Pierre and Johny Hendricks for sitting next to each other when they are expected to fight sometime in the near in the future. He sounded open about the potential for a rematch against Carlos Condit if he couldn’t get a bout with St. Pierre or Silva</p>
