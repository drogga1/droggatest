  <p><b>[Ethan Horvath is trending up]</b> I know I need to get better at getting out of my goal <b>[on]</b> long balls. I wanted to punch away the ball first, but I hesitated and the equalizer happened. I know it remains a work in progress</p>

  <p><b>[You can count Ethan Horvath among those not at all surprised to see <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> enjoying success]</b> His biggest strength is on the field - he’s a fantastic coach, but he’s also a hands-on coach. He can tell if something is wrong with you, or if you’re in a down moment or something. He’s very hands on. He’s kind of like a father because he’s a father of three or four so he cares about you like you’re one of his own. I think that’s one of his biggest strengths.<br /><br />I messaged him when he first got the (Manchester United) job, and just told him congratulations. I was really, really happy for him because I know from a personal level that his big dream was to always go back to United and be the coach there. He’s doing a fantastic job<br /><br />With me, I was very, very young at the time, but with the older guys he’s the same. He doesn’t do special treatment for the younger players or the older players. He treats everyone the same and I think that’s very good because we are one club, we are one team, we all have the same goal and same mission in mind so I think it’s good that he treats everybody the same and looks at everybody the same<br /><br />Growing up one of the biggest dreams is to play in Champions League and to play the teams I got to play against, Dortmund, Madrid and Monaco, it was fantastic. That’s three massive clubs in Europe so to do as well as I did was a huge confidence-booster. Now you don’t go out telling yourself to shut out all these clubs, because when you look at the teams we were playing it was kind of like an impossible mission, but when it actually happens it’s a fantastic feeling. To play in the Champions League was kind of like a bucket list check. It was fantastic<br /><br /><b>[Horvath said of the competition for the starting USMNT goalkeeper job]</b> Personally I think it’s wide open. Brad (Guzan) is not here right now and right now it’s me, Sean (Johnson) and Jesse (Gonzalez). Zack is obviously in the picture and Brad’s obviously in the picture. I think it’s wide open. All we can do is come into training, and whoever plays the game, just show Gregg and the coaching staff that we are ready</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT ready for tougher March test from veteran Chile side]</b> They like to high press so that can kind of work in our favor. If we move the ball quickly and break lines and switch the play I think we can be dangerous</p>
