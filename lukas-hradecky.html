  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky has backed his former boss Niko Kovac]</b> A weak phase can happen and now everyone finds the smallest mistakes, but I’m not worried that Niko has to worry about his job.<br /><br />You do not have to defend at FC Bayern, they want to see offensive football there, and it’s probably annoying for the players that they have to train so many defensive things<br /><br />For his own perspective, of course, it was the right decision to go to Bayern.

No one believed he can take such a big step and that he is allowed to<br /><br /><b>[Heiko Herrlich is also under pressure after Bayer Leverkusen’s poor start to the campaign]</b> We to have got less points but… I hope Heiko can keep his job. We players have not discussed about him</p>
