  <p>[Ulinzi Stars head coach Benjamin Nyangweso has noted quality in new signing Baron Oketch from Gor Mahia and Stephen Ochollah and Evans Amwoka] They showed their quality, but it is difficult to judge them at this point because everyone is not on top in terms of fitness. Baron played well and showed very good qualities which will be a huge asset to us. The focus now from here is to build on fitness.</p>

  <p>[Ezekiel Otuoma joined Western Stima recently after spending two seasons with Ulinzi Stars] Otuoma is a good player who is really talented and we loved him. However, he spent most of his time in the doctor’s room with nagging knee injury putting him out of our squad regularly. That’s why we have decided to let him leave</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Ulinzi Stars have received a major boost as John Mark Makwatta is set to feature in their return leg clash on Saturday] Makwatta was missed in the first leg, he is a player who you definitely you do not want to miss in your team. He is back and we are delighted with the new development. My only concern is for Bonface Onyango, he sustained a knock on his knee on Wednesday and we will have to give him until Friday before our final verdict.</p>
