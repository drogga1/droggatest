  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higuain will likely feature alongside each other once again in the Italian top flight]</b> It would be fantastic if he made a strike partnership with Gonzalo. They know each other so well, as they played about 80 games together. If Juve can do it, this will be fantastic, just spectacular.</p>

  <p><b>[Gonzalo Higuain’s agent Nicolas Higuain say his brother is determined to see out his contract at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, despite speculation about him moving to <a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a>]</b> Gonzalo wants to respect his contract and therefore stay with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> for another two years. His performances at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> have been good and playing for another team in Italy isn’t a workable solution. I don’t want to disrespect anyone, but if Gonzalo plays in Italy again then he only will for <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, who own him.<br /><br /><b>[His brother understands why the fans were upset with the striker but believes it is testament to the passion of the Neapolitan support]</b> The parties wanted each other. The Neapolitan people always loved Gonzalo and the boos he received after his transfer at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> prove it. The pain was strong, but I think their reaction was normal because we’re talking about a passionate set of fans.<br /><br /><b>[His agent believes it’s too soon for that and supported his sibling’s choice to withdraw from national team contention]</b> I think it’s still too early <b>[to return to River Plate]</b> because Gonzalo is 31 and, once he’s recharged his batteries, he’ll be good enough for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. He has no second thoughts about quitting the national team. He felt he had to give way to younger players because staying in the national team for such a long time is a great responsibility and he preferred to withdraw himself</p>
