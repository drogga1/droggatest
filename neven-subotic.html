  <p><b>[Former Borussia Dortmund defender Neven Subotic insists his former club are ‘very clearly’ Bundesliga favourites this season]</b> If the Bayern squad stays the same it is Dortmund. Very clearly. I say that as a former BVB player and fan<br /><br /><b>[Having controversially joined rivals Bayern in 2016, the towering defender Mats Hummels is back at the Westfalenstadion and Subotic believes it is a good move for both parties]</b> I congratulate him. The team will benefit from him. He won four titles at Bayern during the last three years, while Dortmund only won one during that period. Dortmund will get a lot of experience in Mats. It is a big chance for him<br /><br /><b>[After backing his former defensive partner to be a success, he dismissed Bayern’s claims that Hummels departed because he was scared of fresh competition]</b> It is normal a club communicates it that way. Who is in this business for a ling time knows, that it has something to do with your ego<br /><br /><b>[Subotic was delighted to see him former manager Jurgen Klopp finally get his hands on the Champions League this year with Liverpool following BVB’s heartbreaking final defeat to Bayern in 2013 at Wembley]</b> Of course, Kloppo finally did it. 2013 in the final against Bayern we already came very close. Until now Klopp won the championship and the cup. Now he managed to win an international title of the highest level</p>

  <p><b>[Union Berlin (3) vs (1) <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>. Former <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> defender Neven Subotic played the full 90 minutes for Union after joining over the summer, and was warmly received by the travelling <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> fans]</b> I wanted to express my respect, even in a moment of joy - this appreciation is very important for me and for the fans. It was also beautiful after the game, to greet the fans, and to say thank you again for the years of support, so I tried to keep things under control.</p>

  <p><b>[Union Berlin defender Neven Subotic on his return to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>, a club he spent ten seasons with]</b> Such a special moment - there is no script for it. Everything that happens is very special because 25,000 fans are here to support me and to show their appreciation and also from my end it is much appreciated. A very special moment in my career and in my life!</p>

  <p><b>[Union Berlin defender Neven Subotic has doubts about <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> resumption]</b> That’s a precarious situation for all of us. It’s going to be impossible to come out of the league with positive remarks. It’s just going to be a lot of risk management and trying to get to a finished season with the fewest casualties. You can hear from my response that I am critical of how everything has been managed, but I understand it is a difficult situation for everybody. We all want to press forward and be in a situation where we don’t have to worry about it, but I think that is unrealistic in the coming months<br /><br />The leagues that were very decisive did the best under those circumstances, you don’t want to hear ‘Ah, in two weeks there will be a decision’, which is what you were hearing in Germany. We were also one of the last to close down the league. Since then, the approach has been to come back as soon as possible, and the financial aspects have always been highlighted. We’ve postponed the league so many times, we’re always trying to start it - you’ve heard for the last six weeks that ‘it’s going to start soon, it’s going to start soon’. Now it actually is, but things have been frustrating because what we want is clarity<br /><br />No matter when we start, it will be too soon. Even if we start in a few weeks, it’s too soon. If we had started already, it would be too soon. Even if we start in a few months, it may be too soon</p>
