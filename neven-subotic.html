  <p><b>[Borussia Dortmund downed AC Milan 3-1 in the opening fixture of 2017’s International Champions Cup at the Guangzhou University Town Sports Stadium]</b> I don’t mind rumours and if I listen to rumours, I would be a very sad man! We are very happy because he has been a very important player for us. He has probably been one of the key players in the last few years because he is able to change the game with one sprint, one goal. He has been a very good team player. He also works defensively which is also one of the key aspects for a player in our club<br /><br />There is a possibility in football and tons of possibilities in everything. But we know that Bayern has different <b>[financial]</b> capacity than us. They will, as always in the last few years, be the favourites. We are going to do the best. <b>[The idea is]</b> not to decide to challenge them but to challenge ourselves and then we will see where we end up</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> defender Neven Subotic insists his former club are ‘very clearly’ <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> favourites this season]</b> If the <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> squad stays the same it is <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. Very clearly. I say that as a former <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a> player and fan<br /><br /><b>[Having controversially joined rivals <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> in 2016, the towering defender <a href="mats-hummels.html">Mats Hummels</a> is back at the Westfalenstadion and Subotic believes it is a good move for both parties]</b> I congratulate him. The team will benefit from him. He won four titles at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> during the last three years, while <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> only won one during that period. <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> will get a lot of experience in Mats. It is a big chance for him<br /><br /><b>[After backing his former defensive partner to be a success, he dismissed <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>’s claims that <a href="mats-hummels.html">Hummels</a> departed because he was scared of fresh competition]</b> It is normal a club communicates it that way. Who is in this business for a ling time knows, that it has something to do with your ego<br /><br /><b>[Subotic was delighted to see him former manager <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> finally get his hands on the Champions League this year with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> following <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a>’s heartbreaking final defeat to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> in 2013 at Wembley]</b> Of course, Kloppo finally did it. 2013 in the final against <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> we already came very close. Until now <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> won the championship and the cup. Now he managed to win an international title of the highest level</p>

  <p><b>[Union Berlin defender Neven Subotic has doubts about <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> resumption]</b> That’s a precarious situation for all of us. It’s going to be impossible to come out of the league with positive remarks. It’s just going to be a lot of risk management and trying to get to a finished season with the fewest casualties. You can hear from my response that I am critical of how everything has been managed, but I understand it is a difficult situation for everybody. We all want to press forward and be in a situation where we don’t have to worry about it, but I think that is unrealistic in the coming months<br /><br />The leagues that were very decisive did the best under those circumstances, you don’t want to hear ‘Ah, in two weeks there will be a decision’, which is what you were hearing in Germany. We were also one of the last to close down the league. Since then, the approach has been to come back as soon as possible, and the financial aspects have always been highlighted. We’ve postponed the league so many times, we’re always trying to start it - you’ve heard for the last six weeks that ‘it’s going to start soon, it’s going to start soon’. Now it actually is, but things have been frustrating because what we want is clarity<br /><br />No matter when we start, it will be too soon. Even if we start in a few weeks, it’s too soon. If we had started already, it would be too soon. Even if we start in a few months, it may be too soon</p>
