  <p><b>[Philippe Senderos had settled into a nice rotation role with the Houston Dynamo]</b> If you’re a competitor, you don’t come over to stay on the bench. Obviously I was going to come in and try to fight for my place and play as many games as possible. If I can help the team, which I know I can, I can get some playing time. But there were many other factors. I just wanted to work hard and fight for my place.<br /><br />We’ve been trying to do a solid job defensively and I think it’s a credit to every single one of us at the back, and even in the team <b>[everyone]</b> has understood what it’s going to take and what we needed to do to win games<br /><br /><b>[Senderos speaks six languages]</b> The fact that I’ve been in many different places, I’ve had to adapt and that’s helped. I wish I’d stayed in one place the whole time, but sometimes life has different plans for you. So I’ve had to adapt and people here have been great with me and I’ve been welcomed here with open arms<br /><br />I knew when I was coming in we had an important run-in before the playoffs. We needed to get the results before so we’d make the playoffs. We achieved that. I was lucky enough to be able to help out and bring my qualities to the team. That was very good and now we’ve done tremendously in the playoffs and we’re in the conference finals. It’s an exciting time to be in Houston and to play for the Dynamo</p>

It’s amazing to see that, in every game he’s come in, people get excited and talk about the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> and that’s very important. Not only <b>[do]</b> they talk about the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, but also he provides the goods on the pitch, and that’s very important</p>
