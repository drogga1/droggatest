  <p><b>[After losing to Italy in their opening game, the Matildas have now claimed consecutive wins in France but coach Ante Milicic is adamant more improvement is needed]</b> We have qualified for the next round but we need to be better. We still get caught in transition far too easily. For us to keep our mission and go further in the tournament we need to get better. Full credit to Jamaica and I applaud them from trying to play an attacking style. We have to review this game quickly…it’s a short turnaround and we know we have to be better to get past a very strong Norway team</p>

  <p><b>[Ante Milicic is fully aware just how crucial Sam Kerr is to his side]</b> She’s an inspirational leader. We as an Australian footballing community should be thankful that we’re witnessing one of the best players in the world, live. If there’s one player that you’re really happy for to score the goals, it’s Sammy. So I’m delighted for her - it’s history, as an Australian player at a World Cup to do what she’s done. I think all the accolades must go to Sam, but also the service she got throughout the game from the rest of the team.</p>

<p>: 2019 06 22b
Australia’s defensive woes sent them crashing out of the Women’s World Cup in a heart-breaking penalty shootout defeat to Norway, with even their world-class attacker Sam Kerr faltering, missing her spot-kick</p>

  <p><b>[Ante Milicic pointed out post-match in Sydney, the South Americans were probably the perfect opponent for this stage of the Matildas’ preparations]</b> It’s a team that’s drawn recently with Brazil, a team that’s got a strong footballing culture, it’s actually a type of opponent that causes us problems. A direct style of football, a stop-start game that makes it <b>[all about]</b> transition. A couple of good individuals - they’re the ones that we struggle, in patches, against</p>
