  <p><b>[Dinamo thumped Atalanta 4-0 in their Group C opener and head coach Nenad Bjelica was not disconsolate with his side’s performance against <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> champions]</b> After we conceded we tried to turn to attack more, we had an open match against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> until the end and it is not a small thing. They are a level above us and they showed that today. We conceded that first goal in the best phase of our play. We were nervous a lot during the match, making mistakes, the home team had a lot of good chances</p>

  <p><b>[Dinamo Zagreb head coach Nenad Bjelica has revealed that <a href="dani-olmo.html">Dani Olmo</a> has already received many offers to leave the club]</b> Dani is impressive both as a footballer and as a person. He’s very modest and ambitious at the same time. He wants to learn every day and I’m proud to have him on the team. I think we are just watching his last matches at Dinamo. There are so many offers. In the end, the club and the player will decide together what is best for both sides. He is ready to play for the best clubs in Europe</p>

  <p><b>[Dinamo Zagreb manager Nenad Bjelica has confirmed that <a href="dani-olmo.html">Dani Olmo</a> is set to join <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> despite interest from Barcelona]</b> From the numerous offers he had, he picked Leipzig. In my opinion it is the best club for him to develop. He wanted to say good-bye to his teammates <b>[before leaving Zagreb’s training camp to go to Leipzig for his medical]</b>, but he could not. It was very emotional</p>
