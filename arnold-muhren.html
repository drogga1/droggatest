  <p><b>[Arnold Murhen says Klaas-Jan Huntelaar would be a superb acquisition for Manchester United]</b> The way the market has gone this summer then Klaas-Jan would be an absolute bargain at that kind of price. If United are looking to replace the goals lost through <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>’s sale then Huntelaar comes as near as you can get with a guarantee to score them<br /><br />He’s a goalscorer. Very, very dangerous in the box. He scored 76 league goals in 92 appearances for <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and despite what some people might tell you, that is not easy<br /><br />I believe he can score goals at any level. He has proved he can do it on the international stage with 13 goals in 23 matches for Holland. He has proved he knows where the back of the net is throughout his career. He might need a little time to settle into <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but he would score goals in England<br /><br />Huntelaar is not as fast as <b>[Ruud]</b> <a href="ruud-van-nistelrooy.html">van Nistelrooy</a> but he’s not slow. You need to play it to Klaas-Jan’s feet. He’s a target man who will hold the ball up for you and bring the midfielders into play. That’s his style. He’s also very good in the air. He needs wingers feeding him the ball and midfielders playing into him. Like Ruud, if you give him the right service in the box then nine times out of ten he will score. Play to his strengths and create opportunities and Huntelaar will pay you back in goals. He would be another good option for United with <a href="michael-owen.html">Michael Owen</a>, <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> and Dimitar Berbatov<br /><br /><a href="michael-owen.html">Owen</a> is fast over the first two or three yards and can win the balls put over the top. <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> is a great talent and works hard and scores goals. He also has that ability to play wide and come in from that position. I love Berbatov’s kind of arrogant style. With Huntelaar added to that department it would be a great mix<br /><br />I really do think it would work for United. I still love the club and want them to be successful and I think with Huntelaar at Old Trafford he’d get the goals to keep United in front</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> Coach Arnold Muhren says Lack Of Board Support Driving <a href="martin-jol.html">Martin Jol</a>’s Move To Fulham]</b> I know Martin is unhappy at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> because he wants to buy some new players but because the club lost €21 million <b>[£16.8m]</b> last year, they won’t let him. There are a lot of players at the club that they want to sell. He wants to bring new players in but they won’t let him do that without selling players first. There is no other money to spend. He is desperate for a striker. He has been told that he must sell Suarez and Marko Pantelic was only offered a one year deal when he wanted two or three years so he has left. Martin wants to win the Dutch league this season and the board want to sell Suarez. He scored 35 goals last season so he would be impossible to replace.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Netherlands national team manager Arnold Muhren has said he is unsurprised by Robin Van Persie’s move to Manchester United]</b> It would have been City or United. I understand his choice. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is one of the biggest clubs in the world. If he wants to win prizes, he has the chance at United, they have a very good team with that new kid from <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> <b>[Shinji Kagawa]</b>, <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a>, Hernandez, <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> and <a href="nani.html">Nani</a>, and the young lads that are breaking through<br /><br />At <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, everything turned around him. At United that’s going to be different. There are some egos at United, so he will have to find his way here. He’s a guarantee for goals, and he makes 20 or 25 a season. If he makes 15, the other players will score more. He came to Old Trafford to win prizes, and I have a lot of faith in that</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> midfielder and Netherlands international Arnold Muhren believes embattled manager <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a> should leave Old Trafford]</b> They let him spend a lot of money. People shouldn’t forget that he also sold some players. But besides that <b>[…]</b> a club like United should play for trophies all the time. There were several moments this year that they didn’t play well and the results were bad as well. If you don’t play well but you win, they think ‘OK but at least we have three points’. But they don’t play good. ‘s also not a stable team. There were so many changings during the season<br /><br /><a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are so big. The club is well known in the whole world so they always have to play for trophies. I think <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a> is a fantastic manager. I think everyone knows that. But if you sign a three-year deal like Van Gaal did. And you say: ‘OK the first year we see how it goes, the second year we have to be at the top four and the third year we’re going to be champions…’ You don’t have that much time at a club like <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. If you sign there you can’t say we have to be there within a couple of years. You have to perform immediately<br /><br /><b>[Muhren believes Van Gaal’s time is up, the 64-year-old feels the English media is making matters worse for the former <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> boss]</b> He always had great successes everywhere but now…The English press complicates his work as well. The journalists are waiting for Manchester to make a mistake so that can write negative things about Louis. I got the impression that it became a sort of a battle between Louis and the press. When I read the English papers I think to myself ‘Oh my God, what is going on there?</p>

  <p><b>[Louis van Gaal was doing a better job than <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, according to former Red Devils player Arnold Muhren]</b> Before <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>, there was <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a>. He also wasn’t so successful. In England, they immediately start to look around to find a better coach but in the end, I think Van Gaal did a better job than what <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> is doing. Yes, <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> won the EFL Cup but that doesn’t mean much, even though he pretends it means a lot. But it isn’t as important as <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup. And for a club like United, it’s not a big deal to win the Europa League final against <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. That’s not so special, is it? They have to win the Europa League, it’s not even the Champions League. That says enough<br /><br />The crowd isn’t that impressed by the way his <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> play. It’s not forbidden like that, to park the bus, but it’s not attractive to watch. I’ve played at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and I know they love to play good, attractive football. It’s not a big deal if you lose a game but at least you have to lose with good, passionate football. The people don’t like it when you lose games and <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> blames the players, the referee, the fans - he always blames someone</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and star Arnold Muhren believes it would make sense for in-demand defender <a href="matthijs-de-ligt.html">Matthijs de Ligt</a> to join Manchester United]</b> <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> have a very good connection with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. A lot of Dutch guys went to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, one or two came from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> to <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. So the relationship is very, very good. De Ligt can play in any team. there are a lot of teams interested in him. I saw the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> game yesterday and they need something at the back desperately because there are one or two players a little bit over the hill. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> need a lot of good defenders and they need De Ligt.<br /><br />I understand <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are willing to spend a lot of money on foreign players and if De Ligt chooses to go to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, it’s of course a very good move for him. But I think they need more players than just De Ligt. They have to rebuild the team</p>
