Of course there is interest, but people tend to rush to conclusions about that<br /><br /><b>[When asked about how he felt being second choice after Paul Pogba]</b> I haven’t heard it being talked about like that, but it could be true. There’s more to it than what’s in the newspapers, but you don’t have to believe everything that is written. There’s always a lot of nonsense.

I play here all season, I finish at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> this year. That gives me clarity and tranquility. I will see what happens next. Maybe someday in my career it will happen that I switch club during the winter break, but now I don’t like it<br /><br /><b>[Real Madrid became interested in his services following that run of form]</b> At a certain point <b>[the transfer saga]</b> all took too long. I don’t read and see everything myself, but others always confront you with it. That does something to you. I’m still young. And even if you are a bit older, I think these things will continue to do something to you. You are a human being. There were so many rumours and so much was said and written. If you keep being on all those front pages, you will see it anyway. I am very happy that it is over, that I can focus on <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and put a thick line under it</p>

These reports about <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> or <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> are a good sign, but it is not important now.

There is no contract. That is the situation. That has not changed throughout the season<br /><br />I don’t want to choose. Both are great clubs, but as I said before, <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> is also a great club. Therefore, there is nothing to choose from. Everything would be very good</p>

I do not know if it is completely finished. I wish him everything and I hope he will do very well there. It is a step he deserves in my opinion. He is a fantastic football player, so I am confident that he will do well. I think it’s a very nice club with a lot of young players that can grow. I think Hakim will certainly be in <b>[the right]</b> place. Everyone, of course, has their opinion about that, but I think it’s a nice club for him</p>

But I also have to fit in with the system that is being played and of course I also want to have an overview of playing minutes. Playing in the sun is always nice. But no, I certainly haven’t started taking Spanish lessons yet. I have not said yes to anyone, everything is still open. I know what I’ve got here, I am loved in <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and I love <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>.</p>
