  <p><b>[Benedikt Howedes has targeted a spot in Germany’s Euro 2016 squad after returning to full training with Schalke]</b> I am in regular contact with the national coach and am confident that I could be involved in the European Championship. The prerequisite for this, of course, is that I am fit and in good shape. After nearly four months out it was a very nice feeling to be back in the pitch with the boys. That I can be involved against Bayer Leverkusen is exciting.</p>

  <p><b>[The wonderkid loved by Pep: Joshua Kimmich is the answer to Germany’s full-back woes]</b> Joshua has played great. It was exactly the right decision by the coach to take him. We were dangerous in the game <b>[going]</b> forward.</p>

  <p><b>[Schalke defender Benedikt Howedes is on the verge of joining Serie giants Juventus. Volker Struth, Benedikt Howedes’ agent, also confirmed a deal was near]</b> Juve wants it, Benedikt Howedes wants it - we have an agreement in principle. Now Schalke must want it, too.</p>

  <p><b>[After playing over 200 games for Schalke, Benedikt Howedes secured one almighty sea change after being loaned to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> in 2017]</b> The year before I came, every player got a Ferrari as thanks for the championship, or if he did not want a car, a monetary bonus in the appropriate amount. That already shows, which level prevails there. Nevertheless, there was no resentment or bragging in the dressing room. The team spirit at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> was phenomenal. I was extremely impressed by how the boys dealt with each other. When I first came into the dressing room, I was really excited. But absolute legends like <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Gigi Buffon</a> or <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Giorgio Chiellini</a> came to me beaming, kissed me left and right and were glad that I was there. That was an overwhelming feeling and blew me away. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> is a big family, and I was completely respected and accepted. Although I did not play much, I was very much appreciated there as a person and a player<br /><br />Although both have already achieved everything and won countless titles, they are still hungry for success. They want to be successful every day. That impressed me. I still remember a pre-match talk from <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a>. Although he only sat on the bench in this game, he gave a very emotional and almost poetic speech. At <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, the team spirit was lived - even by players who sat on the bench. There were no egos, only the team and that was great</p>
