<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Saido Berahino says he would be open to moving back to England after he leaves Zulte Waregem]</b> England is where I first fell in love with football so, yes, if the opportunity arose I would definitely consider it<br /><br />So far I’ve had a great time in Belgium, I’ve showed that I can adapt in a different league. I can only thank my team-mates and coach for believing in me. I miss the atmosphere and the buzz before games that I grew up learning my trade. We take it for granted how passionate and amazing the fans make the game so beautiful</p>
