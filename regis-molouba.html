<blockquote>
  <p>[on Samuel Umtiti] There was a point in which when I saw Samuel play, I told myself ‘this kid can’t stay here, he is already better than everyone. I made my move so that OL would not lose sight of Umtiti.<br /><br />[Lyon struggled to recruit the young Umtiti] They did not have access to Samuel’s guardians. I went to see Samuel’s mother to tell her that her son was good, that Lyon were interested in him and that this was an opportunity they could not let go.<br /><br />I developed a personal program for him and we would work every Sunday from nine in the morning until midday because he did not have to go to school. We would run through the streets of Lyon and we kept that up for a long time, even after signing for Lyon we would work during his school holidays with intensive sessions to prepare for the season ahead</p>
