  <p><b>[I-League 2016’s player of the year Sony Norde is all raring to don the famous Green and Maroon of Mohun Bagan for a third successive season]</b> Sure, very happy that I signed for Mohun Bagan again this season. My family supported me and I hope we get success in the league this time.<br /><br />Sometimes in life, money is important but love is the most important. I have got too much love from Mohun Bagan supporter. Let’s hope for that. That is why Mohun Bagan try to sign the best Indian players to win trophies and us foreign players have to do our best on the pitch and win games<br /><br />I have nothing to prove and will always play my game. I try to win trophies and help my team win even when we are in difficult situations. I hope that my experience <b>[in the Copa America]</b> helps my team. We have <b>[Darryl]</b> Duffy, Jeje <b>[Lalpekhlua]</b>, Balwant <b>[Singh]</b>, Katsumi <b>[Yusa]</b>, Sehnaj <b>[Singh]</b> - all good players. Let’s hope that they can push up and try to win every game. We drew too many <b>[games]</b> last season. We don’t want to repeat the same mistakes<br /><br />The AFC Cup and the I-League</p>

  <p><b>[Sony Norde’s brilliance against Chennai City underlines why it was so important to win without him]</b> You can say I am 50 per cent responsible for Jeje staying at Mohun Bagan. During ISL, he had told me to inform where I will be playing because he was ready to accompany me. When I texted him from Haiti that I will be continuing at Bagan, he threw away East Bengal’s offer</p>

  <p><b>[On Kolkata Derby]</b> I am happy that I could leave a mark in the derby. It was one of the best matches of my career. I have always dreamt of doing well in the derby and I am pleased that I came good today.<br /><br /><b>[When asked why he chose to replicate a sten gun firing action]</b> My wife called me and showed that my infant son was doing that with his little hands. So, that was my way to dedicate the goal to my family, especially the little one<br /><br />I have said that before that we have not won the title yet. A lot is left to do. We have four games remaining and each of them is a final. We have to win all. I cannot take the credit alone. It was a team effort as everyone contributed towards the win. We sealed the fate of the match in the first half after Azhar’s goal, he is the future of Mohun Bagan</p>

  <p><b>[Sony Norde mounts personal ‘Everest’ and leaves mark on Kolkata derby]</b> It was one of the best matches of my career. I have always dreamt of doing well in the derby and I am pleased that I came good today. The player, however stressed that the celebration was not about shooting with a gun. ‘‘My wife had sent me a video this morning of three month old son doing that gesture. I just wanted to emulate him. I am happy that I could leave a mark on the derby.</p>
