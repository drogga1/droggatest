  <p><b>[Lucas Perez showing that Arsenal never needed Jamie Vardy]</b> You learn much more from difficult times than from good times. You need to have gone through some tough times to appreciate the good.<br /><br />When you’re having a good time, make the most of it and appreciate what you’ve got</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Perez’s agent, Rodrigo Fernandez Lovelle, has suggested that it’s logical that the Arsenal striker is unhappy with his situation at the club]</b> Lucas has a contract with Arsenal. We haven’t spoken to AC Milan. It’s logical that someone is unhappy if they do not play - that’s why he’s a professional.</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Perez is confident both he and Arsene Wenger will still be at Arsenal for the 2017-18 campaign]</b> The relationship I have with Wenger is good and I think he will continue, but he has not yet communicated it to anyone. He is a normal person, very accessible, humble. Wenger knows all the people who work at the club and is always willing to help them<br /><br />I had the bad luck to get injured in the first few months and that affected me but today I feel very capable of showing why they signed me. I am trying to take the chances they give until they have 100 per cent confidence in me. The manager is happy that I am in the squad because whenever I play I have done well</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Perez only thinking of Arsenal. Rodrigo Fernandez Lovelle said]</b> It’s not true and we haven’t been talking with anyone. Lucas has three years left on his contract with Arsenal. In the summer when the season is finished we can talk but right now we are only thinking about Arsenal.</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham have completed the signing of Lucas Perez from Arsenal for a reported £5 million fee]</b> I’m very happy to be here at such an historic club. I’m very excited, as West Ham are giving me the chance to stay in the Premier League and I’m very happy to be part of this new project. West Ham have great fans and play in an amazing stadium, so to sign here brings me great joy. I’m very motivated.</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Perez reveals he turned down Barcelona: I didn’t want to make <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> mistake again]</b> In the winter transfer window, like all transfer windows, teams usually call. In fact, not only <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> called, but other teams as well. But in my head, I wanted to end the season here because I am happy and I have a contract. I didn’t want to take another misstep, where I would not have opportunities, as happened to me in England. In no case did I plan to leave mid-season, I want to stay here until the end<br /><br />It is not the first time that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> has called me, like other great clubs. The truth is that that does not distract me. What is clear to me is that I want to do well and I want to feel like a player again as I am doing here, where they have given me love since day one. At the end of the season, what happens, happens. I have a contract with Alaves. I am very settled and I am very happy in Vitoria, and that is reflected on the field<br /><br />The experience has given me an ability to survive all situations outside of Spain and helped me to grow on a personal and football level. It’s something that all players should try</p>
