  <p><b>[Lucas Perez showing that Arsenal never needed Jamie Vardy]</b> You learn much more from difficult times than from good times. You need to have gone through some tough times to appreciate the good.<br /><br />When you’re having a good time, make the most of it and appreciate what you’ve got</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham have completed the signing of Lucas Perez from Arsenal for a reported £5 million fee]</b> I’m very happy to be here at such an historic club. I’m very excited, as West Ham are giving me the chance to stay in the Premier League and I’m very happy to be part of this new project. West Ham have great fans and play in an amazing stadium, so to sign here brings me great joy. I’m very motivated.</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Perez reveals he turned down Barcelona: I didn’t want to make <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> mistake again]</b> In the winter transfer window, like all transfer windows, teams usually call. In fact, not only <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> called, but other teams as well. But in my head, I wanted to end the season here because I am happy and I have a contract. I didn’t want to take another misstep, where I would not have opportunities, as happened to me in England. In no case did I plan to leave mid-season, I want to stay here until the end<br /><br />It is not the first time that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> has called me, like other great clubs. The truth is that that does not distract me. What is clear to me is that I want to do well and I want to feel like a player again as I am doing here, where they have given me love since day one. At the end of the season, what happens, happens. I have a contract with Alaves. I am very settled and I am very happy in Vitoria, and that is reflected on the field<br /><br />The experience has given me an ability to survive all situations outside of Spain and helped me to grow on a personal and football level. It’s something that all players should try</p>
