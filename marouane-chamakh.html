<blockquote>
  <p>[Marouane Chamakh: Whatever happened to Arsenal striker flop? At 33, these would prove to be his last matches as a footballer, though his retirement was only made official when he appeared, sporting a new man-bun] It’s been two years since I made my cut away from football, it was what I wanted. I wanted to get closer to my family. Today, I can say that I have really retired from the game<br /><br />[Chamakh has an interest in politics and has even dabbled in it a touch in the past] I didn’t plan to return to football, either as a pundit or a coach, but I feel that it’s something I miss. So I’ll try to comeback. I want to pass my coaching diplomas. I want to take things step by step and do things seriously<br /><br />[Since then, he has suggested that he could take up a role in the Moroccan FA] Yes, of course. What’s more, I live in Marrakech a part of the time. If they call me, I’ll be there for them. It would be a pleasure to give them my experience, what I’ve learned and been through, to help youngsters or future coaches learn from my experience</p>
