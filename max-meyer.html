  <p><b>[Schalke star Max Meyer has contradicted a club statement and claimed that he was not injured for the weekend’s 1-1 draw with Borussia Monchengladbach]</b> What can I say? I was not injured</p>

  <p><b>[Max Meyer has been suspended by Schalke in the wake of bullying accusations levelled at the club]</b> I was never concerned about the money, otherwise I would have accepted the second improved offer. That’s why I find it a mess for Clemens Tonnies to say it on TV as if it were all about money. I simply did not want to stay with Schalke and work under Heidel. It’s all about this. Lately, it just feels like bullying to me</p>

  <p><b>[Crystal Palace have confirmed the arrival of Schalke youngster Max Meyer]</b> I feel really good and I’m happy to be here. I can’t wait to start training with the team and I hope I’ll have a good season. I’m proud to be here and I hope I can make the next step in my career. I want to give my best and I think we can have a good season - maybe better than the last. I played at Selhurst Park last season for Schalke and the atmosphere was perfect, and I can’t wait to experience the atmosphere for a Premier League game.</p>

  <p><b>[Can the ‘German Messi’ Max Meyer prove his worth at Crystal Palace?]</b> He <b>[Lionel Messi]</b> is my role model. I can learn a lot from him. He is the best player in the world and always remains humble.<br /><br /><b>[Even after turning 18, Meyer continued to live with his parents]</b> I’m happy here because my parents take care of everything for me. I never tidy my room and my mother moans about it all the time, but she’s got to come to terms with it if she wants me to stay at home<br /><br /><b>[Meyer denied the reason he left Schalke was for money]</b> I simply did not want to stay with Schalke and work under Heidel. It’s all about this. It just feels like bullying to me</p>

  <p><b>[Former Schalke midfielder Max Meyer has distanced himself from comments made by his father Achim, who posted a video on social media criticising the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> club while driving a Lamborghini]</b> It doesn’t get any better, man. Through the forbidden city, Gelsenkirchen. Off to the tax consultant. It’s nice with the paid Lambo from the bankruptcy club. Wonderful</p>

  <p><b>[Former Schalke midfielder Max Meyer has distanced himself from comments made by his father Achim, who posted a video on social media criticising the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> club while driving a Lamborghini]</b> I was just made aware of a video from my father. I am deeply shocked by this video. It doesn’t fit in this time, it doesn’t fit in this world, it doesn’t fit in any time. I have Schalke to thank very, very much and I distance myself from the nature and content of the video</p>
