  <p><b>[Hull City midfielder Ryan Mason says he feels lucky to be alive after fracturing his skull against Chelsea earlier this month]</b> I would like to thank everyone for the overwhelming support that has been shown to both me and my entire family over the past week or so. It has been an emotional rollercoaster and I feel lucky to be alive, but I’m happy to say that I’m now at home resting and recovering. My fiancé and family have read so many messages of support to me over the past week. To have had so many people send messages to me, including from fellow players, clubs <b>[in particular the support shown to me from both Hull City and Tottenham Hotspur]</b>, so many fans as well as the support I have received from the general public around the world has been completely overwhelming. Each and every message of support really has given me strength and I cannot tell you how much it means to me. The love and support my mum, dad, sisters, fiancé Rachel and all of my friends and family have shown to me during what has been an extremely traumatic time for all involved has been incredible and I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart for being there for me throughout.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to say a special thank you to all of the medical staff at Hull, as well as the medical team at Chelsea and of course the fantastic treatment and support I have received from all the staff during my stay at St Mary’s Hospital. I will now be taking each day as it comes and concentrating on my recovery</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Mason has praised Mauricio Pochettino for his courage in developing young players]</b> You love playing for him, you’d run through a brick wall for him because he’s a lovely man and a lovely human being. Don’t get me wrong I would never, ever cross him because his morals and values are so strong that if you went away from that it would be hard for him to forget it. But at the same time if you work hard, do what he says right and enjoy your football then he is unbelievable. Probably the biggest thing that I can say about him is that he didn’t just improve me as a player, he improved me as a human being. He just changed my view on life through his values - he’s a big family man, he loves creating friendship and values loyalty. Also when I say he changed my way of life, that way of stressing your brain I believe helped me recover from my injury because, rather than feeling sorry for myself, that experience of being strong mentally with him helped me to change my outlook.<br /><br />You could see how he develops players from day one. I was playing for Swindon in League One six months before he came in but he didn’t care about that, he said to me ‘you’re a Premier League player, if you get fit and train hard you’ll play for me’. There aren’t many managers around in the Premier League or even league football that would be able to see potential like that and then have the balls to develop it and be patient. If you look at the players he’s brought through at Tottenham - they’ve got a great youth set-up with John McDermott - but to actually trust players in the Premier League is amazing. He knows everyone’s name at the club. From the women in the canteen to the groundsmen, he knows everyone and it just helps to create a good atmosphere. When I was in the youth team, I didn’t really see a path into the first team initially because there were managers who didn’t really want to promote youth, they’d rather go out and buy someone. At one point, we had a squad of 26, 27 players and probably 20-odd were internationals and for a youth-team player it was like ‘how am I going to get into that?’ Whereas if you look at the first team now you could see a path into the first team for a 17 or 18-year-old</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Mason on suffering a head injury which forced him to retire from football]</b> If you went through something like this and it didn’t change your perspective on life, you’d be pretty foolish. When you almost die and you’re given a second chance, you find a new level of appreciation for everything you have</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale should join Manchester United or return to Tottenham]</b> Manchester United and Tottenham stick out for me, as they are both clubs looking to get back to that top level. I think Manchester City are recruiting in a way where they recruit young, trying to develop. Bale could play anywhere, but I think for Tottenham it would be a huge statement signing, improve their front line and in wide positions. Why not make him that marquee signing as they move into that new stadium? The type of mentality he has, he’ll be thinking: ‘Where can I go and impact things and win things?’ He’ll want to go and make the rest of his career as successful as possible.<br /><br />On current form and style of play you’d probably say Manchester United. You could argue Tottenham, but they’re so set in their ways, it would be difficult for him to come back. The transition the club have made since he left has been massive, so it would be a totally different football club. He’s won four Champions Leagues, so from his point of view anywhere from Real is a step down. But I’m sure he’s at a stage in his career where he wants to be enjoying his football. He’ll want to go and make the rest of his career as successful as possible</p>
