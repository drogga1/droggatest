  <p><b>[Former adviser Cezary Kucharski says <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a> wanted to join <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> to play alongside <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> before being persuaded to sign for Bayern Munich]</b> At one point in the negotiations, he no longer wanted to sign a contract with Bayern, and wanted <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> instead because <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> played there. I convinced him that he had to be the number one striker at a big club. At <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, he would have prevailed over <a href="karim-benzema.html">Karim Benzema</a> at some point, but I couldn’t allow him to move to a club as a number two given the status he already had at that time. I emphasised this in all discussions, whether it was with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> or <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. It’s funny today, but Lewy really had doubts at the time.<br /><br />That was crucial for me and showed me that Bayern was the safest move for him after his time at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>. He will end his career at Bayern. If I was still his adviser, I would at least advise him to do that. I think only <a href="ruud-van-nistelrooy.html">Ruud van Nistelrooy</a> went to Madrid when he was over 30 years old. Instead, I would concentrate on Bayern to continue breaking record</p>
