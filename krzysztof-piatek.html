  <p><b>[AC Milan forward Krzysztof Piatek says Cristiano Ronaldo would be a dream strike partner, but he is determined to prove himself deserving of the No. 9 shirt at San Siro]</b> When I arrived in Italy, who would have thought that I would have scored more than CR7. But I want to improve and become top scorer. I will do everything to succeed. Nine is an important number for a striker, all the best have it - Robert Lewandowski, Luis Suarez, Karim Benzema, Harry Kane. I am happy because the club believed in my qualities, they told me that I should have the shirt, while I said that I would have fought with all my strength to get it, and I did. I don’t believe in superstition and this curse. For me, nine is normal, everything will be fine like with 19. It’s not scary to me<br /><br /><b>[Piatek said of the managerial movement]</b> Marco Giampaolo is a master of football. I like the 4-3-1-2 because it gives us many offensive solutions. In Italy I have already had four coaches, he is the fifth, but tactically he is certainly the best. Gennaro Gattuso is a legend and also a bit crazy. He loves Milan with all his heart, he has taken on many responsibilities and came to the end tired and drained</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd &amp; <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> offered hope in Piatek pursuit as Milan striker’s father opens transfer door]</b> Kris wants to reach Euro 2020 in good shape and that means he can’t be a reserve sitting on the bench, but wants to be a regular starter. If he can’t do that at Milan, then he’ll gladly do it elsewhere. He is on the transfer market in January, just like Lucas Paqueta, Suso and Hakan Calhanoglu. Many clubs are asking to take him on loan, but Milan want to sell straight away to recover the money they paid Genoa a year ago and reinvest immediately in new players. It’ll all go down to the final week of the transfer window, when his future will be decided</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham target Piatek completes €27m move from <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> to Hertha Berlin]</b> I’m so happy that this transfer got done. The way this club is going really convinced me that this was the right move for me and I’m so excited to play with my new teammates. I want to contribute to this development with plenty of great performances and hopefully lots of goals</p>
