  <p><b>[Who is Krzysztof Piatek?]</b> The fans are fantastic. With the people so close to the pitch, there is a resounding noise. I have got off to a strong start and that’s because the ball comes looking for me.</p>

  <p><b>[Krzysztof Piatek is reading little into talk of interest from Barcelona]</b> I can’t be compared to Lewandowski - he plays for Bayern Munich, myself at Genoa. I don’t think the links with Barcelona are true, even though I’ve heard about it … If I have any secrets, it’s simply that I try to improve, giving my best in training. With the coach Ballardini, we’ve agreed what my position on the field is. I know exactly what I have to do. I asked <b>[Dawid]</b> Kownacki, <b>[Bartosz]</b> Bereszynski and <b>[Karol]</b> Linetty for information before I came here. I already knew it would be a fantastic move for me</p>

  <p><b>[Genoa striker Krzysztof Piatek has proclaimed Cristiano Ronaldo the greatest there has ever been]</b> Cristiano Ronaldo is the best player in the world right now and in my view the greatest there has ever been. At this moment, I am concentrated only on the game with Juventus. It’ll be very difficult, because we are facing the best team in Italy, but we’ll do everything possible. I know Wojciech Szczesny because we are international teammates, while I’ve not met Mattia Perin. I hope Szczesny is in goal on Saturday<br /><br />I am at Genoa now and my focus is only on Genoa. There are still so many games to go this season and I am concentrated on them. I love the Genoa fans</p>

  <p><b>[Milan’s Robocop Krzysztof Piatek has already made fans forget about Gonzalo Higuain]</b> Just sitting here next to legends like <b>[Paolo]</b> Maldini and Leonardo is a huge honour.<br /><br />Milanello is amazing! Everything is of the highest standard. There are six pitches, two heated, one artificial, two gyms, kitchen, dining room, each player has his own room. Amazing place. Every situation and every day provide new impressions. Signing the contract, visiting the trophy room, that is where your jaw drops<br /><br /><b>[When he joined Milan, he made clear his desire to take over the No.9 jersey left behind by Higuain. His request was rejected by the Rossoneri, though]</b> The club decided to take it slowly and hold off for a bit. It has to be a reward for the player who deserves it, to follow in the footsteps of Filippo Inzaghi and Marco van Basten. I was told that I must prove myself first</p>

  <p><b>[Krzysztof Piatek hopes to bring AC Milan back to the lofty heights of their past]</b> If I had all the qualities that the newspapers are talking about, I’d be the best player in history. I hope that Milan will return to greatness thanks to me and that one day I will be really worthy of those comparisons. In my opinion, certain newspapers are exaggerated. I take only a part of those praises. I’m satisfied with the goals, not the fact that thanks to them I am on the front covers<br /><br />I especially like those with whom I sit at the table during meals, that is <b>[Hakan]</b> Calhanoglu, <b>[Tiemoue]</b> Bakayoko, <b>[Lucas]</b> Paqueta, <b>[Franck]</b> Kessie, <b>[Ricardo]</b> Rodriguez and <b>[Fabio]</b> Borini, we have created a real team, Paqueta knows how I want the ball, and he has great technical skills.<br /><br />I left Poland when I was ready for all these challenges from every point of view: physical, mental, technical. I could have done it before, but I preferred to stay for a year longer and I absolutely do not regret it.</p>

  <p><b>[AC Milan striker Krzysztof Piatek has admitted to being a boyhood Arsenal fan]</b> When I was a child I was an Arsenal fan. I loved the style of Wenger and I admired players like Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp.<br /><br />My celebration? I did that after I scored a goal once and from that moment it remained the same. It’s a habit now and it brings good luck so I am not going to change it. I see people go crazy for this celebration here in Italy. I loved Genoa. I had a good time there. I loved the sea, there was good weather and good cuisine</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> forward Krzysztof Piatek says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> would be a dream strike partner, but he is determined to prove himself deserving of the No. 9 shirt at <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a>]</b> When I arrived in Italy, who would have thought that I would have scored more than <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">CR7</a>. But I want to improve and become top scorer. I will do everything to succeed. Nine is an important number for a striker, all the best have it - <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a>, <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a>, <a href="karim-benzema.html">Karim Benzema</a>, <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>. I am happy because the club believed in my qualities, they told me that I should have the shirt, while I said that I would have fought with all my strength to get it, and I did. I don’t believe in superstition and this curse. For me, nine is normal, everything will be fine like with 19. It’s not scary to me<br /><br /><b>[Piatek said of the managerial movement]</b> <a href="marco-giampaolo.html">Marco Giampaolo</a> is a master of football. I like the 4-3-1-2 because it gives us many offensive solutions. In Italy I have already had four coaches, he is the fifth, but tactically he is certainly the best. <a href="gennaro-gattuso.html">Gennaro Gattuso</a> is a legend and also a bit crazy. He loves Milan with all his heart, he has taken on many responsibilities and came to the end tired and drained</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> &amp; <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> offered hope in Piatek pursuit as Milan striker’s father opens transfer door]</b> Kris wants to reach Euro 2020 in good shape and that means he can’t be a reserve sitting on the bench, but wants to be a regular starter. If he can’t do that at Milan, then he’ll gladly do it elsewhere. He is on the transfer market in January, just like <a href="lucas-paqueta.html">Lucas Paqueta</a>, Suso and Hakan Calhanoglu. Many clubs are asking to take him on loan, but Milan want to sell straight away to recover the money they paid Genoa a year ago and reinvest immediately in new players. It’ll all go down to the final week of the transfer window, when his future will be decided</p>

The way this club is going really convinced me that this was the right move for me and I’m so excited to play with my new teammates. I want to contribute to this development with plenty of great performances and hopefully lots of goals</p>
