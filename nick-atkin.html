  <p><a href="justin-gaethje.html">Justin Gaethje</a> is fighting Donald Cerrone in the main event of UFC Vancouver this weekend. But it was a tweet to <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> that has caused a bigger stir. The American called the Irishman a ‘s*** human, father and husband’, responding to <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a>’s demand for a rematch with <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> on social media<br /><br /><a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>’s manager, <a href="ali-abdelaziz.html">Ali Abdelaziz</a>, has shut down any chance of <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> getting another crack at the UFC lightweight champion. ‘The Notorious’ called for a rematch - even suggesting Moscow for the location - after the Russian retained his title with a third-round submission of <a href="dustin-poirier.html">Dustin Poirier</a> in Abu Dhabi last weekend. UFC president <a href="dana-white.html">Dana White</a> suggested a <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> rematch ‘makes sense’ if No 1-ranked <a href="tony-ferguson.html">Tony Ferguson</a> doesn’t want the fight. But <a href="ali-abdelaziz.html">Ali Abdelaziz</a> has shut down that notion<br /><br /><a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> made a grovelling apology on ESPN last month after footage leaked of him punching an elderly patron of a Dublin pub who had refused a shot of his Proper No 12 whiskey. He has made negative headlines this year after smashing a fan’s phone on the ground outside a Miami nightclub</p>

  <p>While the consensus is that <a href="tony-ferguson.html">Tony Ferguson</a> is getting the next crack at <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>, the UFC lightweight champion’s manager caused a stir last week by claiming they’re giving <a href="georges-st-pierre.html">Georges St-Pierre</a> a shot. UFC legend St-Pierre expressed his desire for a dream fight with the Russian before retiring for the second time last year. But he has shot down <a href="ali-abdelaziz.html">Ali Abdelaziz</a>’s talk he could leapfrog Ferguson - who, like Khabib, is on a 12-fight win streak - in the queue</p>

  <p><a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> is no longer ‘the man’ - <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> is. That’s according to UFC president <a href="dana-white.html">Dana White</a>, who told The Boston Globe that the Irishman can no longer call the shots in his division. Once the jewel in the company’s crown, former featherweight and lightweight champion <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> has not fought since a fourth-round submission defeat by the Russian last October 2018 and his demands for a rematch are falling on deaf ears<br /><br /><a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> defended his title at UFC 242 in Abu Dhabi but at one point looked in trouble with interim champion <a href="dustin-poirier.html">Dustin Poirier</a> locking him up in a guillotine.

  <p>UFC: <a href="jon-jones.html">Jon Jones</a> asks <a href="tony-ferguson.html">Tony Ferguson</a> if he’s ‘feeling suicidal’ after callout, then deletes tweet. Light heavyweight champion apologises after being accused of mocking Ferguson’s mental health issues - ‘definitely should’ve used a better choice of words<br /><br />Seemingly blindsided, <a href="jon-jones.html">Jon Jones</a> hit back. ‘Wait, when did this beef start?!? I thought we were cool!! You over there feeling suicidal Tony?’ Jones tweeted. The tweet was deleted around 30 minutes later after drawing heavy criticism from fans, who pointed out Ferguson’s struggles with mental health issues earlier this year.<br /><br />The 35-year-old underwent counselling after his wife filed a restraining order against him in March, citing domestic violence. He reportedly rejected an interim lightweight title shot, which was contested between Max Holloway and <a href="dustin-poirier.html">Dustin Poirier</a>, with UFC president <a href="dana-white.html">Dana White</a> citing ‘personal issues’ for Ferguson’s absence</p>
