  <p><b>[Julian Brandt talks about managing fame]</b> In the end, money is just a number in an account that definitely doesn’t make you a better person. Everyone, including a footballer, has the right to treat themselves to something: a car, a smart watch. You can treat yourself as long as you behave normally with other people. You should say ‘hello’, ‘good day’, and not be snobby</p>

  <p><b>[Julian Brandt’s humility off the pitch is the reason this clause is so low]</b> In the end, money is just a number in an account that definitely doesn’t make you a better person,” Brandt told Bild. “Everyone, including a footballer, has the right to treat themselves to something: a car, a smart watch. You can treat yourself as long as you behave normally with other people. You should say ‘hello’, ‘good day’, and not be snobby<br /><br />I think I still have a lot of potential and I have not reached my ultimate aims in the last few months. I still have room to grow, but I don’t think you can call me a rising star anymore at my age. I have been playing in the Bundesliga for almost five and a half years, but I am still young and can still learn a lot. As I have been here for such a long time, I have automatically taken on some responsibility. You mature over time, so although I am no longer a rising star, you cannot forget that I am still young</p>

  <p><b>[Julian Brandt is enjoying life at Bayer Leverkusen]</b> I’m enjoying myself. I’ve got a contract with Bayer until 2021, so right now all is well. As things stand, I’m staying put. I just want to end the season as best we can.<br /><br /><b>[Leverkusen starred in their most recent outing, claiming a stunning 6-1 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt]</b> That first half was insane. I don’t think I’ve ever seen or experienced anything like that in my life! If someone told us before the game we were going to score six first-half goals, we wouldn’t have believed them. It’s going really well right now</p>

  <p><b>[Borussia Dortmund have completed the signing of Julian Brandt]</b> I am a person who sometimes decides things from the gut and for whom a good feeling is important. In the case of Borussia Dortmund, I have a very good feeling. One of the main reasons for my change is that BVB narrowly missed the title last season, so there is room for improvement and I am very excited about playing with the boys. I am very motivated and optimistic about my personal development but especially the whole team.</p>

  <p><b>[Julian Brandt feels <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> lacked courage during their 4-0 loss to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> in Der Klassiker on Saturday]</b> It happens that we’ve lost, that’s okay. But the way it happened was difficult for me. It’s hard to digest it like that. For everyone it’s okay to lose games. It’s human. Every team is not perfect and you have bad days, that is okay. But that wasn’t so good<br /><br /><b>[Brandt saw attacking colleague <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> hauled off before half-time for a sub-standard display]</b> We just weren’t there that day. Everything was missing. The courage to go up front, the aggressiveness to go into the duels. If you don’t have that in the end, then something like that happens</p>
