  <p><b>[Julian Brandt talks about managing fame]</b> In the end, money is just a number in an account that definitely doesn’t make you a better person. Everyone, including a footballer, has the right to treat themselves to something: a car, a smart watch. You can treat yourself as long as you behave normally with other people. You should say ‘hello’, ‘good day’, and not be snobby</p>

  <p><b>[Philippe Coutinho’s loan move to the Allianz Arena, with a view to a €120m permanent transfer, has been greeted much more positively, with even Borussia Dortmund’s Julian Brandt feeling compelled to celebrate his arrival]</b> Coutinho is an awesome player, I’m a big fan. He was fantastic at Liverpool. I think he played very well at Barcelona, too, even though he was under the microscope a bit more. He’s a real boon for the Bundesliga. I’m delighted that such a player has decided to move to the Bundesliga</p>

  <p><b>[Brandt mentioned a few days ago that <a href="marco-reus.html">Marco Reus</a> had approached him while on international duty and said that he ‘absolutely wanted’ the former Leverkusen man at Dortmund]</b> It triggers something in you when a player like Marco, who has done so well</p>

  <p><b>[Julian Brandt feels <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> lacked courage during their 4-0 loss to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> in Der Klassiker on Saturday]</b> It happens that we’ve lost, that’s okay. But the way it happened was difficult for me. It’s hard to digest it like that. For everyone it’s okay to lose games. It’s human. Every team is not perfect and you have bad days, that is okay. But that wasn’t so good<br /><br /><b>[Brandt saw attacking colleague <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> hauled off before half-time for a sub-standard display]</b> We just weren’t there that day. Everything was missing. The courage to go up front, the aggressiveness to go into the duels. If you don’t have that in the end, then something like that happens</p>

  <p><b>[Julian Brandt adding that the clean sheet also showed the side’s defensive resilience]</b> It was good for us to show that we can stay solid at the back, even in these hard-fought games, which we’re bound to have more of in the future</p>

  <p><b>[Erling Haaland having netted five goals in just 57 minutes of football for BVD]</b> That’s why we signed Erling. The fact that he’s still very young makes it all the more amazing. He is extremely fast and knows how to use his body well. He’s a weapon</p>

  <p><b>[Haaland and <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> benefited from a brilliant Julian Brandt display that steered the title contenders to within a point of leaders Bayern Munich]</b> You have to find a way to make the most of the situation and have fun. What better way to start than with a win? Obviously I’d prefer if conditions were normal, but it is what it is. It wasn’t a perfect performance, but I’m happy after such a lengthy hiatus</p>
