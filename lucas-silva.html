  <p><b>[Lucas Silva hopes to revitalise his Real Madrid career]</b> When I arrived I trained well, started to play and even started in the Champions League, played well and we won. I am motivated and want to play at a high level and win titles. Without a doubt, I think I have the option of returning to Madrid again.<br /><br />I left Europe thinking about resuming my career and having more consistency and rhythm in matches. I didn’t achieve it in my first season, but last year was very good because I played regularly and I was winning titles. It was a very good year. The most important thing is that I’m back playing at a high level<br /><br />After being loaned out I kept in touch with some <b>[players]</b> like Marcelo, Danilo and Casemiro. I was closest to him <b>[Casemiro]</b>. It’s normal that contact is lost as time moves on but whenever there’s a special occasion we speak</p>

  <p><b>[Call it a cliche, but those were the honest words of a wonderstruck Lucas Silva in 2015 when he did what millions fantasise about - signed a contract with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. The Brazilian had been turning heads with Cruzeiro in his homeland and earned his move to Europe on the back of being voted <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>’s best defensive midfielder]</b> I am really happy and motivated. I’ve come to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> to learn and above all else to help. I feel good and am ready to honour this shirt, which belongs to the best club in the world. I’ve liked <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> ever since I was a child. I’m really happy to be in the city and I’m certain that I will live very well here<br /><br /><b>[Two solid, if unspectacular, seasons in Brazil followed, with the now 26-year-old returning to Spain this summer with a year to run on his original Real contract and still hopeful his dream could continue]</b> The truth is that I have a team, and it’s <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. I’m living in a difficult moment because it’s the last year of my contract. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> is a club where there are always high-level players, many of the best in the world. I had difficulties at the start, perhaps because I was very young, and I didn’t have a regular place in the team. I needed to adapt better. Today I’m much more prepared. I played few games in Madrid but, when I did play, I feel I did well. When I started, I didn’t think I did anything wrong. I just want to play. Right now, it’s hard to say where. Spain is one of the possibilities and a league in which I feel ready to play in now. I have more experience and maturity than before, I was able to play at a great level in recent years and I believe today I have the ability to play for any team in the world. My intention is to stay in Europe<br /><br /><b>[Having arrived in Spain with high hopes and plenty of talent, the midfielder now leaves without a club but still determined to make a name for himself]</b> I wish I’d had more opportunities in Madrid, but it just wasn’t possible. It was still a great experience. I learned a lot and with only one year left on my contract, we both decided it was better for everyone to just terminate the deal early. I was considered the best young midfielder in Brazil when I arrived, so naturally I expected it to go differently with Madrid, but I regret nothing and want to think only of the next opportunity. I want to play in Europe, that is my objective, especially if I can get back into the Brazil squad that way. <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> would be perfectly suited to my characteristics and that’d represent a very important move. I was close to Genoa and we were in direct contact, but at the end of the day it wasn’t finalised due to some details</p>
