Taking into account the economic capacity of the club and the amount of the economic operation, this committee is aware that the payment of €300, beyond its merely symbolic nature (the fine is imposed because the issued club has been considered the author of a disciplinary infraction), will not contribute to the sanctioned club in particular and, probably, other clubs that may be in the same situation in the future, adapt their behaviour to what is required by regulation. However, this is not a sufficient reason for this committee to opt for the imposition of a sanction - the closing of the stadium by a party - which, as stated, seems to be intended for infractions of another nature</p>

These images <b>[are]</b> without any sort of technical rigour and offer a distorted view of the play. <b>[It’s a]</b> manoeuvre which creates a social alarm like a loss in confidence in the current VAR provider and in the skill of the Spanish referees.<br /><br />The RFEF wants to make it clear that there can be no confusion and will raise the relevant complaint to international judicial and football organisations to analyse the situation and apply the corresponding measures. We are convinced that these irresponsible actions could lead to serious penalties. Therefore, we urge the LNFP <b>[the Spanish football league]</b> to articulate the necessary mechanisms to cease these types of activities so as not to damage and devalue the image of Spanish football</p>
