Wellington Phoenix players have scored four goals between them across New Zealand’s first two games at the U-20 World Cup in Poland. Nix trio Ben Waine, Sarpreet Singh and Gianni Stensness have all got their name on the score sheet so far at the tournament with the latter scoring a stunner on Tuesday morning</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich have officially signed New Zealand international Sarpreet Singh from A-League side Wellington Phoenix]</b> It is with great joy that I announce I have signed with Bayern Munich for the next three years. Words cannot describe how I’m feeling right now but I’m extremely excited about this opportunity to develop myself further here in Munich and represent my country and New Zealand football. I look forward to getting to know everyone and also learning German</p>

  <p><b>[From New Zealand to India, Sarpreet Singh has quickly become a household name after signing for Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich. At just 10 years of age, it was clear Singh’s football skills were something special - with his mother revealing Everton even expressed interest in him at the time]</b> He has a natural ability for it. He plays other sports at school but he enjoys playing soccer the most. They (Everton) have asked us to send a video of Sarpreet playing. But I’m not sure whether he would be playing here or overseas, and we want to keep him here with us until he’s a bit older</p>

  <p><b>[After playing a key role as the Kiwis reached the knockouts at the 2019 U-20 World Cup in Poland, clubs very quickly began circling for Singh]</b> It’s pretty difficult to turn down an offer from Bayern Munich. I was in Australia when my agent phoned me and I was extremely happy when I heard the news that Bayern were interested in me. It showed me that my development has gone beyond the A-League and it gives me the strength and motivation to go further</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich starlet Sarpreet Singh following <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> model as he learns from <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a> &amp; Coutinho]</b> There are so many examples of players who are small but they are still the best players on the pitch. For me it’s about being smarter and getting around that. I think physical, it’s easy to fix. Technique is a bit harder to fix<br /><br />Learning off the likes of <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a>, Thiago and <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> and these guys, there’s no-one better in the world to learn off. I’m extremely grateful for that and every day I strive to be like them<br /><br /><b>[Singh has taken in just one competitive appearance for Bayern so far]</b> That debut, 80,000 packed out at the Allianz Arena, it’s a truly special feeling and everything I’ve worked hard for kind of paid off. But at the same time, it’s just a start</p>
