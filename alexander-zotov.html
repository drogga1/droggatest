  <p><b>[World Cup boycott is the only way left to punish Russia]</b> I think it’s the only way they can punish Russia now. We already have a lot of sanctions in place against the country. That’s why it’s being attacked. This theme is coming up all the time. It’s something where you can hurt Russia.<br /><br /><b>[On Boris Johnson]</b> I always admired the guy and then all of a sudden he becomes so aggressive in this rhetoric towards Russia. It’s not something that a politician of his level should use. Several years ago, it was not possible that we’d hear something like that but now everybody is trying to speak out in the most aggressive manner as possible. And Boris Johnson outdid himself last week<br /><br />I’m switching on different channels from the UK or from the United States or EU countries and they are all saying Russia, Russia, Russia. It’s Russia all the time. It’s 24 hours, seven days a week. It’s nonstop<br /><br />The world is becoming like a volcano and unfortunately countries are becoming more and more aggressive to each other. There was the same hysteria before the Sochi Olympics that’s happening now. We expected that closer to the World Cup it could be more and more tense. <b>[But]</b> I don’t see any problems with anybody coming; neither the teams nor the fans. The stadiums are getting prepared, the cities are getting prepared and the people are getting prepared. The speculation about Russia’s involvement in a lot of bad things around the world is just creating an atmosphere of fear<br /><br />It’s not like Russia is bad and all the world is good. Issues of geopolitics are happening around the world. You can see the pressure is mounting. Russian diplomats will be expelled from a lot of countries now. And the outcry for boycotting the World Cup is happening every day but let’s see. It’s worrying<br /><br />Russia and the States had more agreements signed during the Cold War than they have now. Now it’s the other way around, all the treaties are being broken. America and Russia are stepping away from all these treaties and this makes the world a more dangerous place. We have to see and find ways to come together and not to run apart and think of each other in terms of prejudice<br /><br />People should get this prejudice out of the way. Come and see for themselves what Russia is and Russians are about</p>
