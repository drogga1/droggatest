Eibar have made Marc Cucurella’s loan from Barcelona permanent after triggering their purchase option following an impressive debut season in La Liga</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Barcelona have taken up the option to re-sign Marc Cucurella from Eibar in €4 million deal]</b> FC Barcelona has made effective the repurchase clause of the player Marc Cucurella, who last season played on loan at Eibar, for 4 million euros. The Basque club exercised their purchase option at the end of the 2018/19 season for a value of 2 million euros. Cucurella left on loan to the Mendilibar team with the aim of gaining experience in the elite of Spanish football. For the Basque side he has played 33 games: 31 of those in league and two in the Copa del Rey. In addition, a player trained in the Barca academy scored two goals, one in each competition. Curiously, the goal he recorded in the league was in the last game of the championship against Barca in Ipurua. In the Cup, he scored in the return match of the round of 32 against Sporting Gijon.</p>

  <p><b>[Eibar fear ‘terrible consequences’ of <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> return]</b> We are afraid to start an activity in which we cannot reach the minimum recommendation of the experts, physical distancing. It unsettles us that, for doing what we love the most, we could get infected, infect our families and friends and even contribute to a new outbreak of the pandemic, with the terrible consequences that would have for the population. The most important thing should be everyone’s health, and it’s the moment that this idea comes to the fore with facts and not only with words. Only with this clear premise would it make sense to return to the competition. We want guarantees. We demand responsibility</p>
