  <p><b>[Penalty-saving hero Mike Maignan the one that got away for PSG]</b> I wanted to be an outfield player with my friends and score goals. In fact, in my head I consider myself as an outfield player. When my team has the ball, I take part in the game and try to give an outlet to my defenders. It’s only when my team loses the ball that I become a goalkeeper again. It’s my job after all!</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a> goalkeeper Mike Maignan has recounted how he once branded <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> a shit attacker when he was a youth on the books of <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>]</b> Even if we’re not in touch today, I like him. He’s honest. He says what he has to say to you to your face. But when you speak to him, you have to be careful, that you’re not too perfect. He had a go a me and I answered him. For some people, it was not normal because I was only 17, but for me it was the right thing to do. He was practising shooting and the ball was going past me at 400km an hour! <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Gianluigi Buffon</a>, Julio Cesar, these guys wouldn’t have stopped those shots. He told me: ‘You’re a shit goalkeeper’. For me, that wasn’t right. The next time, he came back but I stopped his shot. I had to respond: ‘You’re a shit attacker’. He just looked at me and didn’t say anything. Back in the changing room, he stopped me. He told me that it’s good, that he liked what I did and that he liked my personality. I loved him before but it made me like him even more</p>
