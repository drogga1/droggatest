<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Lille goalkeeper Mike Maignan has recounted how he once branded <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> a sh<em>t attacker when he was a youth on the books of Paris Saint-Germain]&lt;/b&gt; Even if we’re not in touch today, I like him. He’s honest. He says what he has to say to you to your face. But when you speak to him, you have to be careful, that you’re not too perfect. He had a go a me and I answered him. For some people, it was not normal because I was only 17, but for me it was the right thing to do. He was practising shooting and the ball was going past me at 400km an hour! <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Gianluigi Buffon</a>, Julio Cesar, these guys wouldn’t have stopped those shots. He told me: ‘You’re a sh</em>t goalkeeper’. For me, that wasn’t right. The next time, he came back but I stopped his shot. I had to respond: ‘You’re a sh*t attacker’. He just looked at me and didn’t say anything. Back in the changing room, he stopped me. He told me that it’s good, that he liked what I did and that he liked my personality. I loved him before but it made me like him even more</b></p>
