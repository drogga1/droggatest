  <p><b>[Bayern Munich winger Serge Gnabry has said he would love to have German team-mate Leroy Sane at the Allianz Arena next season]</b> I would say hello to him with a special handshake. I’ve already asked him about this topic, but he is the only one who can tell us what will happen. I would love to have him in my team. We are getting along really well, also off the pitch. He would help any team and it’s very fun for me to play with him. He would be a real asset for Bayern Munich<br /><br />I’m so ready to go on holidays. This season was quite tough, as we played a lot of games. I missed a couple of games towards the end, due to injuries, but overall, I am happy about meeting the expectations, which is most important to me. I was also happy about getting a lot of minutes and receiving that trust in my first year at Bayern. I just try to improve every day and to help the team</p>

Serge Gnabry on winning Bayern Munich’s Player of the Season award</p>

<p>: 2019 06 22b
Arsenal right-back Hector Bellerin has trolled West Brom and former manager <a href="tony-pulis.html">Tony Pulis</a> on Twitter as he congratulated Serge Gnabry on winning Bayern Munich’s Player of the Season award. Former Baggies boss <a href="tony-pulis.html">Pulis</a> infamously said that the winger was ‘not at the level required’ to play for West Brom after joining on loan from the Gunners in the summer of 2015.</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich’s first pre-season run-out despite slipping to a 2-1 defeat to Arsenal in California. Serge Gnabry who faces his former club]</b> Finally we play football again. After the many training sessions, today’s game was really fun, especially as we took on my former team Arsenal. I was very glad to see my former colleagues and the staff again. Then I saw Mesut Ozil and Hector Bellerin in the dressing room, we teased each other a bit, which was fun of course. Needless to say, I would have like to score. I had a few good chances but the ball just refused to go in. I’ll save it for the upcoming season. Taken altogether it was a really good dress rehearsal, only the late goal was unnecessary. But we can definitely build on the performance</p>

  <p><b>[Serge Gnabry thankful to Arsenal as he targets Champions League triumph with Bayern Munich]</b> Joining Arsenal may have been an extraordinary step for some, but not for me. If a club like Arsenal makes you an offer and says it wants you in the club - with a coach like <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>, who was known to give young players a chance - that’s a great opportunity. I really wanted to take this opportunity. My time in England has shaped me, with all its ups and downs. I would do the same again<br /><br /><b>[Gnabry kickstarted his career in 2016 with a move to Werder Bremen and joined Bayern a year later for a reported €8 million]</b> The move away from Arsenal was because I did not want to line up again and only play in the cup a few times. So I said, ‘Okay, I have to take a step back’. In Bremen I got a lot of playing time. That’s why I enjoyed playing football again<br /><br />Now that I have won the championship and the cup with Bayern, I also want to win the Champions League. This is a dream that I and everyone in the team has. I’m satisfied with my playing time, that’s the most important thing. Over time, I want to slip into a role where, at 24, I can help the boys who come up - the way I was helped</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal were well aware of Gnabry’s potential and were keen to hold on to the Germany international, even after an underwhelming loan spell at West Brom.

I wanted to get more playing time and it worked. Arsenal wanted to keep me, badly. But I had to look after my development</p>

It was definitely a long time ago. I waited one season for my first goal in the Champions League, but I did not dream of four today, that’s something I did not dream of before. I saved the ball.

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich and Germany star Serge Gnabry believes traditional ideas of masculinity are outdated, including when it comes to talking about modern football]</b> For me, it is more important to be a good person than a good man. For me, this is someone who looks out for his environment, who wants good for other people, who is honest and forward-thinking. Gender roles provide orientation. But they also restrict you. Masculinity in the classical sense is not important to me, it’s always about being the strongest. But the topic of ‘New Masculinity’ interests me a lot. For me, new masculinity means freedom, openness and respect for individual ways of life<br /><br /><b>[He says his guidance as a man and a footballer helped him avoid bad influences and develop an openness and honesty about his thoughts and feelings]</b> If my team lost a really important game, I cried in front of him. Once, when he was our coach and shouted at me for mistakes of my teammates. But that made me harder. That’s what characterizes you for life. You can handle criticism better. My dad has accompanied my whole career and has always been there for me. Through football we have a mega-tight bond. He is a role model for me.<br /><br />In competitive sports, it is often presented as a weakness when we talk about pressure, when we reveal our feelings, what we really think and feel. But every person has weaknesses and fears. This is often forgotten because, like machines, we always have to accelerate, always have to perform. If we talked more about feelings, things would change. It would be clear that we are only human, that we make mistakes, that it can’t always go well. Maybe this would be a way to escape the pressure, to perform anew, to react anew and to have a different self-confidence</p>

  <p><b>[Serge Gnabry feels team-mate <a href="thomas-muller.html">Thomas Muller</a> deserves to be shown some respect amid reports he could be on his way out of <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> in January]</b> Normally I shouldn’t say anything about it. But when a player has been with one club since his childhood, then a <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> without <a href="thomas-muller.html">Thomas Muller</a> is difficult to imagine. It is easy to relate with every player who does not play and who is angry about that. This is normal. You don’t have to make the whole thing bigger than it is. Thomas has got his qualities and has won everything. You have to have respect for him and must not ask stupid questions or spread negative news about him<br /><br /><b>[Gnabry has more than helped to fill the void by scoring 10 goals in 11 appearances for the senior side]</b> I’m having a great run right now. It takes a lot of work, the right attitude. You cannot rest. The good environment here helps me a lot. The mood is relaxed-casual. I want to do my best in every game. You have to prove yourself again and again. If I were to play three games, surely someone else would get my playing time. That’s why I’m trying to focus on maintaining my performance</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich star Serge Gnabry has opened up on his life at Arsenal]</b> He used to always be so hard on me, but in a really good way. He was like an older brother for me at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, and no matter how well I played, or how hard I worked, he used to say. O.K., hang on! Because this part is not going to make sense unless you really know Per. You have to hear his voice. You have to see his face. Per is the nicest guy in the world. But he’s also the most German guy in the world. Like everything he says, it’s so intense. Like he’s so tall, and he’s looking down at you trying to be intimidating but it’s also kind of friendly. I don’t know if there’s an English word for it. Imagine like a really friendly Arnold Schwarzenegger or something. That’s Per. And no matter what I did in training, he would come up to me afterwards and start yelling, like: ‘Serge, remember where you come from! You are from Stuttgart! Humility, humility, humility! Serge, you think you’re good now, huh? You must be humble! Humility</p>
