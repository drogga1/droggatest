  <p><b>[Former Arsenal midfielder Serge Gnabry has revealed that the club were desperate not to sell him]</b> It was the right decision <b>[to leave Arsenal]</b>. Everybody who compares my development over the last four months to my time in England before that can’t come to a different conclusion. That was the main reason for the transfer - I wanted to get more playing time and it worked.​ Arsenal wanted to keep me, badly. But I had to look after my development. If a player does not perform well, a club has no sympathy and they do not want to keep him</p>

  <p><b>[Serge Gnabry has refused to rule out a return to Premier League football just five months after departing English shores for Werder Bremen]</b> For my future, I’ve decided to focus on how I play now and today. That’s why I’m trying to concentrate on the now. As of today, I do not intend to change in the summer. But what happens in the future depends on my performance. What if Chelsea or Arsenal come knocking? Well, at the moment I’m trying to give everything to Werder.<br /><br /><b>[On Per Mertesacker]</b> Per has had a career unlike many footballers. He has enough experience to decide his future. Because he’s a good buddy of mine, I’d be happy to play with him, of course</p>

  <p><b>[Serge Gnabry has pointed to Mesut Ozil as his favourite team-mate]</b> I’ve already played with many good guys. But, if I have to highlight one, I take Mesut Ozil. The kind of quality I have seen in his training and in the games at that time was amazing.<br /><br /><b>[On Joshua Kimmich]</b> He has a great sense of humour that is contagious. He is also extremely ambitious. Not only in the game, also in everyday life. We have known each other since we were 12 years old and played together in the youth of Stuttgart. We are good friends. That we are playing together is just great<br /><br />The respect is definitely there, especially off the field. On the pitch, Franck and Arjen give their best as I do, Kingsley Coman or Alphonso Davies. They also help us with their experience. This is important for young players. In the end, it’s up to the coach who plays on the weekend. Of course you can see why Franck and Arjen have been at this level for so long and have developed the club</p>

  <p><b>[Serge Gnabry says the public has reason to back Liverpool]</b> I do not think the public is wrong. Liverpool is playing a very strong season, you cannot deny that. That’s okay. But that does not mean that we go into the game and say, ‘There is nothing to get.’ On the contrary: We have our strengths, we are Bayern. Everything is possible.<br /><br />Georginio Wijnaldum. When I watch Liverpool games, he’s everywhere. He works in the background, bridging the spaces between defence and midfield and has a very large impact on the Liverpool game<br /><br />It has been seen that you cannot afford fails in the Bundesliga. Of these we have had too many lately, we conceded too many goals. We have to turn that off. Liverpool mercilessly exploits such mistakes with its three fast offensive players</p>

  <p><b>[Asked about his duel with Andy Robertson after the game]</b> I think it was a good battle - it was fun. Hopefully next time I will go past and score. An away goal would have been nice for us but I think we’re happy with our performance. Coming to Anfield is never easy. We needed to take the pressure of their front three. We know that they’re a counter-attacking team so for us to move the ball at the back was very important, and also to keep the ball in midfield and not let them break through was important<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether he felt the results was fair]</b> I think it was fair. Liverpool in the first half had a couple of chances, not really by playing. They were just lucky to get the second ball and I think there was a back-kick from <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane. But in the end it was a fair result to have 0-0</p>

Team sport is always more important than individual performance. Accordingly, it is important to get both titles at the end.<br /><br /><b>[Having taken in 40 appearances and recorded 13 goals]</b> Taking on responsibility, playing every week and having the rhythm feels very good. I came with the goal of getting games. That’s what I’ve been working for from the beginning and that’s the way it should stay<br /><br /><b>[Gnabry added on Kovac]</b> He gave me the trust. I try to repay this confidence with hard work during the week and good performances in the games<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on the speculation which surrounds a managerial post in Munich]</b> That’s a topic in the media.

  <p><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> and Germany star Serge Gnabry believes traditional ideas of masculinity are outdated, including when it comes to talking about modern football]</b> For me, it is more important to be a good person than a good man. For me, this is someone who looks out for his environment, who wants good for other people, who is honest and forward-thinking. Gender roles provide orientation. But they also restrict you. Masculinity in the classical sense is not important to me, it’s always about being the strongest. But the topic of ‘New Masculinity’ interests me a lot. For me, new masculinity means freedom, openness and respect for individual ways of life<br /><br /><b>[He says his guidance as a man and a footballer helped him avoid bad influences and develop an openness and honesty about his thoughts and feelings]</b> If my team lost a really important game, I cried in front of him. Once, when he was our coach and shouted at me for mistakes of my teammates. But that made me harder. That’s what characterizes you for life. You can handle criticism better. My dad has accompanied my whole career and has always been there for me. Through football we have a mega-tight bond. He is a role model for me.<br /><br />In competitive sports, it is often presented as a weakness when we talk about pressure, when we reveal our feelings, what we really think and feel. But every person has weaknesses and fears. This is often forgotten because, like machines, we always have to accelerate, always have to perform. If we talked more about feelings, things would change. It would be clear that we are only human, that we make mistakes, that it can’t always go well. Maybe this would be a way to escape the pressure, to perform anew, to react anew and to have a different self-confidence</p>

It takes a lot of work, the right attitude. You cannot rest. The good environment here helps me a lot. The mood is relaxed-casual. I want to do my best in every game.
