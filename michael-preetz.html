We have already talked about a contract extension with him and we’re hopeful he will sign a new deal. He will turn 18 in April 2011 and is then able to sign a new deal</p>

We asked him if he would be willing to help us and the talks were very pleasant.

  <p><b>[Marko Grujic is being tipped to star for Liverpool in the future]</b> We were able to convince them that Hertha is the right next step in their careers. Javairo came from Manchester City’s Under-23s and showed during the first months his great skills and individual quality - until he got injured in November during his debut for the Netherlands against Germany. We hope he will be back for the last matches of the season. And Marko is an example of a player with quality that we can usually not afford. But we can get him for one or two season on loan. And in the future he will be a real asset for Liverpool. The question is when Jurgen Klopp sees him at that level. He is already helping us, so we would like to keep him. But that decision will only be made after the season<br /><br />Hertha is my favourite. I would love to stay here longer. And if Liverpool ever wanted to sell me and I could decide, it would be great if Hertha made an offer. Most of all my self-confidence has increased due to the match practice. My defensive behaviour has also improved a lot because of the games. Of course it would be great to be there <b>[Liverpool]</b>. But for the development of my career at this time it is much more important to always be in the starting XI than to be mentioned by name</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Klinsmann</a> appointed <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha Berlin</a> head coach until end of the season after Ante Covic dismissal]</b> It was an extremely difficult decision for us, because Ante has been part of <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha</a> BSC for more than 20 years. He has conducted himself with a lot of passion, expertise and meticulousness ever since he took over as head coach of the first team in the summer. We regret that it has come to this, but ultimately, in terms of development and recent results, we felt there was a need for action. I would like to thank Ante for his commitment and in time we will talk to him about alternative ways for him to be involved with <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha</a> BSC</p>

It has been agreed by both clubs that he will return to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. The conclusion of this loan agreement over the past two years is very positive and it has had positive effects on everyone who has been involved. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will get back a player who is definitely more experienced than he has been before, because he earned very important game practice. And we also had profit out of this past two years with Marko. Marko is a player who is present in both penalty boxes. Just in his first year he played extraordinary. Now after the restart he is getting back into his good shape. He is just a very good player. So for me this loan agreement definitely made sense</p>
