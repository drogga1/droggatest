  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen After Hertha Berlin Starlet Nico Schulz]</b> We don’t really care what clubs are interested in signing him. He still has a contract with Hertha until the summer of 2012 and we want to hold on to him at least until then. We have already talked about a contract extension with him and we’re hopeful he will sign a new deal. He will turn 18 in April 2011 and is then able to sign a new deal</p>

  <p><b>[Rehhagel is expected to take over the capital club until the end of the season in an attempt to steer the side away from the relegation zone]</b> We are currently in a difficult situation and have come to the conclusion that we need an experienced coach like <a href="otto-rehhagel.html">Rehhagel</a> to achieve our goals by the end of the season. We asked him if he would be willing to help us and the talks were very pleasant. Anyone who knows <a href="otto-rehhagel.html">Otto Rehhagel</a> knows he lives for football, still has the burning desire and is very charismatic</p>

  <p><b>[Klinsmann appointed Hertha Berlin head coach until end of the season after Ante Covic dismissal]</b> It was an extremely difficult decision for us, because Ante has been part of Hertha BSC for more than 20 years. He has conducted himself with a lot of passion, expertise and meticulousness ever since he took over as head coach of the first team in the summer. We regret that it has come to this, but ultimately, in terms of development and recent results, we felt there was a need for action. I would like to thank Ante for his commitment and in time we will talk to him about alternative ways for him to be involved with Hertha BSC</p>

  <p><b>[Preetz happy Boateng brothers are interested in returning to Hertha Berlin]</b> It’s nice to hear that the two still have such a close connection to Berlin and Hertha BSC. These are boys from Berlin and both have achieved a great deal in their careers and have seen the world. It is totally understandable that I will be drawn back home to this great city at some point and I am very happy</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool have been assured <a href="marko-grujic.html">Marko Grujic</a> will return to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> as a more complete player following two years on loan at Hertha Berlin]</b> It is 100 per cent certain that the loan agreement between us and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and the contract with <a href="marko-grujic.html">Marko Grujic</a> will end on June 30. It has been agreed by both clubs that he will return to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. The conclusion of this loan agreement over the past two years is very positive and it has had positive effects on everyone who has been involved. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will get back a player who is definitely more experienced than he has been before, because he earned very important game practice. And we also had profit out of this past two years with Marko. Marko is a player who is present in both penalty boxes. Just in his first year he played extraordinary. Now after the restart he is getting back into his good shape. He is just a very good player. So for me this loan agreement definitely made sense</p>
