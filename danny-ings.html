  <p><b>[Ings credits <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s medical team, led by physio Matt Konopinski, who now works under <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> at Rangers, for his recovery]</b> They saved me. The effort they put into me, without that detail - that is the reason I am back in this shape now<br /><br /><b>[Reluctantly, he accepted that if he was to return to the top level, he would have to leave <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>]</b> It hurt. But I just knew I had to go and make a name for myself and be the player I wanted to be<br /><br />I feel I am in a better place mentally this year. I came back in pre-season better physically than when I arrived here <b>[at <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>]</b>. I’m here and enjoying my football again. I feel absolutely loved by the fans and my team, so all of that helps. Any striker will tell you that when they’re enjoying football and having fun, it brings out the best in you</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Ings scored twice as <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> piled the pressure on struggling <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> with a 3-1 victory at Vicarage Road on Sunday]</b> To be honest, no. I just want to play as many games and score as many goals as I can for the team. I’m fortunate enough to be up and around it now and hopefully I can keep building on that and score some more. After the last game (defeat to Arsenal) we were very disappointed really and it was important we came here today and did something about that, and I thought the lads were fantastic</p>
