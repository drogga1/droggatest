  <p><b>[Burnley striker Danny Ings is hopeful he can find form in the Premier League and make a push for a place in the England squad]</b> If you’re scoring goals for your club in the Premier League, doors open. It’s happened to him <b>[Saido Berahino]</b> and fair play to the lad, he’s a fantastic striker and a great finisher. Hopefully I’ll be able to follow in his footsteps so maybe in the future, you never know.</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Ings is focusing on his return to fitness at Liverpool as transfer speculation swirls around him]</b> If you dwell on things too long, you’ll never make it back. You need to obviously be hurt for a while but then you need to get your head down, focus and crack on. That’s always been my mentality. There wasn’t really any other choice. For now it’s just to get as healthy as I can, get as strong as I can and get fit, and to integrate with the lads as soon as possible and just build from there. Timescale-wise I’m unsure but I’m feeling closer and closer every day. I’m not setting any big targets. I’m trying to accomplish small things at a time..</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Ings says that the quality of Sadio Mane has been emphasised by the fact he has been deemed to have had a poor season]</b> For anyone’s ‘bad’ season, that’s extremely good! There’s no such thing as a bad season for him, he has been absolutely brilliant. He is so sharp; when he faces anybody up in a one-v-one situation you fancy him every single time. His runs in behind, his intelligent movement coming short, inside and helping Robbo get down the outside - they’re the sort of things that go unnoticed sometimes. From the outside looking in, it’s about goals and assists. He gets all of that, all of our front three do. But it’s the movement and work-rate that really catches my eye.</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Ings admits he will miss Liverpool]</b> There is a part of me that will miss them, as Liverpool is a club of such magnitude. I was part of a squad that reached the Champions League final last year. But the feeling <b>[of being important]</b> is something I’ve craved for a long time. I want to show people what I can do again.<br /><br />There are a lot of unbelievable footballers in this country. They did so well in the World Cup and have really come on under Gareth <b>[Southgate]</b>, so it is going to be difficult to ever make a squad again. If one day it happens, I’ll be over the moon. That will almost feel like a great comeback story. I don’t want to be a guy that has got one cap. I have had lots of hurdles to overcome and now feel I’ve got over the last hurdle. I’m just working as hard as I can now to try and get another moment someday. Hopefully one day it will happen. I’m back in a happy place</p>

  <p><b>[Ings credits <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s medical team, led by physio Matt Konopinski, who now works under <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> at Rangers, for his recovery]</b> They saved me. The effort they put into me, without that detail - that is the reason I am back in this shape now<br /><br /><b>[Reluctantly, he accepted that if he was to return to the top level, he would have to leave <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>]</b> It hurt. But I just knew I had to go and make a name for myself and be the player I wanted to be<br /><br />I feel I am in a better place mentally this year. I came back in pre-season better physically than when I arrived here <b>[at <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>]</b>. I’m here and enjoying my football again. I feel absolutely loved by the fans and my team, so all of that helps. Any striker will tell you that when they’re enjoying football and having fun, it brings out the best in you</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Ings scored twice as <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> piled the pressure on struggling <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> with a 3-1 victory at Vicarage Road on Sunday]</b> To be honest, no. I just want to play as many games and score as many goals as I can for the team. I’m fortunate enough to be up and around it now and hopefully I can keep building on that and score some more. After the last game (defeat to Arsenal) we were very disappointed really and it was important we came here today and did something about that, and I thought the lads were fantastic</p>
