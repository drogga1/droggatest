  <p><b>[Win over Sweden would be ‘gold dust’ for Ireland]</b> Sweden are no mugs, make no mistake about that. Our Under-18s just lost <b>[4-1]</b> to them <b>[on Saturday]</b>, but that’s the beauty of the international game. There are times we will perform and get the win. Four teams get out who finish in third place. If we get a win, that’s gold dust. If we start with a win, then we’re there.<br /><br />Now they’re in to the waiting game, which can be difficult. You have 23 different types of people. You can have tension, it can be jovial, and managing that can be difficult. <b>[Giovanni]</b> Trapattoni was very strict, very severe. The old Italian way. I’m not sure how Martin and Roy will behave. If they have a relaxed attitude and allow people to have a drink, that’s one way of doing it. The difficulty for people is being away from their family. Being away is hard to get used to. It’s six to eight weeks.<br /><br />People who are playing and know they’re playing are confident. But people who aren’t playing, it’s a long two months. Then you have the different lads in the squad and the staff as well. If you want to deal with it as manager, make sure you have good staff to delegate</p>

  <p><b>[Future looks bleak as Ireland approach the end of an era]</b> There’s a lot of talent coming down the road. Maybe not at the age of Callum, but at younger ages, there’s plenty of players over in England with potential. Take Josh Cullen, who has played for West Ham this year. He’s only 19, he’s one for the future. You have Alan Browne with him. There are players out there. We have no Messis. We don’t have players who’ll come through to the top four teams.</p>
