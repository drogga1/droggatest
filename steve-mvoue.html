  <p><b>[Africa Cup of Nations: 17-year-old Steve Mvoue targets Cameroon spot]</b> I know if I put in the effort I can be part of the team. I feel great joining the national team. It’s an honour and all my life I’ve worked hard for this. Now I have to prepare for this. It’s a new opportunity and I have to work hard<br /><br /><b>[He is the son of Regine Mvoue, the first captain of Cameroon’s women’s football team, and his older brother Stephane Zobo is currently on the books of French <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> side Toulouse]</b> I wasn’t approached by anyone from the technical staff. I know that my performances with the under 17 and 23 teams are the reason why I have this call up. I need to work hard to deserve the coach’s confidence</p>

  <p><b>[Cameroon’s Mvoue more than a famous name]</b> I was delighted to be named player of the tournament but what really thrilled me was winning the African title. I wouldn’t have won that individual award without the team. Obviously I’m proud of it, but if I’m going to become a great player I know that I’ve still got a long journey and a lot of work ahead of me<br /><br /><b>[Acknowledging the central role that she continues to play in his career]</b> She’s my role model and it’s thanks to her that I play football. She still coaches me every day as well<br /><br /><b>[Indomitable Lions head coach <a href="clarence-seedorf.html">Clarence Seedorf</a> called up the prodigy this May, making him the first 17-year-old to form part of the national team set-up since a certain <a href="samuel-eto-o.html">Samuel Eto’o</a>]</b> I got a great welcome. I’d met Zambo Anguissa, Ambroise Oyongo, Jack Zoua and <a href="andre-onana.html">Andre Onana</a> before and that made it easier for me to settle in<br /><br /><b>[But as he waits for his senior debut, Mvoue Jr will once again run out for the U-17s at Brazil 2019]</b> I get a lot of pleasure playing for this team. We are warriors and we never give up, which is the very least you have to do if you want to succeed in a tournament like the U-17 World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[Cameroonian midfielder Steve Mvoue confirms summer move to Toulouse]</b> I have chosen TFC, because it is a club that knows where I have come from. I had trials with <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, Lens, Monaco and Toulouse. Other clubs were interested in me joining you. It is my agent who dealt with all that. I chose Toulouse, because it is a bit the club that knows where I have come from. My first trial here occurred back in 2017. I came back in 2018 and 2019 where I did pre-season. Since, I have come to train here from time to time. It is a club where I feel good, where I know people. These elements motivated me to sign here<br /><br /><b>[He also confirmed that <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> is his idol]</b> My model is <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>. I am technical, I have good vision and read the game well, a strong shot and athletic capacities. My weak points? I still need to improve a lot tactically and in my concentration. The coaches who have already rubbed shoulders with me in Toulouse have been making me work on that</p>
