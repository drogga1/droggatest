In the <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> games everyone’s been very happy with the situation because we’ve played very well - we’ve passed the ball just as people expect <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to, but when we’ve lost the ball you can see that everyone has been closing it down so quickly</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> midfielder Alex Song shocked after Sion sacking]</b> We played a friendly on Friday (March 20) and we were supposed to meet with the president on Monday, then on Tuesday, he said. We had no news. We received a WhatsApp message on Tuesday afternoon to tell us that everyone had to sign a paper telling us that we were being lowered our wages, that we were going to be paid around 12,000 euros. We were to return the paper the next day at noon. We received this document without explanation<br /><br />I am a footballer, it is not my job. There are people to verify that. I couldn’t sign it, we didn’t have any discussions. All the clubs are talking today. Our captain didn’t know anything. We decided together not to sign this document. We wanted to talk. I did not make any professional misconduct. All the clubs talk to their players to find solutions. We do not understand what happened. No one can understand</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Song explains <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> exit to become a millionaire]</b> When <a href="barcelona-fc.html">FC Barcelona</a> offered me a contract and I saw how much I would earn, I didn’t think twice about it. I thought my wife and children should have a comfortable life. I met the sporting director and he said I wouldn’t play many games, but I didn’t give a sh*t. I knew I was going to be a millionaire<br /><br />I was going to training <b>[at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> and I saw <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> arriving in a magnificent car. I told myself that I wanted the same car at all costs. I went to the dealership and bought the same one. But I had to return it after two months because all my money was being spent on petrol</p>
