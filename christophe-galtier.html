  <p><b>[Christophe Galtier talks about his former protege Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang]</b> Even though up until then things hadn’t gone that well for him, I saw one thing in the first training session: he was able to beat anyone with the ball at his feet with a run of 60 metres<br /><br />If I had had him another season, he would have played as a central striker, because he had found something that he hadn’t had before: a lot of sang froid in front of goal<br /><br />He didn’t have that when he arrived to us, and it came through hard work. He asked for training sessions to help himself with that. His greatest quality is humility. He has a lot of humility, respect, and he has something else: when he hasn’t done something right in a match, he asked to do it again in training, to change how he had done it, and do it right.</p>

  <p><b>[Lille boss Christophe Galtier has already admitted that he fears his side are becoming too reliant on <a href="victor-osimhen.html">Victor Osimhen</a>, a youngster, who is fast becoming their talisman]</b> We were too gentle offensively. We’ve not played to win. It’s as if the players are resting on Victor. He’s started at a very high level. I hope for him and the team it continues. In general, when a team has a good season, one player is a revelation. And, automatically, when an attacker is decisive regularly, the team is powerful</p>

  <p><b>[Lille boss angry at <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> for taking coaches to Tottenham]</b> Everyone has their own way of doing things. It’s very classy, anyway, very classy to act like that. I was angry; the timing isn’t good. There are ways to do things. Regardless, what matters is that I agree with the decision of the president <b>[Gerard Lopez]</b>. I have also been in a deputy role. They were asked, they believe in this project, they want to go. That’s football today.<br /><br />My president and <a href="luis-campos.html">Luis Campos</a> could not do anything to keep two people who couldn’t stay in this project. We’re not in the world of the Care Bears. I learned it by phone from my president on Tuesday night. He told me about the situation. I didn’t see anything coming. We were preparing normally for the match in Paris.<br /><br />He explained it to me, and I understood. I would have done the same thing. If staff want to go to another project, it takes so much investment that if your head is 10 per cent elsewhere, you’re doomed to failure. Galtier certainly does not expect Campos to follow his former coaching staff to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, though. Luis is 200 per cent invested in the project <b>[at Lille]</b> and I don’t see a 1000th of a wish to look elsewhere. We’re close and looking forward</p>

Each person has his own way of doing things. I don’t know if it was a knife in the back, but it’s very classy to do things like that. The timing isn’t good. To be totally transparent, my president informed me of the situation and told me he would let Joao and Nuno go. That’s how football is these days.

  <p><b>[Lille boss Christophe Galtier spoke out about what he views to be a screen time pandemic in today’s society]</b> We are in a generation, a society even, where there is a terrible addiction to screen time, to social media and to mobile applications. It is the heroine of the 2020s. I am convinced, because I read a lot and I have a lot of discussions, that there is an addiction to screens, and that these screens can make you tired or generate problems with concentration and in the preparation for a match. Recently we took a decision, after consulting the players, that one hour before kick-off there are no more telephones or screens in the dressing rooms. So about 25 minutes before going out for warm-ups. I am almost convinced that there is going to be a significant development in the seasons to come, that as soon as players enter the dressing rooms, they will be in a screen-free zone</p>

  <p><b>[Lille head coach Christophe Galtier has admitted that he is resigned to losing striker <a href="victor-osimhen.html">Victor Osimhen</a> and centre-back Gabriel over the course of the summer transfer window]</b> I can confirm that both Gabriel and Victor are likely to depart. I’ve expected it for a long time. They are working very seriously and we’re working currently with the players who are currently here who are likely to replace them and obviously on future players who will come to us to replace them in their posts. We’ve not talked much about the transfer window. Players have been or are being contacted. There will be a delayed transfer window. I believe it will run until October 5. That shows how complex the start of the season will be. I don’t know exactly when the windows will be open abroad<br /><br />People didn’t believe that we had such big offers for Pepe. Let me tell you that with <a href="victor-osimhen.html">Osimhen</a>, it’s the same thing.<br /><br /><b>[Galtier reported some positive news for Lille in terms of the players who were running out of contract, with former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> striker Loic Remy closing in on a new deal along with ex-Southampton man Jeremy Pied, who was a bit-part player last term]</b> There’s a very good chance they will stay with us. They want it and we want it. We’re close to an agreement, but it’s not done yet</p>
