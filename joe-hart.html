  <p><b>[England vs Estonia]</b> I feel there is a great belief in the squad. We feel good. We have picked ourselves up. We were disappointed a couple of summers ago but life goes on. We had a two-year plan after that. We’re 12 months into that and then it is all about next summer. Winning 10 qualifying games wouldn’t crown everything, winning the tournament itself would do that. It isn’t that good an achievement unless we go on and win the whole thing.</p>

He’s 21, he’s fully aware of that and he’s going to get better. And he’s excited. He’s an exciting footballer, someone I enjoy working with and I really want to do well. He was really good <b>[on Sunday]</b>. He got kicked to pieces because they couldn’t deal with him, simple as that. I think maybe in a <b>[European]</b> Championship game a few of them would have been walking a lot tighter rope than they were. But it was good. I was excited to see it. It was tough for Raheem towards the end of the season - he wasn’t starting games - that’s gone and it’s a fresh chapter.<br /><br />It’s definitely a bonus. A fit and firing Raheem Sterling can change games</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Hart reveals why he left <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> Football is a game of opinions and some people have a great opinion of me and some people probably think I’m absolutely useless. Unfortunately for me, one of the guys’ opinions in charge of my club at the time wasn’t as strong as it needed to be<br /><br />Some people you struggle to argue with, they’ve got a lot of strong backing to what they say and what they do. It’s hard to please everyone and I learnt quite early that that’s never going to happen<br /><br />I had a situation at City where my playing time was going to be limited, so I had to look elsewhere. I’m not going to lie, I wasn’t sat there with 25 options. I felt like <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino FC</a> was the best option for me and it was pretty quick. I wasn’t given much time so when that opportunity came, I was really grateful<br /><br /><b>[So is it a realistic goal to go back to City?]</b> I’m at <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a> for the season and it’s hard to look past these <b>[England]</b> internationals. How this season plays out, or what comes of it, will be however it ends up. I’m at <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a> with huge commitment to the club, huge commitment to the season, the culture, the football and I’m going to give it my all. Whatever happens, happens.<br /><br />I need to improve all the time because I’m still learning the game and the game is changing all the time. I love trying to improve. I love that challenge. I want to keep developing until I physically can’t.<br /><br /><b>[Hart is hoping to impress interim England manager <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a>]</b> There’s always a threat to my place that’s very evident because we’ve got some fantastic keepers. Tom <b>[Heaton]</b> and Fraser are performing brilliantly in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> from what I’ve seen. Sunderland aren’t doing well as a team but Jordan <b>[<a href="jordan-pickford.html">Pickford</a>]</b> is doing well. So there are good keepers everywhere you look and you can’t rest. There is never that feeling. Right from playing under-14s at Shrewsbury Town, you’ve got to be aware of your surroundings<br /><br /><b>[Hart has now played under four managers with England, with <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> the latest appointment following the dismissal of <a href="sam-allardyce.html">Allardyce</a>]</b> I think it’s definitely down to us to create an identity of the team that we are trying to be. Win, lose or draw, I think we need an identity of why we won, why we lost, why it didn’t go very well. I’ve never been looking too far ahead. It’s always been the future and the present and the near future.<br /><br />Gareth is the England manager. He has come in and set a really good example. He’s had a lot of work with <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> previously. Asking the 21 lads what Gareth is like as a manager, <b>[there]</b> couldn’t be a more positive reaction. From what I’ve seen, I am excited to work with him</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Hart believes Yaya Toure could make the difference in Manchester City’s Premier League title bid]</b> It’s great for him. It’s been a situation that’s been played out pretty much worldwide, but it looks like he’s stayed focused and he’s come back into the team and he’s been important. Yaya’s a special player. I played with him for years, he’s got the ability to win you matches and win you leagues. Whatever’s going on behind the scenes looks like it’s sorted and he can get on with playing his football.<br /><br /><b>[Asked when he became aware he would have to leave City]</b> Probably at the start of the Premier League season. I was aware of it, that it was a strong possibility, but it was confirmed towards the end of August. It didn’t leave me much time but I managed to find a solution and here I am<br /><br />I’m never going to tell anyone what to do but if you want to speak about my experience I’ve enjoyed what I’ve done. It’s certainly new. It’s interesting. You get to meet some great people you realise that football doesn’t solely revolve around what’s going on in England, there’s plenty of support and love and interest and I’m really enjoying what I’m doing so if anyone asks me if I’m enjoying I’d say very much so</p>

He just seems to perform every single week. <b>[Just]</b> 17 years old, been doing it since he was 16 - that’s young for a goalkeeper to play at this level. He’s not just interesting to watch because he’s young, he’s interesting to watch because he’s actually very good and that’s a big compliment to him. He’s already a special talent. If he continues then the sky is the limit for him. It’s not easy to be consistently very good. You can have a good game and one small mistake and the whole world changes.

To make the move happen, at least. For Hart to succeed in a country where so many of his compatriots had failed, he knew that he would have embrace the culture and, most crucially of all, the language.<br /><br /><b>[When asked about Gianluigi Buffon’s greatest attribute]</b> He has everything!

  <p><b>[Torino goalkeeper Joe Hart has praised the talent of his AC Milan counterpart Gianluigi Donnarumma]</b> Donnarumma is incredible, full stop. The fact he’s only 17 years old is almost irrelevant and just adds extra gloss to the situation. You can tell he’s at the top because he trains at the top. Age can only make him better, but he acts as if he’s already got a long career behind him..<br /><br /><b>[On Andrea Belotti]</b> Andrea is similar to all great strikers, whether they are English or not. It’s difficult to find someone to specifically compare him to: he is Belotti and that’s all. As a goalkeeper, I can say his best qualities are the instinct for goal, his character and the fact he is a team player. He’s always got in his mind how to work hard and help his teammates<br /><br />Chelsea are not a surprise for me and neither is he. As a manager he’s always been successful and that’s also because he was a great player - just like Roberto Mancini and Sinisa Mihajlovic. It’s difficult to make predictions in the Premier League, as unpredictable things can happen and I know that well: I won the title in a crazy way and lost one unexpectedly<br /><br />I do watch some Premier League football, but my priority now is Serie A, so I try to watch Italian football when possible. It is understandable why the Premier League is more popular around the world, as it’s more ‘visible’ and there’s so much on offer. But playing here I have realised how you Italians live the sport with pride and passion<br /><br />People say the English players don’t come to Italy because they look down on Serie A, but that’s just not true. Aside from the guaranteed earnings from the Premier League, I think it’s also because there isn’t much of a dialogue between English and Italian clubs: if they communicated more often, these moves would happen more. I see no reason why not</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Hart is unaware of what the future holds for him at Manchester City]</b> Of course it wouldn’t be a catastrophe, in no way, shape or form. It’s a strong league, it’s first team football. I’d like to think I’d be able to be happy anywhere. At the moment, that’s my life, that’s where I’m at and I’m going to make the most of it, no matter where I am. I’ve enjoyed being out there, enjoyed being part of a great football club, a great city, meeting new people, being involved in different situations. Our form has not been great lately but we are going to keep battling until the end and try and make the most out of the season.<br /><br />If I’d ridden the waves of what people’s opinions were, I’d be a wreck. You’re up, you are down. I’ve grown into the role. As a goalkeeper, even at Sunday League level, if you let your performance at the weekend dictate your whole week and your whole life, you are going to have problems. One day you are going to be far too over-confident and the next you are not going to want to make eye contact with anyone. I know how I play and my position in the games and what I need to be doing. But I am human and sometimes it doesn’t go perfectly, but it is not through lack of effort. I am going to dust myself off and do my best for the rest of the game</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Hart has admitted that going out on loan again was not his ideal situation]</b> The permanent move was going to be difficult. I don’t think there were too many options for me to go on a permanent, if any. That was my ideal situation. When you’ve asked me questions I’ve always answered honestly, and ideally I wanted to be signing a permanent deal somewhere so I could set my life up and have a direction. When you become a professional footballer there is no written contract that says you have to play first-team football. It’s a job at the end of the day but there are a lot of us, myself included, who just love playing football and I’m just lucky that it’s my job.<br /><br />It’s a short career. The money side of it is great and it is important, but at the end of the day I’m a young guy, I want to play football, that’s all I want to do. If going on loan is what needs to happen then for me that’s fine. The game moves quickly, there are plenty of people who have been in my situation and you have two choices. You can either moan about it and you can make smart comments and try to work out why it was done, or you can just get on with it. I’ve taken the latter.<br /><br />I’m trying to make a point to Slaven Bilic, he’s my coach. I’m trying to make my point to Gareth Southgate, they’re my coaches, they’re the people whose opinions I care about. I’ve always said the standard of ‘keepers in England is very high. It’s a privileged position to play for the country. Every single time I’ve put on that number one jersey I have been very proud and very excited for what comes with it</p>

So when this happened I was all up for a fight, and a fair fight is good for me and if I lose I will shake hands with my opposition, but I realised this wasn’t going to be my opportunity for a fair fight so I looked elsewhere. There was no point getting upset or irate because there was only ever going to be one winner and that was going to be the guy who Manchester City had put in charge.<br /><br />He has a lot of power and City fought like hell to get him as their manager and he had decisions to make and he made that with me. That’s life and that’s football. We all want a fair chance at everything but that’s not how it works. I’m not going to second guess why he wanted to get rid of me.

At every opportunity, when I think it is right, I will play Joe Hart. I will give Joe Hart an opportunity to show but I would never be disrespectful to Adrian in any way because Adrian has earned it by his performances. At every opportunity I can, I will give Joe the opportunity to show he is still England’s best goalkeeper. I’ll try to do that. If Adrian in any way slips up then I’ve got Joe ready.</p>

I came here at 19 and I’m going to leave at 31 so it’s been a long time and a lot of things have happened - family, friends and a lot of football! I certainly feel a lot of love and appreciation. I’ve always enjoyed the Man City fans, I came here as a Shrewsbury Town player - a kid from Shrewsbury. It was the pinnacle for me to be at this club before they were challenging for the title, and I was welcomed from day one. I think they saw in me someone who was just going to try his best. I wouldn’t have been able to do the things I’ve done if I wasn’t embraced or happy - so I’m happy to have given the fans some great memories and hopefully I’ll be thought of well.</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Hart says he respected Pep Guardiola’s honesty when he dropped him from the Manchester City team]</b> I’m cool with Pep, I think he’s a top manager. He came in and was dead honest with me. I looked him in the eye and shook his hand, I thanked him for his honesty. I didn’t thank him for his opinion, but his honesty was second to none. We tried to make the best of a bad situation for both of us. It is what it is. I moved on, worked hard, trained with City, I was welcomed back the last couple of pre-seasons. It could have easily been awkward, but it wasn’t.<br /><br />I do what the manager asks of me, to the best of my ability. I’m not saying I’m brilliant or saying I’m perfect. That’s probably the most high-profile thing to happen to me over the last couple of years, comments like that, rather than what actually counts<br /><br />If I was asked to play for England tomorrow I’d be ready. But at the moment, managers are always going to have opinions. I can only get myself as I can, to the highest of my level, and then it’s up to everyone else. Stuff out of my hands is out of my hands, how people want to play it is up to them. I am going to continue to push, Burnley is obviously my priority, and whatever happens, happens. I could have had a long summer where I felt sorry for myself, but I love it too much, I love challenges. The summer was amazing, I was absolutely gutted and other words that I wasn’t in the World Cup squad, but you’ve got to make the best. I had a fantastic summer, I enjoyed it, I bounced into this pre-season, and I’m ready to go</p>

  <p><b>[Man City honour Joe Hart by naming training pitch after him]</b> Having the goalkeeping pitch at the City Football Academy dedicated to me is a huge honour. Manchester City has been a huge part of my life and my career, and I’m immensely proud of what I and my teammates achieved in that period. There have been some incredible goalkeeping legends throughout Manchester City’s history, and I feel privileged that the club has chosen to recognise me amongst that number</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea is still one of the best in the business]</b> He should make that save because it’s his style. He’s top quality at that. He’s just mistimed it. He’s gone to go with the sole of his boot and it’s hit him higher up the leg. His style is to be low down. At the moment it’s not going for him. Nine times out of ten he makes that save. He’s a top goalkeeper. I’ve never seen a keeper like him. I love watching him, he’s so brave, you can’t knock him. He could pass the ball, make a mistake and concede a goal but he would still be the same goalkeeper, making the same decisions. He’s a human being who cares about his football and playing for Manchester United. I’m sure he just wants to get back to the level and be their best player - saving them at every opportunity.</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Hart considers <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> to be a wizard]</b> The wizard came over, I had no idea who <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> was. £25 million, tiny, slow, only left footed and didn’t even know his position. He seemed like a lovely guy, didn’t really speak much English. He didn’t take over straight away but his consistency and quality were through the roof. Just an all-round amazing player - there isn’t one negative to him, other than he’s small<br /><br /><b>[Hart added on the qualities that endeared Silva to the City faithful and his team-mates]</b> He could give an assist, score, have an amazing game, but if he walloped someone or won a header, he couldn’t tell you enough. He genuinely had no interest in the good stuff, he just loved the fact every now and again he whacked someone<br /><br /><b>[<a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> is another to have left a lasting impression on Hart]</b> When I talk to my goalkeeper friends and we talk about putting pressure on strikers, <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> doesn’t just put his head down and hit it. He feels and senses every situation. If you go down early, he flicks it over you. If you stand up, he puts it past you. I don’t think he knows he’s doing it, that’s just him - it’s his instinct. He’s the man that makes the difference</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Hart admits he was fairly concerned when <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> was appointed manager of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in 2016]</b> I was fairly concerned. Lots of important people tried to reassure me. But you just have a feeling, don’t you? I came back late from the <b>[2016]</b> Euros and he made it clear when I got there that I needed to be out by that window. That’s Pep’s brilliance. He makes decisions and stands by them. I don’t dislike him. We get on as men and we both love football. I made sure we had dialogue. I certainly backed myself to the hilt when we spoke. I listened to what he had to say. There’s more to it than me not being as good with my feet as he wants from a goalkeeper. I realised he needed to make his stamp at City. He had a direction he wanted to go and he’s not exactly struggled since, has he?<br /><br /><b>[Having struggled to secure game time this season under <a href="sean-dyche.html">Sean Dyche</a> before the coronavirus pandemic struck, Hart’s desire to play on has only been strengthened]</b> This lockdown has made me realise how much I want to play football. All I want to do is be a big part of something. I understand I’m not going to be part of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. I don’t think I’ve lost the ability, but I know how football works. I just want to be a big part of a club and give my all to them. That hope burns through me. I’m going to try and get back in the team. And if I don’t, there’s always another transfer opportunity. There’s no point in sulking. I’m still part of the squad. It gives you some power if you have a dialogue with the manager. It’s important to have that when you’re doing well. But it’s even more important when you’re not doing well</p>

  <p><b>[Former England and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> goalkeeper Joe Hart has pleaded for a club to believe in him after parting ways with <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a>]</b> The fact I have had to sit on the bench for 18 months in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is not going to define or crush me. I remember who I am. I remember playing for my local Sunday league team and trying to get into the Shrewsbury Town first team. I learned early - you need to keep things in perspective. You can have great things said about you in football, but you have to be strong on self-criticism, analyse what you are doing and be comfortable with it. Maybe from the outside, people are thinking it is a time for panic, but from the inside it is a time to look forward and see all the opportunities. I am young when it comes to goalkeeping. I am even younger when it comes to the mental age of a guy who just wants to go in goal and have people whack balls at him. I am under no illusions that <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> are going to knock my door down, get <b>[Thibaut]</b> <a href="thibaut-courtois.html">Courtois</a> out and bring me in. But there is plenty more to come from me. I just need someone to believe in me and I will repay that faith<br /><br />If I meet a bunch of Under-12s, I would be asking me about when I saved a <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> penalty or what it’s like playing for England. All they care about now is how do you deal with a mistake? How do deal with someone taunting you from behind the goal? That is not what your mindset should be as a kid. That’s why I got involved in it and that is why I talked about it</p>
