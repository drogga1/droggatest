  <p><b>[Joe Hart, who has made 66 first-team appearances for the Citizens since joining from hometown club Shrewsbury City in 2006, revealed his frustration at losing the No. 1 shirt at Eastlands]</b> It has been tough. It’s frustrating, but there’s only one person can play in goal and Shay’s doing that at the moment. I’ve had to deal with it the best I can. It’s not been ideal, but it’s not the end of the world</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Hart reveals why he left Manchester City]</b> Football is a game of opinions and some people have a great opinion of me and some people probably think I’m absolutely useless. Unfortunately for me, one of the guys’ opinions in charge of my club at the time wasn’t as strong as it needed to be<br /><br />Some people you struggle to argue with, they’ve got a lot of strong backing to what they say and what they do. It’s hard to please everyone and I learnt quite early that that’s never going to happen<br /><br />I had a situation at City where my playing time was going to be limited, so I had to look elsewhere. I’m not going to lie, I wasn’t sat there with 25 options. I felt like <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino FC</a> was the best option for me and it was pretty quick. I wasn’t given much time so when that opportunity came, I was really grateful<br /><br /><b>[So is it a realistic goal to go back to City?]</b> I’m at <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a> for the season and it’s hard to look past these <b>[England]</b> internationals. How this season plays out, or what comes of it, will be however it ends up. I’m at <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a> with huge commitment to the club, huge commitment to the season, the culture, the football and I’m going to give it my all. Whatever happens, happens.<br /><br />I need to improve all the time because I’m still learning the game and the game is changing all the time. I love trying to improve. I love that challenge. I want to keep developing until I physically can’t.<br /><br /><b>[Hart is hoping to impress interim England manager Gareth Southgate]</b> There’s always a threat to my place that’s very evident because we’ve got some fantastic keepers. Tom <b>[Heaton]</b> and Fraser are performing brilliantly in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> from what I’ve seen. Sunderland aren’t doing well as a team but Jordan <b>[Pickford]</b> is doing well. So there are good keepers everywhere you look and you can’t rest. There is never that feeling. Right from playing under-14s at Shrewsbury Town, you’ve got to be aware of your surroundings<br /><br /><b>[Hart has now played under four managers with England, with <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> the latest appointment following the dismissal of Allardyce]</b> I think it’s definitely down to us to create an identity of the team that we are trying to be. Win, lose or draw, I think we need an identity of why we won, why we lost, why it didn’t go very well. I’ve never been looking too far ahead. It’s always been the future and the present and the near future.<br /><br />Gareth is the England manager. He has come in and set a really good example. He’s had a lot of work with <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> previously. Asking the 21 lads what Gareth is like as a manager, <b>[there]</b> couldn’t be a more positive reaction. From what I’ve seen, I am excited to work with him</p>

  <p><b>[England goalkeeper Joe Hart thinks <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>’s 17-year-old goalkeeper <a href="gianluigi-donnarumma.html">Gianluigi Donnarumma</a> has impressed him since his loan move to Torino]</b> I’m really impressed, I don’t know about surprised, but I’m very, very impressed with him. He just seems to perform every single week. <b>[Just]</b> 17 years old, been doing it since he was 16 - that’s young for a goalkeeper to play at this level. He’s not just interesting to watch because he’s young, he’s interesting to watch because he’s actually very good and that’s a big compliment to him. He’s already a special talent. If he continues then the sky is the limit for him. It’s not easy to be consistently very good. You can have a good game and one small mistake and the whole world changes. But he’s at a special club which loves him, he’s got the backing of the whole nation and he can learn from <b>[Italy’s Gianluigi]</b> <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a> as well</p>

  <p><b>[Regarding his future]</b> I am no robot. That’s me, that’s who I am. I want to win. I’ll do anything for the cause but once the game’s done sometimes you’ve got to say ‘well done’ to someone and that’s my personality, hate it or love it, that’s who I am. I wanted to congratulate him, and talk about it because I’m interested. I’m interested about his thought process, you know, football interests me<br /><br />You look at some of the top teams in the world that have got the best strikers, and they are looking to buy another top striker. If you have got a top goalkeeper, you are not often looking to buy another goalkeeper. It’s a game of chess and my situation is different to everyone else, and we are going wait and see how it plays out. It looks like it is easy for some goalies. But my personal situation is interesting, and patience is going to have to be the key. I’m lucky that I’ve got this great distraction of being involved with my country for the next couple of days, and then we will see. I’d love to be withholding information about my future but I don’t have the information to withhold<br /><br />I just want to play football, I love football. I don’t know if you guys can see it but that’s what I live and breathe and I want to play football at the highest possible level I can play, that’s the plan</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Hart considers <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> to be a wizard]</b> The wizard came over, I had no idea who <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> was. £25 million, tiny, slow, only left footed and didn’t even know his position. He seemed like a lovely guy, didn’t really speak much English. He didn’t take over straight away but his consistency and quality were through the roof. Just an all-round amazing player - there isn’t one negative to him, other than he’s small<br /><br /><b>[Hart added on the qualities that endeared Silva to the City faithful and his team-mates]</b> He could give an assist, score, have an amazing game, but if he walloped someone or won a header, he couldn’t tell you enough. He genuinely had no interest in the good stuff, he just loved the fact every now and again he whacked someone<br /><br /><b>[Aguero is another to have left a lasting impression on Hart]</b> When I talk to my goalkeeper friends and we talk about putting pressure on strikers, <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> doesn’t just put his head down and hit it. He feels and senses every situation. If you go down early, he flicks it over you. If you stand up, he puts it past you. I don’t think he knows he’s doing it, that’s just him - it’s his instinct. He’s the man that makes the difference</p>

Best case is he’s got <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s captain, leader, legend out of the second leg<br /><br />I think both decisions would have been umpire’s call in cricket.

  <p><b>[Joe Hart admits he was fairly concerned when <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> was appointed manager of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in 2016]</b> I was fairly concerned. Lots of important people tried to reassure me. But you just have a feeling, don’t you? I came back late from the <b>[2016]</b> Euros and he made it clear when I got there that I needed to be out by that window. That’s Pep’s brilliance. He makes decisions and stands by them. I don’t dislike him. We get on as men and we both love football. I made sure we had dialogue. I certainly backed myself to the hilt when we spoke. I listened to what he had to say. There’s more to it than me not being as good with my feet as he wants from a goalkeeper. I realised he needed to make his stamp at City. He had a direction he wanted to go and he’s not exactly struggled since, has he?<br /><br /><b>[Having struggled to secure game time this season under <a href="sean-dyche.html">Sean Dyche</a> before the coronavirus pandemic struck, Hart’s desire to play on has only been strengthened]</b> This lockdown has made me realise how much I want to play football. All I want to do is be a big part of something. I understand I’m not going to be part of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. I don’t think I’ve lost the ability, but I know how football works. I just want to be a big part of a club and give my all to them. That hope burns through me. I’m going to try and get back in the team. And if I don’t, there’s always another transfer opportunity. There’s no point in sulking. I’m still part of the squad. It gives you some power if you have a dialogue with the manager. It’s important to have that when you’re doing well. But it’s even more important when you’re not doing well</p>

  <p><b>[Former England and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> goalkeeper Joe Hart has pleaded for a club to believe in him after parting ways with Burnley]</b> The fact I have had to sit on the bench for 18 months in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is not going to define or crush me. I remember who I am. I remember playing for my local Sunday league team and trying to get into the Shrewsbury Town first team. I learned early - you need to keep things in perspective. You can have great things said about you in football, but you have to be strong on self-criticism, analyse what you are doing and be comfortable with it. Maybe from the outside, people are thinking it is a time for panic, but from the inside it is a time to look forward and see all the opportunities. I am young when it comes to goalkeeping. I am even younger when it comes to the mental age of a guy who just wants to go in goal and have people whack balls at him. I am under no illusions that <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> are going to knock my door down, get <b>[Thibaut]</b> <a href="thibaut-courtois.html">Courtois</a> out and bring me in. But there is plenty more to come from me. I just need someone to believe in me and I will repay that faith<br /><br />If I meet a bunch of Under-12s, I would be asking me about when I saved a <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> penalty or what it’s like playing for England. All they care about now is how do you deal with a mistake? How do deal with someone taunting you from behind the goal? That is not what your mindset should be as a kid. That’s why I got involved in it and that is why I talked about it</p>
