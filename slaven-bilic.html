You can never be 100 per cent certain in football, of course, and maybe one of them will knock on the door and say he is unhappy but even if that happens, I will try to persuade them to stay at the club</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>’s Slaven Bilic admits he laughed at ‘Dildo Brothers’ remark]</b> Which comment? I thought about coming with a lawyer today. There have been issues. Come on, say it. It’s funny. It made me laugh but look, I don’t like to talk about some things. What I know about that transfer is that I wanted the player. That has been going on for a long time. We kept it low-profile.<br /><br />It was the whole summer and it looked promising. From what I know we spoke, not me, but <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> people and the people who have the power, they spoke to Sporting about Carvalho. We wanted him. I’m smiling, I’m laughing, I’m joking. I’m frustrated because we didn’t get the player, of course. I’ve been trying to get him for a couple of years. It didn’t happen with <a href="ivan-perisic.html">Perisic</a> at Man United, it didn’t happen with a few players at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I’m not angry at anyone.

If I want to say something, no problem. I am not going to talk through my lawyers - I don’t have a lawyer - or the media. I am expecting if he says something about me to call me, to say this and not go through you guys, although that is best for you<br /><br /><b>[Bilic revealed players were sold to raise funds for Carvalho]</b> Everybody is talking about how much money we spent on <b>[Marko]</b> <a href="marko-arnautovic.html">Arnautovic</a> and <a href="javier-hernandez.html">Chicharito</a> <b>[Javier Hernández]</b>. But we sold 11 players. We did not have a massive squad like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I was so sure we would do it. We spent £6m, not £26m<br /><br />You can’t be like a small child and cry and go ‘buy me that Kinder egg’ that my daughter is asking me for every time we go to Waitrose. Then if you don’t buy it she is very disappointed. We’ve got good players. This was one disappointment. This was a crucial position for us that we’ve been trying to get since I came here. It didn’t happen. I can be disappointed, but if we tried everything then you can’t be angry. I wanted Carvalho. Fuck it now, you know what I mean? I have a good team.</p>

Albion have a short-term project and a long project, and they do not clash. They wanted me to lead them, to help improve them.

Everybody gave everything and that was expected, but you can crumble under the pressure, but we didn’t. It was not easy to play that game. There was big pressure on us and we responded like a proper, mature, quality team and that’s what I like about it. I’m really proud of the guys for tonight. Hopefully we are back in town</p>

  <p><b>[West Brom secured a thrilling 4-2 victory over Hull to move closer to a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> return]</b> The teams who are below us, Brentford, Fulham and Forest are doing well but they are hoping. We have to cope with the pressure. We wouldn’t swap with them and we have to cope with it. The pressure will only get bigger. It doesn’t mean we would swap with them. We have to continue being brave and relax in a positive way. Today was a game to enjoy. It was a very frantic match, the stage is frantic. It was a very open game, we didn’t want it to be open when they were getting the ball. On the ball we were excellent but they put us under pressure with a very simple way of football. We were a little afraid they were going to hurt us. We are back on track and I’m really pleased with that</p>

  <p><b>[Automatic promotion-chasing West Brom had to settle for a point at <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> after substitute Joe Rothwell’s strike earned the hosts a 1-1 draw]</b> Before we scored the goal we had a couple of great chances, after we scored the goal in the first half we had straight away a great chance. We had a number of, not good chances but great chances, and unfortunately if you don’t score them there is always a possibility, against a team with this quality, that you can concede<br /><br />I’m not happy with how we played after we conceded the goal. Up front we were OK, but we lost the shape and the game became stretched too much, and that is why they had a couple of chances. Up until then, as I said, I was very, very pleased with the performance. (But) we had to score goals. We had to kill the game off, and unfortunately we didn’t</p>

  <p><b>[West Brom boss Slaven Bilic says his role is currently more like a psychologist than a coach as his side attempt to seal automatic promotion to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> During the pre-season you can be 80 per cent focused on tactical and let the fitness coach deal with the fitness, and you can allow mistakes in training, in friendly games. But now you are a psychologist, you are there for them mentally. It doesn’t have to be organised meeting you know, sometimes those organised meetings are like ‘why are we having a meeting?’ It’s more about those wee talks, two-minute talks, individual talks, talks in pairs, those things where … you are not lifting them up because they’re down, you are convincing them in something that they’ve basically done yesterday<br /><br /><b>[Bilic accepted that there is still some apprehension amongst his squad]</b> It’s that stage of the season, until you cross that line of course there is anxiety. Brentford are pushing us to the limit but we are doing well. If it wasn’t for them it would be done but they are doing well. We have to continue doing what we are doing and that is winning games. Of course the supporters are nervous, the players are a bit nervous, everyone is. It’s a big thing. If it was easy it wouldn’t be a big achievement. It’s not a question of are we enjoying the pressure? We’d prefer to be without it but we are responding really well to the pressure. We are playing against a very good team, one which is on a very good run and they still have chances for automatic promotion. We have to be on top of our game because of the opponent, we have to be very confident and extremely brave</p>

  <p><b>[West Brom’s grip on an automatic promotion spot loosened as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Fulham]</b> Everything is in our hands. We started the restart a bit slower, were a bit unlucky in first couple of games but after that, in last five games, we are creating and dominating. We are in good form, playing good football. That’s where I have my optimism and belief<br /><br />I’m very proud with the way we played. We defended well and in the second half we kept the shape and composure and created more than enough chances. We just couldn’t score but the composure, mentality, passion and quality made me really proud. It would be better if we had won the game of course but it’s one game less to go and it’s in our hands. There is no point watching it (Brentford), it will only make me nervous, I’m going to be big Preston fan of course.</p>

We are good and we know we are. Now it’s time to step across the line and finish the job. You must manage this intensity from the start but don’t panic, keep it calm. Believe in yourself. I’m really happy with how we are dealing with it <b>[the pressure]</b> and really happy with how we are playing and every aspect of the game. It’s in our hands completely. Brentford are pushing us but we will do everything we can. <b>[We mustn’t]</b> play like we did against <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> in the last 20 minutes, when we tried to score like it was a basketball game, we don’t need to. Why? Because we are good and we don’t rely on luck or that something’s going to happen. We’re going to make it happen. Since round seven, we are there <b>[in the automatic promotion places]</b>, all this time. So we haven’t relied since September on anybody else to do our job. We have to do our job and we are going to. We will not let anybody take it from us</p>
