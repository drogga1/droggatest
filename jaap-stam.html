Had a marvellous technique and goalscoring ability, but above all great situational awareness; he always knew where his team-mates were and how to bring them into the game. Wasn’t always a prolific goalscorer, but some of the goals he scored were incomparable. He was very clever at finding space and making himself available. He never stood still when he received the ball and that made it very difficult playing against him.</p>

In this league, with all the games we need to play, you never know what’s going to happen with injuries and suspensions - so it’s also important we have options and the chance to rotate.

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba has been told that Italian football suits him]</b> It’ll be fantastic for him to return to Italy, he’ll face the team where he developed in front of the fans who cheered for him. He’ll certainly want to make a good impression and do his best. A possible return to Juventus? I have no idea if he’s happy at Manchester United but I’m sure he would be good at Juventus. Italian football suits him.<br /><br />I expect a match in which both teams will want to get three points. Certainly the approach will be different though, Juventus are a team that prefers to attack from the first minute of the game, while Manchester United are more cautious, they prefer to wait for the opponent and then hit them. They’ll try to win though, because if United lose tomorrow night the pressure will be on Mourinho again. Juventus are favourites, they haven’t dropped any points in the Champions League and they have great players. Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci? They’re good players who have played at a high level for many years now. I heard the Manchester United manager say that ‘they could teach Harvard,’ but I don’t agree with that. But I think Juventus really can win the Champions League. Of course, they’re not at the level of Barcelona in terms of playing with the ball but that doesn’t mean they can’t aspire to win it. Games are not always decided by individual play, in this competition there are important aspects such as mentality and mental strength. It also takes a little bit of luck in individual matches</p>

  <p><b>[Jaap Stam wants Manchester United to hire Mauricio Pochettino as their next permanent manager]</b> He is the best choice. He’s got a lot of experience working in the UK with Southampton and Tottenham. He’s good in building a team, plays attractive football, playing out from the back to score goals and win games. I would say that’s my choice. I think they can <b>[get him]</b>. There’s been a discussion at Spurs about not spending money on players, I think he is the type of manager who wants to invest every year and improve - at United he gets to do that. They’ve got the money to do that. For him, that would be the ultimate step.<br /><br />The only thing is, and that’s a pity for Tottenham, there’s always a bigger club and that’s United. They’ve always got that little bit more to spend, they’re bigger all over the world. For a manager it’s ‘if I want to work at the top I need to be there to really show myself’. It doesn’t matter if they’re in the new stadium now or in the next season - if the opportunity is there then he wants to go<br /><br /><b>[Stam also backed former team-mate Solskjaer’s appointment on a temporary basis]</b> He wants to play attacking football, as a personality he can work with young players, give them a certain feeling, which is what they need. Sometimes they need to be released from something that brings out that feeling of freedom. I think Ole is that type of manager</p>

After good and open conversations with (technical director) Martin van Geel about the possibilities and impossibilities at Feyenoord, I soon found out that I would like to go for this opportunity. I am grateful to PEC Zwolle for the fact that they understand my ambitions have come quickly to an agreement with Feyenoord. In the coming months I will do everything I can to finish the season at PEC Zwolle with the players and the staff. That will really be the focus for me in the coming period.</p>

  <p><b>[Managing Man United would be ‘nice’ but Jaap Stam focused on Feyenoord for now]</b> It’s all gone very quickly. The time certainly does go fast. But it’s good to make a move to a big club like Feyenoord and to get the chance to work there. After a couple of months of being at Zwolle, Feyenoord came and showed interest and said that they wanted to sign me for next season. So, I start in June. It’s going to be an interesting job. To get the chance to work there is unbelievable because it’s a massive club with a very big fanbase and a massive history. They want to get back to the top of football in Holland and hopefully we can help with that. There are always high expectations there of winning the league so it’s going to be difficult, but it’s a nice job and I’m looking forward to getting started.<br /><br />I’d love to come back one day, but first I need to do a good job at Feyenoord. That’s my aim now, to do very well with them and then afterwards we can always see what happens way down the line. But first things first, right now Zwolle is my priority and then, from the summer, Feyenoord will be my only priority. I want to do well for them, but of course one day in the future I could eventually return. Everybody knows that the UK is my second country to live and to work in.<br /><br />People keep coming up to me and talking about Ole because we played together. It’s not strange because when we were playing together and rooming in hotels, Ole talked about football all the time, constantly. So, it’s not a shocker to me that he went into coaching and got the opportunity to be manager at United. For him to be performing like he is doing, it’s great to see that. Before he went, he would have known the squad and what he could do with it. And now he is showing he’s a very good manager. But, of course, you always need to rely on the players you have<br /><br /><b>[Would Stam one day like to follow in the footsteps of <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> and sit in the hot seat at Old Trafford?]</b> That would be nice. I’ve always said that you want to work at the top teams if you have the ability. But you always need to get that chance as well, because there are so many managers and so few clubs. When I went back to Holland my aim was to work for a top team and to perform over here and now I’ve got the chance to work at the top in Holland next season with Feyenoord, hopefully we can do a good job there and then we will see what might come in the future. As a player and as a manager, the ambition is always to work at the highest level. If you can achieve that, it’s good</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Giggs’ wonder-goal won the 1999 FA Cup semi-final replay between Manchester United and Arsenal]</b> I remember the ball deflected off me and went in, Pete couldn’t get there. It’s always a pity when that happens, but it’s always the risk when you are trying to close down these players. After that they got on top. When you played in those type of games and were 1-0 up, you felt you were in control but when the other team equalise, there is always that feeling of doubt. When they scored they pushed on and went for the second and after that it was about defending, trying to get through the 90 minutes.<br /><br />I’d seen Dennis with the national team and he wasn’t that comfortable taking penalties. It’s always difficult for a player if you don’t take a lot of penalties and then you have to take one, especially in a moment like that - even for a player like Dennis. I was looking at him as he was running up to take it and I was just hoping that Pete was going to save it - and that’s what happened. That save kept us in the game, after that they were feeling like they should have won and it gave us a feeling like we were invincible. It gave us a lot of confidence<br /><br /><b>[Patrick Vieira’s misplaced pass, Giggs’ run from the halfway line]</b> When he got the ball, I remember thinking, ‘where is he going with it, what’s he doing?’ We wanted to push up a bit, but then we saw him going and making these moves that we sometimes saw when he just glided past players. The Arsenal players were backing off and then he just went past them, got into the box and Seaman couldn’t save it. It was a tremendous feeling and a feeling of disbelief as well. To get past five or six players and finish like that, it was incredible</p>

  <p><b>[David Moyes has questioned the progress made by Manchester United]</b> I feel that since I took over to where they are just now, I don’t think there’s an awful lot of difference. When I took over it was needing a change and needing a turnaround of players, and that was all going to take time. I feel like in the four years or so since I was managing there, it’s probably not moved on much more. It’s quite similar - they’re still saying there needs to be changes and has to be things done. That time since I left hasn’t been used awfully well.<br /><br />It’s always easy to talk about a club where if you leave and if the club has not had the success it wants to have, to say the club hasn’t reached anything and was still the same as it was. It’s up to a manager to play how he wants to play. If you are joining United, it’s the same probably for Moyes as well, if you are joining a club like that you have the opportunity to change everything within the club. To make choices in coaches, the academy and in players you will be bringing in to the club to play a certain way and you can do your thing and you can do your bit but if you are not succeeding you need to be a person who says I could change everything but I have not brought the success and have not done well. You don’t want to talk about other managers after you and then say what they’ve done and nothing else has changed. Even when Mourinho was there and now Ole is there - every manager at United gets the opportunity to build a team and every manager has the opportunity to spend a lot of money and bring in players</p>

  <p><b>[Ajax’s Matthijs de Ligt would be a good fit at Barcelona]</b> It’s important that he’ll get playing time. If you look at the squads: Barcelona, after losing to Liverpool, probably wants to strengthen their squad, especially in defence, if you ask me. The question is how they are going to solve that problem<br /><br />I think that Matthijs de Ligt would be a good fit though. It will be great to see how he performs against better players in a better league, not just every few weeks, but every weekend. Same goes for Liverpool. We all know who is their biggest defensive star - his Dutch colleague <b>[Virgil van Dijk]</b> - the other players, <b>[Dejan]</b> Lovren and <b>[Joel]</b> Matip, rotate quite a lot. The big question is if he’ll immediately play all matches. I think he has enough quality to do so. In those big leagues it’s normal to have to deal with rotation, especially at the start you will probably start on the bench a bit more often. After that, you have to get used to the level and the quality of your opponents. I think the people around him, and Matthijs himself, are smart enough to pick the option with the most playing time. In that case, money won’t make a difference</p>

  <p><b>[Jaap Stam says Paul Scholes is the former Manchester United team-mate he would most like to sign]</b> I think Scholesy was one of the best players I played with in my career from all my teams. He was probably the complete midfield player, he had everything. The goalscoring, his passing was very high quality, technically he was very strong, he could run and he wasn’t afraid to put in a tackle as well. I would love to have signed him. Even now he can do it! Will I just give him the ball in Sunday’s game? Well, I might keep it myself if I have it. When I played at United, sometimes if I went over the halfway line with the ball as a centre-back, Sir Alex <b>[Ferguson]</b> would shout at me: ‘Jaap, don’t do that. Get the ball to the midfield players. We’ve got them to do that!’<br /><br />That’s how it goes. I think everybody needs to know their role, their part. I was brought in as a defender and you need to do your defensive job. Sometimes you can bring something extra to the game, but eventually you’ve got the other players in front of you for that, so I was always glad to have Scholesy to give the ball to. Sometimes I was a bit sneaky and kept the ball, took it forward and hopefully you’re going to get something out of it. It gives something extra to the fans as well, when they see you run with the ball. Of course, you need to do something good with it, but it was great to do it. You could feel the atmosphere, hear the crowd growing louder and that gives you a great feeling as a player. It’ll be great to sample that at Old Trafford again on Sunday</p>

You want a squad that is competitive towards each other. Everyone needs to push each other to get the maximum out of everyone - to achieve something. As a manager and as a club, you need to have a look at that. After the last couple of seasons and how everything is going, I think it is good to re-evaluate everything in the team. Look at the players, what they have done and what they have achieved. Even players who have a contract for another three or four seasons - you need to make your choices towards them and what you want to do with them. At the end of the day, the most important thing is to achieve the goals you set out, sometimes you need to make hard decisions to do that.</p>

We all know how this world works, so it’s inevitable that a player makes a transfer at a certain point in his career. We know that English and Spanish clubs scout all over the world, but especially in the Netherlands for talented Dutch defenders, because they’re known to be good with their feet. Those clubs usually have enough money lying around to take a risk and sign a few of them and see if it pays off in the long run. If it works out, great. If it doesn’t, they’ll probably sell them for more money than before. In the end it’s up to the clubs, but I wish Sepp all the best and I hope he’ll turn out to be a big success story at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Stam has taken over as Feyenoord head coach ahead of the new season, but he did not try to bring Van den Berg across from Zwolle]</b> We haven’t talked about that. Looking back at the situation we were in at PEC Zwolle, we were battling against relegation. In those cases, you have to make sure that the available players are of the sufficient level to perform week in, week out. In those cases, you don’t have time to educate and to develop, which sometimes could hurt the development of youth players.

He’s always looking to play forward. He’s got the ability to score. He’s got a great free-kick. He’s got a great pass. He is always looking to get into certain areas to get onto the ball and be influential in the game. He’s not exactly the same. Scholesy was a bit more aggressive without the ball. But in terms of football intelligence, he is similar to <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a>.<br /><br />The difficult thing is that agents are always pressing on behalf of their players. But players always want to play themselves, especially when you’re a big player and a manager tells you that you’re not going to play. You then want to go somewhere else and play for another club. And if you’re a big player like <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> is there are always teams asking for you and who want to sign you. That makes things difficult for the manager who has to keep the player calm and make him feel happy and appreciated. This is especially true these days with all the money in football. ‘It’s an extra dimension to the actual football and with all the money around every player want to be thought of as the best. But they need to look at the big picture and look at what the club wants to do and how they want to play</p>

  <p><b>[Jaap Stam on Orkun Kokcu]</b> When we played with one holding midfielder, he was one of the two who played a little bit higher up the pitch. But he can play as No.10 or he can play as a left midfield player. Sometimes he can drop in deep as well to get the ball forward to link up the play with strikers. He has creativity, scoring ability, stamina and running ability. He keeps on going. I saw him as a very promising player. The only thing he needs to work a little more on is the defensive part of his game. Ideally it would be good for him to stay in Holland, to adjust even more to playing three games a week and to get used to the intensity.

  <p><b>[Jaap Stam has lifted the lid on his disappointing spell in charge at Feyenoord, admitting he would never have made the move to De Kuip had he known what was going to happen behind the scenes]</b> I’d made agreements with Martin and Jan in terms of what we were going to do with the squad, players who might be leaving, that sort of thing. But then, in my last week with Zwolle, Martin left and then, a week before the new season started, Jan left as well and I was there basically by myself. Other people came in who had never been in these positions before and they told me there was no money to spend, they’d sold a couple of my players and that the money they’d brought in I couldn’t invest.<br /><br />I brought players in who hadn’t really been playing and I also had to work with youngsters. For me, that wasn’t a problem, but I said that they had to know that results might be different from what Feyenoord had been used to. That we would need time to grow<br /><br />They said that wasn’t a problem, but the first four or five months I needed to get players up to game fitness and people were still expecting results; you know how it goes in football. Eventually, I said that this wasn’t what I’d signed up for and that maybe it was better if they took someone else for the job because the agreements I’d made with the club weren’t like this<br /><br /><b>[When asked whether he now believes he would have been better off continuing the project he was building with Zwolle, the 47-year-old admits]</b> Yes, but afterwards it’s easy to say that. And it was more to do with the people leaving and everything that happened before the season started. Sometimes, I was more like a man in an office rather than a manager working with his squad because there was a lot going on and I needed to do a lot of things. So, maybe it would have been better to stay <b>[with Zwolle]</b> and if I’d known what was going on and the problems Feyenoord had, then I would have made a different choice. But that wasn’t the case and that’s not how it always goes in football.

Cambuur were 11 points clear of third place, it was likely that they were going to be winning the league. But now there are no guarantees that next season will be the same. They are building a new ground as well. I played for Cambuur, I enjoyed my time there.

They were in the cup final as well and now they are not allowed to play this game, so they haven’t got a chance to go into Europe by winning that either. For them it’s been a very bad decision. In Holland, you have the Super Cup at the beginning of the season played between the champions and the cup winners. That’s not going to happen now, so I think they could have played the cup final in that spot at the beginning of the next season. What they said over here is that all clubs could have a vote over what they thought was the best idea, but it seems like the Dutch FA didn’t listen and made their own decision. It was surprising and there was a lot of anger about it, which I can understand</p>

I think nowadays it is becoming better and people appreciate the job of defending a lot more. But goalscorers earn more money and they get more attention. That’s how it’s always been and that’s how it’s going to be in the future. And looking at the world now, I think <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is still the best player. If you look at the Ballon d’Or and winning the trophy, I think the right decision was to give it to <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. I would have liked to give it to Virgil because I think he’s done great. It’s not that I don’t want him to win it, but I think <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and what he is doing year in, year out, scoring goals and creating goals with the pressure he’s under, I think he deserves it.<br /><br />Virgil has been very good. But the thing that people don’t always understand is that the team-mates you have around you make you very good as well. As a player you need to have the ability and the quality to get to the top and that’s what he has, but having quality people around you sometimes makes life a little bit easier for you as well and it makes you look like you are one of the best in the world. That was the same for myself and for other good centre-backs. That’s how it goes in football. Virgil is one of the best in the world right now. He’s been doing great and his route from Scotland, to <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> and then to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> has been ideal for him. I think he’s adjusted to every level and that tells you something about his mentality as well<br /><br />To be one of the greats, you have to produce these performances year in, year out and to stay at that level for several years. I think by playing at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> with these players around him and being very decisive for his team, it will make Virgil an even better player. Playing against big teams in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, but also the best in the Champions League makes you a better player. By learning from that you will get better and better. It’s very important that you don’t think ‘I am one of the best so I don’t need to learn anymore’. No, you can’t do that. You have to be realistic and continue to learn from every game and I think that’s what Virgil’s doing</p>

  <p><b>[The end of tiki-taka and gegenpressing? Football’s next tactical revolution]</b> I don’t think it’s going to change within a couple of years. But I still think the most important thing is the manager and how he wants to play. As a manager you have to go to a club, look at your squad and the quality of the players and then pick a certain way of playing. The likes of <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> and <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> have the opportunity to buy their own team in terms of how they want to play. At the big clubs where a lot of money can be spent, they also look at the league they are playing in and the type of football that can get results. If you look at Pep, he wants to play possession football, but he learnt as well that in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> sometimes he got caught out on the break and conceded goals. So now he’s choosing to sometimes drop in a bit more and wait for the right time to press and win the ball and then go on the break himself<br /><br /><b>[Stam, who resigned as Feyenoord boss in October, may have played under the likes of <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>, <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> and <a href="roberto-mancini.html">Roberto Mancini</a> during his playing days, but he still believes in the possession-based style that he was brought up with as a child in the Netherlands]</b><br /><br />I’m not a fan of copying. I like my teams to play possession football, to get the ball and move it quickly if the opportunity is there to create chances and score goals. When you are playing and go into management you start creating your own philosophy and your own way of thinking. Of course you will think about some of the managers you’ve had in your career and how they approached the game or training sessions, but I’ve rarely used that for myself<br /><br />When I joined Reading I spent a lot of time watching them as the deal was getting closer and closer. I looked at how they played and saw they played a lot in 4-4-2, they very direct and without trying to keep possession. So when I went over there we started from day one to try and drill our way of thinking into the squad. A lot of games it worked out, sometimes of course it didn’t but that’s normal with every team when you try and play a certain way. It’s always a bit of a gamble in terms of how it will work out. Will the players like it? Will they start to feel confident? But we made it a thing for the players to enjoy and they started to believe in it. At the beginning of the season it was not the easiest, but eventually it became easier and easier for them and we won a lot of games that first season<br /><br /><b>[The way the art of goalkeeping has changed in recent years mirrors the shift]</b> There’s a lot more to come. I think coaches are going to be thinking more and more about tactics over the next few years. With respect to previous managers who did very well and won lots of trophies, the game is changing all the time. Players are becoming quicker, they are athletes now compared to years ago and there is more at stake in terms of money. So people are thinking more and more about tactics and what can be done</p>

But I think everyone at the club knew that the players who had come in needed time to adjust to the club, the pressure of playing for the club and what Ole wanted to do. Now you see players are getting used to the way of playing and by bringing in Fernandes, a quality player, it’s given them that extra dimension of creativity going forward which makes it easier at times for other players to get on the ball and get into scoring positions. So I’m delighted for Ole that it’s getting better and better. Unfortunately for him it’s stopped now because for the last period of the season they were looking very good.<br /><br />Against City they have had a good run of results. But you can’t look at individual games and say we can go for winning the league because we’ve beaten them several times. I think you need to be very stable as a team throughout the whole league, which <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is. You need to play in a certain way now and build your squad in a certain way, then eventually you can build that challenge for winning the league again.
