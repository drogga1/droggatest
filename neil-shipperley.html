  <p>[<a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> legend Neil Shipperley says <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Aaron-Wan Bissaka</a> is a fair deal at £55 million] I think it’s good business for a right-back that has made 42 appearances. It’s a great deal for the club. This is football at the moment. There’s not a bidding war for him. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are the club. No-one else is coming in for him so you’re not going to have this bidding war. I think £50m or £55m is a fair deal. The fans aren’t going to like this but what they’ve got to realise is that this kid could still be in the Under-23s. He only came on the scene because we had no-one else to play right-back. He came in and he has made that position his own. He’s a great player but at the end of the day, he’s a right-back. He’s not a centre midfielder or a centre forward like Wilf [<a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a>]. He’s a right-back and I think we’ve got a replacement in Joel Ward, who is not as good as Bissaka but he can certainly play right-back and do a job<br /><br />[Shipperley added, on a fee that could make <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Wan-Bissaka</a> the most expensive English player in history] Back in the day it was centre forwards [who went for big fees] because they were the ones that won you games. There was no talk of massive money for defenders and goalkeepers. It was really just strikers. As kids, you wanted to be a striker. But now you might as well go and play left-back and study that, make it your position because it’s not just about centre forwards anymore<br /><br />[There is speculation surrounding <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> once more] There will be uproar if Wilf and Bissaka both go. I can understand this one [<a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Wan-Bissaka</a>] because I don’t think <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> are a club at the moment who can turn down that money. I thought it was going to be the other way round because I thought Wilf would go and we’d keep Bissaka. But I would imagine with this looking like it’s going to get over the line, Wilf will stay. If he doesn’t, I think the fans … you can’t lose two big players like that unless we’ve got something up our sleeve where we can go and buy some able replacements</p>

  <p>[Eyebrows have been raised over the figures involved in a deal for <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Wan-Bissaka</a> that appears to be drawing ever closer.
