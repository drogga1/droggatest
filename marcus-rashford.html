  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford says he was inspired by Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> When <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> came to United, he was the one who everyone looked up to. The thing that impressed me the most was the fact he was only young when he came into the side and he wanted to be the best player in the side. He worked hard every single day, you saw him in the gym every single day and the results came on the pitch. He openly wanted to be the best player in the world. You have to have an approach like that – all the best players in the world do. It’s not arrogance or anything like that, it’s the mindset you need to achieve things</p>

The likes of me, Anthony and Jesse - watching these forwards play and how they train, their mentality, is so important. You can’t ask for more. <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> is very easy to speak to and he’s easy to get along with. The way he approaches every game is about winning. He wants to win, regardless of the opponent, whether we are home or away, whatever the odds, he always wants to find a way to win. That mentality is what you need to be at the top level. That is where he is and where he has been for years</p>

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford says it is clear that England are heading in the right direction as the <a href="fa.html">Three Lions</a> prepare for the upcoming Nations League semi-finals]</b> There are signs we are heading in the right direction. Before the World Cup, we were winning games and playing good football but when it came to games against the big teams - the elite nations we want to be amongst - we fell short a couple of times. But in this last year we have played Spain and Croatia and managed to get over the line. It shows we are improving. The World Cup was the start of a journey, rather than the end of an adventure. Because since then we have kicked on. We’ve changed the system but have kicked on. If we want to get to our aim of being the number one team in the world, we have to beat the best teams<br /><br />Holland will be tough, but we are determined to do well. Not long ago, back at the Euros in 2016, I don’t think our fans believed we could win something. I think that is different now. It’s been a long time since we won something so it would be nice. We are approaching this Nations League as though it is a major tournament, 100 per cent. We want our names to be first in the history books. Who knows? In the future, it could grow into a big, big tournament</p>

This club has shaped me, both as a player and as a person, so it is such a privilege every time I get the opportunity to wear the shirt. I want to thank Ole and his staff for everything they have done for me; they are the perfect group of coaches to learn from as I continue my development and look to push on to the next level. I will be giving everything I have to help get this club back to where it belongs and deliver the success that our fans deserve.</p>

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford has revealed the hurt he is feeling at Manchester United’s current plight]</b> It is a huge sense of pride and a huge feeling for me to sign the contract. Manchester United are one big family. Some clubs don’t have that - it’s just a football club. That’s why Manchester United are more than a football club to me. Me being a fan changes the emotional side of it. Say we lose a game, it affects me more than it should because I’m a fan. It hurts every day to see where we are now, <b>[compared]</b> to where we’ve been in the past. I use that pain as motivation. It makes me more determined to put the club back where they belong.<br /><br />There’s nothing I want more than to see the club winning the Premier League again, winning the Champions League again. Everybody here deserves much, much more than what we’re giving them right now, not only the fans, the club itself. They don’t deserve to be where they are now. As players, we’re the ones who have the opportunity to try and forget about the past five, six years and put the club back on track.<br /><br /><b>[Solskjaer was a key figure during the glory years under Sir Alex Ferguson, and Rashford is convinced a brighter future for United lies in store under the Norwegian]</b> He just gets it. He understands. He’s been a player here. He knows how we may feel in certain moments because he’s been there himself. The fact that he understands us way more than a normal manager is why he’s fitted in straight away<br /><br /><b>[On whether the Solskjaer ‘revolution’ will work]</b> That’s what drives me every day. If I didn’t believe it, I wouldn’t be waking up every morning and giving 100 per cent to try and put the club back where they belong. I believe in the players, the staff and the manager. The players have the faith in the manager now. If we’re going to do it, now’s the time. We’re looking forward to the new season. One season is not going to change it. It can take two or three seasons but I feel we’re ready to take the first step, and really start showing people that we are Manchester United</p>

We’re in much better condition then we were this time last year<br /><br />I feel like now I am in a better position then I was. Physically I feel in a better condition. I don’t think you put a number on it, but you want as many goals as you can get. It is a different challenge. My goal was never to be a No.9 who can’t play anywhere else. Playing on the left and the right, that is what I want to do. I know what I have worked on since a six-year-old and it is to adapt<br /><br />A lot of the things are instinctive. You can’t really work on them. But I think you get a lot from speaking to him and now he has had the time to work with us on the pitch we have had new things.

I think we are starting to understand it all a bit better. We can use this. This is Ole’s first pre-season and he can really stamp down what he wants to do. We have got to use the remainder of the time here and then in Singapore and China to keep progressing and improving<br /><br />I just think that little things like pictures in our heads are a lot clearer already. Some of the other lads have been here in pre-season longer than I have, but in the short time I have been here things are becoming clearer to me on what the manager wants and how we are to do it on the pitch, so that will put us in good stead for the rest of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford claims to give my life for Manchester United]</b> I think it’s a very exciting moment. For me it was just about getting the new contract out of the way and solidifying that I’m here for the club. It’s about getting the club back to where it belongs, what everybody knows Manchester United are. I give my life for the club and that’s the most important thing. For me, when you’re in a squad with a lot of young players who share the same ambition and have the same drive, I can only see us succeeding. It might take us some time, but if we all stick to the game plan, work collectively as a team, and we’ve got a good manager who knows the club and who shares the same ambition, who knows what we can achieve?<br /><br />There’s a group of young players together and we can start to become what we decide to become. That’s an important thing to me: that we can start to help the younger ones coming through. It’s all part and parcel of growing up in a United shirt. It’s just the next step<br /><br />For me it’s just about becoming the guy that’s responsible and reliable. I feel like that’s the next step for me. Everything goes in order of the way it should be done. I remember these similar steps when I first went into the Under-18s and it takes you a season to grow into that standard of football. Before you know it, you’re one of the leaders there and you take responsibility on the pitch. Now I’m in that situation for the first team</p>

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford has delivered his verdict on the club’s new additions]</b> Over five, 10 yards, Daniel James is the quickest I’ve seen. It’s a massive strength, you can put everything in front of him. Harry Maguire brings calmness. Playing with him for England, you feel assured at the back, and for a team that’s massive. Naturally <b>[Wan-Bissaka]</b> is an attacker, and they’re always the hardest to get past because they understand what forwards are thinking. That’s what makes him a top defender. His physical abilities are very good. He’s young and with the attributes he has, you can only see him going up and up, and there’s not a better place for him to develop<br /><br /><b>[He also says that he hopes to be an inspiration to the players who make the step up this year]</b> That’s one of the things he (Solskjaer) holds on to very closely. He always wants to give them opportunity. I want to make a difference. I’ve experienced Champions Leagues, Europa Leagues, World Cups, so I’m in a great position to offer advice. I looked up to the likes of Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt coming through the academy and understand these players now look up to me, wearing the No. 10 shirt, scoring important goals. That motivates me</p>

Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar. If they’ve done something at the weekend I’d want to know how they’ve done it. Messi’s natural abilities are crazy. It’s a joy to watch him but also for the <b>[way he uses]</b> space. I remember the first time I played Barcelona in pre-season <b>[in Maryland, 2017]</b>, the team were like clockwork based around him. It wasn’t necessarily what Messi was doing on the ball that was, ‘Wow.’ It was the positions he was taking up, and how he affected a game without even touching the ball, that were also special<br /><br />When I was younger, I’d watch games, watch clips on YouTube, then go out, and try everything. I watched Ronaldinho doing that flip-flap. I watched a lot of the Brazilian Ronaldo when I was really young. Cristiano Ronaldo was the one that made you love the game and want to try things that people wouldn’t normally try. Just everything. It’s not scripted</p>

For starters, physically we’re at a much better position than we were this time last year, going into the season. We’re already three or four steps ahead of where we were last season, and now it’s about putting the fundamentals down about how we’re going to play<br /><br /><b>[When asked to pin-point specifics when it comes to the differences between Solskjaer and Mourinho]</b> I’d say the intensity change, from how we were towards the end of last season, to where we are now. It’s so clear to see the difference in terms of intensity, especially without the ball. That’s where we’ve taken a lot of strides forward. You learn different things under different managers. The time under (Louis) Van Gaal, it was perfect for me at that time to have a manager like that, he was patient with me and gave me time to learn the game. It wasn’t too much information thrown at me. Then under Jose I feel like we all understood the game a bit better, especially defensively. And now under Ole we’re trying to combine the two, and at the same time he knows the club for what the club is so he can spread his own messages too. For me it’s like it’s back to normal, and that is the most important thing. It’s been good. It’s been tough, but as a team I feel we’ve taken a lot of strides forward, so it’s been worth it.</p>

We go again in the next game and if we play how we played today, with a bit more urgency, we’ll be fine<br /><br />It’s simple. If you want to take it, you take it.

And so it should be. We practice pretty much all week and we score the majority of the time so there’s no reason why you shouldn’t have the confidence to take the penalty. Like I say, it’s unfortunate we didn’t score it but it’s not on him it’s as a team. We take that forward into the next game</p>

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford is at a loss in the battle to stop racist abuse]</b> It is disappointing. It seems to me that things are going backwards rather than forwards. All around the world people are standing together and that is all we can do. We have to rely on the campaigns to deal with this. Our voice only has so much power. Social media is a big problem. For me, it is too easy to do what you like on the internet. Anyone can go on and write what we want. It is easy to figure it out. There are hundreds of thousands who use my profile and they can write what they want <b>[in reply to tweets]</b>. There are a lot of things that need to change. I’ve never been a big fan of social media. I try and stay away from it, but it’s important for me to say my part.

I could use Harry as an example. He’s one of the best finishers that I’ve played with and whenever we do finishing, in my head, it’s about being as close to him as possible. So if he scores six, you want to score six, if he scores seven, you want to score eight. Little things like that are the bits that people never see. Even though we’re fighting for the same position, or to be in the same team, we really do drive each other on and it’s very important that you have that sort of atmosphere within a team. He <b>[Owen]</b> can only go on what he sees. Whereas the people around me <b>[know]</b>. Especially when I was younger, the reason why you started playing is because you see things that you like and for me, it was goals and watching exciting people doing exciting things with the ball. So, the important thing is I know what I want, what I want to become and what I will become if I keep my mind on it<br /><br /><b>[Rashford acknowledged missing chances plays on his mind]</b> Yes, it haunts you, it’s the same for when you score and you know you’ve had other chances in the game, you’re looking <b>[at]</b> what went wrong.

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford has revealed the secret behind his penalty technique after confidently dispatching from 12 yards against Leicester]</b> There has been a lot of talk <b>[about penalties]</b> but it is all about clearing that out of your head and just getting back down to basics. When it comes down to it, that is all you know, to get to the first team, it is by doing the basics and working hard. I just try to look at the keeper, especially a keeper like him because he has a good jump and likes to go early. If it is not hard and in the corner, then he has a chance of saving it. But it was a nice feeling to score<br /><br />The preparations are a lot more difficult for the manager and staff to get the work in. But we have used it as a positive, following the last game at Southampton. We felt we should have won that game so the break worked in our favour because we got to go away and clear our heads, focused on the games with the national teams and then came back with fresh minds. As a result, I think it was a bit more calm today. It felt like, on the pitch, we knew we were going to win. We have been playing well since the start of the season. Today wasn’t as good a performance but we got the three points. Football is funny at times and that’s how it goes. It is a big three points, not only for the league position but, for the team, it is big<br /><br /><b>[Ahead of a Europa League opener against Astana on Thursday]</b> We don’t have the biggest squad and we have some injuries, and to some very important players as well, but it shows good courage and strength to get through it. We are not worried at all. We have the players coming back and we have young players on the bench who are itching for an opportunity. When they get the chance, they will deliver. We are in a good place</p>

You know you think about the times that you’ve practiced, and you want your head to be focused<br /><br />I can’t say I’ve ever really enjoyed the attention off the pitch. That’s one thing growing up as a footballer that you never think about. You always think about playing in the first team and scoring goals for United or at Old Trafford or any stadium. But you forget how your life can change overnight. Things that you can do with your friends, things that you can do with your family, the places you can go, it all changes. And I probably wasn’t as prepared for that bit as I was the actual going on the pitch and playing. For me that bit was the easier bit. It obviously took a lot of hard work to get there but when the opportunity came up I felt ready to step up<br /><br />I remember a couple of months before my debut I was on the bench and at that moment I didn’t feel ready. I didn’t feel like I belonged in the first team. You know that’s why timing is so important. I wasn’t ready to play that game so I think the manager knew what he was doing at the time. Van Gaal is very experienced with young players and he wanted to wait for the right time. When I made my debut it just felt natural, it just felt like I was playing with my normal team-mates</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd star Rashford given award for charity work]</b> Wouldn’t normally share these types of things but this certificate is not just for me, it belongs to you all. Each and every one of you that has contributed the few pounds you can, you’ve all made a huge difference - 2.8 million children a week are receiving meals they otherwise wouldn’t have during this lockdown because of YOUR help. I couldn’t have done any of this without the help of you all and @fareshare. To be recognised by my city is a great feeling. From being young I knew that if I ever got in a position that I could help I would and I’m so proud of what we’ve achieved so far. Thank you all, you’re all superstars. And we won’t stop until children and their parents no longer have to worry about where their next meal is coming from. I appreciate you all, thank you to the High Sheriff of Greater Manchester</p>

  <p><b>[Rashford back and ready to lead <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> from the front]</b> I have sort of had my head down. It has been a tough period for me, the last few months, obviously being injured<br /><br />I have just been getting my head down and working. I am privileged enough to have the equipment I need at home so it is not much different for me as I do a lot of work at home anyway, so I am just staying indoors and making sure I am eating right. For me, motivation is always quite simple. It changes as time goes on, but now that everything outside the pitch is sort of dealt with, I can just focus on myself and improving myself. That is my motivation every day. Regardless of whether we are stuck inside or not, that doesn’t change.<br /><br />A lot of the things he (Solskjaer) is speaking about are instinctive. So it’s not necessarily something that you work on it, it’s just recognising certain pictures. If someone else is shooting, it’s instinct to follow in. You don’t practise that out on the <b>[training]</b> pitch but I think you get a lot of that from speaking to him</p>

That’s what makes the game so great.<br /><br />Before the lockdown, me and my family were speaking about how this situation can affect certain people. We came to the conclusion that some families and kids will be in vulnerable positions because their parents have lost their jobs so we knew their families will be affected and we decided to help. We just have to try and help people in different situations. That’s actually how the conversation came about. Me and my team started researching and learning more about the situation.

I watched the crowds waving their flags and fist-pumping the three lions on their shirts and I was overwhelmed with pride not only for myself, but for all of those who had helped me reach this moment and achieve my dream of playing for the England national team. Understand: without the kindness and generosity of the community I had around me, there wouldn’t be the Marcus Rashford you see today: a 22-year-old Black man lucky enough to make a career playing a game I love.<br /><br />My story to get here is all-too-familiar for families in England: my mum worked full-time, earning minimum wage to make sure we always had a good evening meal on the table. But it was not enough. The system was not built for families like mine to succeed, regardless of how hard my mum worked<br /><br />As a family, we relied on breakfast clubs, free school meals, and the kind actions of neighbours and coaches. Food banks and soup kitchens were not alien to us; I recall very clearly our visits to Northern Moor to collect our Christmas dinners every year. It’s only now that I really understand the enormous sacrifice my mum made in sending me away to live in digs aged 11, a decision no mother would ever make lightly<br /><br />This Summer should have been filled with pride once more, parents and children waving their flags, but in reality, Wembley Stadium could be filled more than twice with children who have had to skip meals during lockdown due to their families not being able to access food. (200,000 children according to Food Foundation estimates).<br /><br />As their stomachs grumble, I wonder if those 200,000 children will ever be proud enough of their country to pull on the England national team shirt one day and sing the national anthem from the stands<br /><br />As a Black man from a low-income family in Wythenshawe, Manchester, I could have been just another statistic.

  <p><b>[Rashford reveals <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> allowed him to join their academy early due to home circumstances]</b> My mum was a single parent, she had five kids all living in the same house. The programme that I started at 11 years old, you’re supposed to start it at 12 years old. It basically gives you accommodation closer to the training facilities and a new school and she worked that hard to push it forward because she knew that was a step I needed to take. I needed to be eating the right food as I was growing, I needed to be close to my team-mates, my new school and my new school friends. She made that decision when I was 11 years old and United allowed it. That was the reason I ended up going at a younger age to the others, it was to help my mum with her situation and also get me out of the situation we were in. So there is always a big element of sacrifice to get to the top level and that’s the one we had to make<br /><br />My mum, she did the best she could, we used to go to a shop called Pound World and everything was under a pound. We would schedule out the week, we would get seven yoghurts and you could have one yoghurt a day and so on. She did the best she could within the circumstances. There are some families out there, like mine, that have four or five kids and it is literally impossible for her to take control of the situation. This is all going on at a time when kids should be concentrating on school work and stuff like that. It is crazy to think this is still going on in 2020 and it’s something I don’t believe should be happening</p>
