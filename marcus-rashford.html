The thing that impressed me the most was the fact he was only young when he came into the side and he wanted to be the best player in the side. He worked hard every single day, you saw him in the gym every single day and the results came on the pitch. He openly wanted to be the best player in the world. You have to have an approach like that – all the best players in the world do. It’s not arrogance or anything like that, it’s the mindset you need to achieve things</p>

The likes of me, Anthony and Jesse - watching these forwards play and how they train, their mentality, is so important. You can’t ask for more. <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> is very easy to speak to and he’s easy to get along with. The way he approaches every game is about winning. He wants to win, regardless of the opponent, whether we are home or away, whatever the odds, he always wants to find a way to win. That mentality is what you need to be at the top level. That is where he is and where he has been for years</p>

Obviously I’ve grown up watching Rooney week in week, week out since I was young. They are the two you look at and try to emulate.<br /><br />For the young players coming up to see his character and the way he approaches every game and his mentality, it’s invaluable. Some players can’t bring that when they move clubs so we have to try and learn from him while he’s here and take what we can out of his game</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford admits he has had to hone his ability to transform a game from the substitute’s bench]</b> It’s important you do that. You don’t know where the manager is going to bring you on, so you have to do that for all the positions really. Just so you’re ready and mentally prepared for when you get on the pitch.<br /><br />So it is something you do when you’re on the bench but I think that’s only natural, for a player to be thinking about getting on the pitch, what you’re going to do when you’re out there and who you are going to come up against. It’s just about building on it and being able to repeat the same movements for the 90 minutes. I think it will come in time but I have to take it step by step. Sometimes, an approach can take time to perfect but it’s going well. It’s about almost singling out each player and each opponent you come up against so you know you can get a one against one. That’s when you know it is a good asset for me to use</p>

That is probably the biggest thing, not only for the young players but other players can take that from him as well. In fact, that is definitely the main thing. It’s good for the dressing room. Sometimes, if we’re down, he can pick us back up and, when we’re up, he keeps us up. Bringing in that type of player, it has been key.</p>

We were all sitting around in the dressing room after the match, not sure what to think. But then Wayne gets up. And he says one thing. Keep your head up. We’ve got a lot to fight for in the future. Look forward’. But he says it to each individual person. One by one, he goes up to us and looks us in the eye. So that’s where we are now. Our heads are up and we’re fighting for the future. I know I’m young – the whole squad is quite young – but we want to make history in the time we’ve got. We know that when people look back on our team, it’s the trophies people are going to judge us on</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford has revealed the immense buzz around his call-up to the England squad for Euro 2016 and how Louis van Gaal broke the news to him]</b> A lot of people think I came out of nowhere. And to be honest, this past year has gone by so quickly that I still can’t believe it myself sometimes. One day during training with United last season, my team-mates told me that I’d been selected for the national team to go to Euro 2016. I literally didn’t believe it. I thought they were joking. I’d only just made my debut for Manchester United a few months before. Phil Jones came up to me as we were heading into the changing rooms and said, ‘I’m tellin’ ya mate, you’re going to France’.<br /><br />As I made my way into the building, some of the staff were telling me the same thing. When I got my mobile phone out of my locker, there were messages from my friends, my brothers, my mum, all saying the same thing: England!!!!!!!!!!!!! At that point, I was buzzing, but still kind of confused. And then my manager at the time, Louis van Gaal, walked up to me. ‘Quick word?’ I didn’t know what to think. I mean, I had expected to play with the under-21s, but what he told me was massive. ‘The national team phoned,’ he said. ‘Go and enjoy yourself.’ That was it. I was going to France.</p>

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford has been used as a winger on a regular basis by Manchester United, but he sees himself as a central striker]</b> My overall game <b>[has changed]</b>. I’ve been playing in wider positions and now me knowing what the forwards wants helps me, and also helps me know that the winger wants when I get in the middle. The modern-day forward and attacker is not just a No.9 or No.10 or just a winger. It is someone who can interchange between the positions if they are needed to. I think I’m a No.9 but if I have to move to other positions for certain games it is what you have to do and it is part of your attributes</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United star Marcus Rashford says the benefits of playing alongside Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be seen for years to come]</b> You will see the benefits in years to come. What I have learnt from him is irreplaceable. His influence on the younger players, especially, is fantastic. We want that to continue because he is making us into better players. Now, when I go to the left or right, I see it differently to how I pictured it last season. They are things I didn’t have naturally inside me. I didn’t feel uncomfortable in the wide role, but when something is different it takes a while to get used to it. For me, the development has been going great all the way through. Next season I think I will have come across most situations that are going to occur.<br /><br />You look at all the strikers in the world now, I can only think of two, three who are No 9s - Harry Kane, Robert Lewandowski, Luis Suarez. Sergio Aguero? You could play him deeper as a No 10. The qualities a striker needs now are different to what they used to be. When you look in the first team here and there are players who have won 15, 20 trophies, you want to try and live up to that and even exceed what they have done</p>

But that’s what you do. It’s what you’ve always done. You want to play football all the time. Why change? One hundred percent I view myself as a street footballer. We used to play everywhere when I was kid. Parking lots over the road, the number of times we got told to come off the school field when the school wasn’t open. If we could we’d still do all those things, but it’s a bit more difficult now<br /><br />We still go to a quiet field every now and then, though, but the opportunities are a little less. Even at home I’m always getting that urge to go out and play football. Playing with my brothers, in the garden, in the house, anywhere</p>

The best thing about it is that you’ve earned it. He didn’t just come in and say ‘there you go - play every game’. He’s made us all work for his trust and respect. Sometimes it’s difficult and sometimes it’s easier but the players are all battling and improving to work for him. It’s massive for us and you can see how everyone’s come on this year.<br /><br />We’ve got to keep fighting till the end. As individuals, the way we’re made at this club is we want to win every game, no matter what game it is and what circumstances we’re in. It’s going to be the same approach until the end of the season</p>

Good competition is important if you want to be successful.<br /><br />The way they <b>[Ibrahimovic and Rooney]</b> think, their mentality towards the game, they are the biggest things that I can take from their game.

  <p><b>[Learning from Messi and Ronaldo readied Marcus Rashford for Man Utd competition]</b> You try to, especially when you’re young, until you find your own identity. You try to emulate those players a lot and they’re the things that make you into the player you are. Ronaldo, Messi, Rooney, Neymar - everyone knows good football when you see it and that’s what I like to watch as well. Teams defend a lot more now as a unit rather than man to man. There’s different ways to take people on and different things you have to watch against different teams. It’s hard to take a specific aspect but you can take things like mentality or characteristics.<br /><br />Without it, you don’t improve. Young players need that sort of environment around them. I think we’re both enjoying our football at the moment, we’re both having our say in the games, and it’s good for us, good for the manager, good for the team<br /><br />I’m a striker but if you have to play elsewhere to wait for your time, so be it. If I’m not playing there, I’m not playing there. But wherever I’m playing, I try to get the same results. Obviously you have to do it in a different way but it’s not my decision</p>

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford has revealed how Manchester United are helping him stay grounded]</b> There’s loads of different examples I can give you of ways they keep us grounded. If you are winning a game by a ridiculous scoreline, obviously as an attacker you might start messing about if you’ve scored three goals or whatever. But the coaches will tell you: ‘You’re beating them but still show them respect.’ They drill that into you from a very young age.<br /><br />Obviously the coaching is very good, but they also try to turn you into good people as well as good players. It’s about having respect for everyone, regardless of who they are or what they’re doing. That is probably the baseline at United, no matter what age you are. Just having that alone can get you a long way. It’s the main message they give you.<br /><br />Probably the way you have to look after yourself, and look out for yourself as well, because everyone is always trying to get something off the back of you. You have to take care of yourself. You just have to be smart and try not to put yourself in them situations as much as you can. But there are always people who are trying to build themselves up off the back of you. It can be your own friends, or even people’s family members. It’s difficult, but what are you to know? I have people around me that guide me and kind of keep me away from certain things. Sometimes as a young player, that’s what’s needed. I have friends. I just do normal stuff, to be honest. I play PlayStation and I take the dogs for a walk</p>

When you are younger than I am and you are learning the game I think you do need it. But my experiences from the past mean I understand that’s part of the game. There are only 11 players that can start - it’s just one of those things. It is something you have been through before. If it happens again you will probably deal with it better than the first time it happened to you. It is just another experience. In football you are going to be up, you’re going to be down. The most important thing is sticking together as a squad. Everyone turns up every day for training, we all work hard, we all do the necessary things. We are all in it together. Sometimes you are in the team, sometimes you are not in the team.<br /><br />Right now I’m probably not learning the most on the pitch. It is in training where I’m doing most of my learning. What am I learning? There’s lots of things. It is just the all-round game is starting to become more clear. Things this manager wants is becoming more clear to me. The more you do that, the easier the results come on the pitch. You have to take it into the game and today it worked.

The goal was world-class but he was teasing defenders by the touchline. His performance wasn’t perfect but he was enjoying himself, and that was good to see.

When you see his work ethic, it’s his determination to improve. It’s like what we were talking about with <b>[Cristiano]</b> Ronaldo and wanting to better yourself. There’s been times when we’ve stayed behind and practiced finishing. Genuinely we could stay there all day and just try to better ourselves and improve. That’s a quality in itself<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on his attitude in training]</b> Everyone is chilled but everybody wants to win, especially when things aren’t going our way.

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford insists he will take a penalty if England face a shootout at the World Cup]</b> I think he <b>[manager Gareth Southgate]</b> knows the players who are confident in those circumstances. I’d be willing to step forward. Not everybody here is a penalty taker for their club. It’s more if you feel comfortable taking one, which I do, that’s the way you go about it. If you don’t feel comfortable you have to be honest with yourself. That gives the team the best chance<br /><br />Colombia might not be talking about them but they’re definitely practising. I think it’s stupid not to practise, especially at this stage of the tournament. It’s not chance. It’s never chance. It’s a skill and every skill takes time to learn it and to perfect it. It’s a simple skill but it’s about being able to perform it with pressure and everything around it. I know goalkeepers practise them a lot. They practise their skills to become perfect at it. It’s definitely not chance if you might or might not score.</p>

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford admits a lack of regular starts for Manchester United is frustrating]</b> Every player will tell you it’s always frustrating when you don’t start. You have to look at the positives - you get two extra days’ training. It’s not stopped me developing. If it had stopped me developing then it’s more of a problem. He <b>[Mourinho]</b> has 20-25 players. Everyone has different attributes and suits different styles so finding the right balance is a tough job for a manager. He got it right most of the time last season but we need a bit extra to push for the title.<br /><br />You’ve got to be patient. You have to have an open mind because there are a lot of top players that all bring different qualities to the game.

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford is already a veteran of 27 caps]</b> I remember at first there were 40 or 45 of us and I’d say the real step up was when we got to maybe 10 or 11 <b>[years old]</b> and that number dropped down to about 20 and it started to get a bit more serious. Around that age, there were players coming from all over the world, so it got a bit more difficult. From the age of about 11 or 12, training with them more regularly was a massive part of my development and the other kids’ development as well. Training with your own age, there’s a certain amount that you can learn. But when you have the chance to train with older players, the level of learning, it goes up. You’re learning the same thing as what 18 and 19-year-olds are learning. So that was massive, a big learning curve for us all.<br /><br />I think the timing was very good. I think we needed something big to give the country some hope that we can win something in the near future. We didn’t get all the way in the tournament, but we definitely planted that seed where people can see that we’re growing and what we’re aspiring to be. The biggest thing is with the fans. I think it’s been a journey that none of us will forget for both players and fans that were watching all over the country. Back home was crazy<br /><br />These are very tough games, but this is the final step that we are at now - getting over the line against the biggest teams in the world. There’s no added incentive than other going there and beating them and that’s what we’ll feed off and that’s what will take us to the next level<br /><br />I’ve seen a lot of the younger players when they’ve been playing not only first team football but academy football as well. I think we all know their quality and the talent they have. It’s just about nourishing it to get the best out of them for our game. That’s the enjoyment in football, there’s always people ready to come in. Just by their selection, that shows the strength in depth we have throughout the nation. Hopefully we can go into these two games and I hope that they do well<br /><br />Trent has played quite a lot of games for his age. He’s performed well throughout his time. Consistency is the biggest thing so if you’re getting consistent minutes you improve and that’s what really separates as they get a little bit older. There’s a lot of talent and we have a lot of them here<br /><br />In terms of what you envision in the future, going to Fletcher Moss you’ve seen people do it before you, you’re sort of following in the footsteps of those players. That is important at that age. You have to be able to see your vision, see what your dreams are made of and definitely at Fletcher Moss they give you that platform. Of course, the facilities have to be in place for you to be able to do that and thankfully it was in place at the time and we had no issues</p>

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford says Cristiano Ronaldo is his biggest inspiration in football]</b> The thing that is a massive eye-opener for me now is I remember when he first came his talent was arguably one of the biggest talents that we’ve seen at United for a long time; to have him and Wayne <b>[Rooney]</b> in the same team was amazing when you look back. But the way he’s sustained his career and even improved year on year is just amazing. People don’t do that at his age, people are usually heading towards the end of their career and their level starts going down a little bit, but he’s just gone up and up and up. For me, there is no bigger inspiration in football. I could speak for a lot of young players and United fans that watched the team when he was here and the majority of us have followed him as he’s moved on in his career and that’s what’s special about United. Once you play for this club you become part of this family even if you move on. There is always something that remains in your heart, you could see that when he returned <b>[to Old Trafford]</b> from our fans. When you play against a player like that you have to respect his qualities but at the same time you have to play your game and you can’t show fear to that type of player.<br /><br />The home game was a game with a lot of lessons. It was a game where we could have lost 2-0, drew the game 1-1 or won the game 2-1. I think in that game we left it a bit too late, but we learnt from it and we go again. There have been times when we’ve got it right and there will be times when we get it right again and times when we don’t, but we have to understand that it doesn’t always go to plan, and we have to be ready for that. I think it’s good to have the two games quite close together because the first game is quite fresh in a lot of people’s minds. I wouldn’t say it’s easier to prepare for it, but you feel ready to face it.</p>

But it’s almost a different Arsenal side now, they’re playing better football, they’re a more aggressive team and looking at them now, they’re one of the strongest teams in the league. We have to take all that into account and no matter what happens we have to try to get the three points.<br /><br /><b>[On going two goals down at Southampton before fighting back to claim a draw]</b> It was disappointing and we paid the price for not starting how we should have started.

That’s what was in my mind: that whatever happens, go out there and give 110 per cent so when you come off the pitch you have no regrets. There’s no secret, it’s just a direct correlation: if you work hard, you get results. That’s always the thing I naturally go back to, especially when things aren’t going well. It’s just about hard work and us keeping on grinding out games when we’re not playing at our best, and at the same time we’re always trying to improve because we want to play our best football and that’s the level we have to get to.<br /><br />The fans want to see us win as much as we want to win for them. We just need to put the performances together as we have the quality to beat teams, which is easy to say but can be difficult sometimes. Right now, we’re in one of those periods where it’s proving difficult, but it doesn’t mean we stop trying to improve or win the games. It just means we have to try harder.

He has that know-how, the understanding, that’s the kind of thing you just pick off naturally off these type of people. Even not just out on the pitch, having conversations about it, it all adds up.

So they hold special value, probably, to every academy player at United. Then for me it was the players like <b>[Wayne]</b> Rooney, <b>[Cristiano]</b> Ronaldo. <b>[Ruud]</b> van Nistelrooy was very good.<br /><br />I think, probably the most all-round centre-forward is Sergio Aguero. Even on an off day, he can score you three or four goals. That, for me, is one trait of a centre-forward that I would take all day long. When you’re not having a good game, but you’re still scoring goals. That is a skill on its own. Also Harry Kane, his positioning, his movement - very clever player. I like <b>[Pierre-Emerick]</b> <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> as well<br /><br />It’s definitely a good feeling. I’d say before, maybe at about 17, goals and being a striker weren’t always a thing that seemed enjoyable. I’d always played on the wings and in a position behind the striker, and they were three positions that you can play through that you don’t have to stick to certain jobs, you know? You can play what you see and at first, when <b>[they]</b> were trying to get me to buy into becoming a forward, it was difficult, because the main thing for me was that you don’t see much of the ball sometimes. You might get one chance at goal and you have to take that chance, and it’s a different part of your brain, to be a striker. It’s completely different to the other positions. Before joining the first team, I was probably learning that and developing. But I’d say, especially over the last two years, that’s been at the front of my mind, and I’ve been trying to channel the way I play into getting goals and assists, and knowing which helps the team most. But, it’s difficult when you’ve been playing on the right, and playing on the left. Now, how you feel going into the game, it doesn’t matter, because the main focus for me and the team is goals and assists. And the way we attack is to always to score and get an end product from an attack</p>

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford claims to give my life for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> I think it’s a very exciting moment. For me it was just about getting the new contract out of the way and solidifying that I’m here for the club. It’s about getting the club back to where it belongs, what everybody knows <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are. I give my life for the club and that’s the most important thing. For me, when you’re in a squad with a lot of young players who share the same ambition and have the same drive, I can only see us succeeding. It might take us some time, but if we all stick to the game plan, work collectively as a team, and we’ve got a good manager who knows the club and who shares the same ambition, who knows what we can achieve?<br /><br />There’s a group of young players together and we can start to become what we decide to become. That’s an important thing to me: that we can start to help the younger ones coming through. It’s all part and parcel of growing up in a United shirt. It’s just the next step<br /><br />For me it’s just about becoming the guy that’s responsible and reliable. I feel like that’s the next step for me. Everything goes in order of the way it should be done. I remember these similar steps when I first went into the Under-18s and it takes you a season to grow into that standard of football. Before you know it, you’re one of the leaders there and you take responsibility on the pitch. Now I’m in that situation for the first team</p>

It’s something we’ve been focusing on, as the forward players. Hopefully today was just the start of it and we can keep improving and be more natural.

I’ve just been in my house doing my gym work and recovery, reading books, watching Netflix and just doing what I can do to make the time pass further. There’s not really anything you can do that comes close to being in the changing room and being in the team, so I’m not trying to chase that high. I had to have time off anyway because of my injury, but I’m fortunate enough to have a bike in the gym downstairs. Not much in that sense has actually changed for me because I can still do my daily routine that I was doing.<br /><br /><b>[Rashford is also heading up a campaign for the FareShare charity]</b> I didn’t know how high the numbers were of kids not eating at home other than school meals. That number kind of shocked me. And then I remember speaking to a friend who was saying there was an opportunity where we can help these people and FareShare allowed us to make it work. I don’t think I’ve actually ever done something at such short notice before. I thought let’s try and get to £100,000 and right now we’re on £97,000.</p>

But you know Rom is one of those guys who if, well, in that particular game he’d scored two goals already, he could have taken it and got a hat-trick. But he’s the kind of guy that when you play in a strike partnership with him, he wants you both to do well and he just threw the ball to me and said you take it. Which of course I was willing to let him take it because it’s an opportunity for a hat-trick you know which is obviously a very good achievement. But he just said he wanted me to take it so that was when you just sort of prepare yourself for the moment and just try and relax. You know you think about the times that you’ve practiced, and you want your head to be focused<br /><br />I can’t say I’ve ever really enjoyed the attention off the pitch.

But you forget how your life can change overnight. Things that you can do with your friends, things that you can do with your family, the places you can go, it all changes. And I probably wasn’t as prepared for that bit as I was the actual going on the pitch and playing. For me that bit was the easier bit. It obviously took a lot of hard work to get there but when the opportunity came up I felt ready to step up<br /><br />I remember a couple of months before my debut I was on the bench and at that moment I didn’t feel ready. I didn’t feel like I belonged in the first team. You know that’s why timing is so important. I wasn’t ready to play that game so I think the manager knew what he was doing at the time. Van Gaal is very experienced with young players and he wanted to wait for the right time. When I made my debut it just felt natural, it just felt like I was playing with my normal team-mates</p>

I think we just need to take each game as it comes and not get too ahead of ourselves.

  <p><b>[Rashford reveals <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> allowed him to join their academy early due to home circumstances]</b> My mum was a single parent, she had five kids all living in the same house. The programme that I started at 11 years old, you’re supposed to start it at 12 years old. It basically gives you accommodation closer to the training facilities and a new school and she worked that hard to push it forward because she knew that was a step I needed to take. I needed to be eating the right food as I was growing, I needed to be close to my team-mates, my new school and my new school friends. She made that decision when I was 11 years old and United allowed it. That was the reason I ended up going at a younger age to the others, it was to help my mum with her situation and also get me out of the situation we were in. So there is always a big element of sacrifice to get to the top level and that’s the one we had to make<br /><br />My mum, she did the best she could, we used to go to a shop called Pound World and everything was under a pound. We would schedule out the week, we would get seven yoghurts and you could have one yoghurt a day and so on. She did the best she could within the circumstances. There are some families out there, like mine, that have four or five kids and it is literally impossible for her to take control of the situation. This is all going on at a time when kids should be concentrating on school work and stuff like that. It is crazy to think this is still going on in 2020 and it’s something I don’t believe should be happening</p>

  <p><b>[Selfless Rashford leading by example in coronavirus pandemic]</b> My mum worked full-time, earning the minimum wage, to make sure we always had a good evening meal on the table, but it was not enough. The system was not built for families like mine to succeed, regardless of how hard my mum worked. The Government has taken a ‘whatever it takes’ approach to the economy - I’m asking you today to extend that same thinking to protecting all vulnerable children across England. As a Black man from a low-income family in Wythenshawe, Manchester, I could have been just another statistic. Instead, due to the selfless actions of my mum, my family, my neighbours, and my coaches, the only stats I’m associated with are goals, appearances and caps. I would be doing myself, my family and my community an injustice if I didn’t stand here today with my voice and my platform and ask you for help.<br /><br />Whether the outcome is that it doesn’t change, or it does change, I know I’ve done the right thing in trying to help these people</p>

  <p><b>[Rashford urges government U-turn on free school meals]</b> People often ask me how it felt to score the deciding penalty against <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> to knock them out of the Champions League last season, my answer is always the same: did we go on to win the tournament? I have been overwhelmed by the support I’ve received over the last 24 hours, from MPs and members of the public, but the feeling I have is exactly the same as when we got knocked out of the Champions League against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in the next round: what did we achieve if we didn’t get the result we needed? If we didn’t lift the Champions League?<br /><br />Today I focus on a trophy that stands for something much bigger than football. A U-turn on the decision to stop the free food voucher scheme continuing over the summer holidays could help us reach the next round but we still have a very long way to go as a country to eventually lift the trophy.

  <p><b>[Rashford says UK government has ‘done what is right’ with free school meals U-turn]</b> This was never about me or you, this was never about politics, this was a cry out for help from vulnerable parents all over the country and I simply provided a platform for their voices to be heard. I stand proud today knowing that we have listened, and we have done what is right. There is still a long way to go but I am thankful to you all that we have given these families just one less thing to worry about tonight. The wellbeing of our children should ALWAYS be a priority</p>
