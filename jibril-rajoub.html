  <p>[<a href="cas.html">The Court of Arbitration for Sport</a> has rejected the Palestine Football Association president’s appeal against a 12-month ban for ‘inciting hatred and violence’ against <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>. Ahead of Argentina’s scheduled pre-World Cup friendly against Israel in June 2018, Jibril Rajoub spoke out about the match amid the conflict and political tension between Israelis and Palestinians. The match was due to take place in Teddy Stadium, Jerusalem, a ground built on land said to have belonged to a Palestinian village before its destruction in 1948] He’s a big symbol so we are going to target him personally and we call on all to burn his picture and his shirt and to abandon him. We still hope that <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> will not come</p>

  <p>[Ahead of Argentina’s scheduled pre-World Cup friendly against Israel in June 2018. The match was due to take place in Teddy Stadium, Jerusalem, a ground built on land said to have belonged to a Palestinian village before its destruction in 1948. Jibril Rajoub spoke out about the match amid the conflict and political tension between Israelis and Palestinians. The match was ultimately cancelled] The Israeli embassy is sad to announce the suspension of the match between the Israel and Argentina national teams scheduled for Saturday June 9, as a warm-up for the Russia World Cup.<br /><br />The threats and provocations directed at <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>, which logically aroused the solidarity of his colleagues and fear of playing the friendly, are no strangers to the daily life of Israel’s civilian population whose sporting stars, to put it simply, have been on numerous occasions the targets of violence and attacks. The friendship between Argentina and Israel, which will soon celebrate its 70th anniversary, is not about a football match. The democratic country and plural state (composed of Jews, Muslims and Christians), will always eagerly await the chance to receive one of the stars of Argentine sport</p>
