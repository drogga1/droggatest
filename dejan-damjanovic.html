  <p><b>[Dejan Damjanovic has argued FC Seoul’s AFC Champions League <b>[ACL]</b> clash with Western Sydney Wanderers could be the last chance]</b> They’re in the same position as us, so they will try to make some good results to keep them in the group. It’s going to be for us maybe the last chance to come back in the group to make any chance for qualification. We need the three points to keep any chance to qualify from this group. So honestly I am not sure how they will play, but for sure they will not just defend and hope for some lucky goal on the counter attack, they’re going to try and play football. That’s normally how you have to play in the Champions League if you want to get good results, especially in an away game, you can’t depend only on defence and wait for the counter attack. When you play like this it’s very hard to get good results<br /><br />In 2014 they were unbelievable. They showed that Australian football is getting better and better, I am happy that somebody else won the Champions League other than Korean teams and Guangzhou <b>[Evergrande]</b> a few times. Honestly we didn’t play good, it looks like we played together for the first time. I think just mentally we were not ready for the game, and that was the biggest problem. You need to prove yourself every game, you need to prove to yourself that you are the best and you deserve to play at Seoul in the Champions League. Maybe it’s good to happen in the beginning of the season so that everyone can calm down and can come back in the normal mind, and we still have the time we need to recover<br /><br />This game in Gangwon, the pressure was on us and the pitch was awful, the weather was a bit cold and it was a really tough game. Luckily I scored a goal and we got the three points, and the pressure has gone down a bit so we are in a much better mood<br /><br />Our group is incredibly hard and the first two games show this. We are not in the best position, and now we have two games against the Australian team and Shanghai play directly against Urawa, so we need to do our part and make the best of these two games, and if it’s possible to take six points. I cannot guarantee <b>[anything]</b> but for sure we will try, and then we have a game against Shanghai over there. I am sure they are not better than us and we will not lose there if we make these two games good. In the end we have enough quality to pass this group, so we just need to show <b>[that]</b> and we need to perform better than these first two games.</p>
