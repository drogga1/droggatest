<blockquote>
  <p>[Liverpool turned a deaf ear to calls for them to sign Cristiano Ronaldo and Gerard Pique] I looked at Gerard Pique and I tried to get him. The Spanish delegation he was with at a youth tournament, I think it was his grandfather who was the delegate for the Spanish federation. Well he wouldn’t give me permission because I think Man United were already in at that point. I brought Cristiano Ronaldo [suggested to Liverpool as a signing]. That’s water under the bridge, I recommended him and saw him at a youth tournament.<br /><br />I tried to get John Terry to come. It went to the final day and they beat us at Stamford Bridge. After the game I went to speak to John Terry to try and get him. How I did it was, I went up to him in the corridor and asked him for his autograph. He said yes. As he was signing it I said: ‘Could you put your mobile phone number? Gerard Houllier would like to talk to you’. He put his agent’s number and said to talk to him. Gerard Houllier spoke to his agent on the bus. I think he just used us to get more money out of Chelsea. I also had Petr Cech, but at that moment in time we were trying to sign Chris Kirkland. I went to a game to watch Milan Baros and Petr Cech was making his debut. I then went to Argentina, I think it was in 2001, the Under-20 World Cup. You could have got him for a song. He was with Chmel Blsany and then he moved to Sparta Prague and then he moved to France [signing for Rennes].</p>

  <p>[Steven Gerrard will only consider leaving Rangers if Liverpool, Manchester United or Arsenal come calling] Rangers will mount a challenge to Celtic. And if you make a go of the Rangers job, why would you leave? It would need to be Liverpool, Manchester United, or Arsenal.<br /><br />Rangers will be some machine if Stevie can get them going. He felt he had too many of the same type of player when he came in. Too small. Nice footballers, but Rangers needed a bit of height and strength. Now they have a better squad and are better equipped. They don’t have enough to win the Premiership, but they have more about them than Aberdeen. They will finish ahead of everyone bar Celtic</p>
