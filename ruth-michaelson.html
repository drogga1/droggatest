<blockquote>
  <p><a href="ibrahim-halawa.html">Ibrahim Halawa</a>, from Dublin, was acquitted of charges including murder, arson and illegal possession of weapons at a mass trial in Wadi al-Natrun court outside the Egyptian capital on Monday â€¦ Halawa was arrested at a protest in August that year alongside three of his sisters. Three days earlier, the clearing of a protest camp in Rabaa al-Adawiya square in Cairo had left at least 817 people dead, according to Human Rights Watch<br /><br />Mass trials have become an increasing feature of Egyptian justice since President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi came to power in 2013. On Monday, the court in Wadi al-Natrun handed out 43 life sentences, while 399 other people were sentenced to between five and 15 years in prison. Fifty-two, including <a href="ibrahim-halawa.html">Ibrahim Halawa</a> and his sisters, were acquitted<br /><br />The US citizen Ahmed Etiwy was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in the Ramses Square protests in 2013, despite the efforts of the US senator John McCain, who recently implored President <a href="donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> to intervene as he did during the trial of the American aid worker Aya Hijazi</p>
