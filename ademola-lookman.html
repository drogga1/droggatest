  <p><b>[Lookman leaves <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> for <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> in £22m deal]</b> I am very happy to be back here and would like to continue where I left off in the second half of 2018 for <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a>. Of course, I am also looking forward to seeing my team-mates again and would like to help the team to continue to celebrate great successes. Finally I can play again in the Red Bull Arena in front of this great backdrop and the fans. And last but not least, I would like to thank God, the fans and <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> for making my move possible</p>
