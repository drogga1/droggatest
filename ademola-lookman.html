  <p><b>[Ademola Lookman decided to reject a loan move to Championship club Derby County in favour of Bundesliga side RB Leipzig]</b> I wanted a new challenge, a new league. The Bundesliga has a great reputation in England. Top stadiums with good, physically strong and disciplined players and games played at a high level. The training ground could not be better. The training center leaves nothing to be desired - it is all highly professional. The food in the academy tastes like a top restaurant!</p>

  <p><b>[On going abroad]</b> People said at the time I was crazy to go to Germany but I saw it as another learning curve for me. I’m glad I did go. I learned about being more of a goal threat.</p>

  <p><b>[Lookman leaves <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> for <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> in £22m deal]</b> I am very happy to be back here and would like to continue where I left off in the second half of 2018 for <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a>. Of course, I am also looking forward to seeing my team-mates again and would like to help the team to continue to celebrate great successes. Finally I can play again in the Red Bull Arena in front of this great backdrop and the fans. And last but not least, I would like to thank God, the fans and <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> for making my move possible</p>
