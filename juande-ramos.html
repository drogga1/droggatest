  <p><b>[Juande Ramos is looking forward to Real Madrid against Tottenham]</b> It’s a very special match. I think Tottenham have grown a lot since I was there. Both matches, the Wembley one and the game in Madrid, will be very special and even. I think that at the moment, Madrid are possibly a level above Spurs. They are European champions, they are at a very high level. I think second place <b>[in the group]</b> will be between Tottenham and Borussia Dortmund. They will have to fight it out, but within the group I would say that Real Madrid are the favourites.<br /><br />Yes, of course. You enjoy the situation they are experiencing because you are fond of them due to the time you have spent with them and you always leave friends within the club<br /><br /><b>[Ramos remains the last Spurs boss to win a trophy - the League Cup in 2007-08]</b> It was something that was talked about a lot over there. When I arrived, they had gone many years <b>[since 1999]</b> without winning a trophy and they always said that is what they most wanted, what excited them most was winning a trophy. And thanks to God, we achieved that. Now, almost 10 years have gone by and they haven’t won another title. I hope they don’t have to wait too much longer<br /><br />I always say that the problem I had at Tottenham that season was that, on the last day of the transfer window, they sold Berbatov, and a few days before they sold Robbie Keane. And the window closed without the possibility of signing replacements. We ended up without any strikers, the only striker there was Darren Bent. And we weren’t strong enough to save the season. In fact, in the next window, they spent £50 million to solve the problem …<br /><br />This is cyclic. Those footballers that were spectacular for Barcelona, like Xavi, he’s not there, <b>[Andres]</b> Iniesta is getting older. Those footballers, either they have lost some of their physical condition, or more of them have left. And now, Real Madrid are on the crest of a wave<br /><br /><b>[Real have reached the semi-finals every year since and won the trophy three times - twice under Zinedine Zidane]</b> His numbers are spectacular. He came out of Castilla to coach Real Madrid. He had a year as assistant to <b>[Carlo]</b> Ancelotti as well and I think that helped him. As a player he experienced all kinds of situations and now he is at a team that is among the best in the world. He has had spectacular results and he is managing the squad with a lot of intelligence</p>

  <p><b>[Former Tottenham manager Juande Ramos says the club’s problems at Wembley are difficult to understand]</b> That was a good win and it looks like it changed the sensation. The players Tottenham have are practically all internationals. They are players with a lot of experience. They have played many matches at all kinds of grounds. It’s a big pitch where they are very protected by their fans. Sometimes football has these things and they are difficult to explain.<br /><br />In that final against Chelsea, they were one of the biggest teams in the continent. And it was a final that we were able to turn around, we drew level and then won in extra-time. I don’t think it’s a problem with the pitch, but sometimes in football these things happen</p>

  <p><b>[Juande Ramos coached Real Madrid right before Cristiano Ronaldo’s arrival in 2009]</b> When you have those kind of players, Ronaldo or Messi, you know that they can score a goal or win a match at any moment. If the match is difficult, if it’s tight, those players can win the three points and resolve everything.<br /><br />That’s the whole change right there.<br /><br />I would say that they are situations that are difficult to compare because football evolves and changes a lot. I didn’t see Di Stefano for Real Madrid, but people talk about him a lot. People also talk about the five European Cups. I didn’t see them, so I don’t want to compare. There have been very important footballers. Raul was at Real Madrid for many years as well, he was very important for the club. So comparing if he is the best in Real Madrid’s history, I can’t compare because they are totally different eras. Gento won six European Cups, they are different situations …</p>
