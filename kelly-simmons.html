  <p><b>[FA confirm decision to end seasons in some non-league and women’s leagues]</b> This is the right decision for the leagues and their clubs, and they can now focus positively on planning for the 2020-21 season. Football has the ability to unite, rally and uplift, but for now health and wellbeing must be the ultimate priority. In these most challenging of times, we’ve seen a spirit and willingness within women’s football to support the wider community, which has filled me with a great sense of pride</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea champions &amp; <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> relegated from Women’s Super League]</b> Firstly, I would like to thank the clubs for their ongoing collaboration and support throughout this period. They have played a crucial role in helping to shape the decision-making process, with the welfare of the players and clubs first and foremost. I would also like to congratulate the players, coaches and staff of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>. Although the 2019-20 season has been prematurely curtailed, it has been a hard-fought campaign and their success is well deserved, with the outcome based on sporting merit. Women’s football has made huge strides in recent years, and The FA has been at the forefront of investment and support to help grow women’s football at every level of the game. Our commitment to the women’s game is unwavering and we will continue to work closely with the clubs to ensure we come back even stronger for the 2020-21 campaign</p>
