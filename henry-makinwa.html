  <p><b>[ABS FC head coach Henry Makinwa is confident his side will not crumble against Sunshine Stars]</b> It was a boost to us. Everyone knows MFM plays good football. They are strong and a serious team. So we beat them, and the boys were very happy. The victory has given us a boost and we hope to do better to defeat Sunshine Stars. Every game is a different story, different tactical approach, different players and different atmosphere too. To win MFM, we are coming to Akure to fight them and I’m sure we are not going to lose against Sunshine Stars. Let’s hope we win. No, I don’t think their salary row will affect them against us. Football is about 90 minutes. Footballers are footballers, during the 90 minutes they could forget their salary problems, but probably after they could remember again</p>

  <p><b>[Former Nigeria international Henry Makinwa has hailed the performance of the Super Eagles after they held Senegal to a 1-1 draw at the Hive Stadium]</b> It is a good outcome for the Super Eagles against Senegal. At least they avoided defeat even without much training together. The technical adviser <b>[Gernot Rohr]</b> has not lost with Nigeria. It’s a friendly match so psychologically all efforts are not effected by the lads and some players invited are to be seen as trialists<br /><br />John Obi Mikel should allow Wilfred Ndidi to take charge for now. He is simply better off seeing his performance for his club and with the country. For our forthcoming qualifiers, they must work smarter and pick the best lads playing in their clubs regularly. Nigeria can’t afford to lose out on major international tournaments for now. All players must be on their toes</p>

  <p><b>[We outclassed El Kanemi Warriors, boasts ABS’ Henry Makinwa]</b> It was an outstanding victory for us. We outclassed them in every department of the game. It was 1-1 before we had the second goal from someone who just dribbled everyone on the pitch to score. We couldn’t convert many of our chances though they had some impressive defending too. The victory will give us another confident boost to go to Akwa United. In Maiduguri, there pitch was not good. We couldn’t play good football because the turf was poor. But here in Ilorin, we had a standard pitch. It could have been more than two if we took all the chances we had. We missed more than four glaring chances. The difference in our performance in the first leg defeat and second leg victory was from the pitch.</p>
