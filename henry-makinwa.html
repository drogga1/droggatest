<blockquote>
  <p>[ABS FC head coach Henry Makinwa is confident his side will not crumble against Sunshine Stars] It was a boost to us. Everyone knows MFM plays good football. They are strong and a serious team. So we beat them, and the boys were very happy. The victory has given us a boost and we hope to do better to defeat Sunshine Stars. Every game is a different story, different tactical approach, different players and different atmosphere too. To win MFM, we are coming to Akure to fight them and I’m sure we are not going to lose against Sunshine Stars. Let’s hope we win. No, I don’t think their salary row will affect them against us. Football is about 90 minutes. Footballers are footballers, during the 90 minutes they could forget their salary problems, but probably after they could remember again</p>
