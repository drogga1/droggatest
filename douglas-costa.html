  <p><b>[Bayern Munich winger Douglas Costa believes Brazil can win the 2018 <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup Russia]</b> I’m world champion with Brazil <b>[in 2018]</b>. We have what it takes in the team. There is a big quality with players like <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> and <b>[Philippe]</b> <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a>. The new coach is also good. If we find ourselves as a team, we are among the favourites</p>

  <p><b>[Costa reveals initial <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> doubts after <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> move]</b> Believe it or not but when <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>’s arrival was being talked about, I asked ‘what will the dressing room be like?’ We all have to love each other as team-mates because we’re all looking for a place in the team - but <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> won everyone over very quickly.<br /><br />He’s a simple, hardworking guy who likes to win. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> were looking for a player with his mentality, so he’s given us a lot. When he arrived. I thought ‘the best player in the world has joined, right?’. As soon as he arrived, the club improved in every aspect. His contribution has been noticeable. He scores goals every week, he’s brought more fans to the stadium and we hope to win things with him so we make history with him by our side. He’s a stand-up guy, he’s hard-working and he’s always with us</p>

  <p><b>[Giovanni Branchini says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> held strong interest in Douglas Costa over the summer]</b> I sincerely say that <b>[Massimiliano]</b> <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> and <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> have never thought of letting him go. The interest of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> was strong, a club that has always been interested in the Brazilian. It was not the only club but in England it was certainly the most active team on the trail of Douglas Costa<br /><br /><b>[The injury concerns of his recent past appear to be behind him]</b> Douglas has had countless health problems. Last season he was very often injured. He is wanting to recover with great professionalism after standing still. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> never intended to sell him despite the big pressure from United<br /><br /><b>[Costa still has much to prove if he is to keep his place, but looks to be thriving under the guidance of former <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> boss Sarri]</b> Douglas is a ‘cool’ professional in the best sense of the word. He is able to adapt to everything. Just think of how well he did in Ukraine, in a country totally different from Brazil. He loves <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> but is able to adapt to every reality. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is a beautiful championship but for now United have failed in all their attempts to convince <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> to sell him. The player remained in Turin and is a champion</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus winger Douglas Costa hits out at agent’s claims of talks with Manchester United]</b> I’m writing to deny the baseless news published today, which said I was in negotiations with some clubs during the last transfer window. Since the start of this season, I’ve been clear that I wanted to stay here to win trophies and give blood for the <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> jersey. <a href="junior-mendoza.html">Junior Mendoza</a> is my only agent and the only person authorised to speak on my behalf.</p>

Therapy and recovery also for Federico Bernardeschi, who suffered a bruise to the right hemithorax. Douglas Costa suffered a low-grade lesion of the semitendinosus muscle of the right thigh and has started rehabilitation treatment</p>

  <p><b>[Indeed, on top of the commercial benefits of having ‘CR7’ in Turin, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> are also experiencing another ‘Ronaldo effect’]</b> Since he arrived at the club, the percentage of body fat throughout the squad has gone down. You often see <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> topless and his physique is awesome. It drives everyone on and we all want to have a body like his.</p>

  <p><b>[Guardiola asked me if I was ready to learn how to play football]</b> <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> was the person who made the biggest difference in my growth. He allowed me to play in the right role. He called me and said: ‘We have a plan for your career, are you coming to join us? Are you ready to learn how to play football?’. I replied: ‘Yes, I’m ready’.<br /><br />It was a very sad period for me at Bayern, though. I thought we would make it <b>[lifting the Champions League trophy]</b>. Each of us played really well. That team was one of the strongest and most technical I’ve ever played in. Of course, we also have an extraordinary group at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, but in that team every one of us was at the top of our game<br /><br />The club’s ambition is to win the Champions League, which is why I came to Turin to live this crazy adventure of trying to win it. We are trying - only raising that cup will give us the feeling of reaching our goal. I’m so focused on learning from <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, we have one of the strongest players in the world in our team. And if I’m 100 per cent and <b>[Paulo]</b> <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> is 100%, we can aim for a very high level. At the moment, I wouldn’t leave <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> for another team. You feel welcome and free, so I feel very well</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus winger Douglas Costa admits considering retirement over injury problems]</b> There are times when I think: ‘Can I still play?’. <b>[That’s]</b> because I go out on the pitch and get injured again. Then, when I watch it on TV, I remember this is my passion and that I can still play at a high level. This is what keeps me alive, I know football comes easy to me. It has nothing to do with money or being famous. The point is to do what you enjoy and have fun doing it. That’s my objective. I joke with Alex Sandro that I’ve had more scans than I’ve played games.<br /><br />People say, ‘Douglas has the potential to be one of the best in the world, but injuries are holding him back’. That annoys me. I have the potential to be a top player, but for reasons out of my control I can’t be. Every time I get injured, I ask myself: ‘What did I do wrong?’ I wonder why I can’t play consistently. It’s something that hurts me. Therefore, I asked for help. I don’t know if you’ve heard of a mental coach. They’re not a psychologist, but they show you how childhood facts can still affect you</p>
