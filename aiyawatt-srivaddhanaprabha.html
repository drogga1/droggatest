  <p><b>[Vardy used to turn up to <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> training still drunk]</b> I was against signing <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Jamie Vardy</a> in the first place. I asked <a href="nigel-pearson.html">Nigel Pearson</a> and <a href="steve-walsh.html">Steve Walsh</a> about him, checked the scout reports, and I started to believe he would be a good signing, but I had to answer the supporters who were asking ‘how is a non-league player worth £1 million?’<br /><br /> It turned out I was the dumbest club owner in the world to them. I asked <a href="nigel-pearson.html">Pearson</a> and Walsh, if I have only £1m transfer budget for the next season, who would you buy? And they replied ‘Vardy’. Then I said ‘go’There was outrage from the fans. Some even called me to say ‘are you nuts? Why have you spent this much on a non-league player?’<br /><br />Back then, I think he didn’t even have what it took to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. The day we bought him, he came to me and thanked me for changing his life. He had never had this much money so he was over the moon already. He went straight from the bottom to the Championship, which eventually led him to start drinking booze every single day. We had no idea what to do<br /><br />I didn’t know about this until someone told me that he came to train while he was still drunk. So I went talk to him myself, I asked ‘do you wish to end your career like this? Do you want to stay here like this? We’ll let your contract run out, then release you. Don’t expect a better career path’<br /><br />He said he didn’t know what to do with his life. He’d never earned such a large amount of money. So I asked him ‘what’s your dream? How do you think your life should be? Just think carefully about what would you do for the club. I invested in you, do you have to do something in return?’<br /><br />After that he simply quit drinking and started working hard in training. His physicality wasn’t as good as it is now. We know he had explosive acceleration, but we simply had no idea he could be this good. He’s adapting, working on fitness training, he’s turned into a new person. And that’s better</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s 2-2 draw at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> on Monday handed <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> the title and Srivaddhanaprabha believes team spirit is at the heart of the unbelievable success enjoyed by <a href="claudio-ranieri.html">Claudio Ranieri</a>’s side this season]</b> There is no special secret, but the team spirit is so great. They fight for each other and try to cover the mistakes for each other. They never stop and they kept believing. They are a special group of players and love each other. When we bought the club, we said we love football and we will try everything to make the club successful. If you asked if I believed: can we win the league? Maybe not realistically. My father said he wanted the team to be in the Champions League one day, and we set the plan with all the staff<br /><br /><b>[Srivaddhanaprabha added that <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>’s unlikely achievement, they were 5,000-1 to win the league at the start of the season, will provide inspiration for the whole world]</b> Is it a miracle? It is. It is inspirational and people talk about it. We set the standard of the sport and inspiration for the whole world. It is not just for the sport, it is life. If people use <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> as the standard now, if they fight, they try - then they can achieve one day. Everything has to be right as well. It is a miracle for the city, it is a miracle for the players, but we have a job to do. They worked hard to be in this position. It is not just lucky. All the middle clubs in the league will try now as they are inspired by <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>. They will believe so it will be more difficult for the big clubs and for <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> to try again</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="claudio-ranieri.html">Ranieri</a> pens extended <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> deal]</b> Twelve months ago, we brought to <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> a man whose knowledge and experience, we felt, could lead us into the next phase of our long-term plan. What he would go on to help us achieve, in the time we have achieved it, has been beyond anything we could have anticipated. Claudio’s qualities, both as a man and as a coach, have been very clear since the moment he arrived - qualities that have helped <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> to progress on every level. We have strong foundations from which to keep moving our club forward and I’m delighted that Claudio will continue to be part of that journey</p>

But we are duty-bound to put the club’s long-term interests above all sense of personal sentiment, no matter how strong that might be.<br /><br />Claudio has brought outstanding qualities to his office.

His warmth, charm and charisma have helped transform perceptions of the club and develop its profile on a global scale. We will forever be grateful to him for what he has helped us to achieve<br /><br />It was never our expectation that the extraordinary feats of last season should be replicated this season. Indeed, survival in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> was our first and only target at the start of the campaign. But we are now faced with a fight to reach that objective and feel a change is necessary to maximise the opportunity presented by the final 13 games</p>
