Both of them were very unfortunate with their injuries. They were both in their best moment of the season, playing regularly and were important for the team. So it was a huge downer for all of us, including them. All of us will take it as an extra motivation to win it for them because they have been very important to get us to Baku. They deserve us to give everything for them. Hopefully, we can do it.<br /><br /><b>[Azpilicueta’s first trophy for Chelsea was the 2013 Europa League where he featured heavily after his £7 million move from Marseille]</b> That was my first final with Chelsea when I was 23 years old. The stage is different when you’ve experienced those kinds of games. I’ve got that in my backpack and it will help me hopefully in Baku. I’ve had a couple of experiences winning trophies, playing in finals, and obviously that helps the other people as well. Having a few of us that have played regularly in big games is important to help your team-mates. A couple of players never played in a European final. We have to work together because it’s a big game, it’s a derby, and hopefully we can win it. When you play your first final you don’t have the experience of those kinds of games, and sometimes the small details can make the difference. We have to be ready to be focused.<br /><br />Every team is prepared for it and we have to be ready. Honestly, with a trophy in the middle, it doesn’t matter who you play. You want to win it. Arsenal is a derby, we know it’s a big game, and that gives us an extra feeling, but every time you play a final you want to be a winner. It doesn’t matter who you’re facing. When we started the season we wanted to get into every trophy possible and to get into the Champions League. We did it through the top four, but when we started our first game in Greece, we were targeting Baku and trying to get the trophy<br /><br /><b>[Azpilicueta says the pair haven’t discussed who will lift the trophy, should they win it, and he thinks it will be decided in the moment]</b> I don’t know <b>[what we will do]</b>!

  <p><b>[Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta admitted Eden Hazard will be a big loss]</b> It’s a big loss for us, as a player and as a person. We came here together seven years ago, we have won six trophies, it’s been amazing on and off the pitch for me. I can only wish him the best because he’s a very good friend of mine. The desire he’s shown on the pitch for the club, his behaviour as the star man, I think everybody in the club loves him.<br /><br />He’s not selfish - a lot of times I heard rumours about him leaving. In other situations maybe other players could push but he didn’t do it. I can only say all the best and we’re going to miss him<br /><br /><b>[When asked whether his head coach should stay]</b> It’s not my choice. Obviously Maurizio is the manager. We started the season quite late. In February, March we were in difficulty, we were sixth in the Premier League and everybody thought we were out of the Champions League. We came back, we finished third… lifted the Europa League <b>[and]</b> lost on penalties in the Carabao Cup <b>[final]</b>. I think if you look at the whole season it has been very great</p>

He is an amazing person, an amazing player. He has been a very important part of our team. A very good friend of mine, very close. We arrived here seven years ago together from France and you know if that moment comes <b>[Hazard leaving]</b>, obviously I will be very sad. Honestly, the times that he had to cope with the rumours <b>[was tough]</b>. He always showed his desire not to sign for an English team, even if he could have better contract offers. He has never been a selfish person. He always had this dream to play for Real Madrid and we will see what happens. But I think he has been very honest until the last day. That’s why the fans love him because he didn’t play with the club, he didn’t move for another contract. He just always gives his best. He was very clear with the club and that’s why the club is also happy with him. Obviously, it is a big opportunity for him. He has been amazing for us and I hope he still wins trophies at Real Madrid.<br /><br /><b>[Wednesday’s European success is a big moment for Azpilicueta, who is likely to take over as club captain with <a href="gary-cahill.html">Gary Cahill</a> set to leave in the summer]</b> It is a proud moment.

Our performances were not good enough. We turned it around and won the Europa League but you can see that this season all of the fans are very happy we have the gaffer back at the Bridge. Now we have to give it back by working hard on the pitch, by winning games. We are very happy to have him with us. I can’t add anything to his career at Chelsea as a player. But, over his first week in training, I’ve seen the way he wants to play, the way he wants us to feel the shirt, the way he wants us to train every day, it is something special.<br /><br />He was here for a very long and very successful period, and always set an example: how he wanted to break every record or improve himself in every session. We have to be grateful and feel the passion for the shirt. We are very excited and the only way we can carry it on is by winning together, getting the feeling back of being all together as a club.

They have been working together with the group of players and the manager for a few years.

It’s a tough scoreline to take but we weren’t clinical in the boxes and after we conceded two goals in two minutes, things were more difficult for us. From that point, we were more open and gave them more spaces, they got more confidence and at the end, we got a tough result.

  <p><b>[Cesar Azpilicueta is excited to see the impact that Chelsea’s young players can make as he welcomes a change of approach under new manager <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>]</b> The level they - <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - showed in the Premier League has been amazing. It’s the first time in history that a team over 90 points doesn’t win the league, so when you see the results you know they set the standard very high. It’s up to us, and to the other teams, to rise to their level. It’s true that the transfer ban is not a help, but I believe in the group that we have. I believe in the young players that we have. A lot of players through the academy have been on loan and we’ll work hard to carry it as far as we can.<br /><br />We have the examples of <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a>, of Reece James, of Mason Mount playing regularly in the Championship <b>[last season]</b>. We have the academy players who reached the final of the UEFA Youth League like Conor Gallagher. Charlie Brown was the top scorer. The left-back, Ian Maatsen, won the European U17 Championship, so we have very good players coming from the bottom. But they need time as well. It’s difficult to go straight <b>[into the first team]</b> but the loan team, the academy, they are doing an amazing job. We’re very happy to have Ethan Ampadu, <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a>, <a href="andreas-christensen.html">Andreas Christensen</a> and <a href="ruben-loftus-cheek.html">Ruben Loftus-Cheek</a> and they have been doing a very good job. I think it’s what the loan team are looking for - clubs to play, to get experience, and then when they get back they have improved.<br /><br />That’s what they are trying to do and I think the results have been very good. Maybe we don’t get the credit that we deserve because we didn’t get many players through the academy to the first team. I think that this situation is something that people felt with Chelsea that we win trophies in the academy but then we just send 40 players on loan and don’t get them to the first team. I think in the last few years we have changed this. They are still winning trophies in the academy and some are getting minutes on the pitch so I think it is what we all want - to get academy players into the first team. I think Chelsea is a big team and it is difficult to get in the first team, but they are doing a very good job. We are seeing it now and we are sure we will get more and more through the years. We are ready to have a very strong team.</p>

  <p><b>[Cesar Azpilicueta claims Jorginho is revelling in new <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> role under <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>]</b> Jorginho has impressed me a lot since he arrived here with us. Obviously he was doing what the manager (Sarri) at the time wanted from him, which was to play short and to control the game in a different way, to touch a lot of the ball maybe without being dangerous by putting balls behind the defence. I think this season he has adapted to the <b>[new]</b> manager. He prefers to play a bit longer, to switch the play with longer balls to get more commitment in the final passes to get more chances for the strikers. Apart from that, his work rate has been amazing. The way he reads the game, he wants to press, he recovers a lot of balls. He is a very important player for us through the season<br /><br /><b>[The 30-year-old is enjoying working with <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> and has his sights set on maximum points this week]</b> For myself, the season before the manager asked something different. We are playing with more intensity, we are pressing higher up the pitch. We want to control the game, we attack with the full-backs and cross more. Last season we were more trying to get through the lines with our passes. I’m enjoying it and hopefully we can take the momentum from the last two wins at home into this game. And into the <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> game on Sunday, where we would like to finish both with wins and go into the next month with better results</p>

The way he worked for the team, the way he always showed the ability to get the ball, to dribble, not to have any fear and hide in-between the full-back, I think Callum is a very important player for us.<br /><br />He’s going to be a massive player in the future for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> but we have to accept the progression.

So fair play to Christian for continuing to work hard. When he has come on in the last two games he has made a significant impact and he changed the game. He nearly got an assist last Saturday but he was running at people, he was taking people on, creating chances and tonight he got the assist.

I know I got criticism, which was fair, because I was not at my level. My job is to work hard in training sessions, to work on my game, to keep improving and obviously I am very pleased to keep two clean sheets in a row.

  <p><b>[Cesar Azpilicueta believes <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> is capable of becoming <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s top scorer]</b> He has the potential to go even higher. We know we are still in December with a lot of games but with his passion and hunger, he is capable of getting to the top, for sure. I am confident that he can get many more goals because of the way he is working and improving since he started pre-season. Not only is he scoring goals. He is playing for the team, recovering the ball and he made a tackle in our own half - that was an amazing effort for him. He made an assist as well <b>[against Villa]</b>. I am not just looking into his goals as a number because he is doing more than that. His desire is amazing. When he was injured, he wanted to come back as soon as possible.<br /><br />I think for him it was special to play against <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> where he got promoted to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and where he had an amazing spell there. So for him, it was a special game. I am very happy for him because he showed that strength of character to play, score and get an assist. He was key for us. He showed his desire in pre-season to be a striker for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. It is something he has dreamt about and he worked for it all the way through the academy. He got his chance and is making the most of it. <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Vardy</a> is doing an amazing season with a lot of goals and Tammy is behind him so if he is there, it is because he deserves it<br /><br />It’s something we have to improve because we are conceding a lot of goals. We made it more difficult for ourselves. If we kept a clean sheet and went in 1-0 at half-time then the second half could be more open and we would have had everything in front of us. And against <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>. If we don’t concede I’m sure we could push and maybe score one goal and win. Against <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>, even if it was not our best game, 2-0 was enough. It’s an area where we need to improve because defensive solidity is key throughout a season and I’m sure we’ll keep working hard to get that. Offensively, we’re creating a lot of chancing and scoring a lot of goals.<br /><br />We are creating more <b>[chances than we are taking, though]</b>, I’m sure we’ll get that killer instinct better through the season. You’re going to have games like this. You can’t win every game 3-0 in the first half and thing go easy. Sometimes you have to dig in and work hard - even though we were 1-1 at half time and deserved to be ahead. The reaction of the team after the equaliser was very good. We put a lot of pressure on them. Even at 2-1 we created a lot of chances. It was just a lack of killing the game to enjoy the final minutes. We played three games without a win. We needed a good reaction from Saturday. It wasn’t a good game and not a good result. We were facing a good side and we saw that. We had to suffer until the end. The most important thing was the three points <b>[against Villa]</b>, even though we could have won more comfortably with the way we played</p>

I hope everything gets clear and we eradicate it as soon as possible. It’s an issue not just in football but in life</p>

  <p><b>[Azpilicueta encouraged by rapid progress under <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>]</b> We cannot forget the young players and where they were last year when they were playing a different competition and they were playing in different circumstances. We know that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> requires the highest level in every game and that means playing every three days in the Champions League and in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, every game fighting to win and be at the top, so we have to respect that and the young players have shown great spirit and great mentality to grow day by day, together with the staff and with the coach. We the senior players try to help them as much as possible but they have shown great strength and it is one more step towards their development. I am very pleased with the whole team<br /><br /><b>[Willian bagged a brace in a 2-0 derby win over <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> We have been conceding a lot of goals, we did not win points, it is a fact that we lost many games for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and now we have come to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> to play a team that were in good form and we showed great spirit, we fought and we know what it means for the fans and for all of us. That spirit made a huge difference in the game. It feels very good for us, for the fans, to come here and win after a run that was not the best, and to keep a clean sheet. It is a very good win. We prepared very well during the week, we knew that we were coming to play against a tough team but we did our job, we knew that we had to recover that fighting spirit and that it was a London derby with what that means to everybody in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. We did very well, with the quality we have in the team like with <a href="willian.html">Willian</a> with these two goals and every piece of football he did in the game was amazing. We fought and we played some very good football. It is due to the whole team doing an amazing job and I am very happy with it</p>

  <p><b>[Cesar Azpilicueta has said that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> need to rediscover respect from opponents at home after their 2-0 defeat to <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> on Boxing Day]</b> We haven’t managed to score or win in the last couple of home games, and it’s a big issue if we want to keep the consistency and stay where we want to be. The fans want us to perform and get results and we are not giving them that. It’s true at home we face teams who sometimes sit back more than when they play at home and we can find more space. But it’s up to us to find a way. In the first half we shot once on target. In the second half we got the ball in the box, we went past a defender, but we didn’t find the man in the box, or we didn’t create the chance to get a goal. We are putting ourselves in difficulty. It’s up to us to find always the consistency, the level to play home or away, against any team. We know every game in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is very tough. When teams see you are losing points at home they come with more confidence. We have to recover this respect at home<br /><br /><b>[Asked about the outlook for a tough couple of fixtures]</b> When you lose a game you want to bounce back as quickly as possible. We have to find a way to do so in two days’ time. We have to react, but I have to be clear, we can’t be the whole season up down, up down. It’s key in the second half of the season we recover our consistency, the solidity at home, and keep growing as a team</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta is worried teams no longer worry about travelling to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> to face his team]</b> It’s true that when teams see we have not won games, they come here with more confidence because they see they can do it. So forget tactics. Everything is about recovering the respect at home, being solid at home, because it is not normal to lose so many games in your stadium. I don’t think the pressure of playing at home should be negative. It should be the opposite. We have the players, we have the quality and we have to turn it around straight away. The lesson has been very harsh - losing three <b>[recent]</b> games and scoring zero goals<br /><br />It’s difficult to understand why this is happening. Normally at home you find teams a bit more defensive, we can enjoy more time on the ball and you can create more chances. It’s up to us. When you play at home it is not about the rival, it is about yourself - about moving the ball quick to find the spaces, to create chances and give the fans and ourselves a lift</p>

  <p><b>[Cesar Azpilicueta has called for patience with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s young forward line after they failed to kill off a game at Brighton which ended in a 1-1 draw]</b> Well, we have had ups and downs. We have had an amazing run of games where we were winning. Then in the last few games we haven’t found consistency and lost a lot of points, especially at home. That is something we are trying to improve on as quickly as possible because to be at the top; we need to find consistency at home. We need to be solid again and to recover our home form because we know every game is difficult but we know with our position that it is in our hands.<br /><br />We have it in our hands. We are in fourth position and if we do our job, then we will finish in the top four. It is up to us; we know that we have a lot of games. We know that for the second part of the season we have <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup and Champions League coming in. When we were winning back-to-back, we were winning as a team. Now we don’t win; it is up to us. We work together to try to get it because we cannot forget that we have young players around, but we are <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.<br /><br />Every time we go to the pitch, we go to win. In every game, we show that we want to win. It is true that sometimes we are not at our level but it is up to us to raise it to get to where we want to be. We cannot forget where most of them were last season. They were playing in different environments and circumstances. It is their first year in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and they are doing amazingly well, it is part of the process and we need to keep it all together. We are very happy that after the hard work from the academy coaches and staff that these young lads have their opportunities. Some are coming back from loans; some are from the academy and directly now with us. It is part of their progress and I am sure that they will keep us growing as a team<br /><br />Sometimes through games, you have better periods than in others so when you are on top of them you have to try to make the most of it and it is not the first time it happens that we are better than them and we don’t put the game to bed. At 1-0, you risk it. Today we were punished in the second half. We started very well. We controlled the game. We scored the first one and we could have killed the game in the first 45 minutes we were much better than them but we were not able to do it. Then, we lost a bit of control and Kepa made good saves to get at least a point from the game.<br /><br />When you don’t win, it is always bad. At <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, we fight every time to win the games. When we don’t win we are not happy and we came here to get back-to-back wins in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> which we haven’t done in a while and we were not able to start the year in a good position</p>

  <p><b>[Azpilicueta talks about what it means to represent the club]</b> I think one of the characteristics of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> throughout this period has been winning trophies and even when we didn’t win something, we didn’t have any long spells without lifting a trophy. That’s obviously a big part of the ambition of the club, to always aim for trophies, and it’s something we have done not only in England, but also in Europe, with the Champions League and the Europa League twice. We have won <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> a couple of times since I arrived as well, so I think it’s in our DNA that we always fight for trophies and hopefully we can keep going in this direction</p>

This is the best time to recover this solidity, with three big games in a row at home where we can show we are ready and able to make <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> a tough place to come. With the fans we have had some disappointments at home altogether. When these three opportunities come we have to take them one by one, and hopefully we can build up on this. It’s key for the success of the season<br /><br />I have improved at my movement attacking set-plays. For most of my career I was not going up for attacking set-plays, but a few years ago I started, and then you improve. At training I work on my movements, getting in to the right spaces. I have a determination as well. To be hungry is very important, because I’m not the tallest. I’m pleased to score goals, even if it’s not my main job</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea have followed <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s lead in making a stand against racism by creating a symbol in training to support the Black Lives Matter movement]</b> We have seen recently the result of racism and we see every day that that kind of hate has to be eradicated from society, and we have to play our part. There is every day the possibility to lead by example, to behave, to educate the children into a better world because we know that education is key for the future. We know the young generation is coming behind us and we want to leave them in a better world with more possibilities without any kind of discrimination or racism, so everything matters and it is time to speak up and to face up to the attitudes that we are seeing. There is no place for all of this. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is a club that leads by example, always on the front foot in tackling racism and all kinds of discrimination. We are very proud to be part of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and to take action when we participate in any campaigns. You want to try to help in the way we can. It is part of our values and we take it very seriously. We see many incidents of discrimination in every part of the world and it shouldn’t happen. We are all equal and it doesn’t matter our origin, the colour of our skin, our religion, our sexuality, we are all human. To have the same opportunities and respect for each other is the key, next to education, to see all people as other human beings and not to discriminate. It is important to respect each other and to learn from each other. We come from different backgrounds but we can all appreciate each other and get love from each other, and in the end have a better path for the world</p>
