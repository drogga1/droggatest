  <p><b>[Azpilicueta planning Chelsea stay amid Barcelona transfer talk]</b> The truth is right now I am only thinking about Chelsea and I feel loved here. I’ve been here five years now and I extended my contract not long ago. Of course it’s flattering to be linked to Barcelona: it means you’re playing well. I wasn’t hearing those sort of stories last season. That’s a consequence of us being top of the Premier League, things are going well. My objective since I arrived was to grow as a player and a person. I’ve adapted to the city, to the country. I feel settled, I’m comfortable with the language, my family is very happy. Right now my only objective is to continue with Chelsea.<br /><br />It would be a shame because we have a great team. But the club will work on it with the coach <b>[Antonio Conte]</b> and the technical staff. They will know what he wants. We need to get this season finished first. Then there will be all sorts of rumours. In the end I’m sure we will have a very competitive team again</p>

  <p><b>[Cesar Azpilicueta believes that Chelsea will only continue to grow under new coach Maurizio Sarri]</b> It’s been really good since the first day. We’ve been learning his methods and I think the team looks better with every minute. We know we don’t have a lot of time to prepare for <b>[the new season]</b> so we have to work hard to pick up the movements we want to do. I think we saw a good team against Inter and we have to play collectively to get the results.<br /><br />We are improving and we have to keep learning in the games that we have on Wednesday and then on Sunday against City. We know we can still improve, we have room for improvement and we want to work on that aspect<br /><br /><b>[Azpilicueta stated that he would be willing to fill whatever role is required of him at Chelsea this season]</b> I’ve always said, I try to adapt. Every time that I play in a different position, I want to improve and to prove myself. But the most important thing is to give everything for the team</p>

  <p><b>[Cesar Azpilicueta thinks Callum Hudson-Odoi is ready to be an ‘important player’ for Chelsea]</b> Callum is really young. He has showed great quality and character. He is playing very well. His performance in this pre-season has been very good. Now it is up to him to keep at this level. I am sure that if he can keep doing the things that he is doing right now for the team, then he will be very important. That’s something that he has in his hands. We will try to help him and I am sure he will be important for us. I started at 17-years-old when I made my debut. It is about consistency. He is coming from an academy level. He played with us a few times last season and he has been with us during this pre-season and he is improving. That’s really important and I know that he still has room to improve. He is only 17 and he can go really far. I am sure that if he keeps his head and the way he is performing then he will be very good. Every time he went one-vs-one against him <b>[Bellerin]</b>, he was creating problems. In transition he was very good and with defensive work.<br /><br />It is a different style. We have been enjoying it from the first day, learning and improving on what he wants. I think we have played against a good team in Arsenal and we could see the way we want to play. Now we face Manchester City in the Community Shield. We know that they are a very good team, but we will try to play our game. For example, two years ago when we switched to three at the back then from the first day we were very good. Hopefully we can switch again to a back four. It is true that you never know how long it can take, it is true that we still have a few players who are not with us, but with the squad we have, we have to try and go with everything we have on Sunday and try to lift the trophy. The way we play is we attack forward, we defend high, we try to get the ball from them and then play our football. I think today we could see very good combinations, playing from the back, pressing high, so that’s the way we want to play against them and that’s the way we can win the game</p>

  <p><b>[Cesar Azpilicueta is happy that Chelsea brought in Kepa Arrizabalaga from Athletic Club for £71 million]</b> He’s a young goalkeeper, a top man, and I know him very well from the national team. He is very talented and has a great personality and I think the only way he can go is up.<br /><br />He will keep on improving, he has a lot of his career ahead of him and I was very happy when he signed here because he can give a lot to this team. He can play with his feet, he can manage and control the defensive line and he is very agile and mobile on the line, so I think he has all the attributes to be a top goalkeeper<br /><br /><b>[Azpilicueta admits that captaining the side is something that he is proud of]</b> I am really proud to wear the captain’s armband and to lead the team. I always try to help my team-mates and the club, but I’m more happy about it when we win the games at the end. It’s true that to have the armband is something I am really proud of, but I always try to do my work as well as possible</p>

  <p><b>[Cesar Azpilicueta believes Eden Hazard is capable of becoming the best]</b> I know Eden, we came here together and I played against him in France so I have seen him for a long time but, yes, I’m sure he can be the best. He has that quality of eliminating defenders. It’s amazing. But this season he is adding goals and assists. Sometimes he was playing very good but maybe not selfish; he always gives passes to team-mates. Messi, Cristiano, they score 50 goals a year and that is very difficult in England. But from his point of view, if he’s more aggressive in the box by scoring goals and making assists, he will be the top of his game. In normal play he can create chances. It looks very easy. He goes quick, he scores with both feet. Eden has all the qualities to be the best. And his personality as well, the way he behaves. He’s the best player in the team but the way he respects everyone, he’s a normal person. That’s amazing to have the best player and his behaviour and everyone loves him in the club. That’s as important as his work on the pitch.<br /><br />The gap was very big and obviously it was a disappointing season in the Premier League because we missed out on the Champions League. It’s up to us to close that gap. We have to work hard and if we keep working the way we are doing, we can be close to City. We have to show it on the pitch. Off the pitch it’s silly to talk about. Two years ago, when we won the title, it was opposite. We were top of the table and they couldn’t get us. Mentality is key in winning the league. It’s a very tough league and you have to fight against very good teams. No team give you any gifts. The moment to tell about this is on the pitch - and in May</p>

  <p><b>[Cesar Azpilicueta targets Premier League title challenge with Chelsea]</b> I hope, I hope. After the draw against Manchester United we needed to get back to winning ways. We know if we want to be top, we can’t miss out on a lot of points. We played in a difficult place, Burnley put a lot of pressure on us. They know very well how they play but, apart from the first 10 minutes, we controlled it very well. We scored four goals and had other chances as well. We try to play the same style everywhere, home and away. Maybe away from home teams press us more and we can get out of the pressure. At home, some of the teams just sit back. It’s up to us to find the solution in every situation against every opponent because every team is different.<br /><br /><b>[On Eden Hazard]</b> Eden is an amazing player. Unfortunately, he couldn’t be with us because of injury, but we are a team and have to fight all the conditions. Eden was not here, he was not involved and we had to play a good game in a difficult place. We got a very good result and performance. Since Sarri came he was very clear the way he wanted the team to play, collectively and individually in every position. He demands that in every training session, he makes it very clear. Obviously, with the team winning, we are enjoying the style of play. We have a lot of possession, a lot of options. We create a lot of chances. That’s the way, but we still have room for improvement and we will work hard</p>

Hopefully there is a lot to come and we can keep Chelsea where it belongs</p>

  <p><b>[Cesar Azpilicueta, fresh from signing a new four-year contract, claims to have never given any thought to leaving Chelsea]</b> Since I have come here I have felt at home and I never had anything in my mind that made me think about moving abroad. When I had periods when I didn’t play I always felt the confidence from the club and from the manager and my only focus was on the pitch, and to work hard and to get my place. So I think everything has been very natural and progressive and I was always focused on improving as a player and winning trophies, which I think is what every player wants to do.<br /><br />The only response that we can give is on the pitch in this game. We know we are facing a team that at the moment is unbeaten but it does not matter who is in front of us, the fans deserve a reaction from the first minute at the Bridge. We have to do a big game as a team, playing all together. We know that after a defeat it is not easy but there is no choice, we have to analyse what we did wrong and what we are doing well to try to win. We need a big, big performance from everyone. Hopefully we can bring back the happiness to the club and the fans</p>

The first five or six minutes went well but that is not enough. It is very frustrating and disappointing. We are conceding a lot of goals and we cannot accept that.<br /><br />When you lose 6-0 we have to accept we didn’t play well and made errors. We knew it would be tough. When we won at Stamford Bridge <b>[a 2-0 victory in December]</b> it was because we played well and were together. Today was not the case. All I can do is apologise to the fans because it is not acceptable</p>

At Chelsea, we are used to winning a lot of trophies and we have been the most successful team in England for the last couple of years. So, the only thing I can say is that we will give everything and work hard.<br /><br />We know we have the Europa League game coming up on Thursday <b>[against Malmo]</b>. We will then play a final when we are back at Wembley after the FA Cup final last year and the Community Shield. We are used to fighting for trophies so hopefully we can keep calm from Thursday and then win that trophy on Sunday<br /><br />It’s true that it was a tough night because we didn’t convert our game into chances, and we didn’t score at least one goal to push us until the end, give us belief, bring the atmosphere up and fight until the end. So, obviously, we are disappointed. We are eliminated from the competition, we are the current holders and we reached the final the year before last as well. We know the history of the competition, for the country and the club as well. It’s frustrating</p>

It is in our hands to make it possible, so we have 10 games remaining and now we have to fight. We have two games in the Premier League before the international break, we have to be focused on those, and two legs of the Europa League and let’s see where we can finish, but our aim as always at Chelsea is to try to finish as high as possible<br /><br />It is something we are trying to improve on when we get into those areas, to try to find the right pass. Gonzalo is very clever in his movements<br /><br /><b>[On Kepa Arrizabalaga]</b> He made a couple of good saves. This is all done <b>[the follow-up from the Wembley incident]</b> and now we have to be focused on the last two-and-a-half months we have. We have important games coming up.

There is still a lot of games to play and we are going to fight because we cannot miss Champions League qualification. I don’t see just the Europa League as the only way of being in the Champions League, because Chelsea’s place is not to be sixth in the Premier League so I cannot accept this.<br /><br />There is a way of going into the Champions League, it is a trophy, and we will play until the end but we are not in a position in the league where you can say we are not going to reach the Champions League spots. If we had won the (last) two games we would be third going into the international break and we could have said we were already in the Champions League. Obviously with five more points, we could have been much better</p>

With recent performances it is normal they are not happy. It’s up to us to turn this around. We have always had their support in the bad moments, and when things are going well, we all enjoy them together. We have a great chance starting Wednesday <b>[against Brighton]</b> at the Bridge to play a great game and create a great atmosphere<br /><br />I think in the last couple of games, the performances have not been at our level. We didn’t create a lot of chances, we conceded goals in an easy way. I think there is a lot to improve. We are nearly at the end of the season so we must step up. Yesterday we showed great character because we normally don’t come back from bad results. Yesterday was the second time in the Premier League that we did so. We got the three points but we have to be critical and we know we have to do better</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea know the formula to end Liverpool’s title dreams]</b> When we went there they had the party nearly ready because they were smashing every team in Anfield. We arrived with a very clear idea and we played the game we had to do at that moment. To beat that team, who were getting very good results, and to beat them 2-0 was a very important win for the club and for the fans. Everyone enjoyed that day and hopefully we can replicate it on Sunday. It is not about frustrating Liverpool. It is about playing our game. We know they are fighting for the title, but for us, every point is vital to finish in the top four. This is an important game for us.<br /><br />We know that we are playing against a strong side, but first of all, we need to keep the solidity that we have shown in the last games and defend very well as a team because they are a big threat. Then, if we take our chances, we can win the game. We have proven ourselves already at Anfield this season when we won there in the League Cup. It’s a big game and everyone is looking forward to it<br /><br />Records are nice but we have to hold them. Whatever you did in the past is nice because we have had very good results at Anfield, but we have to prove ourselves again on Sunday. What we did before is good, but Sunday is another game in a new season<br /><br /><b>[Azpilicueta believes that Marcos Alonso needed his moment in the spotlight]</b> We know his ability at scoring goals. He has scored very important goals for the club and against Slavia, it was very good timing, a good header. It is very important for him to score that goal. It is important for every player and it is healthy competition. We are lucky to have two very good players in Marcos and Emerson, that can provide different solutions to the manager. We know that in Chelsea the competition for every position is high. We know we have to perform in every game. It is a season where he is playing a bit less and rotating more with Emerson. Players always want to play. When you see other players don’t play, you need to pick up your team-mates because during the season we need everybody. Everyone is important.<br /><br />You can see that in every game. We are in the quarter-finals because we did our job as a team since September. We need to keep pushing because there are still many games to go and we need contributions from everyone. We have improved and have got the results. We needed to recover that solidity at the back. We know that it is very important for the offensive players when you are solid at the back because it gives them confidence. When you don’t concede, it means one goal is enough to win the game. It is a job we have been doing. We have needed to pick ourselves up in a collective way and also individually. Hopefully, we can repeat this in the next games</p>

We knew that we did not start well, we couldn’t cope with their pressure and conceded. We scored at a good time which was important, and the ambition of the team was to win the game in the second half. Jorginho is important for us to control the game.<br /><br />We have an away goal which is important, but it is only the first step. Everything will be decided next Thursday. They are a dangerous team. The job started in September, now let’s finish it and bring our fans to Baku</p>

  <p><b>[Cesar Azpilicueta has offered his backing to Chelsea team-mate Jorginho]</b> Jorginho is a very important player for us. Sometimes all of us have struggled because when the results are not there, it means we are not doing the perfect job. But this is his first season in England, first time at a new club. This was an important game <b>[for him]</b>. He grew into the game by getting more control, creating more space for the two attacking midfielders where he could find them in very dangerous positions. We can see that every time we find him and give him more space, he can create that pass and move forward. It also meant we <b>[the defenders]</b> could enjoy more space in front of us<br /><br />I have told him a lot of times that he needed to be fit. For a long time with Chelsea, he wasn’t able to play and to train for a few weeks in a row. It is very important when you’re a young player. He’s come from Crystal Palace after having a good loan there. He came to Chelsea after the World Cup and the manager trusted him, but due to a few back problems, he couldn’t get the rhythm of being involved in the team every week. But since he has been doing this, we have seen an improvement, his confidence in space is very good. He is very strong. He is a good attacking midfielder that can attack the box and score goals. I’m sure the only way he can go is up<br /><br />The atmosphere was amazing. We knew that they were trying to make history and we had to match this intensity, but we have experience in those kinds of games and we had to use it in the right way. We didn’t start very well, they scored a goal, but after this, we controlled the game. They didn’t create any chances apart from the header in the second half from a corner. Overall I think we could be more effective in the final third. It could be better, could be worse. We scored an away goal and in the second half we dominated and had that feeling we could get a better result, but it’s half-time in the tie and we have a decisive game on Thursday at Stamford Bridge</p>

There were so many players that were all different personalities, different characters, but you could learn from them because they were so successful in the team. They won every trophy but they were hungry to win more. They were amazing people, amazing leaders, and we could learn a lot from them personally from the first day. But gradually they left and we have to take the responsibility. Everyone is different and we just try to keep the club at the highest level by giving everything. Over the years I have played with a lot of players and I’ve had the chance to learn on the pitch, off the pitch, in every training session, every game, and experience different competitions. We were lucky to share very good memories, to win trophies together. We just try to carry on the way they made the club, to fight for trophies, and hopefully we can be successful.<br /><br />Obviously it’s something I’m very proud of. I already take responsibility on and off the pitch, trying to give my best for the club, for my team-mates, to help to get the targets, but to wear the armband gives you extra responsibility and I always try to do the best I can and help whoever I can. I’m one of the most senior players in the squad now. Some of us have been together for quite a long time so I try to help with the experience that we have here, to try to find a way to get the results</p>

Both of them were very unfortunate with their injuries. They were both in their best moment of the season, playing regularly and were important for the team.

It’s the first time in history that a team over 90 points doesn’t win the league, so when you see the results you know they set the standard very high. It’s up to us, and to the other teams, to rise to their level. It’s true that the transfer ban is not a help, but I believe in the group that we have. I believe in the young players that we have. A lot of players through the academy have been on loan and we’ll work hard to carry it as far as we can.<br /><br />We have the examples of <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a>, of <a href="reece-james.html">Reece James</a>, of <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> playing regularly in the Championship <b>[last season]</b>. We have the academy players who reached the final of the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Youth League like Conor Gallagher. Charlie Brown was the top scorer.

Maybe we don’t get the credit that we deserve because we didn’t get many players through the academy to the first team. I think that this situation is something that people felt with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> that we win trophies in the academy but then we just send 40 players on loan and don’t get them to the first team.

He prefers to play a bit longer, to switch the play with longer balls to get more commitment in the final passes to get more chances for the strikers. Apart from that, his work rate has been amazing.

It’s an area where we need to improve because defensive solidity is key throughout a season and I’m sure we’ll keep working hard to get that. Offensively, we’re creating a lot of chancing and scoring a lot of goals.<br /><br />We are creating more <b>[chances than we are taking, though]</b>, I’m sure we’ll get that killer instinct better through the season. You’re going to have games like this. You can’t win every game 3-0 in the first half and thing go easy. Sometimes you have to dig in and work hard - even though we were 1-1 at half time and deserved to be ahead. The reaction of the team after the equaliser was very good. We put a lot of pressure on them. Even at 2-1 we created a lot of chances. It was just a lack of killing the game to enjoy the final minutes. We played three games without a win. We needed a good reaction from Saturday. It wasn’t a good game and not a good result. We were facing a good side and we saw that. We had to suffer until the end. The most important thing was the three points <b>[against Villa]</b>, even though we could have won more comfortably with the way we played</p>

The fans want us to perform and get results and we are not giving them that. It’s true at home we face teams who sometimes sit back more than when they play at home and we can find more space. But it’s up to us to find a way. In the first half we shot once on target. In the second half we got the ball in the box, we went past a defender, but we didn’t find the man in the box, or we didn’t create the chance to get a goal. We are putting ourselves in difficulty. It’s up to us to find always the consistency, the level to play home or away, against any team. We know every game in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is very tough.

We have to find a way to do so in two days’ time. We have to react, but I have to be clear, we can’t be the whole season up down, up down. It’s key in the second half of the season we recover our consistency, the solidity at home, and keep growing as a team</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> captain Cesar Azpilicueta is worried teams no longer worry about travelling to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> to face his team]</b> It’s true that when teams see we have not won games, they come here with more confidence because they see they can do it. So forget tactics. Everything is about recovering the respect at home, being solid at home, because it is not normal to lose so many games in your stadium. I don’t think the pressure of playing at home should be negative. It should be the opposite. We have the players, we have the quality and we have to turn it around straight away. The lesson has been very harsh - losing three <b>[recent]</b> games and scoring zero goals<br /><br />It’s difficult to understand why this is happening. Normally at home you find teams a bit more defensive, we can enjoy more time on the ball and you can create more chances. It’s up to us. When you play at home it is not about the rival, it is about yourself - about moving the ball quick to find the spaces, to create chances and give the fans and ourselves a lift</p>

  <p><b>[Cesar Azpilicueta has called for patience with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s young forward line after they failed to kill off a game at Brighton which ended in a 1-1 draw]</b> Well, we have had ups and downs. We have had an amazing run of games where we were winning. Then in the last few games we haven’t found consistency and lost a lot of points, especially at home. That is something we are trying to improve on as quickly as possible because to be at the top; we need to find consistency at home. We need to be solid again and to recover our home form because we know every game is difficult but we know with our position that it is in our hands.<br /><br />We have it in our hands. We are in fourth position and if we do our job, then we will finish in the top four. It is up to us; we know that we have a lot of games. We know that for the second part of the season we have <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup and Champions League coming in. When we were winning back-to-back, we were winning as a team. Now we don’t win; it is up to us. We work together to try to get it because we cannot forget that we have young players around, but we are <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.<br /><br />Every time we go to the pitch, we go to win. In every game, we show that we want to win. It is true that sometimes we are not at our level but it is up to us to raise it to get to where we want to be. We cannot forget where most of them were last season. They were playing in different environments and circumstances. It is their first year in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and they are doing amazingly well, it is part of the process and we need to keep it all together. We are very happy that after the hard work from the academy coaches and staff that these young lads have their opportunities. Some are coming back from loans; some are from the academy and directly now with us. It is part of their progress and I am sure that they will keep us growing as a team<br /><br />Sometimes through games, you have better periods than in others so when you are on top of them you have to try to make the most of it and it is not the first time it happens that we are better than them and we don’t put the game to bed. At 1-0, you risk it. Today we were punished in the second half. We started very well. We controlled the game. We scored the first one and we could have killed the game in the first 45 minutes we were much better than them but we were not able to do it. Then, we lost a bit of control and Kepa made good saves to get at least a point from the game.<br /><br />When you don’t win, it is always bad. At <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, we fight every time to win the games. When we don’t win we are not happy and we came here to get back-to-back wins in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> which we haven’t done in a while and we were not able to start the year in a good position</p>

  <p><b>[Azpilicueta talks about what it means to represent the club]</b> I think one of the characteristics of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> throughout this period has been winning trophies and even when we didn’t win something, we didn’t have any long spells without lifting a trophy. That’s obviously a big part of the ambition of the club, to always aim for trophies, and it’s something we have done not only in England, but also in Europe, with the Champions League and the Europa League twice. We have won <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> a couple of times since I arrived as well, so I think it’s in our DNA that we always fight for trophies and hopefully we can keep going in this direction</p>

For most of my career I was not going up for attacking set-plays, but a few years ago I started, and then you improve. At training I work on my movements, getting in to the right spaces. I have a determination as well. To be hungry is very important, because I’m not the tallest. I’m pleased to score goals, even if it’s not my main job</p>

We are all equal and it doesn’t matter our origin, the colour of our skin, our religion, our sexuality, we are all human. To have the same opportunities and respect for each other is the key, next to education, to see all people as other human beings and not to discriminate. It is important to respect each other and to learn from each other. We come from different backgrounds but we can all appreciate each other and get love from each other, and in the end have a better path for the world</p>
