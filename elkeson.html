  <p><b>[China have selected their first naturalised player with no Chinese heritage after including Brazilian-born attacker Elkeson in their latest 35-man squad ahead of World Cup qualifying next month]</b> Today, I want to tell the world: I officially started a new journey, I am Chinese, I want to return all the love and care you have had for me over the years<br /><br />This is a country that is vigorously developing their football and a country that many people in the world still don’t understand. It has only participated in the World Cup once. For me personally, this is a gamble in my career. But the blueprint of <a href="guangzhou-evergrande.html">Guangzhou Evergrande</a> convinced me that I can write down my history here. But I want a new challenge, I want to see where my limits are. In 2016, I joined Shanghai SIPG. I spent three and a half years in Shanghai, 116 games, and two championship trophies, all creating the history of the club. Another successful experience but I am still not satisfied because I want to repay the love of the Chinese people in these seven years. I am very happy and comfortable in China. Here is my home. At the right time, I learned of a very challenging possibility, but I accepted this challenge without thinking. I know that this is the next step I should take</p>
