  <p><b>[on Francesco Totti]</b> You look at <a href="francesco-totti.html">Francesco Totti</a> and you can’t help but admire him. He’s a ‘blue collar’ type of player, as we’d say in the United States. He gets in there, he’s extremely loyal and hard-working and he’s very proud of who he is and who he represents<br /><br />He’s one of the best players who has ever played. He’s been so consistent throughout his career and, even now, he still finds a way to make a difference in games for his club. He makes that difference through is work rate, through his goals and through his leadership. I think he has so much respect all across the world amongst players who have played the game</p>

  <p><b>[USA legend Mia Hamm describes what makes <a href="alex-morgan.html">Alex Morgan</a> one of TIME’s 100 most influential people in the world for 2019]</b> She’s fast, strong and fearless. Alex continues to add so much confidence and variety to her game. It should also excite us to know that she’s playing the best soccer of her career, and that this summer she’ll do whatever it takes to help her team defend the World Cup they reclaimed four years ago</p>
