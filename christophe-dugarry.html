  <p><b>[Kylian Mbappe has been billed as Cristiano Ronaldo’s heir at Real Madrid]</b> There is a real decision to be made. But sincerely if Mbappe doesn’t go to Real Madrid, it will be a mistake by Real Madrid. He is the new gem of world football and with Ronaldo’s age, he must end up at Real Madrid. They are the best club in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar needs to accept that he is not the boss of PSG following his on-field spat with Edinson Cavani]</b> Cavani has been there for four years - he is not the type to make life difficult. At some point, we have to reflect the senior players. Neymar is a great player. He will be the boss of PSG. But he will not be because he is worth €222m but because he has won things with PSG. Unai Emery must intervene.<br /><br />Neymar, I repeat, is not the boss of PSG. Soon, he is going to be taking training and picking the team. Where are we going? I am sympathetic to Cavani. The guy, he runs like crazy all match. He never says anything. He is everywhere. He is generous, he is without fault. There’s nothing to say. And then he is hit like that - it is not possible</p>

  <p><b>[World Cup winning striker Christophe Dugarry says the Neymar’s criticism was born out of jealousy]</b> Frenchmen are jealous and don’t support success. They think that if someone’s successful, there’s been a scam somewhere. Neymar must understand that and he must continue his life by having fun with his friends. It’ll do him good and it will allow him to be good on the field. He has to find his balance.</p>

  <p><b>[Dugarry on why <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> star must play centre forward for France]</b> For a long time, I’ve thought that <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> must be the forward for France. It’s sure because it’s his best position. He can play well on the right or the left, but the boy is a centre forward and must be France’s spearhead for the next 10 or 15 years. He’s a No.9. He’s our <a href="michel-platini.html">Michel Platini</a>, our <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>. He’s the player for our future.

It’s the essence of football. They could go in behind, play off each other, they could play in small spaces. It would be like <a href="romario.html">Romario</a> and <a href="bebeto.html">Bebeto</a> and I think that would be perfect</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United’s Paul Pogba has been branded an alien and a genius]</b> He’s an alien, a player out of the ordinary, but he annoys me, because I know he’s capable of doing a hundred times more. He’s a genius, but when is he going to realise it? When he started becoming a marketing player, he lost that rage he had at Juventus.<br /><br />You are not starting for Manchester United, you just lost a game with the France national team. You send out this program that doesn’t make sense. You have just lost. That tells us that you’re not concentrating. Things aren’t going well for you and you make us your Pogseries. What kind of madness is that? You just lost 2-3 against the Colombians and you were missing for an hour. You have a whole country behind you, a country that wants to do well at the World Cup, and you make these stupid things for us.</p>

  <p><b>[Dugarry launches savage <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> attack becasue of missing their league-winning 7-1 victory over <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a>]</b> How can <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> not be there for the title game, how can we give him the label of leader when he does not come to share that? How can <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> accept something like that? How can he look at his team-mates in the eyes by behaving like that? He is spitting on the club. I think it’s barbaric.<br /><br />If he were at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, he would have returned without any problem. If I was a <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> player I’d be raging. I can’t stand these players who are constantly navel gazing. This is a team sport, and it is the collective that win games, not individuals. If we think that <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> can win the Champions League with attitudes like this, we’re having a laugh</p>

I like what <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> are showing at the moment: this humility; this modest approach to matches; their appetite for work. I don’t want a war of egos or statistics. If you’re great, it’s up to us pundits to say so.
