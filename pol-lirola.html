  <p><b>[Juventus can end Real Madrid’s Champions League reign]</b> Honestly, I said before the first game against Barcelona that Juventus would go through. Then, after the performance in Turin, I was sure that they would go through because you do not score three goals against this Juve. They’re too strong at the back. The thing that impressed me most, however, was how the team attacked Barcelona right from the start of the game in Turin. They were devastating going forward. In my opinion, they can now get past Monaco and reach the final, where they will face Real Madrid, who will beat Atletico <b>[after triumphing 3-0 in the first leg at the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday]</b>. This Juve side has everything in place to win the Champions League.<br /><br />If you want to win or even draw against a team like this, you have to play the game of your life and hope that they are not on their game. They really should end up playing Real in the final because in attack they are frightening. I think <b>[Paulo]</b> Dybala, <b>[Gonzalo]</b> Higuain, <b>[Mario]</b> Mandzukic and <b>[Juan]</b> Cuadrado can really hurt Real. Indeed, whereas the Bianconeri defense is phenomenal, the same cannot be said of Real Madrid, who concede a lot of goals<br /><br />Dybala is an absolute phenomenon. Buffon is absolutely right: Dybala is among the top five players in the world. Technically, he’s exceptional. Obviously, though, for their position on the pitch, I pay greater attention to Stephan Lichtsteiner and Dani Alves. They interpret the full-back role very differently but they are two champions. I watch all of Juve’s games and I try to study their movements to understand their secrets!<br /><br />I was out for about a month and a half and lost a little rhythm but now I want to finish the season as best I can, looking to play as much as possible and pick up more experience, which will be useful in terms of helping me start next year well. I’m here on a two-year loan and I’m happy. It’s the ideal environment for a young player that wants to develop and grow. However, my dream is to go back to Juve one day and play, even if I know that I will have to work hard to manage that, because Juve really do have an incredible squad</p>
