  <p><b>[John Aldridge considers Manchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic to be the Premier League’s finest frontman]</b> Let’s dip into a hypothetical world and weigh up how Ibrahimovic would have fitted into Klopp’s Liverpool team if he had move to Anfield instead of Old Trafford. I believe he would compliment any forward line and while a player of his imposing presence would change Liverpool’s attacking impetus, I think he would improve it. Against opponents who are intent on doing little more than frustrate Liverpool into submission and hit them on the break - as Swansea, Wolves and Hull have done in recent weeks - you sometimes need a slightly more destructive approach. I’m not saying Liverpool should go route one from first minute to last, because the players Klopp has in this squad are not designed to play that way. However, using a powerful frontman is not a crime and the second balls Liverpool could make use of if they had a leader at the front of their team could open up so many options that were absent in a disastrous first month of 2017 for Klopp.<br /><br />As I weigh up the respective merits of the best strikers in the Premier League right now, Manchester United’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic stands out as the talisman any manager would want in his team. Okay, Diego Costa has been annoyingly brilliant for Chelsea this season and he will lead them to the Premier League title if he stays fit. I’m also a big fan of Tottenham’s Harry Kane and Romelu Lukaku is having a great season at Everton, as he has proved himself to be a prolific finisher when chances come his way. Yet I believe Ibrahimovic has more to offer than all of them, in a season when he has silenced the critics who were suggesting he was past his best at the age of 35</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp has been urged to change his transfer policy at Liverpool]</b> To me, Jurgen Klopp needs to change his transfer policy this summer. He needs to go after players with the aggression, the physicality and the character to cope with these demands. He needs players who can fight when the going gets tough. We simply don’t have enough of those type. Against Leicester, it struck me as obvious that we need a tough, physical centre forward. When a defence is under pressure, they need somebody up front who can hold the ball up, take a knock off a centre-half, flick a header on, run the channel and give you an outlet, someone who starts the fight from the front. <b>[Roberto]</b> Firmino is a nice technical footballer, but he’s not that kind of striker. It’s not his game. It’s the hardest thing in the world to sign a top, top striker, but we have to get out there and find one. A <b>[Robert]</b> Lewandowski, who Klopp found at Dortmund, a Harry Kane, an Ibrahimovic, Costa. The top sides have that kind of player, we don’t.<br /><br />The trouble is, where do you get them, and how much do they cost? Because let’s not forget, Liverpool need at least one midfielder and at least one centre-half too. That’s the spine of a team. And they don’t come cheap</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp has been urged to spend whatever it costs to bring a striker of Luis Suarez’s ilk to Liverpool]</b> That is the reason we’re struggling to get over the line. Those players get you something when you need it, they get on the end of a cross, something out of nothing, like Luis Suarez used to do for us. We haven’t got a player who can do that at the minute. <b>[Daniel]</b> Sturridge came on and nearly did it, we know he’s got that in his locker when he’s fit to play.<br /><br />It hasn’t happened for <b>[Divock]</b> Origi though he seems to have every attribute. He’s quick, he’s strong, he should be better in the air. He’s not progressed from last year when he was playing the best football of his career before that injury against Everton. He’s still young but he’s got to show more, be a threat. More than anyone else we need a striker in the summer with a big presence who can hold the ball up and attack crosses, by a million miles, whatever it costs.</p>

  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk’s proposed move to Liverpool is not dead in the water as he can choose to force a transfer]</b> Players and their agents hold all the power these days and if he says he won’t kick another ball for Southampton and demands a move, it will happen. Tapping up goes on all the time in the game and even if Liverpool went a bit far in their pursuit of Van Dijk before they spoke to Southampton, I don’t believe this transfer story is dead in the water. Van Dijk needs to make the next move and I reckon he will tell Southampton that he wants out and he wants to go to Liverpool.<br /><br />I don’t like the way the game has gone in some ways and players can hold clubs to ransom if they want a move and big money offers are coming in, but that is the way of the world now. I still see this transfer happening one way or the other and I certainly hope it does because I’d like to have seen a little more movement from Liverpool in the transfer market this summer.</p>

But it didn’t happen after Southampton refused to sell Virgil van Dijk. Our interest in him won’t go away and there’s no reason why that deal can’t happen in January. Until then Klopp will have to push on with what he’s got. I am a bit worried as we don’t have much back up if either Dejan Lovren or Joel Matip get injured. Ragnar Klavan can do a job and Joe Gomez has huge potential but there’s no-one else who can fill in.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool’s £36 million plus capture of Mohamed Salah has been branded an absolute bargain]</b> What can you say about Mo Salah? He plays like he’s been at the club for years. He’s full of confidence, he’s getting in there himself and he’s creating good chances for others as well. I think with his pace he’ll always get good chances. Another two goals in the bag on Saturday and to score 12 in 17 games is a brilliant statistic - he’s been the player of the season without doubt for Liverpool. He’s so dangerous and for what we paid for him he’s been an absolute bargain<br /><br />I thought Alex Oxlade-Chamberlian had his best game for us after starting on Saturday. He’s needed a couple of games but it’s obvious he’s starting to settle in now. Jurgen played him on the right of midfield but he’s a player who is starting to give the manager so many options now. He can play wide right or wide left and of course we know he wants to play in centre midfield. For now though it’s just important that he plays and then see what happens further down the line. Those central midfield positions are incredibly competitive at Liverpool and we’ve got the likes of Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana coming back soon who can play in there as well</p>

  <p><b>[Dejan Lovren’s defending which cost Liverpool two points in a derby date with Everton was immature and naïve]</b> Obviously, the penalty has been the big topic of debate and for me it was a silly mistake by Lovren. It was immature and naive defending. The striker was going away from goal. You don’t give the player the opportunity to get the contact and go down. You don’t give the referee the opportunity to give a penalty. I think 50 per cent of referees would have given it.<br /><br />If you are going to get close like that then put your arms up in the air. That says to the ref ‘I’m close to him but I’m not touching him’. If Lovren had done that rather than put his hands on the player’s back then the ref doesn’t give it. To only get a point from a game we dominated was a bitter pill for everyone to swallow. Jurgen Klopp was clearly angry afterwards but I didn’t have a problem with how he conducted himself. Sometimes emotions run away with you. It just shows how much it means to him and I’d rather have a manager with that kind of passion.<br /><br />We don’t seem to win games 1-0. We let a narrow lead slip at home to Chelsea recently and we did the same against Everton. The type of teams who win leagues and cups win matches 1-0. When we can’t get a second goal then we need to learn how to see a game out</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool need to become more streetwise]</b> Jurgen Klopp claimed the referee cost Liverpool a point at Old Trafford, but I wouldn’t agree with him on this occasion. I would argue that if Klopp’s Liverpool team were a little more streetwise, they would have got at least a draw out of the game, but they are too honest for their own good at times. We saw Tottenham players getting penalties at Anfield a few weeks back after falling over in the box, but Salah decided to stay on his feet and the referee then decided to give nothing. What would have happened if Mohamed Salah had fallen over like most Premier League players would have done? I reckon he would have got a penalty, but that is not the way Klopp has his players thinking. They try to win matches in an honest way, by out-passing and outscoring opponents and what we saw was a team winning via an alternative route.<br /><br />The Salah penalty decision was probably borderline, but I have no doubt that Liverpool should have been given a penalty when Antonio Valencia handled in the box and denied Sadio Mane a chance to score. The United player had time to get his arm out of the way and that was a clear spot kick for me, but Liverpool should not blame the referee for what was a horrible defeat.</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah’s remarkable form could end up being terrible news for Liverpool]</b> Mohamed Salah may well be a strong contender to win the Ballon d’Or for 2018 by the time we get to the end of this summer’s World Cup finals and that could be terrible news for Liverpool. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have been the two best players in the world for a long time, but Salah is putting himself in their company with his performances this season and that reality has consequences. He has now scored more goals than any other player in the major European leagues, with his 28 goals putting him three ahead of the great Messi and inevitably sparking speculation over his future at Liverpool. As we have seen in recent years with Luis Suarez and Philippe Coutinho, success on this scale has consequences and I suspect it won’t be long before we see Salah being linked with a move to Real Madrid again. Barcelona probably won’t be able to splash the cash again having spent so much to sign Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele in recent months, but Real Madrid like to sign the next big thing in world football every summer and at this moment in time, that man is Salah. If he takes Liverpool close to Champions League success and then shines in the World Cup with Egypt, his status will rise to potentially unmanageable levels from Liverpool’s perspective<br /><br />So what can Liverpool do to stave off what may now be the inevitable £150m-plus offers for their latest star man this summer? The only option is to sit down with Salah’s agent and pay him whatever the going rate is to stay at Liverpool for the next few years, with any pay rise that comes his way more than justified given his performances this season. As we saw with both Suarez and Coutinho, who signed new deals a few months before they left the club, a contract is barely worth the paper it is written on these days, but that is the only option open the Anfield board now. Losing Salah on the back of the deals for Suarez and Coutinho would be a hammer blow to the club’s reputation as while Liverpool are a massive name in world football, they don’t want to become a club that are little more than a stepping stone for the world’s best players before they move on to Real Madrid or Barcelona. All you can hope is that Salah has a different mentality to the players who left Anfield in years gone by, yet you wonder whether anyone in that Liverpool squad has big loyalty to a club that they have no emotional connection with</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah is like both Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi]</b> You run out of superlatives trying to describe the brilliance of Mohamed Salah. His performance against Watford on Saturday was remarkable. It was one of those games where I didn’t actually think we played particularly well. On most other occasions it probably would have been a routine 2-0 win but Salah just took us to a different level. The biggest compliment I can pay him is that he reminds me of Luis Suarez in 2013-14. There are also shades of Lionel Messi with his movement and the way he humiliates defenders. Suarez produced the best season I’ve ever seen from a Liverpool striker. He created a lot of goals for himself out of nothing, but I think what Salah has done this season outdoes Suarez.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool need to sign four quality players worth £50 million each]</b> I’d expect Jurgen Klopp to go strong on Sunday, primarily because he hasn’t really got any other choice. We don’t have a backup plan, we don’t have enough players, particularly in midfield. Ben Woodburn could do a job, but not at this stage of the season. What it shows is that we need to do some good business once again in the transfer window this summer. There cannot be any messing about. We need four quality players, players worth £50m each. That’s £200m on new talent. We need the best we can get. And that’s why beating Brighton is so important. Sure, we can qualify for the Champions League by beating Real Madrid in the final, but it would be a lot easier to defeat the Seagulls at Anfield. If we do it on Sunday, then that gives us two extra weeks to agree deals with players in the knowledge Champions League football will be back at Liverpool next season.</p>

It’s a tricky one for the manager. Do you use his experience now he’s fit or do you turn to people whose future is at the club? A lot of fans wouldn’t want Can on the bench. The club has had a custard pie from him and his agent. He’s been part of the journey to this final but he certainly doesn’t deserve to start against Real Madrid. Why does he want to leave? Money. Is the Italian league better? No. Juventus are a huge club but Liverpool have won the Champions League more times than them.

  <p><b>[Liverpool’s aura changed in their Champions League final defeat to Real Madrid]</b> There is a visible change of mentality in Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool team this season and it’s not just down to key signings they have made in the last year. I look at the way this team is going about their business and even though they have yet to hit top form in my view, they are a side that has a belief running through their veins that suggests they are ready to go to the next level. Liverpool may have lost the Champions League final against Real Madrid in Kiev last May and all of us who love the club felt the pain of that defeat, but the run in Europe’s elite competition has changed the aura around this team for good. The players now believe they belong on the biggest of stages, they expect to challenge for the big trophies and most significantly, the opposition are fearful of them now. When you look to the Liverpool side that started last season in such uncertain fashion and compare it to the team that have been winning games in impressive fashion over the first month of this campaign, it’s clear the team gave taken two or three leaps forward.<br /><br />Liverpool’s substitutes bench has been a real weak link over the last few years, but that is looking so strong now and it gives Klopp a real opportunity to have a right go at winning a domestic cup competition as well as pushing for the Premier League and Champions League. We will see two reserve teams doing battle as Chelsea come to Anfield in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday, but I’m pretty confident Klopp’s back-up players are better than Maurizio Sarri’s right now. Fabinho, Naby Keita, Roberto Firmino and Xherdan Shaqiri were some of the names on the Liverpool bench for the PSG game the other night, James Milner and Joe Gomez were sitting it out on Saturday <b>[against Southampton]</b>, while Daniel Sturridge and Jordan Henderson missed out on starts against Tottenham last weekend. That is a lot of quality footballers to be watching from the sidelines, but it highlighted the strength Liverpool now have and it reminds me of the days when the club were the dominant force in English and European football. There are so many players fighting for three places in the Liverpool midfield at the moment and if anyone allows their form to dip, they will be out of the team and replaced by someone better. When you have this kind of quality in reserve, it makes dropping a star player a little easier for a manager and it also keeps everyone on their toes as they know their place in the side is constantly under threat</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool have been urged to rekindle their interest in Ryan Sessegnon and consider an approach for his Fulham team-mate Aleksandar Mitrovic]</b> Fulham might be struggling at the bottom of the Premier League but a couple of their players really caught my eye on Sunday and I wouldn’t mind Liverpool coming in with a bid for either of them. They weren’t the worst team that’s come to Anfield this season by a long way. They created three good chances and looked to have a bit of a go and on this showing I fail to see why they’re bottom of the league. Andy Robertson has been an absolute revelation since he came to Anfield and solved the long-standing left-back issue but I’d still like Liverpool to reignite their interest in Ryan Sessegnon who can play in that position but was being deployed further up the left flank against the Reds. He’s still only 18 but has almost played 100 senior games already. I know a lot of clubs are interested in him but he can play at either full-back or in midfield and you can see he’ll go far that lad.<br /><br />I was also impressed with Aleksandar Mitrovic. He’s the type of player you’d want coming off the bench, he’s big, strong and scores goals. He gives you something that little bit different and I like him as a squad player. The way Liverpool play they could do with someone who provides a bit of diversity and a Plan B. Maybe it’s not Mitrovic himself, but I think they could really benefit from having someone like that, a target man who can bring others into the game. Somewhere down the line I think Liverpool should be looking to strengthen in that department.</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Pulisic is the Coutinho-type playmaker that Liverpool are lacking]</b> Christian Pulisic would be a fantastic signing for Liverpool. I know Borussia Dortmund have said he’s not for sale in January but next summer he will only have a year left on his contract. I watched him score two goals against us for Dortmund in that pre-season friendly in America and he really impressed me. He’s a player Klopp knows all about and he has tried to take him to Liverpool previously. Pulisic has got pace and he would certainly fit our style. With the way he picks the ball up and goes past players, he’s a Coutinho-type.<br /><br />Klopp has said he doesn’t intend to add to the squad in January. If that proves to be right then we need those who have been on the fringes so far to step up. We need Fabinho to settle down and keep improving in the second half of the season. We also need Naby Keita to show what a good player he can be because we’ve only seen flashes of what he can do so far. The same goes for the likes of Adam Lallana and Daniel Sturridge, who have found their opportunities limited. You need game changers who can come off the bench when things aren’t going right and make an impact</p>

Top-quality opposition continue to get joy out of targeting Lovren, as he as a tendency to lose concentration and this is why I believe Van Dijk needs an A-list defensive partner.</p>

Alberto Moreno didn’t change too many opinions with his display and when I look at Divock Origi and Daniel Sturridge up front, it suggested two more strikers will be needed next summer.<br /><br />The top Premier League managers tend to rotate their team in the early stages of the domestic cup competitions these days and other teams are clearly adapting better to that than Liverpool, which is an area Klopp needs to address ahead of next season.<br /><br />For now, the priority has to be refocusing minds and banishing the notion that Liverpool’s season is falling off the rails after a couple of high-profile defeats.<br /><br />Okay, they came up short in a very tight game against Manchester City, but it was the Liverpool reserve team that lost at Wolves and it should not affect the mood ahead of what is now a massive game at Brighton on Saturday.<br /><br />A glance at the Premier League table confirms Liverpool are still sitting at the top and they will be looking to open up a seven-point lead on Manchester City at Brighton, as their chief rivals don’t play again until next Monday.<br /><br />It’s a wonderful position to be in and as we have seen with Leicester and Chelsea in their Premier League title wins in recent years, having spare weekends to refresh players can be a decisive factor against rivals who are playing three games a week</p>

  <p><b>[Klopp tipped by Liverpool legend to dip back into transfer market for Van Dijk partner]</b> Fabinho once again showed his versatility for Liverpool. Hopefully he won’t have to for much longer with the return of Joel Matip. He is likely to make his comeback at the weekend against Crystal Palace and Joe Gomez is on the mend, so I think Liverpool are over that defensive crisis they had, but Fabinho has helped out massively.<br /><br />This summer though, Klopp might be looking at bringing in a centre-back. Matip and Dejan Lovren pick up plenty of niggly knocks and and injuries, but Gomez is the one who has been extremely unlucky. I expect Matip to return to the defence at the weekend, but Fabinho deserves to keep his place somewhere in this team.</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah has earned an unfavourable comparison to former Liverpool star Luis Suarez]</b> Salah went down too easily against Crystal Palace <b>[when looking for a penalty on Saturday]</b>. And now he has a problem. But did Mamadou Sakho catch his calf? 100 per cent. He caught his calf with his shin, and Salah went down. That’s what players do this day and age. Now Salah has to be careful. Everybody is on to him. This has happened in the past with players - think Luis Suarez - who look for a touch and then go down. Salah got touched. Did it warrant a penalty? Some referees would have given it. There was contact but, yes, Salah went down too easily.<br /><br />If it’s a clear foul on Salah, then I’m sure referees will give a penalty in the future. But the way Mo plays means he is always going to invite contact, he is often going to have two or three players around him in the box. It’s hard for defenders in that instance not to make contact with him. It’s very, very difficult for him not to get touched.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City are a small club that has basically got lucky]</b> The reality is and will always be that expectations at Liverpool will always be very different when compared to Manchester City. This has to be an advantage for City and it’s an issue that will always be there when one of the biggest names in the game goes up against a small team that has basically got lucky by finding a sugar daddy investor.<br /><br />Even though I appreciate City fans will be offended when we say they are still a small club, that is how everyone outside of their bubble still views them, despite their success in winning a few trophies in recent years. They will always be a small club compared to their neighbours Manchester United and compared to Liverpool, with the latter two having decades of success that have allowed them to become sporting giants on the world stage.<br /><br />Liverpool Football Club is one of the biggest names in our sport with a fanbase that stretches to all corners of the world and while that is a tribute to a glorious history, it is also an obstacle to ambitions. At City, they hope to win the league and are setting their own standards high in a bid to achieve their goals. Liverpool are dealing with so much more and, while you can try and ignore what is happening around you, it eventually gets to everyone.<br /><br />Kids in China are watching Liverpool matches at all hours biting finger nails. Bars in America are packed with fans in red shirts watching matches early in the morning and amid all of this hype, City are quietly going about their work without anyone taking too much notice of them.<br /><br /><b>[Aldridge wants to see Liverpool preserve and extend their four-point lead at the top of the table]</b> There is no room for mistakes as Manchester City are likely to win virtually every game, so Liverpool have to win at least 13 matches of the 15 they have left to give themselves a good chance of winning the league. Every Liverpool player over the last three decades has been asked whether they can win a league title and all of them have come up short, with the desperation to see that Premier League trophy presented to a red-shirted captain at Anfield never more acute.<br /><br />They will head into next Wednesday’s game against Leicester knowing nothing less than three points will do if they want to compete with City and that pressure will mount as the finishing line gets closer. Liverpool need to beat more than Manchester City if they are to win this season’s Premier League title, with the scars of the past 29 years leaving a mark on the club that will only be erased when wait for the trophy this club demands comes to an end</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool must avoid playing Naby Keita and Adam Lallana in the same midfield]</b> Klopp’s side dropped more points at West Ham, but a bigger issue for me in both games has been the performance or lack of it from Liverpool’s midfielders. <b>[Mohamed]</b> Salah, Mane and <b>[Roberto]</b> Firmino will give you a cutting edge if the balance of the team is right, but the players sitting behind them at West Ham failed to produce the goods and it cost Liverpool.

As for Keita, he has not settled at Liverpool and has failed to deliver the performances we were expecting from him, with Klopp and his coaching staff fighting to get him up to speed and still waiting to see if he will be good enough to play in this team.</p>

There is a lot of interest worldwide, with the fan base Liverpool have, but I can’t believe there is so much talk with January only just finished - it’s crazy to be quite honest. They are doing all right at the moment. They had a little bit of a blip and have a few injuries to contend with. You talk about pressure now, we had pressure every season - 60s, 70s, 80s - every season to win it. The pressure was on the team to do the business and we did an awful lot. Season-in, season-out. Retaining it. That was a different type of pressure. We have always had expectations, we expected it every single season - silverware, silverware, silverware. For us not to win a cup in a season was ridiculous because the standards were raised.<br /><br />City raised the bar massively last season, Liverpool have raised their bar and are keeping up with them at the moment. Just enjoy it and see it through. Enjoy getting top and staying top of the league. The manager is saying all the right things so go out and have the will to win every game. Keep on believing in yourselves. Togetherness will keep them there</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool will drop points but prevail in final day title battle with Man City]</b> Using recent form as a gauge, Pep Guardiola’s reigning champions appear to be firm favourites to win the title, but Liverpool’s return to the top of the table after their tense win at Fulham last Sunday was a timely reminder that Klopp’s men are not going to give up on this title race easily. However, an unconvincing Liverpool do not look like a team ready to win every game between now and the end of a season that will be decided over a frantic 44-day period that starts next Saturday. But on the plus side, City’s uncertain performance at Swansea in the FA Cup last weekend highlighted vulnerabilities in their line-up and if they do go 2-0 down against Premier League opposition away from home, they probably won’t come back in the manner they did against the Championship outfit. The big question hovering over all of this is: Are Liverpool good enough to take advantage if City stumble? I believe we can do that, however, I suspect we are in for a few more twists and turns before the Premier League trophy is handed over on May 12.<br /><br />I believe the Premier League title race will be decided on the final day of the season - with Liverpool one or two points clear of City before kick-off. City will travel to Brighton on the last Sunday of the campaign and you would certainly expect them to win, while Liverpool have a home game against a Wolves side that may well have their minds on the club’s first appearance in an FA Cup final since 1960. If this scenario becomes a reality, Liverpool fans can expect to be celebrating wildly at 5pm on Sunday May 12. Yes, I’m predicting Liverpool will be crowned champions for the first time since 1990.</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp has been urged to end his favouritism of James Milner, Jordan Henderson and Georginio Wijnaldum]</b> At the moment, he is imperative to Liverpool and he’s been excellent for a number of months in midfield. I think at this present moment in time, he is absolutely Liverpool’s best midfielder, without a doubt. For me, Liverpool lost a lot of battles in there <b>[against Spurs]</b> and as soon as he came on, he changed it all. I thought he might have come on a lot earlier to steady the ship but when he did come on, he was a class act. Jurgen Klopp likes his tried and trusted midfield trio of James Milner, Gini Wijnaldum and Jordan Henderson, but I think it’s time someone made way for Fabinho. He’s only really played half the season so he is fit and ready and he has made that position his own since he broke into the team. He is champing at the bit and he wanted to prove a point when he came on against Spurs and I think he did that. There are a lot of big games between now and the end of the season for Liverpool and I expect Fabinho to feature heavily.<br /><br />I expect Milner to go in at left-back for the suspended Andy Robertson against Porto in the Champions League and Fabinho will surely start in midfield in his place. At Southampton this Friday, I think Klopp has to start Fabinho too. The manager chops and changes in midfield for virtually every game but with Gini Wijnaldum his most trusted and Fabinho in form, that should leave just the one spot up for grabs</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona star slammed by Aldridge for antics against Liverpool]</b> Suarez behaved like a rat in the Champions League semi-final against Liverpool and it was out of order. I don’t have any problem with him celebrating his goal against Liverpool. Just because he used to wear a red shirt, it doesn’t mean he has to pretend he is not excited to score a great goal in a massive Champions League game. What was not acceptable was his antics on and off the ball, as he got into the faces of Liverpool players, fell over any time anyone went near him and tried to get his opponents booked at every opportunity. He was sneaky, he was nasty and he was everything people used to tell us Suarez was when everyone at Liverpool was trying to defend him. We know this is a guy who would run over his granny to score a goal, but everyone should have some respect for those who have been good to you in the past, but Suarez threw the support Liverpool gave him back in our faces<br /><br />If I was in that Liverpool dressing room, I’d hatch a plan to wind him up and get him sent off. We know he has a short fuse and can lose it if he is pushed to the limits, so play him at his own game and try and get him rattled. Let’s see how he likes it when the Liverpool fans and the Anfield crowd turn against him. That might be the best chance Liverpool have got to come back into the tie because at 3-0 down, it looks like a long way back for Jurgen Klopp’s side</p>

In many respects, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s immaculate start to this <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> campaign is all the more impressive when you consider their big three in the forward line are not firing on all cylinders and it has to be an ominous sign for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in what looks set to be another tight title race.<br /><br />I believe last season’s Champions League victory has changed the way a lot of these players view themselves and this <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team as they have gone from being a team that has potential to do well to a team of winners. Not just winners of a domestic cup, but European champions and that lavish tag has to fill them with confidence. The brilliant <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team I stepped into in the mid-1980s was full of proven winners and when you have that first medal or two in your collection, it gives you a huge advantage over rivals who are still chasing that first big trophy. Champions have a mindset that ensures they expect to win, while the opposition don’t quite believe they will get over the line until they have proved to themselves that they can do it and this is why I feel <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have a very different look now.</p>

  <p><b>[John Aldridge says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> strike blind fear into rivals, including <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>]</b> How are they doing it? There are a variety of reasons why <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> appear to be invincible right now and the first is the blind fear all their opponents, including <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, now have when they go into a game against <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> leaders.<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> had a fear factor that allowed them to frighten rivals into submission in the 1970s and 80s, especially at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, where you could see the opposition trembling as the crowd reminded them what they were up against. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> then inherited that mantle as <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a>’s side dominated English football and there have been moments when <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> have had an aura that was too much for the opposition to handle.<br /><br />Now <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are in that position and it means the first task for any rival manager is to try and mask that fear before they can start thinking about ways to stop a team that saw their belief levels go to ridiculous heights after they won the Champions League last June<br /><br />Any side taking on this <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team in a straight battle of passing football has come out second best for the last two years and their demolition of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in the Champions League a couple of years ago was crucial in confirming that they are a team that can take the best apart when they are on fire.<br /><br />Last season’s incredible Champions League semi-final comeback against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> added to that aura and now they have pieced together this incredible record in their opening 21 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> matches that may never be matched. I still see them dropping points between now and the end of the season, but this team is so good that it’s hard to see them losing too many games and draws may be the best the opposition can hope for. When you are a top team heading into a game with such limited ambition, it really does impact your hopes of getting a positive result and that’s the scenario <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> will face when they go to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> on Sunday</p>

That team needs a major revamp, which is amazing to think when you think how much money they have thrown into that squad, and ultimately that comes back on the manager’s head so he has to look at himself in the mirror</p>

Cancelling three-quarters of a season to start a fresh one is frankly ridiculous. It really is. It’s not set in stone that every season has to begin in August. These are unprecedented times and it should be amended to suit the season that is already being played out.

He seems to be an old-school winger and it is a difficult one to play. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will be looking where Elliott’s best position is and he could even become one of the three in midfield as an attacking type or as part of that front three, but he’s got to add goals to his game. It will be tough, of course, given <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s current standing in the game but he has got the ability, no question. He is grounded too from what I have seen and that can go a long way. They might send him out on loan in the future but the fact that he has had senior game-time already shows you how highly <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> rates him. And <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> will be assessing him in training every day, too because the level <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> play at when they are at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a> will find players out if they cannot match it. If players are not up to it, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will find out at training, so Elliott must be doing all the right things that are being asked of him and he will be picking <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s brain on how to improve so that can only be a good thing for all concerned.</p>

  <p><b>[John Aldridge says <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> has no need to leave <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> The release of the documentary tracking the career and life story of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> forward <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> has got people talking. Not least the part where he makes a vow to people in his Senegalese home town that he will win the Ballon d’Or. That declaration has prompted suggestions from several people that the only way Mane can realise his dream is by leaving <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> and heading to Spain to join either <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. I can see what they are saying. In recent times, almost every award has been won by <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> or <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. That they have played for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> or Real at the time has been coincidental. It has been unfortunate for so many great players that they have found themselves in an era with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. To finish above them, you have got to have done something unbelievably special. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, though, shouldn’t be too worried about Mane’s situation. They have never before been in such a strong position to be able to keep hold of their best players. Indeed, now would be the worst time for them to start potentially cashing in. Mane has probably been our best player this season. And what’s more, he can get even better next season and perhaps even win the Champions League again. What’s more, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are a better team than either <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or Real at present. When things are going well, you just have to enjoy it, and I’m sure Mane has been over the past 18 months. That said, if players really want to leave, then it’s hard to keep them in the modern era. But Mane doesn’t seem the type. Whenever I’ve spoken to him, he seems very humble, and doesn’t seem someone who would agitate for a move like other players such as <a href="fernando-torres.html">Fernando Torres</a>. And don’t forget, even if <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> forward moves to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, for example, he’d still have to overcome <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. Mane can win the Ballon d’Or as he’s a great player. And he has as much chance winning it while at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> than anywhere else</p>

  <p><b>[John Aldridge says <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> has the potential to be an exciting addition at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> We would need another centre-half if <a href="dejan-lovren.html">Dejan Lovren</a> goes but, as many have said on a number of occasions, it’s up front where we need quality back-up and that is where I would expect to see <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> doing some business. It’s amazing we have been able to get through the season the way we have without any significant injuries to <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>, <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> and <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Bobby Firmino</a> but you can’t expect to be that lucky every season. I have to say <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> is the one who excites me the most when it comes to the potential targets who could be coming in. He looks to have all the attributes you would want from a striker in a <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> team and all the noises coming out of his camp seem to indicate that he would really like to play for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. And because of those going out of the club and off the wage bill, we will have money to balance the books so if <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> go out and spend £60+ million I’ve got no problem with that because it’s money generated through player sales and obviously from being successful on the pitch as well. The club have had a record-breaking year and the money will still be in the bank. <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> might go out and spend £200m - and to be fair they probably need to - and City have a fair bit of rejigging to do, with class players like <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> and <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a> getting older but they both have a bigger job at hand than <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> do. We’re in the fortunate position where we can cherry-pick one or two just to build on the quality squad we’ve already got and that will give us an advantage when we finally begin the new season.</p>

  <p><b>[John Aldridge says <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> deserves to be named Player of the Year for 2019-20,]</b> In my eyes there is only one serious candidate for the Player of the Year gong and that is <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s captain. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">The Reds</a> have had many brilliant and consistent performers this season - we are 25 points clear at the top of the league with nine games left for heaven’s sake - but <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> has been the stand-out one as far as I’m concerned. When you look at some of the players who we’ve been missing at various stages of the season, the impact Jordan has made in the dressing room as well as on the field has been immense. Everyone knows it took him a while to truly find his feet at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and he’s had to deal with the fact that some fans didn’t rate him. He knuckled down, worked his socks off and surely has won all the doubters over now so it will be so fitting when he is the man to lift that trophy for us once we get those final two wins we need<br /><br />When you look at the team, it would be easy to think that <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> is the stand-out ‘skipper’ and when the big Dutchman arrived two-and-a-half years ago, many people thought it would probably be only a matter of time before he got the armband. In any other team, <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a> would be the captain because he’s clearly a brilliant leader as well as being a top player but the manager stuck to his guns by keeping Jordan in the role and he’s been proved absolutely right. Jordan’s rose up and raised the bar, not just for himself but for everybody in the team, and the lads around have responded to that. He deserves to be <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> captain and we are lucky to have him in the middle with <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a> behind because that gives the side an unbelievably strong spine, with the likes of <b>[James]</b> Milner and <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane and <b>[Andy]</b> Robertson and others all sharing similar qualities throughout the side. It’s like when you’re making a meal, you’ve got to make sure you have the right ingredients which all work together and that’s where <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s team-builders at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> deserve enormous credit because they have cooked up something very special at Anfield</p>

From what I have seen of the striker, he would suit <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> perfectly and offer a valuable option to <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>. He can play in every position across the front three and, in terms of his attributes, he has everything <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> would need. Especially his finishing. Many supporters will be watching Werner closely for the first time given the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> is the only major European league to have resumed following the suspension due to the coronavirus. And they’ll have surely been impressed by the manner in which he has already been knocking in the goals, particularly his hat-trick against Mainz at the weekend.

He would be better served moving to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> rather than going somewhere else such as <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. Don’t get me wrong, he would be brilliant for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. But under <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, he could prosper even further. This is a manager who has helped improve obvious talent such as <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a>, <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> and <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>. For the price we could reportedly get Werner - if the release clause is triggered - it’s relatively cheap for a player of his ilk. However, the financial uncertainty will no doubt leave all clubs, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> included, cautious to spend big money on players this summer. If <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> decide the deal is right, then I hope Werner is bought. I hope we don’t mess it up</p>

  <p><b>[Former Reds frontman John Aldridge says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> should be doing all they can to reach a loan agreement with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> for <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a>]</b> I think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> should do all they can to bring him back to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. I know there will be some fans out there who might be surprised by my call for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s owners to hand <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> a route back to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, but let me explain why I think this transfer could work for all parties. Despite his troubles in Spain, we are talking about a class player here who lit up <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. He was a big hero of the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> faithful during his time at the club. He understands how English football works and would not need long to acclimatise if he returns to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Crucially, this loan move could be funded within the tight financial boundaries <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is working with this summer<br /><br /><b>[With <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> having already passed up the chance to sign <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> from <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a>]</b> <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s decision to pull out of a deal to sign Werner confirmed they are short of cash after the coronavirus pandemic ripped a hole on football’s finances, but a one-year deal should be affordable. <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> didn’t handle his exit from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as well as he could have done. With his eagerness to complete what he saw as a dream move to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> seeing him pull a few tricks to get out of the club. That left a nasty taste in the mouth, but we are heading into this summer with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> openly admitting they can’t afford to sign top players. They could have a chance to get around that by getting <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> in on loan. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> can’t afford to stand still and allow their opponents to close the gap they have opened up on the opposition in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. So that’s why I say a deal to bring <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> back on loan would make sense for all parties.</p>

The position they have got <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> into in recent years is absolute evidence that they deserve to be trusted but they’re not soft, they know there’s a possibility of losing <b>[Mohamed]</b> <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> and <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane for a period of time next January now it looks like the Africa Cup of Nations is going to be rescheduled back to that time of the year and I just wonder whether there might be a change of heart over bringing a player or two in.
