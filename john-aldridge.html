  <p><b>[John Aldridge says Liverpool should be looking at the likes of Lucas Moura and Wilfried Zaha if they are in the market for another forward]</b> With Daniel Sturridge leaving the club and his huge wages coming off the weekly bill, it opens up the opportunity for Klopp to sign an out-and-out goalscorer who could offer something different if one of the front three is injured or out of form. Antoine Griezmann has been mentioned as a possible target, but he would be a very expensive option as his transfer fee and wages would be extravagant for a player who would expect to start every week.<br /><br />So I wonder whether Lucas Moura could be prised away from Tottenham, as he had to be a little bemused to be left out of their Champions League final starting line-up after he scored a fantastic hat-trick in the semi-final against Ajax. Moura is a tricky forward who could slot into the team if any of the front three were out and the same could be said of his team-mate Son Heung-min, although I would be surprised if Spurs allowed the South Korean to leave after his outstanding season.<br /><br />It may be that Klopp and his excellent team of scouts have an ace up their sleeves as they look for an extra striker, with their signings over the last couple of years confirming they tend to get things right when they bring players to Anfield, so I’m confident they will get this one right. Maybe they should look into the possibility of recruiting Wilfried Zaha from Crystal Palace, who is rumoured to have made it clear he wants to move on to play Champions League football. Zaha has given Liverpool some real problems in the last couple of years and Klopp’s ability to turn talents of his type into consistent performers has to make him the kind of player who could thrive at Anfield. Transfer fees and wages will be an issue for Liverpool. They won’t pay the kind of crazy money on offer at clubs being fuelled by owners using up spare change from their country’s oil business to play fantasy football</p>

  <p><b>[John Aldridge says Liverpool need to resign themselves to the fact that Matthijs de Ligt will end up elsewhere]</b> While I said that a deal to sign Virgil van Dijk’s Dutch central defensive partner Matthijs de Ligt would be great for Liverpool, the money he and his agent appear to be demanding means he will end up elsewhere. Instead, Klopp needs to focus his defensive reinforcement by signing cover at left-back following the departure of Alberto Moreno, as a long-term injury to Andy Robertson would be a major blow given they don’t have a quality stand-in.<br /><br />The return of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain from injury will feel like a new signing in midfield and if he starts performing at the levels he was producing before he picked up his long-term problem, he could be a very useful asset for Liverpool next season. Despite my musings here, Liverpool are not in need of too many changes this summer after Klopp’s back-up players confirmed they have what it takes to step up to the plate when they came from 3-0 down to beat Barcelona in the Champions League semi-finals. Yet the great teams strengthen when they are in a strong position and if Klopp can add a couple of extra components to his magnificent machine, Liverpool will be ready to take on Manchester City in an era when 90 points is the bare minimum required to challenge for the title.</p>

  <p><b>[John Aldridge says Liverpool shouldn’t blow budget on Coutinho]</b> Coutinho left on a sour note as he forced his way out of the club and while he is a great player, I don’t think Liverpool should blow their transfer budget on bringing him back. None of us have forgotten that Coutinho left Liverpool in a difficult position when he jumped ship mid-way through the season, so we should not give him a simple route back to play for the European champions. We all trust Klopp in whatever decisions he makes, but I think adding attacking a top quality attacking option would be the way forward this summer.<br /><br />Wilfried Zaha is the one I think he <b>[Klopp]</b> should go for. With Daniel Sturridge leaving the club and his huge wages coming off the weekly bill, it opens up the opportunity for Klopp to sign an out-and-out goalscorer who could offer something different if one of the front three is injured or out of form.

  <p><b>[John Aldridge says Jurgen Klopp has ‘earned the right’ to oversee a quiet transfer window]</b> Jurgen Klopp appears to be ready to hand Liverpool’s youthful talent a chance to shine in his first team rather than signing big money players this summer and he has earned the right to be backed in this bold decision. I have watched a lot of Liverpool’s junior teams in action over the last few years and there is a fantastic crop of young talents coming through. The big concern would be what happens if one or two of his front three of Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino are out for an extended period.<br /><br />Firmino had a short spell on the sidelines at the back end of last season, but Salah and Mane were fit for most of the campaign - and that was crucial in sustaining the challenge in the domestic title race and in the Champions League. Imagine a scenario that sees Salah and Mane out for three or four months. I’m not sure Liverpool would have the back-up performers to plug that gap, but finding players of that quality to sit on the bench in reserve would be no easy task<br /><br /><b>[Liverpool won the Champions League last season, but fell one point short of Manchester City in the Premier League title race]</b> To win the Premier League next season, Liverpool will need to collect more than 90 points once again as I fully expect Manchester City to break through that points total once again. City have signed Rodri from Atletico Madrid for a club record £62.8m earlier this month and unless UEFA and the Premier League do something to halt their spending, Pep Guardiola’s side will keep spending in their missio n to have total dominance of their game. Liverpool were the only side who stood up to City last season and it is hard to imagine that story change when the new season gets underway</p>

  <p><b>[John Aldridge says Alisson’s untimely injury has forced Liverpool to put a plaster on a problem they could do without]</b> Liverpool’s defence has not been right throughout the pre-season, with those flaws illuminated once again as Norwich had four very good chances to score in the first half and must have wondered how they went in at half-time 4-0 behind. A team with better quality attacking players would have punished a Liverpool defence that doesn’t seem to have found the right balance in recent weeks, with the concern over the goalkeeper now the most pressing issue for Klopp.<br /><br />After Simon Mignolet left to join Club Brugge, Adrian has been signed on a free transfer after he was released by West Ham, but the back-up keeper is not in place if anything happens to him ahead of next Wednesday’s UEFA Super Cup match against Chelsea in Istanbul. Young Irishman Caoimhin Kelleher is a fine talent, but he has only just resumed training after a wrist problem, with the youngsters behind him in the pecking order not ready to play first-team football yet. I don’t know what would happen if Adrian got injured now, with the signing of Andy Lonergan on a short-term deal putting a plaster on a problem Liverpool could do without<br /><br /><b>[Aldridge admits that he remains concerned about the impact summer international tournaments will have on a side chasing down the Premier League title]</b> These international tournaments during the summer months need to be looked at and I can’t believe the clubs have not made demands for changes to be made to ensure there is conformity across the world on when these events are played. Why can’t the African Cup of Nations and the Copa America tournaments be played at the same time as the European Championships, ensuring that all the players are away at the same time and their employers have a reasonable amount of time to get them ready for the new season? Is that too much to ask?<br /><br />Every player wants to play for his country and I treasure all of my Ireland caps, but it seems unfair that Sadio Mane was still playing for Senegal in the middle of July and then has to come back to Liverpool and play in the Premier League a few weeks later. There is a danger that Liverpool’s players will run out of steam at some point in this season as some of the players have not had a proper break this summer and while I am of the view that players should never get tired, modern footballers are very different and the sports scientists around them will tell them they are tired by looking at data on a computer screen</p>

  <p><b>[John Aldridge says <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> is now worth well beyond the £100 million mark]</b> Mane was something of an unknown quantity when <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> signed him from Southampton in the summer of 2016 and while he always had raw pace, <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> and his coaching staff have turned him into a potent scoring weapon in the last couple of seasons. He is there with Salah now as a scoring threat and if either of the pair were put up for sale by <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> (which is not happening by the way!) the fee they would command would be well beyond the £100m mark. Keeping those three fit is vital to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s hopes of success this season, with the opening few weeks of this season confirming the European champions mean business in the Premier League<br /><br /><b>[Mane and Salah got the goals against <a href="newcastle-united.html">the Magpies</a>, but it was <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> who impressed the most after stepping off the bench to inspire a come-from-behind success for the Reds]</b> Some of his movement and his intelligent passes were sublime and Mane and Salah look better players when <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> is on the field and opening a few doors for them. I have not always been <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>’s biggest fan and there were times last season when I questioned whether he should remain in the team, but <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has always stood behind him and he is showing us why now. <a href="divock-origi.html">Divock Origi</a> going off injured gave us a chance to see what <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> brings to the party and the game changed when he came on, with the <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> defence now unsettled.

  <p><b>[John Aldridge says <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> looks a little low on confidence]</b> <b>[I have]</b> mild concerns surrounding <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s front three, with <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a>, <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> and <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> a long way short of their brilliant best right now. The goals have not been flowing for Salah this season and you get the sense that he is a little low on confidence, but I would not have too many concerns about <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s main man up front. He has missed a few too many chances this season and the same can be said of Mane and <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> to an extent, but we know what those three are all about when they click into gear and one high scoring game could get all three back on track in an instant. In many respects, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s immaculate start to this <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> campaign is all the more impressive when you consider their big three in the forward line are not firing on all cylinders and it has to be an ominous sign for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in what looks set to be another tight title race.<br /><br />I believe last season’s Champions League victory has changed the way a lot of these players view themselves and this <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team as they have gone from being a team that has potential to do well to a team of winners. Not just winners of a domestic cup, but European champions and that lavish tag has to fill them with confidence. The brilliant <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team I stepped into in the mid-1980s was full of proven winners and when you have that first medal or two in your collection, it gives you a huge advantage over rivals who are still chasing that first big trophy. Champions have a mindset that ensures they expect to win, while the opposition don’t quite believe they will get over the line until they have proved to themselves that they can do it and this is why I feel <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have a very different look now.</p>

  <p><b>[John Aldridge says The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title is not <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s yet]</b> With only eight games played this season, it is ridiculous to suggest the title race is anywhere near over, but there is no denying that we are seeing vulnerabilities from <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> that were not there last season. Their 2-0 home defeat against <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> on the back of the away loss at <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> shows that this City team have cracks that are being exposed, with their defensive frailties in evidence yet again. <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a> will come back soon, but I don’t see him solving defensive problems that are stemming from the reality that Nicolas Otamendi is not up to the job of holding that back-line together in the absence of the departed <a href="vincent-kompany.html">Vincent Kompany</a> and the injured Aymeric Laporte<br /><br />City manager <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> has said he won’t spend any money in the January transfer window, but I fully expect him to spend upwards of £100m on a centre-back as soon as he can because he knows that defence will not be good enough to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> or Champions League. I also feel that <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> is more focused on European success than chasing more domestic glory now, with his celebrations as City beat Dinamo Zagreb in unconvincing fashion in the Champions League last week suggesting his sights are targeting Europe this season.<br /><br />He was jumping up and down on the touchline in that Champions League clash and has been urging City fans to create the kind of atmosphere in home matches that drove <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to European glory last season, but that just won’t happen. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> on European nights is a unique experience and, try as they might, City fans will never be able to repeat it at their <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Etihad Stadium</a>, so they face a tough challenge. They will need to keep buying their way to success if they are to conquer Europe. There are still 30 games to play in this <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> season, so ignore anyone who tells you this title race is finished</p>

We played what you would probably say was a 4-2-3-1, while this team is a more traditional 4-3-3. But in terms of the football both teams play; attacking, flamboyant, with game-changers everywhere, yeah, you can see the similarities<br /><br /><b>[Aldridge is modest when he discusses his own <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> career]</b> I was just there to finish the moves off. Barnesy was the best player I ever played with. He was the absolute business. I had good movement, but most of my goals were six-yard tap-ins or headers. All I had to do is give it simple, take the centre-half away and get to the far post. Then Barnesy would pick me out!<br /><br /><b>[How, though, would he have fitted into the current setup under <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, we wonder?]</b> Good question!

It’s his awareness, the way he brings people into play. <a href="peter-beardsley.html">Beardsley</a>, for example, was a great player, with great feet and tricks, but he would play more with his head down. <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> has more awareness.

We probably played better last year, scored more goals and conceded less but we’ve won more games. That’s what matters at the end of the day. I don’t know whether the lack of clean sheets is becoming a psychological thing. I think the manager, the defenders and the goalkeeper won’t be happy because it’s like a goalscorer, you’re only happy when you’re scoring because it gives you pride in your performance and getting clean sheets shows that you’re doing your job. Unfortunately we’re not getting the clean sheets but we’re getting the wins. The manager will know that you can’t keep having to score two goals to win games and get over the line</p>

Winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and getting this 30-year wait for the trophy off their backs has to be the priority in 2020 and with a ten-point lead established at the top of the table after their remarkable start to the season, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> need to finish the job off in a professional manner. So, while it’s easy to be sceptical about a tournament played at a strange time of the year in an unfamiliar part of the world, <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has to find the positives in the hand he has been dealt.<br /><br />Whatever anyone says, the title race is not over with 63 points still to play for in the second half of the season and a couple of defeats or injuries to key players could derail <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, with tricky games against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> and <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> on the horizon over the Christmas period.

Sometimes he comes a little bit too deep for me and when the ball gets whipped out to Trent and <a href="andy-robertson.html">Robbo</a> he can’t make it into the box in time. The two vital goals he scored were about being in the right place at the right time and hopefully can play a part in helping him get back to top form.

  <p><b>[John Aldridge says <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> has become a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> great in his own right]</b> Plenty of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans rushed to judgement on Jordan after he struggled in his first few months at the club, and I was among those who questioned whether he was up to the task of leading from the front in a title-winning team.<br /><br />It didn’t help that he was handed the task of succeeding <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> legend <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> as the club’s captain, as it seemed like an almost impossible task and yet now he is every inch a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> great in his own right. I don’t remember <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans ever singing Henderson’s name, despite him joining the select band of heroes who have lifted the Champions League trophy as Reds captain in Madrid last May.<br /><br />All credit to the lad because he has turned himself in a wonderful leader at the heart of this <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team and I suspect manager <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> decided to substitute him with a couple of minutes to go <b>[against Southampton]</b> because he knew the fans would give him the salute he was due. Henderson is a shining example of a player who has taken his game up several levels working under <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> and his coaching staff and when you look around the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team, there are examples of that<br /><br />What this team are doing will be remembered for years to come and the focus they have shown to maintain this level of excellence for the best part of 18 months is quite extraordinary. The <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans were singing ‘we’re gonna win the league’ once again when Southampton were beaten and with the chasing pack dropping points on a reasonably regular basis, it does feel like it is a matter of time now</p>

City certainly seem to have a phobia about us though and I think it stems from the manager<br /><br />They have got a decent chance of winning the Carabao Cup, and are still in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup, but if they get knocked out of the Champions League - and on the evidence of what we have seen in recent weeks and months, they will have their work cut out getting past <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> - it could end up being a sackable season for <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>. It certainly would be abroad where the big Spanish and Italian clubs get rid of coaches for less. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have done phenomenally well and deserve every bit of praise and credit they are getting but, given the vast resources and experience they have, should City really be so far behind us?<br /><br /><a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>’s comments after the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> game about what former <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> chairman Richard Scudamore - who left his post over a year ago - might say about <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s dominance of the league after his previous comments about City’s 100-point season were just bizarre and another example for me of how the pressure has got to him. His team have not been doing what they should have been after spending absolutely ridiculous amounts of money over the last four years, although their spending has reduced as they are still under investigation over Financial Fair Play. That team needs a major revamp, which is amazing to think when you think how much money they have thrown into that squad, and ultimately that comes back on the manager’s head so he has to look at himself in the mirror</p>

For me, he was and still is a really good player and, with the squad we’ve got now I’m sure he’d do very well but I lean more towards the ‘never go back’ argument.<br /><br />It can work sometimes but he’s on a lot more money at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> which could be a potential problem and of course there would be the question of how much cash <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> would want from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> for him.

Ultimately <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> chose to leave, we got top dollar for him and it’s worked in our favour.<br /><br />We went out and brought in Van Dijk and Alisson for pretty much the same money and you have to say we haven’t looked back since - European champions, world champions and a 22-point lead at the top of the league as we look to end this 30-year weight for a league title.<br /><br />I wish the lad well but at the end of the day what’s happened to him shows that the grass is not always greener on the other side. It used to be said years ago if you left <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> there was only one way to go and that’s down, and it’s a sign of the times that some players are now discovering that again.<br /><br />Another in the same boat is <a href="emre-can.html">Emre Can</a>.

They’ve made themselves look absolutely stupid, arrogant and greedy. Many of them should know better. Especially the ones who are running clubs. It seems like some of them are panicking.

  <p><b>[Aldridge says Get <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> the title &amp; start next season at Xmas]</b> Hopefully <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> get exactly what they deserve this season and that is <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title. People talk about how this league season won’t get finished, but it has to. Next year’s league shouldn’t start if this one cannot finish. What is the point? What is the point in starting a season and scrapping it 75 per cent of the way through? Forget about next year’s competition. What has been started simply has to finish. Whether that is two, three, four months down the line, it just has to finish. Next season is the one that can be retracted or reformed for whatever reason. If it starts at Christmas, for example, then split it in half and have the top half compete for the title or Europe. The bottom half will be forced to battle for survival. You just can’t stop a season without a conclusion. Anyone suggesting it can is wrong. I cannot believe that it has even been suggested<br /><br />This season now cannot be impacted any more than it has already. <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> or West Brom, for example, try telling those two great clubs that they cannot come up to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. It is worth too much money to these clubs and they deserve the chance to try and finish it off to get back into the top flight. People are still talking about voiding the season, I just cannot understand that. As I say, get the world back on track and then complete the season. Cancelling three-quarters of a season to start a fresh one is frankly ridiculous. It really is. It’s not set in stone that every season has to begin in August. These are unprecedented times and it should be amended to suit the season that is already being played out. Next season can start when it is permitted, everyone begins afresh at the same time and it’s all on a level playing field. This season that is here now, it needs finishing. Hopefully, common sense will prevail</p>

  <p><b>[John Aldridge claims Elliott will have ‘incredibly bright future’ at Liverpool]</b> I really think <a href="harvey-elliott.html">Harvey Elliott</a> has an incredibly bright future ahead of him at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. That the teenager only turned 17 last week shows just what a star he can be as he gets a little bit older in this set-up at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. You can’t be the youngest player in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s history if you are a dud. Fulham saw that and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> did too, so they brought him in last summer. Looking at him, I would say his future is as a winger. He seems to be an old-school winger and it is a difficult one to play. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will be looking where Elliott’s best position is and he could even become one of the three in midfield as an attacking type or as part of that front three, but he’s got to add goals to his game. It will be tough, of course, given <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s current standing in the game but he has got the ability, no question. He is grounded too from what I have seen and that can go a long way. They might send him out on loan in the future but the fact that he has had senior game-time already shows you how highly <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> rates him. And <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> will be assessing him in training every day, too because the level <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> play at when they are at Melwood will find players out if they cannot match it. If players are not up to it, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will find out at training, so Elliott must be doing all the right things that are being asked of him and he will be picking <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s brain on how to improve so that can only be a good thing for all concerned.</p>

  <p><b>[John Aldridge says <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> has no need to leave <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> for Barcelona]</b> The release of the documentary tracking the career and life story of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> forward <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> has got people talking. Not least the part where he makes a vow to people in his Senegalese home town that he will win the Ballon d’Or. That declaration has prompted suggestions from several people that the only way Mane can realise his dream is by leaving <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> and heading to Spain to join either <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. I can see what they are saying. In recent times, almost every award has been won by <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> or <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. That they have played for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> or Real at the time has been coincidental. It has been unfortunate for so many great players that they have found themselves in an era with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. To finish above them, you have got to have done something unbelievably special. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, though, shouldn’t be too worried about Mane’s situation. They have never before been in such a strong position to be able to keep hold of their best players. Indeed, now would be the worst time for them to start potentially cashing in. Mane has probably been our best player this season. And what’s more, he can get even better next season and perhaps even win the Champions League again. What’s more, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are a better team than either <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or Real at present. When things are going well, you just have to enjoy it, and I’m sure Mane has been over the past 18 months. That said, if players really want to leave, then it’s hard to keep them in the modern era. But Mane doesn’t seem the type. Whenever I’ve spoken to him, he seems very humble, and doesn’t seem someone who would agitate for a move like other players such as <a href="fernando-torres.html">Fernando Torres</a>. And don’t forget, even if the Reds forward moves to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, for example, he’d still have to overcome <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. Mane can win the Ballon d’Or as he’s a great player. And he has as much chance winning it while at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> than anywhere else</p>

Jordan’s rose up and raised the bar, not just for himself but for everybody in the team, and the lads around have responded to that.

  <p><b>[Former Reds frontman John Aldridge says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> should be doing all they can to reach a loan agreement with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> for Philippe Coutinho]</b> I think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> should do all they can to bring him back to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. I know there will be some fans out there who might be surprised by my call for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s owners to hand <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> a route back to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, but let me explain why I think this transfer could work for all parties. Despite his troubles in Spain, we are talking about a class player here who lit up <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. He was a big hero of the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> faithful during his time at the club. He understands how English football works and would not need long to acclimatise if he returns to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Crucially, this loan move could be funded within the tight financial boundaries <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is working with this summer<br /><br /><b>[With <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> having already passed up the chance to sign <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> from RB Leipzig]</b> <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s decision to pull out of a deal to sign Werner confirmed they are short of cash after the coronavirus pandemic ripped a hole on football’s finances, but a one-year deal should be affordable. <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> didn’t handle his exit from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as well as he could have done. With his eagerness to complete what he saw as a dream move to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> seeing him pull a few tricks to get out of the club. That left a nasty taste in the mouth, but we are heading into this summer with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> openly admitting they can’t afford to sign top players. They could have a chance to get around that by getting <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> in on loan. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> can’t afford to stand still and allow their opponents to close the gap they have opened up on the opposition in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. So that’s why I say a deal to bring <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> back on loan would make sense for all parties.</p>

  <p><b>[John Aldridge says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> may have passed on the opportunity to sign <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> but it would still come as a surprise if <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> does not look to land another striker in the next transfer window]</b> We understand the reasons why they decided not to sign <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> and how the manager and those around him are determined to build the right kind of squad and not go for quick fixes. The position they have got <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> into in recent years is absolute evidence that they deserve to be trusted but they’re not soft, they know there’s a possibility of losing <b>[Mohamed]</b> Salah and <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane for a period of time next January now it looks like the Africa Cup of Nations is going to be rescheduled back to that time of the year and I just wonder whether there might be a change of heart over bringing a player or two in. We’ve got <a href="curtis-jones.html">Curtis Jones</a> who can come in for <b>[Adam]</b> <a href="adam-lallana.html">Lallana</a> but if <b>[Xherdan]</b> <a href="xherdan-shaqiri.html">Shaqiri</a> goes we will need another striker, I think. It’s not easy to improve a squad as good as <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s but Chelse, amongst others, are strengthening well and will be more competitive next season, as will <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> who have a great looking player in <b>[Bruno]</b> Fernandes and will no doubt to try attract more<br /><br />When you’re ahead, you have to try and make sure you stay that one step ahead so if that means going out and getting a world-class player to enhance the squad then I would like to see us do it. There will be a couple of players who leave in the summer and, while we have high hopes for some of the young lads who clearly have big futures ahead of them, I would still like to see us get someone in. Ultimately it comes down to whether <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> feels the same but if he does, I’d be surprised if it didn’t happen.</p>
