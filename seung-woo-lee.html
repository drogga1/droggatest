  <p><b>[Barcelona prodigy Seung-Woo Lee is not being lured away from the club by reported <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> interest, according to the player’s father]</b> We have not received any offer from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. We’re thankful for interest from a big club but what <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are doing for my son and the environment they made for my family is almost perfect. We don’t have any intention of ditching them even if an offer actually came in. Interest from Spanish media are almost scary. But my son is doing well and he’s focusing on his football</p>
