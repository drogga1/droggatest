  <p><b>[Ajax coach Frank de Boer after failing to win the Dutch Eredivisie title, which went to <a href="psv.html">PSV Eindhoven</a>, before he announced he left the club after serving as manager for six years]</b> This is a bad, terrible dream.

  <p><b>[Frank de Boer uses a motorsport metaphor to describe the pressure of coaching a high-profile club like Italian giants Internazionale]</b> Results are not good at the moment, but we are at the beginning of a project. We started from nothing and you need time to get to know a team. I feel like I’m in Formula One, with the haste of having to improve in a short time. It’s just a matter of time until results start coming. It’s normal when you are starting a project and the club is aware of that. I repeat, in Formula One you can race when the car is ready. I’ve said many times that a coach of a big club like Inter, <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> always has a lot of pressure on him when the results are not there. I think I’m doing a good job for the team, though. When you have not won a trophy for four or five years it is normal that the coach can come under scrutiny</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United Coach Frank de Boer who was <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> boss at the time and, with a number of his side involved, he watched on intently]</b> Van Gaal did a great job to put five in the back because he knew, ‘OK, we are defensively not strong enough’. We had the quality up front with <a href="robin-van-persie.html">Robin van Persie</a> and especially <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a>. They made the difference in 2014, with <a href="wesley-sneijder.html">Wesley Sneijder</a> delivering the pass to them<br /><br /><b>[Frank de Boer on current dutch national team]</b> <a href="rafael-van-der-vaart.html">Rafael van der Vaart</a>, <a href="wesley-sneijder.html">Sneijder</a>… they left a gap. You have to put young, fresh guys in but at that moment they weren’t ready - they were still 17 or 18 years old. Everyone wants to qualify, but a small country like us always has periods where we don’t have that much talent. Sometimes you have to fall a bit deep to come back stronger<br /><br /><b>[Frank de Boer on Virgil Van Dijk]</b> He has so much confidence it is unbelievable. He is a leader in the defence and also outside the field, it gives the other players confidence<br /><br /><b>[Frank de Boer on De Ligt]</b> He has got everything: speed, good technique, he can build up from behind, he’s a fantastic defender. It’s unbelievable what he’s already done</p>

  <p><b>[Frank de Boer has laughed off suggestions that Atlanta United is looking to offload struggling designated player Gonzalo Martinez]</b> It’s ridiculous, you know. We’re just halfway through the season and he’s new. I always say the first six months is the hardest for everyone who comes to a new culture. He has to adapt. We have a lot of confidence in his quality. There is no doubt about it. He knows that he has to do better. He wants to do better. He’s working hard for it. We have a lot of trust in him, so I don’t know where those rumors are coming from. But, it’s not based on anything<br /><br /><b>[De Boer said of Josef Martinez]</b> He’s a major impact. He keeps everyone on top of their toes. You want that. He wants to give everything, but he wants in return that everybody <b>[else]</b> shows that same spirit and mentality</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United vs <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a>. Atlanta boss Frank de Boer again had to deal with one of his players publicly criticising his methods this week with Leandro Gonzalez Pirez saying he didn’t like the team’s defensive tactics]</b> Everybody knows those comments stay inside. If there are doubts or arguments, we talk about it like adults here. We know how it works in football. We had three players in MLS team of the week. I was coach of the week. This is how it sometimes goes. We have to learn from that. We want to improve and want to be on top of every game and at the end also on top of the league, especially in our conference at the end of the season. It’s our goal. It’s looking right. We are a team, and we want to be a top team. That means we want to play our best every week. That’s how top teams work</p>

  <p><b>[Frank de Boer has labelled the equal pay debate as ridiculous following the Dutch federation’s commitment to level the pay for the country’s men’s and women’s national team players]</b> I think for me, it’s ridiculous. It’s the same like tennis. If there are watching, for the World Cup final, 500 million people or something like that, and 100 million for a women’s final, that’s a difference. So it’s not the same. And of course they have to be paid what they deserve to <b>[earn]</b> and not less, just what they really deserve. If it’s just as popular as the men, they will get it, because the income and the advertising will go into that. But it’s not like that, so why do they have to earn the same? I think it’s ridiculous. I don’t understand that<br /><br /><b>[De Boer says he believes that the equal pay debate was spurred on by changes in other aspects of society that have nothing to do with sport]</b> I think it started because a woman <b>[was]</b> getting underpaid, especially at <b>[managerial]</b> positions. They have to earn the same as a man. I think if you have a manager position for a bank or something, you have to earn the same what the men did because it’s not physically, just only here <b>[points to head]</b>, so why do you have to earn less, because you’re doing the same job as a man? I think that’s also dropped a little bit into the sports world, like tennis and soccer. But I think that’s still different</p>

  <p><b>[Frank de Boer reignited his war of words with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>, stating that he believes karma always strikes back. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> snuck in a further jibe at that fact, stating that, if the Dutchman was <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>’s manager, he would be coached how to lose because he lost every game]</b> At that moment, he can say that because it was a really bad record, of course. For me, if he wants to say that, I’m not the guy who wants to respond to that … I think karma always strikes back<br /><br /><b>[De Boer says he believes that his time at <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> could have and should have ended differently]</b> I’m convinced. I think if we get the time we should, we definitely turn it around, especially at <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>. We had a feeling, in training you saw it, that this is the moment we’re going to go looking up and win games. And then they decided to sack me. Of course that’s not the nicest feeling, but it’s like that<br /><br />I was especially angry. They do some promises and they have a philosophy: ‘OK, we want to be a solid club’. For example, <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>, you have to also play like a modern team and don’t play relegation football. If you want to do that, OK, one year you can survive, maybe two years. But one time you will go down, I am convinced. So they wanted to change that, like <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> was doing in that period. I saw that picture in front of me, so I had the feeling that I had time, but when the season started, you already see some signs that this is not the way. You always walk in front of a door, and it’s not opening, and I had the feeling again, and also at Inter, that we have to do this and this, and then we make our steps forward. Every time somebody was stepping on the brakes</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United head coach Frank de Boer fears star forward Josef Martinez suffered a serious injury in the defending <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> champions’s win over the San Jose Earthquakes]</b> I’m afraid that he has something serious, but we have to wait. They’re evaluating him now. Probably tomorrow we can have a better diagnosis and then we have to make our plan. Hopefully it’s not so bad. But I can’t say if it’s good or bad. I don’t know. We know Josef a little bit – he’s a tough guy. He will not suddenly step off the field. He will have something, that’s for sure. But we have to wait. It’s too early to predict. But I think it’s not a good sign that he goes off … but it’s like that. We have to deal with it. Again, we have to wait</p>

  <p><b>[Frank de Boer confident ahead of Concacaf Champions League]</b> It’s very good that there are players like Fernando Meza and Pity Martinez in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, because they are going to raise the level of MLS; now there are many players that want to be in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, including Mexicans. We are proving that the difference between Liga MX and <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is closing now that <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> has much more quality. The level will surely grow because when you play with quality players the level rises. Also for U.S. players it will be very good<br /><br />I think it’s fantastic that players like Pity want to play in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> and even moreso with our club. But <a href="javier-hernandez.html">Chicharito</a> is also a phenomenon and will be very good for the youngsters, as a player and as a professional. Pizarro is also a very good player and it would be fantastic if he signs with an <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> club</p>

If he’s ruled out, there’s a good possibility that we are looking at the market for a replacement</p>

  <p><b>[Frank de Boer says <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> filled a <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> role while on the books at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I think <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> was a player where everything <b>[went through]</b> him, every ball went to him at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. He could probably do less work, basically what <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> does with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. And the thing is you see how everything works together, it’s like a machine. If one is not doing it it’s fine maybe, they can handle that, but if it’s two similar types of players, that they also want every ball and have that special position in the team, then you see how vulnerable a team can be. I think we saw that with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. There’s only one that can do that now and that is <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. The team is adapting and if you have to adapt for two players like this, it’s difficult. I think <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> is an unbelievable player but sometimes he doesn’t fit the puzzle and maybe with another club it will go perfectly well. It doesn’t mean he is a bad player. It doesn’t mean that you are not a great player when you can’t play for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> - no. It sometimes doesn’t fit your style of play and sometimes you have bad luck, not bad luck, that <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s around and he has that role, and then you have to do a different role that doesn’t suit you a little bit. So it’s a shame for <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> but I think now he will do okay</p>

You don’t feel the stress that they are really trying to press you, that you have to get good results.
