  <p><b>[Santiago Denia, Spain’s coach, on the other hand, was far more reserved of his team’s display and regretted their inability to equalize]</b> <b>[It was an]</b> Equally contested match. We played well in the first 10 minutes and then Brazil had a very good first half. We played better in the sec half. We could have equalized. We still have areas to improve.<br /><br />Sergio Gomez played like he played in Euro Champs. Both him and Abel played a good match. The whole teams need to improve. We have two games left and we will try to win that<br /><br />Its not normal to see so many players have a muscular problem. Spain has been here just for four days. We are working with our doctors and physios to improve this</p>

  <p><b>[Spain Under-17 coach Santiago Denia seemed happy after a thumping win over Niger at Kochi on Sunday]</b> We are happy for the win and the three points to Spain’s account. I am happy that we played as a team. But at the same time, we know that we need to improve on a lot of aspects. Niger pressed us up front during the starting minutes. It was difficult with the pressure they put. After Niger had the pressure, we could make our passes and we could play our natural game. The objective is to score goals<br /><br />No. In the African championship, they played attacking. They pressed from the middle. We had space in the middle so we could make the most out of it. In the beginning, we played a risky game but after 10 mins, it was easy for us to play. In the end, we had players who could cope with the pressure<br /><br /><b>[On Abel Ruiz]</b> It’s not the worry that Abel Ruiz missed chances, its the work of the staff to tell players to improve in a certain way. My feedback is positive about Abel. He has in this category for last two years for Spain and Barcelona. He will continue to be good. He has a bright future for the national team and Barcelona</p>
