  <p><b>[Alex Manninger believes a heightened focus on goalkeeping problems has become Liverpool-specific]</b> I have been here for five months and have found out that the goalie thing is a bit Liverpool-specific. I can say this because it is not going against people, but the unfortunate thing for Loris is that he didn’t have a pre-season <b>[due to injury]</b>. He didn’t train the way he wanted to do, to get a rhythm, a flow. Chelsea game big chance for Liverpool’. He got thrown in by the coach, which is his decision, and unfortunately he couldn’t take his chance. But he is not a bad goalkeeper because of this. I knew him from Germany and when Liverpool signed him I thought, ‘Well done.’ I know many other clubs wanted him. To get a young, complete goalkeeper is not easy. There are not many around and many are taken by clubs already - Courtois, De Gea, <b>[Kasper]</b> Schmeichel. It is difficult to get them in their early 20s or you pay silly money</p>

  <p><b>[Gianluigi Buffon admitted that he may consider extending his career beyond the end of the current campaign]</b> Gigi is an exceptional man. When I arrived at Juventus, he gave me a great welcome and that created a special relationship right from the start. We are still in contact today and we talk often. My four years in Turin was an experience of an extraordinary level thanks to Gigi. As a goalkeeper, it’s pointless to add anything else. He was a truly world-class player, the role model for anyone that wants to become a goalkeeper. In short, he is the absolute reference point. I remember that, as an opponent, I used to examine him from afar. I followed his moves and I admired him. Then, arriving at Juventus, I had the good fortune to observe him day after day in training and that helped me understand his greatness even more.<br /><br />From him, I really learned so much in terms of the role of a captain. His presence in the dressing room was always that of a true leader, capable of motivating all of his team-mates, of being hard in moments in which it was needed and giving us all a great incentive to improve. I’m very proud at having shared four years of my footballing career with a genuine legend</p>
