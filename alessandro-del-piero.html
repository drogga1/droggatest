Then again, results have not favoured us. I don’t know what to think right now. We have missed out on all our objectives. We have never played to finish in second place and this has made us lose motivation. We must get it back in our remaining games and the clash with Milan at the <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a> will be crucial for second spot.</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus showed they are built to win the Champions League]</b> They did everything they had to do without conceding anything to Barcelona. Juventus reached the semi-finals for the second time in three years and that’s a very important thing. Two years ago, Juventus seemed in deficit compared with Barca, but you didn’t see that on the pitch, or even on an emotional level. They defended as a great team and showed that they’re built to win the Champions League.</p>

  <p><b>[Alessandro Del Piero believes this could be the year that Paulo Dybala becomes a superstar on the Champions League stage]</b> Every year he’s moving up a level. He showed a lot in these two games <b>[against Lazio and Spurs]</b>. He’s a very good guy and an incredible talent. We don’t need to mention his quality. What I saw every year is that he’s growing. Maybe this year is the year for him.<br /><br />This year he made an incredible start. He was scoring a couple of goals a game, he was playing so well and he drove Juve in the first period that was very tough for the club. Then came the injury but then he came back with this goal <b>[against Spurs]</b>. In the same week he scored in Rome against Lazio so Juve had the opportunity to go ahead of Napoli. It will be very interesting to understand how the this season will end for him<br /><br />History is important. How you build a season is important and then there’s magic situations like this. Let’s take Real Madrid, they don’t play well this year, fourth in the table in the league but they are so comfortable in this competition. They usually win against everyone and on the other side is Juve. The moment they have to win, they win. This is very important because the game in London against Tottenham was very tough, especially after the first leg. And they found a way to turn the game to get the qualification</p>

  <p><b>[the shadows of Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi]</b> With Messi and Ronaldo everybody is unlucky. Two icons, two incredible players, two champions. They score almost every game. It’s something crazy.<br /><br />You can compare <b>[Higuain]</b> to Ronaldo now because he changed the position on the field with Zidane especially. He’s become an amazing striker. Everybody has their own history and has to write the story on their own. So, Gonzalo has the opportunity this year to do it. He’s doing it with Juve. He’s playing well, not only goals, so he’s in a good moment. I think he will reach the top of the level in the right moment this season</p>

  <p><b>[Alessandro Del Piero hopes his former Juventus team-mate Gianluigi Buffon can finally win the Champions League this season]</b> It’s the thing that everybody’s hoping now. It’s the kind of trophy that he deserves. He’s lost two finals in three years so it’s pretty tough. But let me say also that even if he doesn’t win for me and for all the fans he is still the best goalkeeper in the world. It would change a lot for him I guess but not a lot from the perspective of the people who already look at him as a legend.<br /><br />Juventus don’t have a lot of luck with this cup because we reached the final many times and we won two. And one of the two no Juve fans want to remember because it was ‘85. And of course ‘96 was the best for many reasons. It’s not easy to explain. Juve have got to the final two times in three years. They lost the other year at 94 minutes against Bayern in the qualification <b>[last 16]</b>. It’s tough to understand what’s going on. When I was playing we reached the final more than one time so it’s controversial the situation. But let’s say because of the number of the finals, because Juve is still a strong, strong club, we deserve a little bit more. But what can you do? This is football and this is how it goes. They just need to put more effort in and let’s see what happens this year</p>

  <p><b>[Del Piero credits Zidane’s Italian football education for Real Madrid success]</b> As Italians, we are maniacs with some things. When you see his team, you can clearly feel that and see that something is going on.<br /><br />He has had the two coaches that changed a lot. Ancelotti and Lippi for him were very important for many reasons. I believe he thinks about Italy a lot when he’s coaching. He’s showing things he learned during his career as well, not only what he’s studying. The experience in Italy is very unique as a coach. Because you are under pressure a lot from every part of the job, fans, media, clubs and players sometimes. For us football is the first thing. It’s primary. You need to be 100 per cent<br /><br />Everybody is still in love with Zidane the player. But he got a lot of experience first under Ancelotti and then with the second team at Real Madrid. He studied a lot. I spoke with him and he was explaining how much he was studying and going around all the teams in France and Spain to look at what the other coaches were doing and how things were going on<br /><br />He’s a very smart guy and he knows how to do it and it shows in the work. I’m surprised a bit because he won the Champions League straightaway when he got the job. He found straightaway the way to make a successful team and put everybody on the same page. It’s not easy at that kind of club</p>

It was a great moment<br /><br />I was joking on my social media because they gave me the privilege and an honour to wear the stuff they give to the king. I said I’ve just been here for an hour and I already became a king. These are the kinds of things you can have on these tours. It’s great because the people really take care of you. Especially in this country they really want the best for you. There were some Juventus fans as well so it was nice. At the end of the day because of the Champions League trophy you become a huge community - all the people that won that trophy - so they respect you for that as well</p>

  <p><b>[Gonzalo Higuain looks angry after being forced out of Juventus by the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> AC Milan need him so badly, both for his goals and for his leadership. Everybody runs to hug him whenever he scores, this proves how happy he is in Milan and proves he’s settled in well. Before his move to Juventus, he used to complain much more, at Juve he has improved and he has learned to play for the team as well. However, I think he is angry with Juventus. He wanted to take his revenge after being kicked out of Juve. He had positive seasons at Juve but he was sold, I think that’s the reason for Higuain’s anger. Did you notice his celebrations? He opens his arms like he wants to be hugged. He is at AC Milan to solve their problems, he knows that and he loves it. He feels great in the group</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus’ project with Cristiano Ronaldo is going perfectly]</b> That’s what Juventus bought him for. He is a champion who has won this title and who knows what it’s like to play these difficult matches, with good football and by scoring goals. He is focused on the objective. Juventus signed him for this and the plan is going perfectly so far<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether it would be a failure if <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Massimiliano Allegri</a>’s side missed out on the Champions League crown]</b> Failure is a really big word. I wouldn’t use it. The project is about winning the Champions League with Ronaldo and he signed for four years. If you can win it in the first year then even better<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he was surprised that such a move was made]</b> Yes, a little, but not too much. Ronaldo could pick whatever team he wanted to go to in the world and it was a good piece of business that he picked Juventus<br /><br />When you have a player who scores a goal per game on average and then has a match when he doesn’t score then something’s missing. It can happen. There isn’t a rule that says you have to score all the goals. For me, it’s part of the game and you should leave it because you’ll score again in a game or two.</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> striker Alessandro Del Piero discussed the current <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> season]</b> I don’t think we needed that goal to overcome a moment that I think Paulo had already put behind him. One thing is certain, numbers like that show he’s a player with extraordinary qualities. Such a beautiful goal should give him more awareness. And I’ll go further. Those who have his means, his talent and even his head, must do even more. Paulo must not set himself limits and must conquer the future<br /><br />Nobody gives you anything, I say that from experience. To <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> more than ever. You have to prove everything until the last game, let alone in the middle of your career. <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a>’s path has just begun and it will be even more beautiful, always wearing the <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> shirt of course<br /><br /><b>[Del Piero doesn’t think that there are any favourites in the title race at this current point in the season]</b><br /><br />Absolutely not, no favourites. <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> are a bit ahead for absolute quality. But nothing is taken for granted<br /><br /><b>[The former <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a> forward believed that it was better to finish the season instead of cancelling it]</b> I can’t give a judgement, as I don’t think anyone can, because we have to analyse the facts and above all the health conditions. But sportively it’s better to finish the season, wait for the verdict on the pitch. Everything else is a thing to be avoided as long as it is possible<br /><br /><b>[Del Piero discussed what the priorities should be for when the season restarts and the importance of playing again]</b> The priority is always the health of everyone, so we need the highest level of safety. But the second priority must be to restart to deal with the other emergency, that of the economy, of jobs. I believe that all this must also be considered when we talk about the future of professional sport. I do not like the populist speeches of those who almost criminalise those who are trying to get us back on track. That’s why I say that when you get the okay from the doctors it will be right to go back to the game, at first of course behind closed doors<br /><br /><b>[He then defended those who are working to restart the league and highlighted why their work is important]</b> And so, what we can do today is to continue working, studying the formulas of the leagues, the calendars. This doesn’t just mean going back to a life that is at least more normal, but above all thinking about how to restart a movement that gives work to so many people. I believe that this does not mean absolutely no disrespect for the real priority, which is health. There is concern for the future in all fields, obviously also for football in general, not just for <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>. I am also thinking of the lower leagues<br /><br /><b>[The former <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a> star highlighted how this period can help improve Italian football as a whole]</b> This is precisely the time to triple our strength, to start again and to really change. I don’t know what will happen, but I know you can’t hide anymore. You can only come out of it as a system, it’s impossible to think that only a part has to leave us something. I think I know what should no longer be part of our future, that is, the logic that looks only at the present, without entrepreneurial perspective, without vision<br /><br /><b>[Finally, Del Piero spoke about how people must come together to help find a solution]</b> Everyone today has to do their part, if it helps then also us ex-players, those who have something to say or propose for the good of our sport. Obviously because they deserve it, and not for past merits</p>

  <p><b>[Alessandro Del Piero says <a href="carlos-vela.html">Carlos Vela</a> could play in Europe, but LAFC is a great club]</b> Los Angeles is a great place to live, also to play football, because <b>[LAFC]</b> has a good plan to build the team, the stadium, the stadium experience is great<br /><br /><b>[<a href="carlos-vela.html">Vela</a> could slot into almost any league and find success]</b> I think he could <b>[play in Europe]</b>.

  <p><b>[Del Piero also owns a restaurant in the United States city, and recently bemoaned the lockdown that had hit his business hard]</b> I have a restaurant and I had to close it. The gyms and non-essential offices have also closed. Life has changed. The schools will also be closed throughout April<br /><br /><b>[He is nevertheless trying to help out during the lockdown, keeping his restaurant’s kitchen open in order to deliver food to medical personnel]</b> He is nevertheless trying to help out during the lockdown, keeping his restaurant’s kitchen open in order to deliver food to medical personnel. We are happy we have done something for people who need it the most. This is a big thing, a big, unpredictable thing. The priority should be the health of the people, not only players. I really hope there will be a way to finish the league properly. Players need to be aware they might have to play longer… to July and August. We’re facing something completely unknown. It’s not easy to manage the situation. To go to football training, go back to your family and hope you’re OK. We are living something really new. In unusual situations, you have unusual consequences. As a fan, I hope it will restart. I miss it in every way</p>
