  <p><b>[Marcos Rojo has his doubts about <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> claiming he won’t be going to the World Cup with Sweden]</b> I asked <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Ibra</a> that now that they are in the World Cup if he would like to go, he says no but I don’t know … for me he has to go</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Rojo is ready to push for a January move away from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> if required]</b> I talked to <a href="lionel-scaloni.html">Scaloni</a>, he told me that he was happy because in pre-season I had played many games, that I looked good and that’s why he called me, but that I had to play. I’m sure that to play for the national team you have to play for your club, you have to always be there, and when you’re here, show why<br /><br /><b>[The 29-year-old, who is capable of operating at centre-half or at left-back]</b> It’s difficult to leave when you are at such a big club. I had the possibility of going to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, but due to the decisions of the club or the manager it wasn’t possible. Now I have to fight until December and, if it doesn’t work out, I will try to leave. The qualifiers and the Copa America are coming and I want to be part of that. I don’t want to be out again, I want to exhaust all the possibilities and compete to be here</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo wants to prove himself at Old Trafford in what he says is a big season for him]</b> I’m happy here. I want to play; I want to be a regular. My best position is a central defender, that’s where I want to play, but I’m happy to be used as a full-back too. I’m in very good condition this season. The pre-season was right and I’ve not been able to say that in other years because I’ve had injuries. I love it here. It’s tranquil. My daughters are fully adapted here. They speak perfect English, my family is happy here. I can speak some English too. I’ve been here in the first team for longer than any other club in my career. I’m happy, I just want to play more. It’s a big season for me – I want to play in the Copa America in my home country next year too<br /><br /><b>[He has given his backing to under-fire manager Solskjaer]</b> He’s a good person. He has the long-term ideas to improve the team and I have confidence in him. Training is fine, we work hard but we know it’s all about results and we know we have not been getting them</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Rojo has said that <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s draw with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was a turning point in their season]</b> After the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> game, I think the team grew in confidence. It gave us much more drive and when we went on to get a good result away from home, I think it strengthened our belief and allowed the players to express themselves that bit more, meaning we went back to attacking in the way we usually do<br /><br />Personally, my objectives would be to play as many games as possible, to continue to be on top of my game, and to show the manager that he can rely on me. And, from a team perspective, it would be to win the Europa League, to finish as high up the table as we can in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and to qualify for the Champions League and improve our situation so that next season is much better</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo has explained his decision to re-join Estudiantes on loan until the end of the season]</b> Many things came together. I need to play, return to my level, the family insisted, my old woman told me to come back. I had many offers to go to other clubs, but what’s better than being at home. I hope to be on the pitch as soon as possible. I want to go to practice and be with the boys as soon as possible. I’m very happy. It’s something I dreamed of, there was a chance and it could be done. I talked to Sebastian (Veron) quite a lot but one day my head clicked and I decided to return. It all came together. I suffered a lot of injuries lately, I went to the bench a lot. And I needed to compete and what better than to do it at home. Argentine football grew a lot and this is going to be a beautiful challenge. I talked with almost everyone and they helped me at this time. I don’t know what to say to the fans, it’s incredible</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Rojo has revealed the reason behind his dressing room altercation with <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> when the pair were at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> together]</b> <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> <b>[Ibrahimovic]</b> has a strong character, Ezequiel Lavezzi had warned me. I knew he wanted us to give him the ball all the time, but during a game phase I saw him ask for it and I didn’t give it to him. I passed it to <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>. Then he started yelling at me, raising his hand, and telling me a lot of things in Spanish and English<br /><br />I said to him: ‘What’s going on with you, big nose? Shut up’. I knew that if he caught me he would kill me so the only thing for me to do was face him. When he entered the locker room, I directly told him to close his mouth and stop yelling. We started to insult each other, and all our team-mates were watching us. And in the middle, <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> was trying to calm us down</p>
