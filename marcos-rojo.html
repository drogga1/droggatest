  <p><b>[Manchester United have confirmed Marcos Rojo has signed a contract extension]</b> Since I joined Manchester United, it has been everything I thought it would be and more. I am extremely happy to extend my stay at this great club. When I joined, my aim was to help the team win trophies and we have done that over the past couple of seasons. I am working hard to get back on the pitch. I would like to thank the fans for their support and the manager for the confidence and help he has given me both on and off the pitch.</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Rojo has revealed he was initially concerned about Alexis Sanchez joining Manchester United]</b> Alexis is a great player, but we didn’t used to get on out on the pitch. Every time we came up against one another, whether in internationals or when United played Arsenal, I would give him a good kicking - and he did the same to me. On top of that I used to insult him, and he would reply in kind. So when I learned that he was going to join United I said: ‘Oh, fucking hell, no, now this guy’s going to be here<br /><br />We were in Dubai at the time Alexis’ transfer went through. I was calmly sitting in a chair watching a film when Jose Mourinho came up and gave me a tap on the shoulder. He told me: ‘We’re going to sign Alexis. I don’t want you smashing him up in training tomorrow’. He burst out laughing<br /><br />At Christmas, my whole family came to spend the holidays, it is not customary to throw fireworks. They all go to bed early, but I wanted to surprise my family and I threw them after midnight. We played the next day and Ferguson always comes to see us when we play at Old Trafford. ‘It was a good light show you did last night’, he told me when we crossed in the hallway. I wanted to die, I thought he would kick me out the club but luckily took it well</p>

  <p><b>[Argentina books a place in the last 16 of World Cup 2018]</b> We needed it. Now the Cup begins for us. Lionel Messi had told the guys he was going to score a goal more than ever. The goal is for my family and for this group that deserves it. Let’s go Argentina.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo ready to repay <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>’s faith in Luke Shaw absence]</b> It’s been very good. Since he <b>[Ole]</b> arrived, he’s had an incredible relationship with me. When he got here, he told me I was part of his plans and that he wanted me to get myself fully fit. He helped me a lot because I was coming off a bad run of injuries and he told me to not worry and just concentrate calmly on making progress in my rehab and recovery. That was important to me and then as I’ve said, he allowed me to go back to Argentina to be with my family a while, as we didn’t have any fixtures. I think his most positive feature is the way he is close to the players and he understands them very well too because he had a long career as a player himself and he played a long time here at this club too. I think that you can see that in his ideas on how to play the game and getting back to what United was before. He’s very positive, always helping and always giving advice<br /><br />There aren’t many games left. But they do come quickly one after another. I think we have about a month and a bit left of just nothing but matches, which is going to be a lot of fun between now and the end of the season. We’ve got a lot of big stuff ahead of us and some important challenges that we are still competing for so, yeah, it’s great!</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Rojo has admitted that a second spell with Estudiantes is part of his future plan]</b> I would like to play at Estudiantes again.<br /><br />The first year was difficult with the adaptation because I came from Portugal and had sun all day, it was more like Argentina. It was difficult because of the rain, the language, the sun never came out, but now it’s been five years and I’m comfortable<br /><br /><b>[A lack of action has cost him a place in Argentina’s squad for this summer’s Copa America]</b> Now I’m thinking about being well and I do not go crazy thinking about call-ups. I try to do my best here <b>[in Manchester]</b> to be back as soon as possible in the national team. I hope I have the chance to return to the national team.</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Rojo is expecting to remain at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> this summer]</b> For now I would like to stay at United. I spoke to the manager before the end of the season and we spoke about his plans for me. He said that I was in his plans, that I’m an important player and that he wanted me to return to full fitness to be able to count on me in the first team. It’s now time to rest and spend time with my family before returning to England.<br /><br /><b>[Rojo’s current deal is due to run until 2021, with the option for a 12-month extension]</b> <b>[<a href="boca-juniors.html">Boca Juniors</a> manager]</b> <a href="nicolas-burdisso.html">Nico Burdisso</a> called me, who was a team-mate of mine from the national team. He called me when he took over at Boca. I wasn’t playing at that point. I thanked him but told him that my intention was to stay at United. Boca is a great team, but for now I want to keep playing in Europe. I’ve got three years left on my contract in England and then we’ll see. I’ve just turned 29 and I’ve got a lot left to give. I’ll come back <b>[to Argentina]</b> but I don’t know when. I’ve always said that I’m going to play for Estudiantes again and I hope that it turns out that way. To return home, be with my family and play for Estudiantes would be the cherry on the cake of my career<br /><br /><b>[Rojo is also planning to force his way back into the Argentina squad after being overlooked for their 2019 Copa America campaign]</b> Definitely. I’m young and I’ve got a lot to give. I know that if I give my all and play regularly in England I can come back and fight for a place. I’m calm. I’m looking forward to having a rest and returning in the best shape possible. I spoke to him <b>[Argentine manager <a href="lionel-scaloni.html">Lionel Scaloni</a>]</b> five months ago. He said he would have me in mind as and when I was playing regularly at my club. I wasn’t able to achieve that and that’s the reason behind his decision. I respect him because he’s a great guy as well as a good coach. I hope they do well in the Copa America</p>

I’m sure that to play for the national team you have to play for your club, you have to always be there, and when you’re here, show why<br /><br /><b>[The 29-year-old, who is capable of operating at centre-half or at left-back]</b> It’s difficult to leave when you are at such a big club. I had the possibility of going to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, but due to the decisions of the club or the manager it wasn’t possible. Now I have to fight until December and, if it doesn’t work out, I will try to leave. The qualifiers and the Copa America are coming and I want to be part of that. I don’t want to be out again, I want to exhaust all the possibilities and compete to be here</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> defender Marcos Rojo wants to prove himself at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> in what he says is a big season for him]</b> I’m happy here. I want to play; I want to be a regular. My best position is a central defender, that’s where I want to play, but I’m happy to be used as a full-back too. I’m in very good condition this season. The pre-season was right and I’ve not been able to say that in other years because I’ve had injuries. I love it here. It’s tranquil. My daughters are fully adapted here. They speak perfect English, my family is happy here. I can speak some English too. I’ve been here in the first team for longer than any other club in my career. I’m happy, I just want to play more. It’s a big season for me - I want to play in the Copa America in my home country next year too<br /><br /><b>[He has given his backing to under-fire manager <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>]</b> He’s a good person. He has the long-term ideas to improve the team and I have confidence in him. Training is fine, we work hard but we know it’s all about results and we know we have not been getting them</p>

It gave us much more drive and when we went on to get a good result away from home, I think it strengthened our belief and allowed the players to express themselves that bit more, meaning we went back to attacking in the way we usually do<br /><br />Personally, my objectives would be to play as many games as possible, to continue to be on top of my game, and to show the manager that he can rely on me. And, from a team perspective, it would be to win the Europa League, to finish as high up the table as we can in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and to qualify for the Champions League and improve our situation so that next season is much better</p>
