  <p>My father was, obviously, a great champion and he is my mentor. But if I had to choose a role model, I would pick an athlete from another sport: Stephen Curry<br /><br />I really like him because he’s managed to make it in the NBA even though nobody believed in him, because he was small, and through his hard work and dedication, he managed to become one of the strongest players in the world. His story is an example of how working hard one can achieve extraordinary results and this is a valuable lesson in both sport and life<br /><br /><b>[Ianis <a href="gheorghe-hagi.html">Hagi</a> says he did his homework on <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> before deciding to join the Viola]</b> I chose <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> because it’s a big club and because Florence is an extraordinary city. I have always admired this club because they’ve always worked well with youngsters, as you can see today with <b>[Federico]</b> Chiesa and <b>[Federico]</b> <a href="federico-bernardeschi.html">Bernardeschi</a>, or in the recent past with <b>[Stevan]</b> Jovetic, <b>[Stefan]</b> Savic and many others<br /><br />I am very happy here and I’m working hard in order to grow from a physical point of view. I am very lucky to be able to train on a daily basis with so many great champions here at <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a>. Every week I train with great effort and I will certainly have my chances<br /><br /><b>[Given he’s only made one <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> appearance to date, against <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> in October, Ianis is not getting ahead of himself]</b> At the moment, the No.10 jersey at <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> is <a href="federico-bernardeschi.html">Bernardeschi</a>. But knowing that this shirt was worn by these extraordinary footballers motivates me to give my best for this club, hoping to one day become <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a>’s next No.10</p>
