  <p><b>[Ianis Hagi on his surname]</b> Carrying the surname Hagi on your jersey certainly brings with it a certain pressure. But I was born with this pressure, so it’s not something that creates problems for me any longer<br /><br />My father was, obviously, a great champion and he is my mentor. But if I had to choose a role model, I would pick an athlete from another sport: Stephen Curry<br /><br />I really like him because he’s managed to make it in the NBA even though nobody believed in him, because he was small, and through his hard work and dedication, he managed to become one of the strongest players in the world. His story is an example of how working hard one can achieve extraordinary results and this is a valuable lesson in both sport and life<br /><br /><b>[Ianis Hagi says he did his homework on <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> before deciding to join the Viola]</b> I chose <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> because it’s a big club and because Florence is an extraordinary city. I have always admired this club because they’ve always worked well with youngsters, as you can see today with <b>[Federico]</b> Chiesa and <b>[Federico]</b> Bernardeschi, or in the recent past with <b>[Stevan]</b> Jovetic, <b>[Stefan]</b> Savic and many others<br /><br />I am very happy here and I’m working hard in order to grow from a physical point of view. I am very lucky to be able to train on a daily basis with so many great champions here at <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a>. Every week I train with great effort and I will certainly have my chances<br /><br /><b>[Given he’s only made one <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> appearance to date, against <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> in October, Ianis is not getting ahead of himself]</b> At the moment, the No.10 jersey at <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> is Bernardeschi. But knowing that this shirt was worn by these extraordinary footballers motivates me to give my best for this club, hoping to one day become <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a>’s next No.10</p>

  <p><b>[Rangers close to completing permanent deal for Hagi from Genk]</b> I just want to send some love and support from the Rangers family to the whole world, especially the doctors, nurses and health workers. The ones that have the courage to go every single day out to work and try to save lives. On the other hand, I am really excited to get back to training. I am looking forward to seeing the guys again and be training with them every single day, but we know we are in a difficult situation right now so the only thing is just to stay healthy, stay safe, stay home, try to follow the rules and everything will be alright</p>

  <p><b>[Rangers sign Ianis Hagi on permanent deal from Genk]</b> I am excited about re-joining the squad for pre-season and putting on the famous shirt once again. There was interest from other clubs, but my priority was always to return to Glasgow and play for Rangers. I really enjoyed my loan spell at Ibrox and look forward to playing in front of our fans very soon, but for now I hope all of the Rangers fans and your families are staying safe and well</p>
