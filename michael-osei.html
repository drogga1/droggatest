  <p>[Asante Kotoko assistant Michael Osei has rubbished reports that he is set to quit the club following the arrival of new head coach Zdravko Lugarusic] I pledged my support to him and the club because it matters at this time. I’m ready to work wholeheartedly with him for Kotoko to succeed. I’m the assistant coach and I accept it because one day, I may be the head over someone and would hope that person gives his all so that I succeed.</p>

  <p>[Michael Osei has been relieved of his duties as the assistant coach of Asante Kotoko] Kotoko top hierarchy revealed to me on Monday that they can’t work with me anymore because of an issue raised. The new coach told the management team to get rid of me because he can’t work with me after some observations. I have accepted the decision but unfortunately couldn’t take the letter of termination of contract along when I was leaving the office because I was in a haste to leave the premise.<br /><br />Kotoko is my club and I wish them all the best ahead of the new season. I will have to take time to reflect on other things before I will decide my next direction. It was true former Ghana coach Kwesi Appiah wanted to appoint me as his assistant at Al Khartoum in Sudan but I rejected it because of Kotoko and the opportunity has been handed to a new person. I don’t regret any of these since it is part of the learning curve</p>
