  <p><b>[Pepe Reina on Naples]</b> You can breathe football here, it’s almost like a religion. The God is obviously Maradaona and will be for many years. In any restaurant in Naples you can see souvenirs of him, from shirts to photos. I hope the same can happen with <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a>. He’s the idol of the moment. Playing in the San Paolo is extraordinary.I can’t imagine what it would be like in the city if we won the Scudetto</p>

  <p><b>[Pepe Reina feels Crazy to keep playing]</b> Here, in England, they have recommended prudence and to try to be at home as calm as possible. I don’t have to look after myself at home because we’re going to rest over the weekend and on Monday we have training. Only those who have positive cases in their teams, like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> or <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, have put their players in quarantine and isolation, but we keep training as usual from Monday. It was crazy to <b>[propose that the Premier League]</b> keep playing, we have to take this seriously. Other countries which are more affected have already taken more radical measures and we have to follow this path. England can’t cover their eyes and look the other way, the life and health of everyone is more important than sport. You have to have clear priorities in life and football is just a game and entertainment for people, the health of the people has to come first ahead of any other interest<br /><br />The leagues should only start once everything has calmed down. The most logical solution is to send the European Championship to next year, that should perhaps be the first measure</p>

  <p><b>[Aston Villa goalkeeper Pepe Reina reveals harrowing coronavirus fight]</b> I haven’t been out for 18 days. I didn’t want for company. It’s me, my wife Yolanda, five children and two in-laws. The house is large and loneliness doesn’t come into it. However, I was isolated after experiencing the first symptoms of the virus: fever, dry cough, a headache that never left me, that feeling of exhaustion<br /><br />I am winning the battle against coronavirus only now. The most difficult moment was when I could no longer breathe, the 25 minutes I ran out of oxygen. It was the worst moment of my life. The only real fear I had was when I understood that there was no oxygen: endless minutes of fear, as if suddenly my throat had closed<br /><br />Football takes a back seat. I don’t care much, really. Everyone’s well-being goes above anything else. I will be a supporter of playing when everything is in the best conditions, that everyone is safe. Football cannot be a priority right now. It is not important to finish this league. I know and am aware of all the interests that exist around soccer, especially economic ones. But there are also many other areas, and right now the first thing is people’s health</p>

It was the worst moments of my life. The only real fear I had was when I understood there was no oxygen: endless minutes of fear, as if suddenly my throat had closed. As a result I spent the first six or eight days indoors. Football takes a back seat. I don’t care much, really. Everyone’s well-being goes above anything else. I will be a supporter of playing when everything is in the best conditions, that everyone is safe. Football cannot be a priority right now. It is not important to finish this league.</p>

At <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> <b>[it was Daniel]</b> <a href="daniel-agger.html">Agger</a>, <b>[Jamie]</b> <a href="jamie-carragher.html">Carragher</a>.
