  <p><b>[Pepe Reina on Naples]</b> You can breathe football here, it’s almost like a religion. The God is obviously Maradaona and will be for many years. In any restaurant in Naples you can see souvenirs of him, from shirts to photos. I hope the same can happen with <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a>. He’s the idol of the moment. Playing in the San Paolo is extraordinary.I can’t imagine what it would be like in the city if we won the Scudetto</p>

  <p><b>[Pepe Reina was asked who football had been most unfair on this season]</b> Maybe with Man City for the squad it has but has not achieved the Champions League in the last three years with Guardiola. They have a bad taste in their mouths because they could not reach the final. But justice has been done with Liverpool’s football, with which there has also been unfairness if we see that they have not managed to win the Premier League despite getting 97 points and having lost a single game. That is also bad luck<br /><br /><b>[Liverpool have a chance to win a sixth European Cup against first-time finalists Spurs, thanks to their epic Anfield comeback]</b> It is that Liverpool were better also in the first leg, but <b>[Leo]</b> Messi appeared at Camp Nou and they did not concede goals thanks to goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Nobody expected it, but it is that incredible things happen in Anfield. What I’m going for is that the surprising result was that of the first leg. In the second leg Liverpool did everything that they had to do<br /><br /><b>[With two Premier League sides aiming for glory in Madrid, Reina feels the English competition is the best in the world]</b> Absolutely, it’s something I already said when I arrived at Liverpool 14 years ago. It is, in competitive and organisational terms. They are two teams that know each other very well, but, for me, Liverpool are the favourites. Tottenham have earned respect and are also a very chameleonic side. They have their favourite systems, they like to play with three at the back, but have more tactical versions than Liverpool. Even so, they (Liverpool) can do more damage if they press high. Tottenham will also depend on who plays up top - if it is Fernando Llorente they will be dangerous in those second plays<br /><br /><b>[Reina revealed he has spoken to Iker Casillas since the Porto goalkeeper’s recovery from a heart attack earlier this month]</b> Yes, I have noticed him happy and grateful for how quickly they saved his life. Now he has to make a decision and I hope it is the smartest, and the one I imagine. As a friend, I hope so. Iker can look back with great pride, and Spain must be eternally grateful to him because he has been the best goalkeeper in the history of Spanish football</p>

  <p><b>[Former Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina has offered his support to David de Gea]</b> In my time at Liverpool something similar happened to me, we all have ups and downs. David has been the best player at Manchester United over the last four years and that means they expect a lot from you. With the national team his level has also improved lately. De Gea is well prepared, he only needs the confidence.<br /><br />I am against rotations. In that position it is required to have the security of knowing that you are going to play and that you do not find out on Saturday in the pre-match talk. It is a security for us <b>[as goalkeepers]</b> and for those in front of you. We transmit more than meets the eye and that needs regularity<br /><br /><b>[Reina is currently back-up goalkeeper at <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> with one of his aims being to help develop No.1 and highly-rated Italy international Gianluigi Donnarumma]</b> I have two more years of my contract and I am happy. I am consistent and when I arrived I knew that they had Donnarumma, a young goalkeeper of great quality who is growing a lot. And humbly, I also feel responsible. It was also my task to help Gigi, not only as a goalkeeper but so that he became a man and had more and more structure off the field. Now he has exploded <b>[showcasing his ability in Serie A]</b>. In the meantime, I work to be ready when I’m needed. I still enjoy the day-to-day, and if the head is feeling well, the body follows</p>

  <p><b>[Pepe Reina has offered condolences to the family of his former Spain team-mate Jose Antonio Reyes, who died on Saturday]</b> It is a sad day. It is something that you cannot expect - 35 years old. Suddenly, you find yourself in this situation. My condolences for the family, for his friends…it’s just a difficult day. The experience of 2006 in Germany <b>[at the World Cup]</b> seems like it was yesterday, to be there with his wife and new-born son. Life is like this, and you have to enjoy it while you can.</p>

  <p><b>[Pepe Reina feels Crazy to keep playing]</b> Here, in England, they have recommended prudence and to try to be at home as calm as possible. I don’t have to look after myself at home because we’re going to rest over the weekend and on Monday we have training. Only those who have positive cases in their teams, like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> or <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, have put their players in quarantine and isolation, but we keep training as usual from Monday. It was crazy to <b>[propose that the Premier League]</b> keep playing, we have to take this seriously. Other countries which are more affected have already taken more radical measures and we have to follow this path. England can’t cover their eyes and look the other way, the life and health of everyone is more important than sport. You have to have clear priorities in life and football is just a game and entertainment for people, the health of the people has to come first ahead of any other interest<br /><br />The leagues should only start once everything has calmed down. The most logical solution is to send the European Championship to next year, that should perhaps be the first measure</p>

  <p><b>[Aston Villa goalkeeper Pepe Reina reveals harrowing coronavirus fight]</b> I haven’t been out for 18 days. I didn’t want for company. It’s me, my wife Yolanda, five children and two in-laws. The house is large and loneliness doesn’t come into it. However, I was isolated after experiencing the first symptoms of the virus: fever, dry cough, a headache that never left me, that feeling of exhaustion<br /><br />I am winning the battle against coronavirus only now. The most difficult moment was when I could no longer breathe, the 25 minutes I ran out of oxygen. It was the worst moment of my life. The only real fear I had was when I understood that there was no oxygen: endless minutes of fear, as if suddenly my throat had closed<br /><br />Football takes a back seat. I don’t care much, really. Everyone’s well-being goes above anything else. I will be a supporter of playing when everything is in the best conditions, that everyone is safe. Football cannot be a priority right now. It is not important to finish this league. I know and am aware of all the interests that exist around soccer, especially economic ones. But there are also many other areas, and right now the first thing is people’s health</p>

At <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> <b>[it was Daniel]</b> <a href="daniel-agger.html">Agger</a>, <b>[Jamie]</b> <a href="jamie-carragher.html">Carragher</a>.
