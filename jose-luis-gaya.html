  <p><b>[Jose Luis Gaya, the <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> defender, complained that Eder Sarabia was trying to put him off last season when Los Che faced <a href="real-betis.html">Real Betis</a> in the Copa del Rey semi-final]</b> He spent the whole game shouting at me, telling me to stop diving and trying to get me out of my place. It’s not the first time he’s done it. I asked <a href="quique-setien.html">Setien</a>, ‘how can you let your assistant do these things?’</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Gaya announces his diagnosis]</b> I have tested positive for the coronavirus. I am isolated in my house and totally asymptomatic. Therefore, I want to take advantage of this social network so that we do not collapse our healthcare. Now it’s the elderly people who need it the most, and it’s the serious cases that need to be taken care of by our health heroes</p>

  <p><b>[Valencia’s Jose Luis Gaya has expressed his desire to continue lining up alongside Ferran Torres despite widespread interest in the 20-year-old’s signature]</b> I have been where he is, I am not in his head but I hope he stays with us<br /><br /><b>[The Spain defender was previously a target for Real Madrid, whom he rejected]</b> Yes, there was interest, but I was too young and decided to stay put<br /><br /><b>[Gaya was one of the <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> players to test positive for Covid-19]</b> I am over it, I gave a negative test again two weeks ago so in theory I’m past it. I was asymptomatic, I was just fatigued but without a cough or fever. I don’t think it’s fair <b>[to end the season now]</b>, there are 11 games left and it would be fairest to finish the <b>[Liga season]</b>. Health comes first, but there is a lot at stake and it should be played out to the end</p>
