  <p><b>[Bangkok blasts wound Iranian attacker]</b> An Iranian man was seriously wounded in Bangkok today when a bomb he was carrying exploded and blew one of his legs off.<br /><br />Shortly before the man was wounded, there had been an explosion in a house the man was renting in the Ekamai area of central Bangkok. Soon after that, there was a third blast on a nearby road, Thai police and officials said<br /><br />Israel said the incident was an attempted terrorist attack by Iran<br /><br />Police later said they had apprehended another supsect at Bangkok’s main Suvarnabhumi airport, one of two men they were looking for who had been living at the house where the initial blast took place<br /><br />The three explosions in Bangkok came a day after bomb attacks targeted Israeli embassy staff in India and Georgia. Israel accused Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah of being behind those attacks. Iran denied involvement<br /><br />Hezbollah is a Shi’ite Islamist group backed by Syria and Iran that is on the official US blacklist of foreign terrorist organisations<br /><br />Thai officials declined to speculate on whether the two men they had detained were involved with any militant group, but Israeli Minister of Defense Ehud Barak blamed Iran<br /><br />Thai police said they were working to make safe an unspecified amount of explosives found in the house where the initial blast took place</p>

  <p>After the election … the majority of the thai people feels a sense of hopelessness and distrust for the election process. People are talking about the Election Commission’s part in supporting the extension of power by the National Council for Peace and Order<br /><br />The election comes after nearly 15 years of turmoil, during which conflicts between supporters of ousted former premier Thaksin and his establishment opponents manifested in street protests, violent clashes, and two military coups. On the eve of the vote, <a href="king-rama-x.html">King Maha Vajiralongkorn</a> made an unexpected statement, recalling a comment made by his late father on the need to put ‘good people’ in power and to prevent ‘bad people from … creating chaos’<br /><br />Six days later, <a href="king-rama-x.html">King Maha Vajiralongkorn</a> revoked royal decorations that had been awarded to <a href="thaksin-shinawatra.html">Thaksin Shinawatra</a>, citing his 2008 corruption conviction and for fleeing the country to escape prison. The military also stripped Thaksin of a pre-cadet school’s achievement award as well as deleting his name from the school’s hall of fame<br /><br />Thailand’s sedition law is broadly worded, and some rights activists say it has been increasingly used against political opponents of the government since a coup in 2014<br /><br />An ongoing insurgency has dragged on since 2004 in the southern border provinces of Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat, which were part of an independent Malay Muslim sultanate before Thailand annexed them in 1909</p>

  <p>The Senate votes secured <a href="prayuth-chan-ocha.html">Prayuth Chan-ocha</a> his premiership, but his new government will be an unstable coalition with only a four-seat majority in the lower house and a determined Democratic Front of seven parties seeking to end military dominance. That will likely make it difficult to pass legislation and leave the government vulnerable to no-confidence votes<br /><br />When the party seats were finally released last month, the Election Commission had changed the allocation formula and given 10 small parties one seat each, mostly taken from Future Forward Party. The 10 parties soon announced an alliance with Palang Pracharat. The new seat allocation denied the Democratic Front its projected House majority, which would at least have given them the power to block legislation or stage a no-confidence vote. And while some predict that Prayuth’s unwieldy 19-party coalition won’t survive a year, others are not so sure</p>
