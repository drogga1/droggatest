<blockquote>
  <p><b>[How <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> new boy has blossomed since ‘reserved’ start at Salzburg]</b> He was very, very reserved, like a little shy deer. He always gave the impression of ‘I don’t want to attract attention. Leave me alone!’<br /><br />You immediately saw that he is extremely fast in all areas. In the head and in the legs, too. Small feints! Stop at high speed and then accelerate again! That was pretty impressive. I quickly noticed that he can make the difference.<br /><br />He is an incredibly humble player for a manager. He is very disciplined and always wants to do everything exactly as it is explained to him. As a manager, you just have to be careful that you don’t say anything wrong.<br /><br />There is an image that has been burned into me. I remember clearly how he was in tears in the dressing room after the Champions League qualification game we lost against Malmo in 2015. That was all too much for him. He couldn’t cope properly with negative experiences back then.<br /><br />He learned in Salzburg what is also required in Liverpool: what do you do when you lose the ball? How do you go ball hunting? <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> has brought in a player with the right football education.<br /><br />Since our time together he has developed the most in terms of personality. He looks very confident now, appears very cheeky and never hides</p>
