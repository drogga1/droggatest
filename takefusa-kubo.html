  <p><b>[Kubo’s <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> move a bitter blow for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>! ‘Japanese Messi’ finally set to shine in Spain]</b> I wasn’t picked to play in games. Although I wasn’t playing in games I still had to go to the matches, just watching my team-mates playing. They were winning the games but I couldn’t be totally happy. At first, I really didn’t want to come back <b>[to Japan]</b>. I was so used to living there and also felt comfortable in the team, so I wondered ‘why?’.<br /><br />I made so many efforts to get used to living over there, and I was afraid that I had to do it all over again. However, despite my worries, I fitted into life in Japan very quickly when I was back, so that was good.</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid new boy Kubo proud of ‘Japanese Messi’ tag but aware he has much to prove]</b> It’s something to be very proud of and I feel honoured but I’m not at that level yet. I want to focus on improving the skills I have now. I only need to express the way I play, nothing more</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> youth player Kubo calls new club <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> ‘the best in the world’]</b> In Japan there is a lot of passion for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and I am very proud to play in the best club in the world. Above all, I am struck by the quality that everyone has. The team-mates and coaches are very friendly and I have been able to adapt very well. I have to take advantage of this opportunity that they have given me but I also have to have fun because not everyone gets this opportunity. I’m learning a lot as a footballer and as a person, both on and off the field. I’m having a great time</p>

  <p><b>[Takefusa Kubo is looking to make his mark at Real Madrid, but claims to know nothing of a transfer for Gareth Bale that could open a door for him. Quizzed after an outing against Bayern as to whether Bale has said goodbye to his team-mates]</b> No, because he is here with us. I don’t know what’s happening. I’m not the guy to have an opinion about this. I just know that Bale is a great player<br /><br /><b>[Kubo admits the focus on him is doing his cause few favours]</b> I know what’s happening in my country. People are a bit…There is a lot of focus placed on me, and I don’t really like that. I do my thinking on the pitch<br /><br /><b>[Kubo made his bow for the Blancos against Bayern, but was unable to prevent Zinedine Zidane’s said from slipping to a 3-1 defeat in the International Champions Cup]</b> I’m very happy about my debut with Real Madrid, even though we lost and even though I always hate to lose. My plan is to help the team as much as possible<br /><br />It was about pressing and playing quickly with one or two touches. I feel comfortable in whatever zone they place me</p>

The confirmation on Wednesday that Marco Asensio ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament against Arsenal comes as a huge blow for Real Madrid. Brahim Diaz, Takefusa Kubo and Rodrygo are all in an uncertain situation at the Santiago Bernabeu and the club are analysing the trio in detail to decide whether to keep them in the first team, drop them to the Castilla side or ship them out to another club</p>

<p>: 2019 08 01
Rodrygo or Kubo? Real Madrid face an impending dilemma over who will fill their non-European Union quota spots for next year following the impressive off-season form of Takefusa Kubo.</p>

The new Mallorca player is one of the great promises of world football and stands out for his great quality with the ball at his feet. <a href="takefusa-kubo.html">Kubo</a> speaks Spanish perfectly after passing through the system of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">FC Barcelona</a> and at 18 he is an international with Japan. <a href="takefusa-kubo.html">Kubo</a> will train with his new teammates tomorrow <b>[Friday]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[Kubo says I deserve the boos from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> fans]</b> That’s the decision of the fans. I made my call and they have the right to whistle me. I think I deserve it, although there were people who also applauded me, which gave me courage. Does it hurt? No, they have to see me as a rival, not as an 18-year-old boy who plays football pretty well</p>
