<blockquote>
  <p><a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a> was there at the dawn of a new kind of English football, back in 1996 when he sat in the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> dressing room aged 20, and tried to make sense, with the little English he had, of <a href="tony-adams.html">Tony Adams</a>’s alcoholism confession to his team-mates. Change was coming, not just for <a href="tony-adams.html">Adams</a>, but the great reinvention of the native game by <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsène Wenger</a> and his mass importation of prime overseas talent that redefined forever what was possible<br /><br />… <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a>, not least because he changed what we thought a central midfielder might look like, and certainly what one might play like. The orthodoxy that ran through British football from <a href="graeme-souness.html">Graeme Souness</a> to <a href="bryan-robson.html">Bryan Robson</a> to <a href="paul-ince.html">Paul Ince</a> was challenged by the emergence of a man with the stature of a nightclub doorman, the grace of a 400m runner and the kind of bloody-mindedness you need when <a href="neil-ruddock.html">Neil Ruddock</a> is on your case<br /><br /><a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a> was a big figure in English football and perhaps, for a few golden years in his career, the biggest<br /><br />Further evidence that management in the lower divisions is a specialism in itself has been <a href="teddy-sheringham.html">Teddy Sheringham</a>’s struggles this season at Stevenage, currently 20th in League Two. <a href="teddy-sheringham.html">Sheringham</a>’s team were beaten 5-1 at home on Saturday by Oxford United, managed by <a href="michael-appleton.html">Michael Appleton</a>, another <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> alumni, albeit less celebrated, whose knowledge and experience of the lower divisions has been hard-won<br /><br />By the same token there have been glittering playing careers that have foundered at bigger clubs. <a href="claude-makelele.html">Claude Makélélé</a> worked with <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> at <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> before striking out on his own at Bastia and lasted six months. <a href="clarence-seedorf.html">Clarence Seedorf</a> had just five months in charge of <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>. His successor <a href="filippo-inzaghi.html">Filippo Inzaghi</a> was sacked after one season<br /><br />There are serious doubts as to whether the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, a competition with a salary cap and no relegation, is a truly useful grounding for a manager with ambitions to launch his career in Europe. Alternatively, City could promote <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a> into <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Manuel Pellegrini</a>’s staff and closer to the kind of role <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> has at United, although as every No 2 knows, that is a long way short of managing yourself.<br /><br />Looking back, life was so much simpler in those days when <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Vieira</a> arrived in London as a 20-year-old prodigy who had struggled at <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>, only to discover that in the English game, for all its initial peculiarities, he was the right man, in the right place, at the right time. Twenty years on, and like so many of his celebrated peers who have retired wealthy from the game, it is not the reputation that is there to be gained that gives them reason to pause, it is the one that might be lost</p>
