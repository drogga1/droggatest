  <p><b>[FC Dallas has earned a reputation for developing young American players]</b> I always say that we have our own identity. What I like to see from different coaches is maybe capture some stuff that can be adapted to our model. But I think we should be proud about the work we do. I say to our coaches all the time, we’re doing - and I’m saying here in Dallas - but America is doing a great job coaching players and this country is doing a tremendous job developing the game. Eventually, I’m not saying them, but people need to come to America and see coaches work.<br /><br />Sampaoli has had a tremendous career and is doing awesome in Spain. We wanted to have that chance to go with the club and we also had the opportunity with Josema as well to go see Atletico Madrid, how they work there in terms of their goalkeeping department. We spent a good two weeks on this education, and for me it was fantastic to go see different things<br /><br />The way the league is being perceived now compared to how it was 20 years ago is different. It’s crazy that people want to come and they know much more about the league, more than we ever think</p>

  <p><b>[Cristian Colman settling in with FC Dallas after long-awaited arrival]</b> It’s first a credit to Major League Soccer to know that players are opting to be part of this league instead of going to some other recognized places. Secondly, it’s great for the club to see how a player with that caliber choose us among some other good options and some teams that have more than 100 years of history.</p>

  <p><b>[Oscar Pareja fixated on bringing elusive MLS Cup to FC Dallas]</b> This is the ultimate goal we have, of course, and I think it’s the first one that should be named at this point. We have the responsibility to win trophies, to fight for them. The importance of those trophies is always there. We’ve already proved to ourselves that we can do it. I think the objectives are always the same. That is always the highest, at the same time having the responsibility to fight for any competition we’re involved in.<br /><br />It’s going to be different. I think always our team is in building mode. It’s an ongoing process, always trying to get better. Last year, we won some trophies but at the same time we don’t forget that we didn’t win the last one. That means there are a lot of things to work on<br /><br />We’re trying to mold those players into our ideas, but at the same time when we look at our formation I think we have some different ways to do it. It’s going to be the team itself telling us what they feel more comfortable with. We’re still in a building situation right now with the new players, but as I said the most important is that the identity of the team is not going to change<br /><br />I think the identity is there. What I have to tell you is that we’re in building mode and getting that to be better and better because there are still many things to work toward and still many things to improve, so definitely there is an identity but also at the same time that identity has to be improved every day</p>

  <p><b>[On Kellyn Acosta]</b> Kellyn is maturing, for sure. I can see in his game a little bit more composure in the last third. When he had those two options, I thought he took one, two seconds more just to think about what he was going to do. I see a very mature guy that still needs to be polished, and he knows. But I think not just this league but this country has a phenomenal player right there.</p>

  <p><b>[La Galaxy 1-2 FC Dallas]</b> Being a box-to-box player at a high level has a lot of requirements and a lot of stuff that needs to be accomplished. Kellyn Acosta is understanding it more and then he’s putting all of his talent and his physical and mental conditioning into that role.</p>

I know Kellyn enough to know he will keep his feet on the ground knowing the journey is really long, and I hope for him he keeps helping the team and helping himself with these kinds of performances</p>

  <p><b>[FC Dallas dominates draft, LAFC didn’t rely on combine and more]</b> I wanted at least one of the two today, which is why we moved up and we got Francis. I was surprised that I was also able to get <b>[Twumasi]</b> at 11. They were both in my top three, and after we got Francis I thought it was mission accomplished, but when I saw Ema 11 it was great.<br /><br />These guys have been in the <b>[American soccer]</b> system, so it’s great for me knowing they already know the country and culture and have already adapted to it and are performing. That’s gold for me because sometimes we bring in players from overseas, from South America, and it’s a challenge</p>

They know the models with four at the back and now with the ideas we have he can adapt to that and there’s no problem there.</p>

I just want to make clear that I have not been interviewed or anything. That’s not something I would like to dig up because of respect for the federation and their process and also for respect for the club we have here. We have big responsibilities. First winning in Vancouver and now going to Portland and preparing this game that could confirm us in the playoffs. Our mind is here with our group and trying to accomplish that goal.</p>

FC Dallas has been our home for many years, but we felt it would be best for us to seek a different challenge which enables me to keep growing as a coach. This club and its players are heading on the right path and I have no doubt they will get there. I would like to thank the Hunt family, Clark and Dan, for their support throughout my time here. The memories I have made with this club will stay with me and my family for a lifetime.</p>

  <p><b>[When Oscar Pareja took over Club Tijuana in December, making the Liguilla was a goal]</b> It’s been very good. Of course, this is the first objective we’ve accomplished. At the beginning when you set the objectives, it probably was too optimistic to think in the first tournament we’d achieve the Liguilla. I think things came well for us. I think the players were committed to the idea and the results came through<br /><br />The Liguilla is another game. We have the same opportunity. Once the game has started, everything starts new. We have the same possibilities to fight those 90 minutes and try to get a result, without thinking too much about what has happened or what could happen. We just live the present and face them with the responsibility and the commitment these boys have, the competition. We respect the opponent, for sure, respect what they have achieved, but we have had success as well, so we’re going to start from zero<br /><br />In the first game at Leon’s place, it was incredible the level of rivalry there is between the two teams. That has been established from the Ascenso. I really was impressed by that rivalry. Now we face them in the first game of the Liguilla, which of course if very important for the fans and very important for the clubs. It’s great. It’s part of this dynamic that puts a lot of pressure on every single participant in the competition, which is great<br /><br />We’re just living in the present, and the present is Leon. (Wednesday) we are going to have - or should have - the character to be in the moment, in those first 90 minutes to try and get a result. The players are excited about the statistics, what they say about the number 8 winning trophies and all those things, but since the first day I came here, we told them we’ll work hard to put ourselves in the position where we can win it all. So, they know the idea is to go as far as possible</p>

  <p><b>[Liga MX, <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> announce Leagues Cup tournament featuring teams from both leagues]</b> Sometimes it has been difficult due to the dates. And now with this international tournament because in some way the (Liga MX) clubs will be entering their preseason and <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is in another calendar. But I think that all of these factors have been taken into consideration, it has greatly favored the way teams have expanded.</p>
