  <p><b>[FC Dallas has earned a reputation for developing young American players]</b> I always say that we have our own identity. What I like to see from different coaches is maybe capture some stuff that can be adapted to our model. But I think we should be proud about the work we do. I say to our coaches all the time, we’re doing - and I’m saying here in Dallas - but America is doing a great job coaching players and this country is doing a tremendous job developing the game. Eventually, I’m not saying them, but people need to come to America and see coaches work.<br /><br />Sampaoli has had a tremendous career and is doing awesome in Spain. We wanted to have that chance to go with the club and we also had the opportunity with Josema as well to go see Atletico Madrid, how they work there in terms of their goalkeeping department. We spent a good two weeks on this education, and for me it was fantastic to go see different things<br /><br />The way the league is being perceived now compared to how it was 20 years ago is different. It’s crazy that people want to come and they know much more about the league, more than we ever think</p>

  <p><b>[Oscar Pareja fixated on bringing elusive MLS Cup to FC Dallas]</b> This is the ultimate goal we have, of course, and I think it’s the first one that should be named at this point. We have the responsibility to win trophies, to fight for them. The importance of those trophies is always there. We’ve already proved to ourselves that we can do it. I think the objectives are always the same. That is always the highest, at the same time having the responsibility to fight for any competition we’re involved in.<br /><br />It’s going to be different. I think always our team is in building mode. It’s an ongoing process, always trying to get better. Last year, we won some trophies but at the same time we don’t forget that we didn’t win the last one. That means there are a lot of things to work on<br /><br />We’re trying to mold those players into our ideas, but at the same time when we look at our formation I think we have some different ways to do it. It’s going to be the team itself telling us what they feel more comfortable with. We’re still in a building situation right now with the new players, but as I said the most important is that the identity of the team is not going to change<br /><br />I think the identity is there. What I have to tell you is that we’re in building mode and getting that to be better and better because there are still many things to work toward and still many things to improve, so definitely there is an identity but also at the same time that identity has to be improved every day</p>

We wanted to play all the regular team, but obviously for us there’s a big game coming up on Wednesday. It’s great for the whole club, for the homegrowns, for the youngsters.

Most important for me or for us as coaches is to make them understand that as well about all the good things that we do, that we are and what the team is that beat Pachuca in Dallas, and just build on that foundation.

We didn’t get the substitution because it wasn’t authorized, so we have to think that in a certain way, it wasn’t fair play.<br /><br />The communication with the referee was done. We were just waiting for the authorization because the player was in the middle of the field waiting for the moment. We can not send the player in without being authorized. That was my frustration at the end of the game. But I have to respect that it is a game managed by the referees because they are the authority of the game and we have to accept that</p>

  <p><b>[Carlos Gruezo a star for FC Dallas, whether he likes it or not]</b> The task for Carlos was to have reference on Feilhaber, Kellyn <b>[Acosta]</b> on <b>[Roger]</b> Espinoza without losing their shape backing each other up during the whole half or game. That’s difficult because sometimes Benny stretched Carlos and Espinoza stretched Kellyn, so there was a hole in the middle that we didn’t want. Dealing with that moment for them was crucial, and I think they did it well. There were times when he took him man to man and was attached but there were times when he wasn’t attached and he just had him as a reference and marked the space, which was good for us. We got the ball back and we countered.<br /><br />Normally he puts a lot of miles into his game and if you track the amount of balls that he gets back to us, that’s amazing. The next step for Carlos is what can we do with the ball when the ball is at his feet. If he can improve that distribution, then collectively we’re going to be much better. That’s hard work for him because after the effort he puts in to getting the ball back, he needs the dynamic to glue people in the middle. It’s tough, and he did it today. That was part of the reason why FC Dallas had such a good game</p>

He’s realizing how good he can be for us if he can keep exploiting those spots in the box. He did it against Real Salt Lake, and in the first half today he did it again. Then in the last game in the cup he has two or three chances just like that. I’m happy to see him being present on the scoreboard. It just gives us a different look. I’m happy to see Roland adapting to the league. I’m happy to see him give us what we need</p>

I think the urgency should be there. Maybe just in the second half if we need to take some risks, that’s different.

It’s a cycle that needs to be reviewed because we all have to stretch out to the max and give our best but many of them need to change as well. Not because we don’t believe in the project. The project is going to move forward but this year has been difficult. We’ll see. What is coming next is we’ll reevaluate what is coming next for the group.<br /><br />I think it’s necessary. The season demanded it. I think not getting to the playoffs makes us think we lack things.

  <p><b>[When Oscar Pareja took over Club Tijuana in December, making the Liguilla was a goal]</b> It’s been very good. Of course, this is the first objective we’ve accomplished. At the beginning when you set the objectives, it probably was too optimistic to think in the first tournament we’d achieve the Liguilla. I think things came well for us. I think the players were committed to the idea and the results came through<br /><br />The Liguilla is another game. We have the same opportunity. Once the game has started, everything starts new. We have the same possibilities to fight those 90 minutes and try to get a result, without thinking too much about what has happened or what could happen. We just live the present and face them with the responsibility and the commitment these boys have, the competition. We respect the opponent, for sure, respect what they have achieved, but we have had success as well, so we’re going to start from zero<br /><br />In the first game at Leon’s place, it was incredible the level of rivalry there is between the two teams. That has been established from the Ascenso. I really was impressed by that rivalry. Now we face them in the first game of the Liguilla, which of course if very important for the fans and very important for the clubs. It’s great. It’s part of this dynamic that puts a lot of pressure on every single participant in the competition, which is great<br /><br />We’re just living in the present, and the present is Leon. (Wednesday) we are going to have - or should have - the character to be in the moment, in those first 90 minutes to try and get a result. The players are excited about the statistics, what they say about the number 8 winning trophies and all those things, but since the first day I came here, we told them we’ll work hard to put ourselves in the position where we can win it all. So, they know the idea is to go as far as possible</p>
