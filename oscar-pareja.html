  <p><b>[Oscar Pareja was full of praise for midfielder Kellyn Acosta following his superb free-kick strike that earned the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> club a 2-1 victory in the first leg of their <a href="concacaf.html">CONCACAF</a> Champions League semi-final tie with Mexican outfit Pachuca]</b> I think he’s a phenomenal player, and America has a fantastic midfielder there. I know Kellyn enough to know he will keep his feet on the ground knowing the journey is really long, and I hope for him he keeps helping the team and helping himself with these kinds of performances</p>

  <p><b>[FC Dallas coach Oscar Pareja denied having been interviewed by U.S. Soccer]</b> Yes, I’ve heard a lot of news about the topic. I just want to make clear that I have not been interviewed or anything. That’s not something I would like to dig up because of respect for the federation and their process and also for respect for the club we have here. We have big responsibilities. First winning in Vancouver and now going to Portland and preparing this game that could confirm us in the playoffs. Our mind is here with our group and trying to accomplish that goal.</p>

  <p><b>[Oscar Pareja has departed FC Dallas]</b> This was a difficult decision for me and my family. FC Dallas has been our home for many years, but we felt it would be best for us to seek a different challenge which enables me to keep growing as a coach. This club and its players are heading on the right path and I have no doubt they will get there. I would like to thank the Hunt family, Clark and Dan, for their support throughout my time here. The memories I have made with this club will stay with me and my family for a lifetime.</p>

  <p><b>[Liga MX playoffs set with Clasico Joven taking place in quarterfinals]</b> I’m really happy to be able to give Tijuana, the club, the fans, this first Liguilla. We’re really proud, the players are happy. We played a really tough game with the whole context of the game, but I think we did a good job, especially in the second half</p>

  <p><b>[When Oscar Pareja took over Club Tijuana in December, making the Liguilla was a goal]</b> It’s been very good. Of course, this is the first objective we’ve accomplished. At the beginning when you set the objectives, it probably was too optimistic to think in the first tournament we’d achieve the Liguilla. I think things came well for us. I think the players were committed to the idea and the results came through<br /><br />The Liguilla is another game. We have the same opportunity. Once the game has started, everything starts new. We have the same possibilities to fight those 90 minutes and try to get a result, without thinking too much about what has happened or what could happen. We just live the present and face them with the responsibility and the commitment these boys have, the competition. We respect the opponent, for sure, respect what they have achieved, but we have had success as well, so we’re going to start from zero<br /><br />In the first game at Leon’s place, it was incredible the level of rivalry there is between the two teams. That has been established from the Ascenso. I really was impressed by that rivalry. Now we face them in the first game of the Liguilla, which of course if very important for the fans and very important for the clubs. It’s great. It’s part of this dynamic that puts a lot of pressure on every single participant in the competition, which is great<br /><br />We’re just living in the present, and the present is Leon. (Wednesday) we are going to have - or should have - the character to be in the moment, in those first 90 minutes to try and get a result. The players are excited about the statistics, what they say about the number 8 winning trophies and all those things, but since the first day I came here, we told them we’ll work hard to put ourselves in the position where we can win it all. So, they know the idea is to go as far as possible</p>

  <p><b>[Liga MX, <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> announce Leagues Cup tournament featuring teams from both leagues]</b> Sometimes it has been difficult due to the dates. And now with this international tournament because in some way the (Liga MX) clubs will be entering their preseason and <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is in another calendar. But I think that all of these factors have been taken into consideration, it has greatly favored the way teams have expanded.</p>
