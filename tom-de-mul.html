  <p><b>[Tom De Mul says The door is still open for <a href="jan-vertonghen.html">Jan Vertonghen</a> to follow the lead of <a href="toby-alderweireld.html">Toby Alderweireld</a> and commit to a new contract at Tottenham]</b> We currently have no agreement <b>[with Tottenham]</b>, but I do not rule anything out. We consider everything. There is a lot of interest for Jan, certainly as a free agent, but <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> also remains an interesting option for us. The door is still open. He still wants to get good results with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> after a difficult start. He wants to qualify for the Europa League or Champions League, or in this case to win <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup. He is 32, but he is still so ambitious. He is focused. The Euros, for example, are super important to him. That’s the beauty of him. He wants to play at the highest level in a top competition for as long as possible. He is still very hungry<br /><br /><b>[He was clearly frustrated at being substituted in the 54th minute of an FA Cup fourth-round replay with Southampton, but De Mul says that incident has been blown out of proportion]</b> It is made a bit too big in my eyes. Jan was just disappointed at the time of his replacement, about his performance, about that of the team. It is difficult for Jan to hide that, but that’s just the way he is. He is still very happy with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and feels great in London</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="jan-vertonghen.html">Jan Vertonghen</a> offers <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> contract hint as he prepares to weigh up ‘pros and cons’]</b> Jan is still super happy at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> and loves London. He is still very committed. There’s a lot of respect for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, just like there is a lot of respect from the club towards us. That’s logical after eight seasons. There is a connection. We haven’t reached an agreement as yet, but we don’t rule out anything. There’s interest in him as a free agent, but <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> is a very interesting option for us. The door’s still open</p>
