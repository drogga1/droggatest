  <p><b>[<a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> had opened the scoring early in the game when Abdoulaye Doucoure crisply slotted the ball home from Daryl Janmaat’s low cross]</b> If you don’t score the second one you are always under pressure to not concede. We had a lot of chances against a top-six team. You know you can always concede one goal so we need to move on from this. We need to be more clinical in the last part of the pitch, especially when you go away to a top team but we are happy with a point</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> &amp; PSG-linked Abdoulaye Doucoure says move would be easy if <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> received suitable bid]</b> If a big club manages to make an interesting offer for me, of course the club will let me leave, easily. A club that plays in the Champions League is the goal, but I don’t have a particular one in mind. We’re little by little arriving at the end of the cycle. Maybe the club <b>[<a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>]</b> has certain expectations for me, I don’t really know them yet, but I can still progress and still do good things, so if I were to change clubs, it would be to go up a level<br /><br />I’m happy in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I want to stay in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, that’s my main wish. Then we’ll see what’s on offer, or not, for me this summer<br /><br />To play for France is still a dream, it is something that I will fight for as long as possible. I think I am of an age where I still have time. My decision is not final. Of course I am targeting France but Mali has never approached me. We will see in the years to come</p>
