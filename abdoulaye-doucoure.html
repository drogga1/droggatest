  <p><b>[Watford midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure admits that he is pleased to be linked with the likes of Arsenal and Tottenham]</b> I’m coming to an important step. It’s a pleasure to see these big clubs interested in me. We’ll see what the state of play is in the summer and then we can ask questions.<br /><br />Why not? If I’m playing well…Morgan Schneiderlin was playing well with Southampton and was part of the squad in 2014. I’m playing in the best league in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Watford midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure has admitted that he one day wants to play Champions League football]</b> It’s true that I’ve heard that clubs like that are interested in me in England, but there’s been nothing concrete. It’s true that I’d like to play in a team like that. Everyone wants to play in the Champions League, so that may mean going to a big club. It was my dream to play in England, to play in the Premier League. This year I’ve played every match, I’ve established myself in the league, and we’ll see if any offers arrive on the chairman’s desk, which we’ll speak about. Then we’ll see what’s best for me and for the club.<br /><br />Of course, I played for all the youth teams. It’s my objective to play for the national team. I’ve got the potential and I’ve got the quality</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United star Paul Pogba has been branded a show-off]</b> He was the same <b>[growing up]</b>. He likes to show off a little bit, but he’s a very nice guy, very natural. Today there’s a different dimension, because he is a superstar, but he was always the same. He likes to laugh, to speak about everything. Both <b>[on and off the pitch]</b>, he has this personality … he gets this because he is good on the pitch as well. It’s good for him.<br /><br /><b>[On Benjamin Mendy]</b> Benjamin Mendy as well brings a lot of personality, show-off sometimes. It’s good in the football. Since Under-16, I played with him <b>[Pogba]</b>. And he was, physically, the same like today. He was in advance of everyone. He had his technique. He grew up in Italy, I think he did very good things in England. Of course, he is a very important player for Manchester United. We have to be aware of him, he will be very dangerous for us. We speak together sometimes… I sent him a message in the World Cup, congratulated him on the title<br /><br />Yeah, I think, if Watford was good like we are at the moment, it’s good for me, it’s good for maybe a call-up to the national team. Of course, it’s one of my dreams to have a call-up there. I have to be very good on the pitch. Watford have to be at the top as well, to have more visibility for me. Of course, I can have a call-up this year</p>

  <p><b>[Watford’s Abdoulaye Doucoure has made no secret of his desire to depart Vicarage Road in search of top-level football]</b> I do not dream of a particular club. Of course PSG is one of the biggest clubs in Europe, but I don’t have in mind to want to go to PSG at any particular price. I would like to stay in the Premier League, I think it’s the best place to express my qualities as a player. From there it depends on the offers and many other things, I am very open.<br /><br />If something happens then so be it, otherwise I’ll be happy with Watford’s jersey. I gave everything for three seasons, and if I stay one more season, I’ll be happy, and if I leave I’ll be happy too. Everyone knows what I want, but it may not necessarily happen as I wish<br /><br /><b>[The midfielder feels that pushing for a move to a big club could see him handed a chance in the national team]</b> It’s getting closer, but it’s still very far away. It is difficult to play for the national team without playing for a big club that is watched all over the world. I know I can reach that level, but since I’m here <b>[at Watford]</b>, it’s going to be very complicated</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> had opened the scoring early in the game when Abdoulaye Doucoure crisply slotted the ball home from Daryl Janmaat’s low cross]</b> If you don’t score the second one you are always under pressure to not concede. We had a lot of chances against a top-six team. You know you can always concede one goal so we need to move on from this. We need to be more clinical in the last part of the pitch, especially when you go away to a top team but we are happy with a point</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> &amp; PSG-linked Abdoulaye Doucoure says move would be easy if <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> received suitable bid]</b> If a big club manages to make an interesting offer for me, of course the club will let me leave, easily. A club that plays in the Champions League is the goal, but I don’t have a particular one in mind. We’re little by little arriving at the end of the cycle. Maybe the club <b>[<a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>]</b> has certain expectations for me, I don’t really know them yet, but I can still progress and still do good things, so if I were to change clubs, it would be to go up a level<br /><br />I’m happy in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I want to stay in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, that’s my main wish. Then we’ll see what’s on offer, or not, for me this summer<br /><br />To play for France is still a dream, it is something that I will fight for as long as possible. I think I am of an age where I still have time. My decision is not final. Of course I am targeting France but Mali has never approached me. We will see in the years to come</p>
