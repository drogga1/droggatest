  <p><b>[Silva praises <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>’s late show as Cleverley goal downs <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> The first half we were shy in some moments. I think we played for 10 or 15 minutes like I wanted us to. We started well but then we gave away the ball too easily - we started to play without confidence.<br /><br />I didn’t like the last 10 minutes of the first half. We spoke well in half-time, I showed our players the plan, what they needed to do. We needed to play without being scared. Even against big teams like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, who have a lot of quality, you need a lot of quality as well. I think our second half was then really good.</p>

The catalyst for this decision is that unwarranted approach, something which the board believes has seen a significant deterioration in both focus and results to the point where the long-term future of Watford FC has been jeopardised.

This is what will make us better as a club, always that competition within the squad. The player himself is fast, strong, very good technically and he can play in three positions across the front line. He can also score goals. Evertonians will see a player who will be 100 per cent committed to helping our team always.</p>

He is a high-quality player, aggressive, with good technical ability and in the past five seasons he has played two years at Paris St-Germain, one in Roma and for the past two seasons he has demonstrated his clear quality in Barcelona..<br /><br />Lucas is a player who will add competitiveness in a position where we only had Leighton Baines last season and he is accustomed to winning. This is his mentality having captured titles in his career and having these on his résumé</p>

We needed to bring in new centre-backs after Mori and Williams left.<br /><br />We will see what happens in the future. When something happens we will let you know. At the moment they are our players. Tomorrow we stop talking about the players. With Besic something happened between the club and the agent, I don’t know what happened.

  <p><b>[Marco Silva was left fuming after Everton’s 2-0 defeat to Arsenal]</b> It was offside. At this level, with these mistakes from the referee, it put our team in that condition as well. The second goal is clearly offside. It is really frustrating, and I tell you why. In that moment we had just one player in our box, it is too clear for the assistant. It was two or three against one, just Jonjoe Kenny inside the box. It is clear where he is, and where the player who scored is. It is clearly offside. For me it is a little bit strange, but OK, mistakes are made, I make them as well, and the assistant and ref they can make them as well.<br /><br />The result didn’t reflect what both teams played during the match. I think we deserved more. We came here to play and challenge the opponents. In the first half we created clear chances. Petr Cech was the best player on the pitch, clearly. We didn’t deserve this result, our team worked hard to achieve a different result. It is a disappointing result for us. But it is football. We created three, four, five clear chances to score. In one detail, a great moment from Lacazette, it changed a little bit the game</p>

It’s important for us, now we have solutions on the bench to solve some problems during the match. We were too slow in the first half, but we pushed them back in the second half.

I told him and our board on the first day that I believe in his skills and his profile. I did my technical analysis on him and he is a good talent. He is our present and our future. Now he has to fight for his position. I am here to do everything I can to make him happy again, to put him in the conditions to fight, and after that it is for him to keep his position and to fight to take it.

  <p><b>[Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri has a potential conundrum on his hands after influential midfielder Jorginho was rendered impotent for the first time this season by Everton’s Marco Silva]</b> To be honest with you, if you come here just to stop Hazard, it would be the first mistake you make. We came here not just to stop Hazard, we came to stop Chelsea as a team. I understand the question as you are talking about, in my opinion, the best Premier League player so far. But we showed this shape, we blocked one player and that’s Jorginho. We blocked well Jorginho and, in my opinion, he is one of the key players in Chelsea this season. Of course, Hazard can create problems in each moment of the match. In some moments, we blocked him and in other moments he created problems for us. It is normal for a fantastic player like him. It was one of the keys to block Jorginho. It was fantastic work from Sigurdsson and Richarlison in the first moments and then with Gomes and Gueye. My opinion he is one of the keys in Maurizio’s system and model this season. He controls all the match with and without the ball for Chelsea.</p>

  <p><b>[Everton manager Marco Silva believes Barcelona’s loss has been his club’s gain as he hopes to make Andre Gomes move to Goodison Park permanent]</b> I think in the right moment we have to do something to achieve one player like Andre.<br /><br />We have time to do that. We are happy with him, he is enjoying the moment here and I don’t think it is a good moment to talk every week because it’s better they <b>[Barcelona]</b> forget a little bit about Andre! You go there in the right moment. Andre is enjoying his time but we don’t want to put this pressure of a decision on him. It is early. When you make a loan, and not just Andre but <b>[Kurt]</b> Zouma as well, if you can do something tomorrow then you have to do it but football is not like that. At the end of the season we will talk to the players and with the clubs and after then we will take the decision or not. Though he has done well as of late, it was a bit of a slow start for Gomes at Everton. Silva noted that Gomes had to overcome difficulties due to injury, but credited everyone at the club, from players to staff, to making the midfielder’s transition as seemless as possible. Last season wasn’t the best for him but we had very good conversations with him before he signed. When he came in he was injured and these were tough moments for him but he is now playing and performing really well and I am sure he will perform better because he has this quality. On Saturday afternoon he performed really well and his team-mates helped him as well because his first moments in the club were not easy. His team-mates and the technical staff help him settle fast and feel an important person in our dressing room, even when he was not playing, even when he was not training. Now he is playing well, working hard and everything you would expect of someone with his quality</p>

Barcelona are included, let’s see when we can talk about the situation.<br /><br /><b>[When asked how Gomes had settled at Goodison Park]</b> I think at first, I agree, he is doing very well. But what is most important for me is the team and the squad, I think it is not fair just to talk about Andre. If Andre is doing well then he is helping our squad. He is getting better every time, taking his responsibility in the squad is important for me as well. But if he is doing well it is because his teammates are helping him since the first day.

When you have good players in your squad that means other clubs are looking to them as well.

I know what we spent and when a player comes from a big, big club you expect, always, that they he will come here and play, but let’s see how many situations happen in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> with a player of 19 coming from abroad and comes here and plays. Let me know. You are talking about a young boy but a clever boy as well. He understands the time, he understands that he is here to work really hard to get his chance and play football, which is what he loves. <b>[There is]</b> zero pressure. Zero for me. Forget money, forget clubs they come from, forget everything. This is football, they have to come in and this is what <a href="moise-kean.html">Moise Kean</a> is doing. Work hard, show your quality in training sessions and games but pressure <b>[to play him]</b>? Forget it. No chance<br /><br />If you look at <a href="moise-kean.html">Moise Kean</a> in the national team, he plays always as a right-winger, always as a right-winger, many, many times as a right-winger. You are talking about a player who played, maybe, seven games in the starting XI last season at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, he played some games as a striker, some games as a winger, when he came in to some games <b>[from the bench]</b> he played many moments as a winger as well. He can play both positions, it is up to him to keep working and keep adapting to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> system and the English football system as well because it is so fast and so quick, we are up and down every time and he has to adapt. Now he is working more as a right-winger and when he goes to the national team he is playing as a right-winger but he can play as a striker as well. I can tell you that in the training session today <b>[Friday morning]</b> he worked in both positions</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> manager Marco Silva believes VAR has cost his side at least five points in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> this season]</b> When we talk about serious moments, very important moments in football, it’s not right to sit here and everyone wants to laugh about it. It is not to laugh about. It is too serious. Managers get sacked for losing football games. They just have to clarify it. I am not saying anyone is doing it on purpose<br /><br />I’m not talking about myself here, he (Klopp) was talking in general terms and he was completely right. It is also my opinion and the opinion of all the managers in the world, not just here in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. It was so clear in the last three or four games and we are talking about it costing us five or six points.<br /><br />Where would we be with those points? I don’t have any doubts that we would be performing on a different level if we had those points. Every team in the world plays with more confidence when it is higher up the table.
