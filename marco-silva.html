  <p><b>[Silva praises <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>’s late show as Cleverley goal downs <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> The first half we were shy in some moments. I think we played for 10 or 15 minutes like I wanted us to. We started well but then we gave away the ball too easily - we started to play without confidence.<br /><br />I didn’t like the last 10 minutes of the first half. We spoke well in half-time, I showed our players the plan, what they needed to do. We needed to play without being scared. Even against big teams like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, who have a lot of quality, you need a lot of quality as well. I think our second half was then really good.</p>

Three points away from home and a clean sheet was important to boost our confidence. It was difficult with 10 men, having played a game on Saturday. They had 10 days to prepare. It was well deserved for our players. One free-kick, one header, but they didn’t create anything more. Jordan did well in those two moments</p>

It’s normal <b>[meeting Moshiri face to face]</b>. When we have the possibility to meet, we do; when not, we speak on the phone.<br /><br />When you are winning games in a row, normally what the people say about you is good.

We have to see them growing in a stable, mature squad. I believe in our squad, I believe in what we are doing and I believe in our young players also<br /><br />We took one decision at the start of the season and in the January market also. We didn’t go in the market because we took a decision and now is not the moment to go in a different way<br /><br />Everyone thinks about <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> spending a lot of money but if you look at last season you can see how different it is to this season. The club spent more than double last season <b>[compared to this season]</b> and in the January market signed two new players. This season we did it differently<br /><br />We took a decision as a football club and the manager is always involved. We took it together and we are together in this project. Football will always be about the results because if you are winning and taking good results you are not asking me about the young players</p>

It was a good decision to bring Andre to the Club and we made it one of our priorities to get him back.<br /><br />I am delighted we have been able to do that as he is a quality player and we were so happy with what he gave us. He is someone who has shown he can operate to a high level in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and for our Club, and I know our fans will be fantastic in welcoming him back.

For that reason, <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> manager Marco Silva is delighted with his new acquisition]</b> When I look to bring a new player into our squad, the first thing I look for above all the other things is quality and Fabian is a player with high quality.

They are two completely different players. Gana plays in one role, Fabian can do the role of Gana but he doesn’t come to our squad to replace Gana. Gana is still our player and, of course, if we lose Gana then we have to sign a player to replace him because you are talking about one player playing almost all of the games in our squad. If it will happen then we have to replace him, it is not because we have signed Fabian Delph<br /><br /><b>[Silva is eager to convince Gueye that he can form part of an ambitious project on Merseyside, with there no need for him to chase a move to the <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> champions]</b> I have to talk with him and show him how he is an important player for us. To be honest, even if it was a fantastic opportunity for him, the behaviour of Gana after that period was very, very good and he lost a ‘dream’. He always gives 100% and his best. He said to me in that period that he had that dream but for us as a club it was really tough to take to lose a player like him. I think we took the right decision and after that Gana proved that with his best season at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, in my opinion. Let’s see what the market will say again about Idrissa and we are here to take the best decisions for us as a football club</p>

He can play both positions, it is up to him to keep working and keep adapting to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> system and the English football system as well because it is so fast and so quick, we are up and down every time and he has to adapt. Now he is working more as a right-winger and when he goes to the national team he is playing as a right-winger but he can play as a striker as well. I can tell you that in the training session today <b>[Friday morning]</b> he worked in both positions</p>
