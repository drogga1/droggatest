  <p><b>[Atletico Madrid should be rewarded for their victory over Champions League title-holders <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> by being handed the trophy if it is not possible to conclude the tournament this season]</b> In the hypothetical case that the Champions League was not played for the coronavirus, then the champion <b>[should be]</b> the one who beat the champion. There are still a few knockout games left, the quarter-finals, the semis and the final. We understand that <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> tries to centralise all these matches in one city, there was talk of Spain, Portugal… nothing is known yet. There are 11 games left, plus the final phase of the Champions League, which can be four games. I imagine that the government is waiting to see how the pandemic evolves and will take the decision it considers</p>

  <p><b>[Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo said it was up to Antoine Griezmann if he wanted the chance to bid farewell to the La Liga club]</b> Griezmann, I do not know if he wants to say goodbye or not, the truth is that I do not know. The farewell depends on Griezmann, who is the one who leaves. If he wants to say goodbye, he will say goodbye.<br /><br /><b>[Cerezo feels there is no chance the France international stays at the Wanda Metropolitano after his announcement earlier this month]</b> It is irreversible. The only thing I tell him is that he has a lot of luck where he goes. And, that at least they treat him as we have treated him here</p>

We have a good relationship. Nice, trustworthy. I hope wherever he goes he will be treated the same as he has been with us. I don’t know where he’s going, he didn’t say. I don’t have the slightest idea where he will go. I don’t think anyone knows.<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether Barca have initiated discussions]</b> No one from Barca has contacted me</p>

I hope that Simeone can be the Ferguson of Atletico Madrid.<br /><br /><b>[Speculation has also suggested that Diego Costa could be moved on]</b> He has not had a great season but I hope he will continue with us</p>

I understand everyone defends their interests and I’ve spoken to Enrique Cerezo <b>[Atletico president]</b>, but I don’t see that the case can evolve in a positive way for them. There’s nothing.

  <p><b>[Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo denied James Rodriguez is poised to join the La Liga side]</b> Atletico are interested in great players and James is a great player, but from that to he’s going to come, there’s some distance. Negotiations? Not that I know of, no.<br /><br /><b>[Diego Simeone’s transfer business is far from over, however, with Tottenham right-back Kieran Trippier and Espanyol defender Mario Hermoso reportedly close to moving to the Spanish capital]</b> We’ve had a few signings and are in negotiations for a few more. Negotiations can end well or badly, but there are negotiations. Everything’s going well, the team is training well, blending in well and very happy at Los Angeles de San Rafael. Now we’re waiting for next season with a month left to go.</p>

  <p><b>[James Rodriguez is fair game for Atletico Madrid, says club president Enrique Cerezo, with there no pact with neighbours Real Madrid that would be broken if an approach is made]</b> There has always been a harmonious relationship with Real Madrid and with all the teams in Spain. When we are interested in a player, whoever it may be, we talk, check and in the end we have managed to get them to come to our team, but it doesn’t mean that any pact or good harmony with Real Madrid or with Sevilla or Cordoba has been broken. It’s life; if we are interested in a player because we consider him to be good, we go and ask about him. If he plays for one team or another it is something that we don’t care about. If it is decided that the player comes to play with us, then even better<br /><br /><b>[Pressed further on reported interest in James and the likelihood of a deal being done]</b> Right now, I don’t know. James Rodriguez is a good player and Atletico are always interested in good players, but I can’t tell you if he’s coming because I don’t know<br /><br /><b>[Atletico were able to fend off rival interest from Premier League champions Manchester City to land Felix, with Cerezo considering that to be a positive sign for the Liga giants]</b> It shows that the work done in recent years has been very good. When players want to come here, when they can play wherever they want, I think it is important for the club and for the fans</p>
