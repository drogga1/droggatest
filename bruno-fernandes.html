It was a similar story at Sampdoria, where he racked up five goals and two assists in his one season stay before joining Sporting. So what has made the difference?]</b> I have grown so much. At Sporting I have found the trust and I am at home. I had the chance to come and I immediately picked it up. There are those who say that defeats teach a lot, but also learning to win is not bad</p>

Everything was right with me - or practically should be. I never made any big demands, my manager was always dealing with the finances. It was, and is my goal to play in England, Sporting know that, everyone knows that, and there were conditions for things to be done. But Sporting understood that the value was not enough and I have to respect the decision<br /><br /><b>[Although only having a £31m release clause in his contract, Fernandes has emphasised his commitment to his current club]</b> Any player has to be motivated to stay in a club like Sporting, a great club that strives for great goals. Having the dream of playing in England did not prevent continuity at Sporting. Sporting made the decision not to sell me also because they believed in my worth and for believing that the values ​​that were offered by me were not enough. I have to be flattered that Sporting does not accept values ​​that for them are low and for me it has to be proud of the club to think I’m worth more</p>

  <p><b>[Sporting playmaker Bruno Fernandes has claimed that he was eager to seal a move to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> during the summer transfer window]</b> In the summer I thought I could go out. I believed it was a good time to leave due to many factors. I made the best time of my career to date. After the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Nations League, there were already many contacts, especially with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. It was the team that wanted me the most and was the only one I agreed to talk with, because there were other clubs that didn’t interest me or whose project was not up to my expectations.<br /><br /><a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> fit into everything I wish I had at that moment. It is an appealing championship. Knowing that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> would be willing to pay for me and make every possible effort to take me, leaves a player eager to take that step. Regardless, I always kept my word that it was up to Sporting to decide whether or not to leave. Nothing changed my desire to be here and to want to stay here. Sporting nurtured me, gave me a lot. It was a source of great pride and honour to continue representing Sporting. Obviously, the transfer market moves any player, especially when we know which clubs are behind us or want us, but I’ve always tried to stay focused because the image I want to leave at Sporting is that. Until the last day I am here, I will always do my best and continue to do my best<br /><br />I don’t know if the dream can wait long, I don’t know if clubs are willing to wait long or not, but if a club really wants me, whether today or tomorrow, I think it will try. If not try it is because the interest is not so great. I am not outstanding. I am not <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, I am not <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>, I have the notion of that. I still have a lot to grow, but when I want to leave Sporting I want it to be what it was like when I came to Sporting: the club wanted me, nurtured me, gave me everything I needed to grow and today I am what I’m because of Sporting</p>

  <p><b>[Bruno Fernandes: <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> improvement not all about me but decision to join was easy]</b> The decision was easy because when I had the chance to come, I didn’t think twice. I talked with Sporting, who had already had some discussions with Man United about my transfer and when they talk with me, I told them my first choice was Man United and it’s what I need for my career. I see the same team from one month ago. I think we are the same and have a lot of hunger to win, to give a lot, to do better and better in every game. In the last month, we’ve had a lot of really good games and I think we can talk about a new start after Bruno, but it’s not about Bruno, it’s about the team. The team needs the right focus, the right decisions at the time and I think also if Bruno doesn’t come, Man United would win the same because one player doesn’t change a team. A team changes when everyone pushes together for the same side. When I arrived, I saw the team pushing for the same side and to win games, get better and I’m another player to help<br /><br />It’s difficult because it’s been one month, but he’s always careful with the details and for me, that’s important because it is one of the things which changes football now is looking for the details. Now, every coach is really good, they look at each other and learn from each other and so the game is difficult. Now you have videos and most teams know what you will do, where you will place the ball, where they need to press so the game becomes harder and harder. I think he’s really good on this and he was a footballer so he knows when he needs to talk to players, when he needs to give q good word or sometimes come and push you to give more. I think when you have a past in football, you understand these things more than when you don’t have <b>[a past]</b><br /><br />But sometimes you have coaches who never play football and they also know this too so it depends coach from coach but I think Ole is really careful with these kind of points. He wants perfection, which is impossible, but he tries to ask more and more from us. I think the coach is always important for a new player when you come in. With me, it was really important because you need to feel confidence from the other side. When you need to change, and it’s a big change coming from another country to a big club with big players, you need to be ready. I think when I arrived here, the coach was really important but more than the coach was my team-mates because when you have the confidence of your team-mates, it’s much better and easier for you</p>

  <p><b>[Bruno Fernandes considers himself to be ‘different from the others’ at Manchester United]</b> I think I’m a different player from the others. Everyone has a different mould to play, maybe I take more risks, maybe other players don’t take as many, maybe I shoot more, some players pass more, some of the players make more tackles, everyone is different in a club. Some players are similar but they’re never the same player. I’m a player who normally likes to take the risk, give the last pass and try to give more assists to my team-mates so I need to take the risk. It doesn’t matter for me if someone off the field is not happy about my pass, I will respect it but I will keep trying.<br /><br />Normally, everyone says the guys who are good on the ball are not good enough off the ball. I try to be better with the ball but also have in my mind these kinds of thing like the reaction when I lose it, being hungry when things don’t go wrong and hungry when you pass and it goes to your partner, but it’s not good enough and you need to do a little bit more.<br /><br />I think I look at the details because if you want to be better and one of the best, you need to look at the details. It’s not about finishing the game and if you get an assist and have a good game, you don’t need to watch the game to see if you made some mistakes or not.<br /><br />And when you think ‘today I didn’t play really well so I need to watch everything and see where I did my mistakes’. Sometimes, when I feel like I played a bad game, I don’t watch <b>[it back]</b>. I have in my mind that I need to do better and I know what I did wrong because you know what is the wrong pass, the wrong shot, the wrong decision and when you do well, you have to look.<br /><br />Maybe you have an assist but you need to look at if that assist can be better because sometimes, it be better but you can’t do better. It’s difficult to explain but think I need to look at the details to be better.</p>

Words like these make the difference<br /><br />When I arrived for the medicals, everything impressed me. At the training ground, you can find everything.

But the hair, the hair needs to stay<br /><br />Not like I need to come because the coach wants me to play, no, not like this, but I want to feel the confidence from the coach: ‘You come, you are a choice for me and you come. I need you, I want you<br /><br />It’s not like you come and I ask, ‘But I will play?’ No, this for me is not the point. For me, the point is the confidence he has in me. If he has confidence in me, then the rest is working. I feel the confidence from the club and I feel also the confidence from the coach, Ole, and also if maybe the choice was not from the coach, I come. I come and I will show to the coach I can play, I can be a choice for him, because sometimes you need to press yourself to be better and give more<br /><br />Maybe if I come and I am not the choice for the coach, I will know I need to give not 100 per cent, 200 per cent, because the coach needs to see, he needs to see me, he needs to understand that I need to play, I want to play more than the others. In your mind, you want to play more than the others, but the others are thinking the same way with you<br /><br />This is the confidence we need to have to keep improving, to keep training more and the healthy battles you need in the team. You are competing with someone, this one, this one and this one. You need to give more than him and he will be thinking the same way with me and then, if you’re thinking the same way, you can be much better. Me and him. It doesn’t matter who plays, you will train better, I will train better and so the team will be better</p>

For me, he is the player with the capacity to take you and put you in front of the TV, and you will stay for hours. For hours! Because he had that energy and happiness.

If you don’t beat them, they will beat you. It doesn’t matter who is on the other team. If it is a friend, because I have friends playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, I don’t care.

Normally I arrive before him, and he comes at breakfast, gives me his hand and starts to sing the song – Bruno, Bruno, Bruno!<br /><br />Physically it’s easier than mentally, because you just need to follow the programme and you will be okay. Mentally it is also nice because I have my family with me so you can spend a lot of time with the family. I have my baby so I have a lot of time to be with her. Normally, if I have games and training, for most of the time I’m out sleeping in hotels and everything, so I don’t have the same time to be with her. So it’s nice to have this time.

So you need to play a lot with her <b>[and do]</b> different things. I think it’s easy because I remember when I grew up, in my home with my father, my mother, my brother and my sister, we didn’t have a lot of space to play. In the first years, I had an apartment – when we were three we had to change home. In an apartment, you can do a lot of things, you know? Just with a wall sometimes, you take the ball left and right, left and right, it’s easy – you don’t need to break something or cause a big problem with your mum!

I think everyone is talking about Marcus not scoring a lot of goals but he is doing an amazing job. The game he is playing now, maybe he is not achieving his goals and everything but, with everything we are doing now, he will achieve more goals and more assists. In the games, in the complete football, because football is not just about goals and assists, it is about the team and Marcus is playing very well for the team<br /><br />Anthony is playing very well and scoring goals, which is what you want as a striker, and Mason is a young kid who is scoring every time in different ways, so you always need to expect something new from him. I hope Marcus can find more goals because he deserves it for the work he is doing for the team, and nobody sees it because everyone sees the goals and who scores and assists. The work he is doing for the team is amazing. Marcus was injured for a long time so it’s difficult to find that confidence again, to do things like shoot from far out. But he is doing an amazing job for the group and I think he deserves credit for this.<br /><br />The play we did, the way we came to score, means it’s one of the best goals from a team <b>[perspective]</b> that I’ve scored.	That’s because of all the teamwork. We won the ball with the header from H <b>[Harry Maguire]</b>, Nemanja <b>[Matic]</b> takes the ball and Mason did an amazing run but, at that moment, Rashy did a perfect run. He was one of the far <b>[off]</b> guys but comes so fast to the goal that defenders know if they give him space, he will score. So maybe he <b>[the defender]</b> closes him down being closer to the ball and, when the cross comes over, and it was a great ball by Mason, after that I just need to score the goal.</p>
