  <p><b>[Rhian Brewster speaks after winning the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> U-17 World Cup India 2017]</b> At the beginning, I scored one in three or four games, so to win the Golden Boot and score a couple of hat-tricks, it is an amazing feeling. I enjoyed every moment of this tournament. It’s been a great month. It shows that football in England is evolving, we’re good technically and tactically, and we’ve got fighting spirit. That’s what we will see from English teams <b>[in the future]</b></p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> planning ‘big role’ for Rhian Brewster this season]</b> It’s mad how far you can come in a year. This time last year I was out injured, I was here watching the boys play against Tranmere and this year I’m here playing. I’m loving every minute of pre-season. It’s tough, don’t get me wrong, but I’d rather be out there than on the treatment bench.<br /><br /><b>[Brewster will back himself to make his mark at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. Though yet to make a senior first-team appearance, the teenager lacks nothing in terms of confidence]</b> I know what I want in life. I want to play at the highest level, for club and country<br /><br /><b>[As for the man himself, he’s just happy to be on the field again]</b> I’m taking every moment as it comes. It’s great to be back out there</p>

  <p><b>[Rhian Brewster is ready to fill the big boots of <a href="daniel-sturridge.html">Daniel Sturridge</a> at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> He has said it quite a few times now and I just want to repay his faith in me. It is alright him saying it, but it is for me to go out there and do it. I’m looking forward to doing that. Of course it’s sad that Daniel has gone, but it’s a gap for me and hopefully I can fill his big boots. He’s not a bad player! Hopefully I can push on this season<br /><br /><b>[When asked about his form]</b> I got two goals against Tranmere and a goal against Bradford, but coming to the US we’ve got <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>, Sevilla and Sporting. It’s going to be a tough task but it will be good to get more minutes in this heat. Hopefully I can get a few more goals and push on</p>

  <p><b>[Rhian Brewster says that he is confident that <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> as a plan for him as he awaits a breakthrough with the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> first team]</b> You’ve just got to be patient and wait for your turn. Obviously the boss has a plan for me and he knows what he’s doing, clearly. Just chatting to him and stuff, he says, ‘Just be patient, your time will come, it will happen,’ and I’m just waiting. I’m being patient<br /><br /><b>[Many expected Brewster to go out on loan this season, but the forward says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s faith in him kept him with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> said no straight away, so that shows that he has great faith in me and wants to push me towards the first team. Obviously it’s hard, with our front three, to get game-time because they’re all amazing players. It’s going to be difficult, but you just have to keep going and going</p>

  <p><b>[Rhian Brewster says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s underrated <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> is one of top three forwards in the world]</b> He’s easily top three. As a striker he’s up there with the best. He’s an amazing player and so underrated in the football industry. Only lately has he been regarded as one of the best at what he does. He’s not a typical No.9. He’s his own nine, he made it himself. He comes in, goes high, he goes over the place and that’s what I think helps the team a lot<br /><br /><b>[He pointed to the example of <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> being voted for by <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> in <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>’s The Best Awards earlier this year]</b> Personally I think he’s one of the best wingers in the world. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is on a different planet but I’m not surprised that he voted for Sadio</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> striker Rhian Brewster has spoken out against racism]</b> This is way deeper than just pointing out who’s staying quiet and who’s speaking up. Unfortunately for us black/brown people etc, this is a real life and everyday occurrence in so many different ways. For years and generations we’ve been screaming out for change and to be heard yet the pain continues. We’ve all been shown films like Roots, we’ve all seen films like Boyz in the Hood where this reality is covered and showcased. Yet we are still living these movies in real life. In 2020, today. This goes beyond just #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd, we need justice for us as human beings. We don’t want special privilege. A level playing field is all we have been crying for, forever. Hear us. #BlackLivesMatter</p>
