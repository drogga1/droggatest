  <p><b>[Rhian Brewster netted a hat-trick as England’s U17s annihilated Croatia 5-0 and added a brace in the 8-1 scorching of Germany during the Croatia Cup last year]</b> That was a great experience. I didn’t think I was going to start and to then score the first goal after a great team move was a fantastic feeling. I got a second goal and then luckily for me I managed to get a hat-trick. I got a ‘well done’ from the boss which was amazing. My confidence was sky high.</p>

  <p><b>[Rhian Brewster speaks after winning the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> U-17 World Cup India 2017]</b> At the beginning, I scored one in three or four games, so to win the Golden Boot and score a couple of hat-tricks, it is an amazing feeling. I enjoyed every moment of this tournament. It’s been a great month. It shows that football in England is evolving, we’re good technically and tactically, and we’ve got fighting spirit. That’s what we will see from English teams <b>[in the future]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Rhian Brewster opens up on Liverpool ambitions]</b> At the moment, I just want to be playing regular professional football for the first team. Whether that was at Liverpool or somewhere else, yeah it was uncertain. But hopefully in 12 months’ time I’ll be sat here saying I made the right decision in what I chose to do. I want to be able to reflect positively on that.<br /><br /><b>[So was Brewster tempted to follow his pal to Germany?]</b> Sure, I look at people like Jadon. But then I look at people like Trent <b>[Alexander-Arnold]</b>. You can do it both ways. You can go down the road of staying, waiting for a chance and then taking it, like Trent did, or you can look at it like Jadon did, and think maybe I won’t get my chance here, so I can go somewhere else, abroad maybe. I look at it both ways. I’m going to do what’s best for me. If that meant going Jadon’s way, I’d go Jadon’s way. If it means staying and doing what Trent did, then I’ll do a Trent!<br /><br />I just know what I want in life. I know what I want to achieve. People say ‘follow your dream’ and that’s what I want to do. But there are others who try and put you down. Those people, they only inspire me. If they hate on me for doing something good, then it makes me want to do even better and stay at that level. I love it, to be fair. If you play football and fans are booing or saying negative stuff, it makes me play better. All I want to do is put the ball in the back of the net and say, ‘what are you gonna say now?’ If I have a centre back giving me stick, I want to score and say, ‘shut your mouth!’ It makes me strive, man.<br /><br />I don’t switch off. I like to watch the games, and watch what I am missing. It makes me want to be out there even more. Being injured gives you the chance to reflect on the players who play in your position, too. You see things you can do, things you can maybe do better. It’s about doing everything you can to get to the top, so any little advantage you can take, you should do it. I do it off my own back. The staff at the Academy will sometimes invite me to games, but it’s more something I like to do myself. I like to watch Firmino and the rest. It’s about being the best I can be, and if that means learning stuff off other people, then I’ll do it<br /><br />If I was building an ideal striker? Ooh, it’d be a bit of Firmino, a bit of Suarez, and a bit of Thierry Henry. Growing up, Henry was my idol. He’s the reason I wanted to play football. If you could put all those three together, you’d have some player!<br /><br />Obviously you want to be the perfect player, so you have to always work towards that aim. If that’s working on my left foot, scoring goals with both feet, then that’s what I’ll work on. Or if it’s my first touch or my physical attributes, I’ll work on those. You can’t stop working. Mentally and tactically as well, you have to develop. You could play for different managers, who want different things, so you need to be able to adapt to everything. If you do that, you will play. You don’t want to be just a big striker that only plays one way or under one manager, you want to be able to do everything, whatever a manager needs from you. I speak to a lot of people, to get their advice and their thoughts. But ultimately, you have to do what you want to do. What’s in your head? If you want to be at the top, be at the top. If that means making sacrifices, then that’s what I am going to do. No, it’s not easy! I still have my friends, and they’re wanting to go out places and stuff. I can’t. I train and I rest and I play. Even when I’m off, I have to be careful, I still have to do the right things. For me, it’s about being careful and sensible. You make big sacrifices, staying in, eating the right things, but that’s what you have to do to get to the top - and I want to get to the top. Of course it’s been hard. Your friends are chilling while you’re training, but what would you rather do? Go to their house and chill, or go training? My rewards will come. At the end of the day, I’m doing something I love. In the future, that may lead to money, but the main thing is that you don’t want to be in a job that you don’t like. You want to be in a job that you love, where it doesn’t feel like work<br /><br />No, not at all. I just wanted to put my voice out there and be heard. No it doesn’t surprise me the way the ruling went, but hopefully it does change at some point in the future, and that it helps bring the rubbishness out of football. With the World Cup being in Russia, I hope no-one gets abused over there. I think it happened recently with France, but my hope is that something can be done about it and we can change it, to be honest. You hope it doesn’t happen to anyone else, but if it does then my advice is to follow the rules. Control yourself, as hard as that is, tell people and speak up. It’s not easy, but it’s the best way<br /><br /><b>[On Liverpool’s support]</b> It’s a really close-knit club. The feedback and the vibe I got off them was that we are a family. Everyone was behind me, nobody said I shouldn’t do it. Even the fans, I got lots of messages and I really appreciate that. No-one was against what I did. It was a bad time, but people were there for me. I won’t forget that<br /><br />Yeah man, I see it! When people look at me, I look at them back like ‘what you looking at?’ but I have to be careful now! They know my face! It happens when I’m out and about at home or in Liverpool, I get asked to take pictures and stuff. It can be a good and a bad thing, but for me it’s more good than bad. It shows that people are recognising you and that you are progressing. Where I’m from, you have to grow up quickly. That’s a fact. I just want to be a footballer and a big face in the game. I want to be an idol to young children. It’s starting to happen now, and I hope it continues<br /><br />You have to stamp your mark. You have to get the chance and you have to take it. My hope now is to be playing regular football, so I can play at the highest level for club and country. The next World Cup or even the next Euros, I want to be in with a shot of being picked. That’s what I strive for, to be the best I can be, to hopefully give me the best opportunity to get there. The only way you can do that is by getting a chance in club football. I can’t wait for mine</p>

  <p><b>[Rhian Brewster has ended speculation over his future by signing a five-year professional contract]</b> It feels great. I’ve wanted to do this for a very long time now and I think it’s the right moment for me and my family. I’m looking forward to getting back fit and making some appearances. Since I got here the club has been amazing to me and treated me like family. It seems like I’ve been here my whole life, to be honest. It’s coming up to my fifth season now. I <b>[still]</b> remember my first training session. It’s amazing and I can’t wait to get started<br /><br /><b>[Brewster is rated highly by Jurgen Klopp]</b> He has been key. Obviously I’ve had conversations with him and I’m just hoping he puts his faith in me and gives me an opportunity to play. I think he will, that’s why I wanted to stay here. Hopefully we can push on, not just as a team but as a club<br /><br />I’d like to think that would have happened but obviously we’ll never know because of what happened. But hopefully this year I will get my professional debut and push on from there</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool prospect Rhian Brewster hopes to finally make his first-team debut by the end of the year having overcome a long-term ankle injury]</b> It has been a frustrating time, I’ve been out for a long time and I don’t wish that on anyone. It’s happened and I’m finally back fit and doing what I love and pushing to get back in the team. To know that the boss really wants me to be in his plans for the future is amazing, especially a boss like him. During this injury, I’ve had that, he has been there from the beginning to the end and to know he still wants me - even though it’s been so long - gives me a great boost. They could easily have left me at the Academy to do my rehab but they wanted me to do my rehab with them, so I can’t thank them enough. Every time I see him he gives me a big hug. Not only him, every time I see the players they are asking about how I am, ‘How long?’. They can’t wait for me to be back in training and hopefully make my debut this year, if not next.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool wonderkid Rhian Brewster back on track for superstardom after injury nightmare]</b> I didn’t want to look, to be honest. I knew it was a bad one, because I heard it. I heard something go. Immediately, I thought I’d broken my ankle<br /><br />I had no calves at all. They’re coming back now, I think, but when you have two operations on your leg, the muscle mass just goes completely. There’s nothing you can do<br /><br />You find out a lot about yourself. You have to be tough mentally. The operations were big ones, so I knew it’d take a lot of hard work. It’s hard, you know? You’re in the gym for hours on end doing strengthening exercises, and that’s just so you are able to start running again. You can’t even think about getting on the pitch to start with<br /><br />Argh, don’t! I just want to score! It’s all I’ve been thinking about! I want to be a Premier League player, a Liverpool player and an England player. Those ambitions still burn inside me, of course. Even more so now, I’d say!<br /><br />It’s huge for me. They still wanted me even when I was out for months, and for a player that’s a big thing. They’ve done so much. I’ve had days when I’m down or whatever, and they’ve let me go home to London to clear my head, or they’ve been there to pick me up and keep me going. I won’t forget it<br /><br /><b>[On Jurgen Klopp]</b> It shows that he has a lot of faith in me. And, when I’m back, I want to repay that faith. He could easily have forgotten about me, sent me back to the Academy to do my rehab or whatever, but he didn’t. He wanted me at Melwood, in and around the team, and for that I can’t thank him enough<br /><br />Seeing them do it, it makes me think that I can do it as well. It’s a good motivation for me. I can’t wait until I can show what I can do. I’m a very ambitious player, and I want to be around those top players. I want to compete with them and learn from them. Training should be tough, it should challenge you, because that’s how you improve. You want to get to that level, I don’t want to be the one where people say ‘ooh, maybe he’s not ready for that level yet’. I want to be up there with them</p>

For years and generations we’ve been screaming out for change and to be heard yet the pain continues. We’ve all been shown films like Roots, we’ve all seen films like Boyz in the Hood where this reality is covered and showcased. Yet we are still living these movies in real life. In 2020, today. This goes beyond just #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd, we need justice for us as human beings. We don’t want special privilege. A level playing field is all we have been crying for, forever.
