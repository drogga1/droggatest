  <p><b>[Vieira heaps derision on <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s Champions League ambitions and criticised their £18.5 million summer signings of Francis Jeffers and Giovanni van Bronckhorst.

  <p><b>[David Dein says <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> is still the man for the Gunners]</b> He’s still got the fire in his belly. He’s still hungry for the game, he’s very ambitious, he’s 67 years young, extraordinarily fit, he’s the same weight now as when I met him in 1989 - why not? He can carry on if he wants to, everything depends on him and himself - does he want to carry on?</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> vice-chairman David Dein says the club should be targeting a top-two finish in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> under Unai Emery]</b> I think it’s a work in progress. We have to patient. It’s not easy today as everyone expects instant success, and you can see what has happened to other club around us. Everyone thinks it is so easy, you turn the tap on and you get hot water, but it’s not quite as easy as that. <b>[but]</b> I think we set a certain standard and we expect them to be up at the top challenging for first or second place<br /><br /><b>[When asked whether those apparent financial disparities mean <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> should lower their ambitions and instead aim for a top four finish]</b> I’ve never subscribed to that. I’ve always felt <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> had to be challenging for at least first or second in the league every year. That has to be the ambition at the start of the season</p>
