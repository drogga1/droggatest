  <p>[Nikola Kalinic has revealed that he turned down a reported €12 million annual salary offer from the Chinese Super League] I’ll stay at Fiorentina! It is my decision, only mine. I want to play in Italy, in the club I’ve been with for the last two years and I feel really comfortable. There was huge pressure to sell me, I felt everyone was pushing me to China. Not the club but the press and people, the atmosphere was created that I should go - they wanted to get rid of me. I never said I would love to go. Of course I considered it when I saw the offer, but not once did I say I would like to go! I don’t know how much Tianjin offered to Fiorentina, I got an offer for me and decided to stay. This is my final decision!</p>

  <p>[Nikola Kalinic has admitted he does not deserve his World Cup runners-up medal. The Milan striker refused to come on as a substitute in Croatia’s 2-0 win over Nigeria, citing fitness issues, but was then kicked out of the squad by head coach Zlatko Dalic] Thanks for the medals, but I did not play in Russia.</p>
