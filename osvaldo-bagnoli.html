<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Osvaldo Bagnoli readily admits Verona’s tactics throughout the season were far from revolutionary]</b> Football is a simple game. Concepts like pressing and playing zonally aren’t indispensable. The important thing is to have the luck to find the right men, then put them in the right positions and let them be free to express themselves. It’s their willpower that comes above everything. I have led players who have deserved to win the Scudetto without inventing new tactics, without Machiavellianism or any secrets. Football is one game and one game only<br /><br />It was a puzzle and the right pieces were always the right people before being the right athletes. It was possible above all because everyone was hungry and wanted to show their former clubs that they were wrong to let them leave. We needed to be together for some years, to get to know each other well then the results began to arrive. We worked a lot on the players, who were either strong or very strong, but no one was a Martian or a phenomenon who came down from another planet</p>
