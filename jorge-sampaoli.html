  <p><b>[Jorge Sampaoli better hope that self sabotage does not further transmit to the field of play]</b> We are looking at alternatives - either man for man or systematic. To replace an important player would be difficult but our obligation is to have all the players ready when called upon to play</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, Suarez, and Neymar]</b> Fifa must intervene. The friendship between Leo, <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> and Suarez is the worst thing that has happened to football. Leo alone can win a game. If, in addition, he empowers Suarez and <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, that is invaluable. They should ban it</p>

  <p><b>[Sevilla head coach Jorge Sampaoli speaks about his desire to create a style of play ahead of <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>’s visit in La Liga]</b> At <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> I am looking for an identity rather than titles. <b>[In future]</b> I will remember the days when I was here, I will think about how we played. At the moment we aren’t making the most of the chances that are being created with huge effort. That is the issue of this team today. Hopefully in the time remaining before stopping <b>[for the mid-season break]</b> we will do better in terms of goals because otherwise it will be stressful</p>

  <p><b>[Jorge Sampaoli on <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> after the Argentina star’s hat-trick helped secure a Russia 2018 berth]</b> I told the group: <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> did not owe the World Cup to Argentina, but football owed the World Cup to <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. The nationality of the best player in the world is luckily Argentine. Football, the World Cup, could not be left without <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. We had to play with that in mind. As a consequence of that pressure, we are stronger now, this qualification will make us stronger to face the future. We had the possibility to help him to be in another World Cup. He is the best player in the history of football and I’m very excited to be in a group near him</p>

  <p><b>[Jorge Sampaoli speaks about <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> during his provisional squad announcement]</b> I think <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is very optimistic, excited about what is ahead. Physically he’s very good, winning the league early influenced that. We won’t count on <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> much for the friendly matches but I think for the World Cup he will be very good. The World Cup is a challenge where if you don’t have everything you’re doing clear then it will cause you problems. You have to face up to it without fear</p>

  <p><b>[Sampaoli defiant over exit rumours]</b> I have a contract and I’m happy to be here despite what sometimes surrounds this job. So, as long as I can fight to be here, I’ll be here every day<br /><br /><b>[<a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> was introduced shortly after and the situation has brought Sampaoli’s authority under further scrutiny, but he insists it did not quite happen as was said]</b> Well, I remember that point in time, but everything I mentioned to the players is personal and I don’t think it’s for the public domain, it was a simple exchange I had with a player. That’s not how to characterise it. We make important decisions in games and I was simply explaining it, that we would use a strategy we had; using more attacking players</p>

  <p><b>[Jorge Sampaoli when asked whether <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> can win the 2022 <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup]</b> Of course yes, but this needs a process, for everything that has happened up to now and you don’t break the process; you correct it. For the next World Cup or Copa America you need organisation, unlimited confidence and knowing that everything requires a process. If you don’t win the Copa America, you have to keep the process, not break it. Enough of this madness that if you do not ‘win’, ‘you’ are a loser. It’s not like that: if you believe, you can win even later. But you have to believe</p>

  <p><b>[Jorge Sampaoli has warned the Real Madrid new boy Rodrygo to expect a ‘difficult’ start to life among ‘icons’ at the Santiago Bernabeu]</b> Rodrygo is going to one of the best teams in the world at a very young age and there will be a very big contrast when he arrives at Real Madrid as he will share a dressing room with players who are very successful and who are icons in Europe. At the beginning, it will be very difficult for him but he has the potential <b>[to make it]</b>. He is very young and he should have the same expectations about his performances after this huge leap he made in his life and his career. In Spain, there is a lot of collective play while here in Brazil these types of players tend to be much more individualistic. During this period, we insisted on the connection of communicating through passing the ball, but also how to pick the moments, to understand when you have to dribble or when to play into space. These are things that you are forced to do in Spain.</p>
