I can assure you that all the comments reach Messi and make him feel bad and that feeling enters the pitch.<br /><br />I would love to coach Messi and get to see him every day from the side of the field. It’s a unique opportunity to see the best player of the world up close. Today, Messi is in great shape. Who wouldn’t like to coach him?

He said that he was happy to play with Messi, but he just did not find his place. Leo <b>[Messi]</b> needs to move in the field normally as he does with his club. To invent a position so as he can develop a system or to structure him, that would be crazy. When we use 4-2-3-1 formation he is even further forward, always near the box. Being away from the box puts our best player far from the scoring positions and that is what he does best in his club. It is my job to make him understand that he is vital in the finishing, in the last third of the pitch</p>

I won’t rule him out, but as Argentina’s coach I have to priorise our partnerships on the pitch.<br /><br />If <b>[Lionel Messi]</b> is ok, Argentina will be his team.

As a result, he can’t enjoy his talent. What I find is that the negativity surrounding international football damages Messi.<br /><br />At this moment, I feel that I’m coaching the best player in history. This is a guy who has stayed as the best in the world for 10 years. It’s difficult to assume a level of control when your leader knows he’s better than you, he executes things like nobody else<br /><br />You have to find the best players and put them in their best position. Leo has to play like he does for his club, to put him into another structure is madness. Against Ecuador I was a bit strong in my tone suggesting that football owed Messi a World Cup, however I knew he was going to appear for us at the vital moments</p>

We have to provoke situations that allow him to be in an optimum state of comfort. We have to know how to accompany him. The dialogue is constant<br /><br />It would be good if we could start to circulate around a player who can strengthen the rest.

If he continues like this, he will have no problems playing.<br /><br /><b>[Sampaoli admits he is not going to try teaching the attacker anything]</b> It is impossible to teach something to Messi. His level is unattainable. You have to understand Messi, not teach him. In training you have to try to cause situations in which his comfort will be optimal. From there, you have to build a team related to this story. You have to learn from these kind of players that come around every so often. You have to learn how to go with them, not even in coaching terms, but in the sense of how to bring harmony to him, surrounding him with the right atmosphere. In that sense, Leo is very open to interact a lot with what he feels inside the pitch. The interpretation of a player with such a capacity inside the pitch gives the coach a better perspective of what is coming because his lenses are probably much more developed than ours. Luckily, the dialogue with him is very constant. I always see him at a high level of compromise with the national team and its wishes. We will go through this together</p>

I am happy because I know that Leo’s commitment to getting us into the next round is still there.<br /><br />We came out determined to dominate the game. Iceland were well-organised defensively and that stopped us from creating chances. We did not manage a quick transition game which could unsettle the opponent. We only did that in the second half. I think the key to the game, because of how Iceland defended, was down the left. But we moved the ball around slowly. We lacked more vertical movement and midfielders pushing up, which is what happened in the passage where Meza earned the penalty</p>

I don’t think there were many differences in the development of the game between the teams. They went for counters and we went for possession.

It’s not ideal and I’d have maybe preferred them to work differently, but that’s the way it is.

  <p><b>[Messi can lead a new Argentina after World Cup failure]</b> We have the best player in the world and we had to try to create collective situations to really use that player who can have many brilliant moments. We tried many different tactics - surround him, create space for him … we tried to use everything we had to allow him to do what he can do. Sometimes we managed it, sometimes we didn’t.</p>

  <p><b>[Jorge Sampaoli has broken his silence on Argentina’s failed World Cup 2018]</b> <b>[Coaching Messi]</b> was incredible, just to see him so committed, suffering so much when we did not win. The best player in history was very committed. Leo suffered more than anyone the impossible task. Not being able to stand weighed on him the hardest. Having the best in the world in your team forces you to demand more. The rest of us have to match his level. But sometimes you can do it, sometimes you cannot. That was our struggle every single day. Having Leo in your team means you do not have any margin of error, you have to win.<br /><br />Of course he could <b>[win the title in Qatar]</b>. But that needs a process, after everything that has happened up to now. Processes should not be broken, they should be corrected. For the next World Cup or Copa America we need organisation, limitless trust and to know that everything requires its own process. That means that if we do not win the Copa America we have to keep the same project, not break it. Enough of this craziness that says that if you do not win you are a loser. That is not true, if you have faith you can win even if it comes later on. But you have to believe</p>

  <p><b>[Jorge Sampaoli when asked whether <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> can win the 2022 <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup]</b> Of course yes, but this needs a process, for everything that has happened up to now and you don’t break the process; you correct it. For the next World Cup or Copa America you need organisation, unlimited confidence and knowing that everything requires a process. If you don’t win the Copa America, you have to keep the process, not break it. Enough of this madness that if you do not ‘win’, ‘you’ are a loser. It’s not like that: if you believe, you can win even later. But you have to believe</p>

  <p><b>[Lionel Messi suffers a lot with Argentina]</b> I coached the best player in the world, I don’t <b>[know]</b> if he’s the best in history, because he now has more than 600 goals in Europe, he’s broken all the records, but he arrives in his country and he’s criticised. Beyond his ability, he’s a human being, Argentinians struggle to enjoy Messi as Barcelona fans enjoy him. The boy suffers a lot, from what I’ve gone through, he suffers that reality a lot. He cannot show the world all that he is when plays for Argentina. <b>[Argentine]</b> society enjoys destroying things much more than it enjoys success.<br /><br /><b>[Sampaoli said of his time with Argentina]</b> Being the coach of a South American national team is almost impossible because the best players in our teams are in Europe and we cannot speak to them for the necessary amount of time. We only have them for very little time to instil the values that we want and our playing philosophy</p>

  <p><b>[Jorge Sampaoli has warned the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> new boy <a href="rodrygo.html">Rodrygo</a> to expect a ‘difficult’ start to life among ‘icons’ at the <a href="real-madrid.html">Santiago Bernabeu</a>]</b> <a href="rodrygo.html">Rodrygo</a> is going to one of the best teams in the world at a very young age and there will be a very big contrast when he arrives at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> as he will share a dressing room with players who are very successful and who are icons in Europe. At the beginning, it will be very difficult for him but he has the potential <b>[to make it]</b>. He is very young and he should have the same expectations about his performances after this huge leap he made in his life and his career. In Spain, there is a lot of collective play while here in Brazil these types of players tend to be much more individualistic. During this period, we insisted on the connection of communicating through passing the ball, but also how to pick the moments, to understand when you have to dribble or when to play into space. These are things that you are forced to do in Spain.</p>
