<blockquote>
  <p><b>[David de Gea is doing special preparation to deal with Lionel Messi]</b> Those who know David well can tell you one of his virtues is his ability to block everything out, he is very strong mentally. We do something different when facing Messi. With De Gea we have worked on some more specific work, there are some extras compared to other games with having Leo up front. I wouldn’t lie if I said we do a super special preparation. I worked in La Liga for many years with David as well and before with other keepers. I can’t deny that there is a particularity regarding Leo. In the end, you try to offer tools and data to the keeper so that it can help him. In this game we have a lot of respect for the opponents and their players, but no fear. We have been able to beat important rivals like Barcelona, so we are capable of winning against any team<br /><br />The most important thing is to know that the Champions League is a different competition than the Premier League. The way we eliminated PSG is a reinforcement for us. It is the most important game of the season</p>
