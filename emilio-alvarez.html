  <p><b>[Manchester United have sounded an ominous warning with the club’s goalkeeping coach claiming that David de Gea can get even better]</b> David is, of course, the one who plays more and is an important player for the club, but the three of them <b>[goalkeepers]</b> are doing very well. With David, we are always thinking about how he can get better and better, and better. To be honest, I don’t think David will ever stop. He can get even better!<br /><br />To be honest, I do not agree that Lee is only learning from us. Since Granty came here, he has been a really, really, really nice surprise. We are learning from him. We are really learning from him because he is a really, really good goalkeeper, a really, really good professional, and as a man, the way he interacts with the rest of the colleagues, he is unbelievable. We are really lucky to have him. We have to be sure to say we have three of the best goalkeepers in the world, because each of them has really good skills. For example, Sergio is an experienced goalkeeper in the Argentina national team so what more can I say about him? It is a pleasure to work with all three goalkeepers</p>

  <p><b>[David de Gea is doing special preparation to deal with Lionel Messi]</b> Those who know David well can tell you one of his virtues is his ability to block everything out, he is very strong mentally. We do something different when facing Messi. With De Gea we have worked on some more specific work, there are some extras compared to other games with having Leo up front. I wouldn’t lie if I said we do a super special preparation. I worked in La Liga for many years with David as well and before with other keepers. I can’t deny that there is a particularity regarding Leo. In the end, you try to offer tools and data to the keeper so that it can help him. In this game we have a lot of respect for the opponents and their players, but no fear. We have been able to beat important rivals like Barcelona, so we are capable of winning against any team<br /><br />The most important thing is to know that the Champions League is a different competition than the Premier League. The way we eliminated PSG is a reinforcement for us. It is the most important game of the season</p>
