  <p><b>[Mahon enjoying <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> interim role after succeeding close friend <a href="nick-cushing.html">Cushing</a>]</b> I’ve gone a bit greyer, if that’s what you want to know<br /><br />Do you want to know the truth? I’ve probably spoken to him more now than I did when he was here. We are very close. We bought a clapped-out old banger to drive in together, so I became really close with Nick as a friend, and as he was my gaffer as well. He’s got a nice little face, hasn’t he? He’s got a happy face and he’s a positive person to be around. I think I try surrounding myself with positive people and he was one of them. Over the last few months, he’s rang me for advice, obviously going into <b>[the men’s]</b> side of football, and also I’ve tapped into his knowledge, which is unbelievable on <b>[the women’s]</b> side. Luckily enough, you can do it over the internet, it’s not done by phones anymore where you get charged stupid amounts, because I would have a big bill to be honest! I’m sure he’ll be very successful because of the type of person he is and the level of coach he is. He’ll be a big part of my life, he’s a cool guy, and I wish him the best<br /><br />It was going to be difficult for <b>[the players]</b>. Nick has been the only voice, as a coach, that some of them have heard. We felt just for the continuity and the smoothness, <b>[it was important]</b> not to change things too much, especially in an important time in the season. When I took charge, I wanted to emphasise that continuity. This is not about me, it’s about the club, about the players and <b>[about]</b> what we needed to do as a group just to keep the ship stable, so to speak<br /><br /><b>[City are top of the table as things stand]</b> It’s been a lot easier than I thought in terms of going forward, but that’s just because, like I said, we’ve got good people around us<br /><br />We tried to make it light-hearted as well because, in the current climate the world is in a really difficult place. Sometimes you need to keep it a bit light to keep people’s spirits and morale up<br /><br /><b>[Having worked alongside <a href="nick-cushing.html">Cushing</a> throughout his trophy-laden tenure]</b> I’m not trying to steer clear or jump questions, but I’ve not looked at it stills. My job is just to continue as it is, but I’ve enjoyed it</p>

  <p><b>[Jess Park’s ready. She’s ready to play]</b> I think when you’ve got Jess’ ability, you can put her in a lot of positions. She plays up top for us because that’s where we probably feel that she’s strongest, but because of her ability, we can put her out wide, we can drop her a bit deeper. At the moment, to develop her, we are going to keep her up top, or in and around the No.10 and No.8<br /><br />A lot of people obviously want to see us as <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and we’ve got loads of money and all the stuff that you hear out there. But we work our socks off and pride ourselves on bringing young players through</p>

  <p><b>[At <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, Toland has only made one Women’s Super League appearance to date, but that says more about the competition in her position than her ability. In fact, Toland has spent most of the season so far in the senior squad, only making three appearances for the club’s development side]</b> It’s difficult obviously, <b>[her]</b> first year <b>[at the club]</b>, and the one thing that we have to do is support the young players. We don’t just throw them in at the deep end. There’s a process to getting them into the first team. But in terms of quality and in terms of ability, Tyler is absolutely fantastic. When she plays for us and when she trains with us on a daily basis, the level that she’s at, we’re really pleased with. The senior players keep the young players in line and the likes of Tyler and Jess <b>[Park]</b> and Emma Bissell can thrive in that environment. We’re quite excited</p>
