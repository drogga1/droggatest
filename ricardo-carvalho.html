  <p><b>[Ricardo Carvalho on Jose Mourinho]</b> <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> can’t deal with losing. He is simply not compatible with it. After a loss it’s very difficult to work with him the following day</p>

  <p><b>[Hamit Altintop delighted with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> debut in Champions League win over Ajax]</b> We’ve already taken six very important points. This home win will help us. We still have to face <a href="lyon-fc.html">Olympique Lyonnais</a> here and we want to seal our passage to the next round as group leaders<br /><br /><b>[The Portuguese defender also praised <a href="kaka.html">Kaka</a>, who scored a goal and assisted another in the 3-0 win]</b> I am very happy for <a href="kaka.html">Kaka</a>. The rest of the team are, too. It’s important to all of us that he plays at a high level. You can tell he feels good on the pitch and that helps us perform even better.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Ricardo Carvalho says Eden Hazard is ‘a great signing’ for Real Madrid]</b> He’s a great signing. I know him well and I’ve no doubt that he’ll do very well. He’s going to have more space in Spain. He’s very fast, very strong when one on one and a team like Madrid with great players will help him.<br /><br />It’s true that last year didn’t go as planned. But the team came from years of winning everything and sometimes that happens in football. You have to build a great team so it’s important they start winning matches</p>
