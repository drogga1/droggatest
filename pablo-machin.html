  <p><b>[Pablo Machin was asked about Ronaldo and Messi ahead of that game]</b> They are two very good footballers and two amazing teams. But there’s a greater dependency on Messi at Barcelona than Cristiano at Madrid. When Messi doesn’t score, he gives an assist or starts the play.</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid coach Julen Lopetegui has already got a head start over Sevilla boss Pablo Machin ahead of their clash]</b> Who would have said that, in the following season, we would be facing each other, with me at Sevilla and he at Madrid. I think we both would have signed up to it <b>[if Machin and Lopetegui had been offered the chance to coach Sevilla and Madrid, respectively]</b>. I gave my point of view on this system, but ideas and theories are one thing, reality is another.<br /><br />We can’t forget that the protagonists are the players and their qualities are what make you win or lose. Coaches help, but those who score goals or save them are key</p>

  <p><b>[Sevilla are top of La Liga]</b> We must realise how long the season is, that there will be tough runs of results. We must not analyse the standings. Otherwise, we will get vertigo.</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona vs Sevilla]</b> Ninety minutes at the Camp Nou can feel like a very long time, anything can happen. We’re going to fight, compete and try to follow the game-plan that we’ve created, that’s what we plan to do. We know that we’re facing a fantastic opponent, one who is searching for another magical comeback, but we’ll try to score, that will greatly increase our chances of progression.</p>
