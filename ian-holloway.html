  <p><b>[Ian Holloway after completing his touchline suspension]</b> You could argue I deserved it, and my wife would say I did, but when I don’t get what I want I’m not very nice. The worst thing was reading back what the referee and the linesman wrote. I actually said it and it’s not very good. My mum would have washed my mouth out with soap, like she used to when I was little. Although that doesn’t work to be fair - I could eat a bar of soap and swear like a trooper, so I don’t know what she was trying to achieve! I will challenge anyone and to be my size - I’m 5ft 7in and three-quarters - you have to be competitive. I’d say I was over-competitive and I get over-zealous, over-angry and over-determined. You can make anger a friend of yours when it isn’t, it’s an enemy. You have to be calm. I have a lot to learn. I have always wished I was more like Bjorn Borg’s temperament. He was my hero growing up. I was more like McEnroe. I don’t mean ability, I mean temperament</p>

  <p><b>[Wilfried Zaha has still got Cristiano Ronaldo-esque potential in him]</b> I’ve never worked with someone as talented as him. It was always about putting those pieces together. When you’ve got the amount of skill Wilfried has, it’s about when to do it. If they’re going to go to a 4-4-2, they should definitely sign him. Is <b>[Anthony]</b> Martial a winger or a wannabe No. 9? And do you really want to play <b>[Marcus]</b> Rashford in a wide left position? I think they still have got some issues to resolve.<br /><br />There was no better thing than seeing Ryan Giggs running down the wing beating people in a Manchester United shirt for years and years. They haven’t really got a winger anymore. Wilf was never given a proper opportunity at United. Sir Alex <b>[Ferguson]</b>, I totally believe, would have loved him. Look at what he did for <b>[Cristiano]</b> Ronaldo? Wilfried has still got that in him, so if I were United I would champion him, and if not maybe Manchester City might take him</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a>’s former manager Ian Holloway has suggested <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have made the wrong choice in landing <a href="nicolas-pepe.html">Nicolas Pepe</a> instead of the <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> winger]</b> I am very surprised that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> rate <a href="nicolas-pepe.html">Nicolas Pepe</a> better than <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a>. I certainly don’t. I would be very sad if I don’t ever see <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> playing in the Champions League. I feel he is good enough for anyone in the world, including the teams that get there. At the moment <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> can’t get to the Champions League. There is no wrong way to go about getting a move these days. I thought he had his best season ever last year. He is starting to add the end product to his performances. He has been handled fantastically well by <b>[<a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> manager and assistant]</b> <a href="roy-hodgson.html">Roy Hodgson</a> and Ray Lewington. The experience that those two have got, they were smart enough to move him from one of the wide areas to be centre forward<br /><br />If you leave him on his own with your last man when you are dominating the ball then you can be in trouble if Palace win it back. So it is all about end product with him, I always think ‘come on son, you can do that’. I see maturity in his play now. I believe at the very, very top level, if he plays with a team that can keep the ball away from you, who also win it back very quickly and dominate a game <b>[he’ll do well]</b>. If you give him the ball on the edge of the 18-yard box then he can win games, even for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. He would have to learn what the likes of <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> want but I think he would <b>[do well at the top level]</b>. He is good enough for any team in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> now. I may be biased because I have seen him close at hand. He is one I would pay to watch. He is trying to shine and I have all the time in the world for him<br /><br />The first time I heard about Wilf was when I got the job. I stayed down near Palace with my wife at one of the director’s houses. He was telling me: ‘Have you seen Wilf? He is brilliant’. I am sat at Palace having just managed Blackpool in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I didn’t say it out loud but I thought ‘I have had Tom <a href="paul-ince.html">Ince</a> and Matt Phillips’. I thought those two were fantastic and Wilf wouldn’t be as good. The first game I saw him, he flicked the ball over someone like he wasn’t there. He has still got it and still does it. He can do things with his brain that are on another level. His speed over a tackling distance is as quick as I have ever seen. He will leave you and then you can’t get there. Palace fans have a song saying: ‘He’s just too good for you’. I didn’t believe that was true but I do now</p>

  <p><b>[Ian Holloway wants his former player Ravel Morrison to forget his <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> past as he is granted a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> chance at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>]</b> He hasn’t failed but unfortunately he never lived up to the hype and expectation that he would have liked. He had to deal with untold attention because <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> said something. To live up to what Sir Alex said is a bit tough. I believe he should forget all that and just do what the rest of the lads do. <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> want to dominate the ball and play their way. If they can do that after promotion like <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> then I would be absolutely delighted for <a href="chris-wilder.html">Chris Wilder</a>. He is very inventive and bright. Even <b>[<a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a>]</b> <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Bielsa</a> said ‘well done’ to him. Ravel could fit into that. I want there to be no pressure on Ravel. I want him to be free and believe in himself. He deserves that and I still believe he can do it.<br /><br />Players don’t start by dreaming about how much money they can earn, they think how good can I be? Unfortunately, he was told he was going to be the best they have ever been at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and he didn’t handle that very well. <b>[Paul]</b> <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> got told that and they got rid of him. There were questions on his attitude. The pressure is on him and he could be the best. I want Ravel to enjoy the game as it has been a pressure for him all his life. I think he is brilliant at football, he is a genius at it but only if he enjoys what he does. I don’t think I would have enjoyed trying to be Man United’s best player ever. I don’t think I would have enjoyed the pressure either. I hope he sees that. He has a fantastic coach now in <a href="chris-wilder.html">Wilder</a>. You can’t look back at your life and move forward because you walk into something. He has to look forward and forget all that</p>

  <p><b>[Ian Holloway claims that the European Union is to blame for the controversial new handball rule in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> For me it doesn’t make sense, the handball rule. If it’s not handball for both, how can you assess that? And to be fair, is that clear and obvious? They forgot the most important thing of all. Their job is to not re-referee the game but to be clear and obvious, so I don’t think that’s our boys making up that new change of law. I think that’s people telling us what we need to do with our game, now they should stop doing that<br /><br />I hope we get out, Brexit, because that’s what people are voting for and sort that out because you cannot have someone telling us how to do our own game</p>

  <p><b>[Ian Holloway has sought to clarify his controversial comments linking the introduction of the new handball rule to English football to the United Kingdom’s impending exit from the European Union]</b> People don’t listen. What I’ve said, and I can say it very clearly, is I’m sick and fed up of being told what to do by people who aren’t running our country. <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> and <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> have brought these rules in, they told us we’ve got to use VAR that I’ve got no problem with, but that handball rule that they’ve made up, I don’t want to listen to them. That’s nonsensical. It’s just in the same way that I’m sick and fed up of us in the UK being told what to do by the EU.<br /><br />Brexit is nothing to do with the football rules, is it? I’m not that stupid, so I suggest people wash their ears out and listen. What I’m saying is, as an English person, I’m sick and fed up of being told what we’ve got to do. Our country is fantastic. If you let us make our own rules up, do what we want to do, we’ll be in control of it a lot better. I don’t like <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> and I don’t like <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> telling us what we should do in our English football game. We should take control of our own game, then that wouldn’t have happened. We should give the referee an earpiece, so he can explain to the crowd what’s happened with VAR, and we should get rid of that handball rule when you’re checking for goals. It’s unfair and it doesn’t sit well in football<br /><br /><b>[Holloway went on to claim that he feels Brexit should be a springboard for English football to have autonomy to dictate its own rules away from <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> and <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>]</b> As for Brexit, that’s totally different. All I’m saying is I’m sick and fed up of our Prime Minister and other parties arguing over something we (Leave voters) all voted for and we all want them to produce for us, whether it’s a no deal or not. That’s what I’m sick and fed up with. Let’s get out and stop the EU dictating to us what we can do. I feel exactly the same with <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> and <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> over our football - I think the English FA should have more power and we should believe in ourselves, and I believe the EFL should have more power rather than <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> telling them what to do. People who listen, I would suggest they actually listen to all of it and stop going off on a tangent. I know exactly what I meant and what I said. I’m sick and fed up, like a lot of people in this country, of being told what to do by people outside our country. In politics, and in football, particularly with <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> and <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> changing the rules</p>
