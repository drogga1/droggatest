  <p><b>[Poirier address his fans on Monday, by thanking everyone for their support and arguing that he was ‘down but not out’]</b> Didn’t get the result I wanted Saturday. This is what happens sometimes when you’re chasing greatness. I gave this my all. I’m down but not out. Thank you to everyone for the kind messages and support. It means the world to me. This one really hurts. It’s a hurt that im <b>[sic]</b> very familiar with…</p>

  <p><b>[Just to get to <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>, Dustin Poirier had to beat three former and one current UFC champion]</b> If I go out there and stop Nurmagomedov, then I am the best lightweight fighter to ever strap on a pair of four-ounce gloves. Simple and plain<br /><br />What I’ve had to go through to get to this point. And then the guy I am fighting <b>[<a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>]</b>, the undefeated champion. Maybe someone who has never lost a round. That’s like a Rocky movie. When I go out there and beat Khabib, it’s not a question of am I the best UFC lightweight? It’s a question of am I the best lightweight to ever fight in mixed martial arts with the run I’m on. Max Holloway, Anthony Pettis, Eddie Alvarez, <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>, winning over those guys in a row in main events, over and over, that’s the best run in lightweight history<br /><br />Now I feel I am a much better a fighter, a much better person. And with every year I become older, but my mind changes in a good way. Religion helps me get through. And my parents</p>

  <p><b>[Few are tipping Poirier for the upset, but the man himself is full of confidence]</b> I’m mentally ready for 25 minutes of bleeding and sweating and being uncomfortable. The fans can expect me to put <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> in positions you haven’t see him in. And to hurt him</p>
