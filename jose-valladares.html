  <p><b>[All you need to know about Honduras U-17]</b> It is going to be a heavy load but we will give every young player an opportunity. We are not going to focus on the outcomes of the games in Spain because we have to get positive results in India.<br /><br />We know that the preparations and the facilities are not the same but we look forward to it. We hope to get past the group stages<br /><br /><b>[On Carlos Mejia]</b> Carlos Mejia is improving and now we are just waiting for him to get in shape. We are preparing him little by little and I hope he can reach the World Cup in good conditions</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Valladares, Honduras’ coach was left flustered at the scoreline]</b> It was a disastrous game for us. We have to reflect on what happened. We knew about two moves of Japan but couldn’t stop them. We will analyze our strength and weakness and come back better next game.<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether he’d been surprised by Japan’s strengths]</b> Actually a bit of both. Japan played exceptionally well. We were surprised by the game they played. Surprised by our mistakes as well. We had due chances but couldn’t capitalise on them<br /><br /><b>[Optimistic as they may come, the Honduran coach concluded ahead of his side’s ties against France and New Caledonia]</b> We saw the game and will analyze their mistakes but we have two more opportunities two more games to come</p>
