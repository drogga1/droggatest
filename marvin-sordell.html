  <p><b>[Marvin Sordell says I always struggled with my mental health in football]</b> I found the industry tough at times because you have so many ups and downs in such a short space of time. But, as men do, we bottle it up and continue. That’s something I did for years and years until I got to a point where I attempted suicide. There were things that I had never really addressed and it was some time before I did. I had always struggled with my mental health in football. I had depression in the earlier stages of my career but I found that some people had extremely archaic views towards it. I still think some people have that old-school mentality of ‘get on with it’ or ‘man up’. The places I enjoyed the game the most were Coventry and <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> but beyond those two clubs, it was just my career and job. I changed clubs very often and yet still I found myself in a place where I didn’t understand why I wasn’t happy. When I took a step back and looked for the one common denominator, it was football. I didn’t enjoy being a professional football player anymore. I felt like the industry and my experiences pushed me away from the game that I loved. It was the industry as a whole that didn’t work for me or make me happy. So, I decided to walk away. It wasn’t about money. It wasn’t about football itself either because I still love the game. But if I had continued to be a professional footballer, then I wouldn’t have been happy and I might have resented football, which I didn’t want either. There are a lot of sacrifices people don’t see that you have to make. You have to put your own sense of worth and values aside at times for what people are telling you to do. You get pushed a lot and it can chip away at you over time. You take a lot of knocks and some people in the game can build you back up. But any person who makes it takes a lot of knocks. It isn’t all glitz and glamour; there is a lot more to it.<br /><br /><b>[Sordell believes that the <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> striker should be commended for his honesty and sparking a much-needed debate over the safety protocol]</b> Troy is under a lot of pressure to go back. There’s no two ways about it. From the media to the clubs to the government - it is clear to see the pressure over coming back. With Troy, fair play, he is very honest and he is being attacked for that honesty. He isn’t saying others shouldn’t go back but just giving his own personal perspective and his point of view. That’s something only he can do and he should be respected. You need to respect both the people who need to go back and the people who don’t want to play. Both choices should be equally fine and it shouldn’t have to even be public. It is a health issue between a workplace and its employees. Of course, because the football industry is under so much pressure at the moment, it doesn’t allow it to happen. You have to respect what people want to do with their lives. How clubs handle it is up to them, a lot of people have opinions on whether these people should be paid or not but that’s a conversation for the individual and the player. I don’t think it is for the public to have an opinion on. I am happy to see his upward curve and how well he has done. He is a <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> legend and the fact he has been able to be himself, it is not easy to be yourself, in the public eye and the fact he has done that is massive. Credit to him for staying true to who he is.<br /><br />He has rightly stood up for himself when he was getting attacked, attacked and attacked by a lot of the media in the UK. I think, firstly, it is fair play to him for getting through that because a lot of people would have found it a difficult thing to face</p>
