<blockquote>
  <p>[Claudio Echeverri, an 11-year-old River Plate youngster, scored four goals against Juventus in a youth tournament and surprised the world with his abilities] At that age, I did the things he is doing or even better. But loads of things happened and I don’t know… I don’t know what to say.<br /><br />There was no margin for error, but I ended up erring.<br /><br />The first time I played at San Siro, it was a qualifying game for Milan against Juventus. There were 70,000 people there. I was great. At the age of 11, I thought a lot quicker with the ball than other players. They simply couldn’t do it<br /><br />[At the age of 14, he was set to sign permanently with the Serie A side, but everything went wrong. His entourage asked Milan for something more than food and a place to live - and the deal broke down] We did everything wrong. The decisions my father took were a mistake. Going to Italy at such a young age was bad… I never had problems with alcohol, drugs or bad behaviour… but perhaps I needed some psychological help, or more help from my parents. And we made mistakes<br /><br />At 11, I was more famous than Messi. I would go out on the pitch and there were 2,000 people there to see me. At 12, people took pictures with me, they didn’t let me walk down the street in peace… here and there. I felt the pressure to show [my talent] and I needed special care to get my head right<br /><br />With Messi we played against each other in training. We were very similar at that time. With Newell’s, we went on a tour to Peru, with the ‘87 and ‘88 teams. Messi couldn’t go, so I played in my team and in the older team. And often I played even better with the older players…<br /><br />Of course it’s fun… if your head is right. Why wouldn’t it be? You play football, train for three hours a day and you get paid a lot. But at my level it’s something different, obviously. Because you still train for three hours, but if in Primera they pay you 100, here you get two… and you have to pray to Jesus just to get paid at all…</p>
