<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Stewart Downing was man of the match when Liverpool lifted the trophy six years ago]</b> I remember that day well. It meant so much to the players and to Kenny <b>[Dalglish]</b> because when you’re at a club like Liverpool, you’re judged on what you win. You’re proud to play for the club, but if you can win a trophy then you’re adding your name to a long list of winners. That means something. We had a difficult season in the league, but the cups were good to us. We made hard work of the League Cup final, but we got over the line, and we felt we should have won the FA Cup later in the season too.<br /><br />Very surprised. They’ve spent a lot of money in that time, as well. Brendan <b>[Rodgers]</b> had a good go and came close to winning the league, and obviously they have had the finals under Jurgen Klopp too. But when you look at the calibre of players that have been at the club in that time, I can’t believe they haven’t been able to get a trophy. I’m sure there will be silverware in the not-too-distant future under Klopp though. He’s the kind of manager players want to play for</p>
