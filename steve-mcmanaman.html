We went out for a meal. I couldn’t speak Spanish but I had to get up and sing a song. That was my initiation. It was very funny because Rob Jones was over visiting and I said ‘we’re all going out tonight, do you want to come?’<br /><br />So we all went out, the whole team, and he was with me. I got up and sang - I can’t remember what it was, probably The Beatles or something - and they didn’t have a clue what I was saying<br /><br />Then they turned to Rob Jones and said ‘right, now it’s your turn!’, So he had to get up and sing as well!<br /><br />We very rarely went out as a team to be honest, it was mainly something we’d do at the start of the season. But Rob came over the next time and ended up out with us again! That was my initiation, to sing a song with Rob<br /><br /><b>[Steve McManaman talks about growing up watching <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>]</b> I was at the very famous game where Glen Keeley got sent off and <a href="ian-rush.html">Ian Rush</a> scored. <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> got beat by five at Goodison, and I’m sat bereft as an <a href="everton-fc.html">Evertonian</a> in the Gwladys Street - a junior <a href="everton-fc.html">Evertonian</a> thinking ‘what’s just gone on there?!’. I knew I was going to school on the Monday, I would be getting taunted. That’s how it was<br /><br />But thankfully I went through that age of 84, 85, 86. Peter Reid, Bracewell, winning <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup, the league, the Cup Winners’ Cup. I was a teenager going to watch that great team, with Sheedy and Trevor Steven and Sharpy and <a href="andy-gray.html">Andy Gray</a>. I was one of the lucky few, to be able to really appreciate that. How lucky was I?<br /><br />For the 1984 FA Cup final against <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>, I went with my Dad to Wembley. Things don’t get better than that - to go to Wembley and watch your team win, singing songs with my Dad and his mates as a 12-year-old they don’t get better!

They had <a href="john-barnes.html">John Barnes</a>, I cleaned his boots, Ronnie Whelan, <a href="steve-nicol.html">Steve Nicol</a>, <a href="alan-hansen.html">Alan Hansen</a>. To learn from those people, I had the greatest teachers in the world<br /><br />And they weren’t arrogant, they just wanted to win.

That’s what’s on the wall! You’ve never arrived until you’ve added to the club’s history. You’re never as good as what’s gone on before you!<br /><br /><b>[Steve McManaman talks about leaving <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> It wasn’t financial, because the money <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> offered me to stay was virtually on a par. I wanted to leave. At that time I had never played in the Champions League, which was a huge thing. I was playing really good football and I needed to test myself. I felt that I needed to go. I wanted to go abroad, I didn’t want to play for somebody against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I was playing good football and I had the right kind of clubs interested in me - <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, Madrid and Juventus<br /><br />I nearly went to Italy. I was taking Italian lessons that year, I’d spoken to <a href="ian-rush.html">Ian Rush</a> and <a href="david-platt.html">David Platt</a>. But December/January came around, and Madrid were interested. They were European Champions, World Champions, they were the best team in the world.

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah is enjoying one of the greatest debut seasons ever]</b> <b>[It is]</b> one of the greatest debut seasons ever. I think everybody concurs with that. I don’t think we knew nine months ago, when he arrived and played his first game for Liverpool, that he’d be as successful as he has been. He has blown everybody away, hasn’t he? <b>[It’s down to]</b> his style of finishing, his type of finishing and his composure in front of goal. Personally, I’d seen him a few times so I knew he was a really good player. I thought he’d be a really good addition to Liverpool’s squad and team - but even I didn’t expect him to have the impact he’s had this year.</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale is happy in Real Madrid and likely to stick around to fight for his future]</b> Knowing the player and some close people to him, I can say that he is happy in Real Madrid. His future will only depend on him, and the final of the Champions League may be decisive for his future. He is happy, but he is not getting enough time of play. He didn’t start against Juventus and didn’t play the first game against Bayern Munich, so that may influence him, but his lifestyle in Madrid is lovely and he is playing for the greatest club in the world.<br /><br />Salah has the quality to play for Real Madrid, but he has only spent nine months in Liverpool and he should repeat his current form for many seasons to confirm himself. I don’t see him in Real Madrid soon<br /><br /><b>[On Champions League final clash between Liverpool and Real Madrid]</b> It’ll be a very tough game for both teams, but Liverpool is in a better form and their style is more attractive. Real Madrid is more experienced though and they won the last two Champions Leagues, and that will be an advantage for them. It’ll be a very entertaining game for sure</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool are looking for an alternative to Nabil Fekir]</b> The fact that he’s looking at that position suggests that he wants someone. So I presume he’ll try and find a replacement. A number 10 type player. When Coutinho went, I know they haven’t missed him because the front three have played so well, but I think it showed that if one of them gets injured they certainly need back up. They’ve got <b>[Adam]</b> Lallana, but the fact they’re looking at that position, an eight or a 10, shows where Jurgen wants to bring somebody in.<br /><br />I think Jurgen will look at the goalkeeper position, definitely. The fact there’s been so many rumours about <b>[Jan]</b> Oblak, Alisson, <b>[Thibaut]</b> Courtois, whoever it is, I think it’s an area they have been looking at and will be looking at. Anywhere you can spend on the team right through - central defenders, he’s bought midfielders, wants a number 10, that spine of the team, I think managers will look at players who are available and if they can improve the team you have to look at it to be honest</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo is edging closer to completing a remarkable switch to Juventus]</b> They <b>[Real Madrid]</b> might be sick and tired of what Cristiano’s said. To come out and say what he did right after the Champions League final is uncalled for isn’t it? It’s the wrong point. It’s as if you don’t care about your team and you shouldn’t say things like that.<br /><br />I’m astounded that Juventus can even contemplate on doing a deal like this and paying the money that he wants because <b>[Gianluigi]</b> Buffon’s just retired, <b>[Giorgio]</b> Chiellini’s in his late 30s, <b>[Andrea]</b> Barzagli’s in his late 30s - they need to rebuild their team<br /><br />Sami Khedira had a really disappointing World Cup, there’s talk of <b>[Gonzalo]</b> Higuain leaving, talk of Alex Sandro leaving. If they do leave, they need a hell of a lot of money to rebuild their squad so that they can be Serie A champions. Throw Cristiano in the mix, the wages he gets and the baggage he has, it’s going to be interesting watching Juventus next year<br /><br /><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo wants out of Madrid as he longer feels loved by a club]</b> He is well loved in Madrid. He’s absolutely adored. He’s just won a third Champions League in a row for the team. As much as he was sort of a bit-part player for the first time in a final - he’s won five Champions Leagues - to declare that you’re not loved is complete bonkers</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool legend Steve McManaman believes modern day footballers need to learn how to accept criticism]</b> I don’t think what they call the old school style of management is redundant, but players have changed and maybe managers and coaching staff have to adapt to that. Footballers are more fragile than they used to be, there is no doubt about that, but I still feel there is a place in game for a good telling off when the moment is right. We see managers like Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola and they appear to have found the perfect balance between having the players under control and getting a good rapport with them. That is obviously going to be easier when you are winning games most week and what we saw in the recent documentary looking behind the scenes at Man City was that Guardiola can scream and shout with the best of them. I’m sure Klopp does the same when the time is right and the Liverpool players all seem to be enjoying working in his set-up. Then you look at someone like Jose Mourinho at Manchester United and he has a slightly different approach. He is more open in his criticism of players at times, but I don’t have a problem with that. I never minded a manager moaning and shouting at me as long as it was constructive and 99 per cent of the time, he was right and I appreciated the need to improve. I also knew my team-mates and my father would tell me I had played badly and that would make me even more disappointed. I never saw criticism or being shouted at as bullying<br /><br />What we have seen with Keane and the way he dealt with Arter seems to be taking things over the top. The trouble in the Keane/Arter situation is it happened in an international camp and Keane is only the assistant manager. He only sees Arter for a few days every two or three months over the course of a year with Ireland, so to chastise him for not training seems harsh when he doesn’t know him too well. When you work with players every day, you understand what makes them tick, but a new element has come into this because shouting abuse at people is now viewed as a form of bullying. I was a Scouser playing for Liverpool when I came into the game and I could take any criticism that came my way, but not everyone has a thick skin and can accept it. Also, Keane and Martin O’Neill worked in the game in a previous era when this kind of treatment was considered to be the norm, so they are still working to those rules. Every dressing room has a different of characters. Managers are paid the big bucks to evaluate the right way to get the best out of each player and not everyone will respond well to being shouted at every day</p>

  <p><b>[Steve McManaman believes England’s Premier League big-hitters are the teams to beat in this season’s Champions League]</b> When I look around Europe now, I believe the English teams are the strongest once again. The Premier League clubs are finally ready to break this cycle of Spanish domination and I firmly believe they are ready to do that this season.<br /><br />I expect all the English teams to get out of their groups this season, even if Tottenham face the biggest test with Barcelona and Inter Milan in their path, and the reason why I’m so confident is that all the odds are now stacked in the favour of the Premier League quartet. The two Manchester clubs, Liverpool and Tottenham teams have big squads that have been together for some time, with none of them needing to sell star players as they merely add quality to their ranks every summer and get stronger and stronger. They have huge finances behind them with the television money bigger for the English clubs than all the other teams in Europe and it means they are now looking like teams that will have too much for the rest of the Champions League. In the past, English clubs often lost their best players to rivals with more money or prestige, but that is not the case any more, as the Premier League is the place to be both in terms of the football and the finances. So I believe we could now be in for a period where the English clubs emerge as the teams to beat in the Champions League once again. We had that for a spell when Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United were getting in semi-finals and finals every year, but English clubs lost their way for five years or so before Liverpool’s run to the final last season<br /><br />Manchester City deserve to be recognised as the favourites, but Liverpool have a bit of a sign over them and I believe Klopp’s side are strong contenders for the Champions League once again. Liverpool fully deserved to be in last season’s final against Real Madrid in Kiev and while they came up short for one reason and another, they showed what they are capable of in knock-out competition in the second half of last season. They should now be aiming to be quarter-finalists, semi-finalists every single year in the Champions League and that level of consistency is well within their grasp. If you keep knocking on the door of that competition, eventually your moment will come and that is what Klopp and his players have to believe. Success in the Champions League can be dependant on the draw you get and Liverpool got a few breaks on that score last season as they got to the final. While they did well to beat Manchester City in the quarter-finals last season, they got Porto and Roma in the knock-out stages and they were very good draws when they could have been paired against Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus or Bayern Munich. That is the kind of break you need in this competition because there are draws out there that are basally 50/50 matches that could go either way. If Liverpool are drawn against Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-finals in April, it is a game that will be decided by one moment of magic on either side and the one thing Liverpool have got going for them is that they have those magic players to make it happen<br /><br /><b>[On Barcelona]</b> Barcelona have strengthened and look like a team that could be competitive this season. When you have Lionel Messi in your side anything is possible and outside of the English teams, Barca would be my pick to go all the way<br /><br /><b>[On Real Madrid]</b> It was a strange summer for my old club as they lost Cristiano Ronaldo and didn’t replace him with a new superstar. That is one of the main reasons why I say I’d be very surprised if they got to another Champions League final again and won it for a fourth year in a row<br /><br /><b>[On Bayern Munich]</b> I have felt they were in need of a freshen up for some time now and while they have a new coach in Nico Kovac, they don’t really have the new blood in their team that suggests they can win the Champions League this season<br /><br /><b>[On Juventus]</b> We are all fascinated to see what Cristiano’s presence does to Juve. He will undoubtedly strengthen them, but will it be enough to see them win the Champions League? I doubt it<br /><br /><b>[On Manchester United]</b> Jose Mourinho has a proven record of success and he can find a way to win trophies when you least expect it. Some Man United fans might not like his style of football, but they will not be complaining if they are watching their team in a Champions League final next May. It is unlikely, but not impossible<br /><br /><b>[On Manchester City]</b> They are the favourites for me. The dominant way they won the Premier League was evidence of their undoubted quality and by adding Riyad Mahrez and having Benjamin Mendy back from injury, they are the team to beat</p>

You don’t want to go into the last game needing to beat Napoli or Napoli needing a draw or anything like that. We know how good the Italians are defensively.

Losing to Napoli in the way they did and then tonight, not even getting a point just to set themselves a little further forward. They’ve really put themselves in a bad position in the group.</p>

I’m very Florentino! Four Champions Leagues in five years, three of them in a row. Now he has brought Zizou back. How can I not be in favour of the man who makes these things possible? I just point to the reasons why this year has been so bad. Anyone could see the consequences of letting Cristiano go without seeking a replacement. But I have no problem with Florentino.

When the intensity is high and people are playing for places, you may get away with a tackle or a pull of the shirt and people get frustrated, it happens all the time.

You’d love them to go and buy a superstar but when has <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> gone out and bought a superstar that was at the tip of everyone’s tongue? <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a> and <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, at the time, were signings that came out of left-field to a certain extent. You never know with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, they’ve done a great job in the past with signings and maybe they’ve got one up their sleeve for the summer.<br /><br /><b>[McManaman is not overly concerned about having seen <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> turn their back on Werner]</b> It wasn’t a surprise for me. I spoke about <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> a month ago. I think he’s a great player and can improve to be a better player, like with <a href="kai-havertz.html">Kai Havertz</a>, but if they joined <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> now they wouldn’t get into the starting XI. That’s a major problem when you’re shelling out £50, 60, 70m for a superstar player in Germany, you can’t then bring them to your team and put them onto the bench for half a season. I think he’s a really good player and a great goalscorer and he’ll suit <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> because of the forward options they’ve got at the moment. They’re crying out for a <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> to be very honest. He might not get into <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>’s team, so he’s not one for them and I think it’s exactly the same for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I think we just put Werner with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> because of <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, that’s all it was. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s said nice things about the players but he would do as a manager as his record speaks for itself</p>

  <p><b>[Steve McManaman says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will be looking to smash <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> points record]</b> Their league record is phenomenal. Great teams go on to win them again and be serial winners, but in a one-off season, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will go down as the best really. It’s a great game first up. It’s a derby match so they’ll have to be at it straight away, they’ll have to hit the ground running. And I think they will now say ‘we’ve got nine games left, we want to beat <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s record’<br /><br />It’ll be fantastic when it happens but the fans are not going to be there. Further down the line, the fans will be allowed in, they can celebrate properly then and have a parade round the city. But you saw the reaction of the fans when <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> brought home the Champions League. If they win the league after 30 years, they will celebrate, but it won’t be the same as being at the ground and celebrating with the team</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> player Steve McManaman has said that he is delighted that he is not seeing much of the club’s academy players because it is evidence that they are thriving]</b> When I see some of the players who are excelling at the Academy, there’s nothing better than not seeing them again. I mean that in the nicest way because they move up to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a>, and I love it when I don’t see them again because it means they’re at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a> and they’re excelling at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a>. There’s nothing better for these younger players with talent to play with better players, to play with players who are at the top of the game. If you’ve got anything about yourself and if you want to be a first-team player in the future, you should be able to improve so much by playing with the best players in the world - and that’s who <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have got at the moment. I love the fact that Leighton and Jake are there, <a href="neco-williams.html">Neco Williams</a> is there and <a href="curtis-jones.html">Curtis Jones</a> has, of course, been there a while, like a number of the older ones. But whenever they disappear to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a> and hold their own, that means they’re improving, that means they’re getting better</p>
