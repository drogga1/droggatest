  <p><b>[Steve McManaman recounts his initiation ceremony at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> following his move from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> in 1999]</b> I found the dressing room at Madrid quite normal. We went out for a meal. I couldn’t speak Spanish but I had to get up and sing a song. That was my initiation. It was very funny because Rob Jones was over visiting and I said ‘we’re all going out tonight, do you want to come?’<br /><br />So we all went out, the whole team, and he was with me. I got up and sang - I can’t remember what it was, probably The Beatles or something - and they didn’t have a clue what I was saying<br /><br />Then they turned to Rob Jones and said ‘right, now it’s your turn!’, So he had to get up and sing as well!<br /><br />We very rarely went out as a team to be honest, it was mainly something we’d do at the start of the season. But Rob came over the next time and ended up out with us again! That was my initiation, to sing a song with Rob<br /><br /><b>[Steve McManaman talks about growing up watching Everton]</b> I was at the very famous game where Glen Keeley got sent off and <a href="ian-rush.html">Ian Rush</a> scored. <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> got beat by five at Goodison, and I’m sat bereft as an Evertonian in the Gwladys Street - a junior Evertonian thinking ‘what’s just gone on there?!’. I knew I was going to school on the Monday, I would be getting taunted. That’s how it was<br /><br />But thankfully I went through that age of 84, 85, 86. Peter Reid, Bracewell, winning <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup, the league, the Cup Winners’ Cup. I was a teenager going to watch that great team, with Sheedy and Trevor Steven and Sharpy and <a href="andy-gray.html">Andy Gray</a>. I was one of the lucky few, to be able to really appreciate that. How lucky was I?<br /><br />For the 1984 FA Cup final against <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>, I went with my Dad to Wembley. Things don’t get better than that - to go to Wembley and watch your team win, singing songs with my Dad and his mates as a 12-year-old they don’t get better! It was the best thing ever for me<br /><br /><b>[Steve McManaman talks about learning at Liverpool]</b> I joined <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> at 16, and it was great. They were in their pomp then. They had <a href="john-barnes.html">John Barnes</a>, I cleaned his boots, Ronnie Whelan, <a href="steve-nicol.html">Steve Nicol</a>, <a href="alan-hansen.html">Alan Hansen</a>. To learn from those people, I had the greatest teachers in the world<br /><br />And they weren’t arrogant, they just wanted to win. Whether it was <a href="kenny-dalglish.html">Kenny Dalglish</a> or Roy Evans or Ronnie Moran, they’d win and it’d be like ‘right, forget about that, let’s go and win again’. They taught me the most incredible values. To train, to play, to mix with these players as an apprentice and then join them as a professional they taught me everything about football<br /><br />When you play for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, the history is all around you. It’s not about winning a youth cup or a reserve league or a game on a Saturday for the first team. It’s <a href="kenny-dalglish.html">Kenny Dalglish</a> scoring against Bruges, or Phil Neal in Rome, <a href="graeme-souness.html">Graeme Souness</a>, <a href="phil-thompson.html">Phil Thompson</a>, Emlyn Hughes lifting European Cups. That’s what’s on the wall! You’ve never arrived until you’ve added to the club’s history. You’re never as good as what’s gone on before you!<br /><br /><b>[Steve McManaman talks about leaving Liverpool]</b> It wasn’t financial, because the money <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> offered me to stay was virtually on a par. I wanted to leave. At that time I had never played in the Champions League, which was a huge thing. I was playing really good football and I needed to test myself. I felt that I needed to go. I wanted to go abroad, I didn’t want to play for somebody against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I was playing good football and I had the right kind of clubs interested in me - <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, Madrid and Juventus<br /><br />I nearly went to Italy. I was taking Italian lessons that year, I’d spoken to <a href="ian-rush.html">Ian Rush</a> and <a href="david-platt.html">David Platt</a>. But December/January came around, and Madrid were interested. They were European Champions, World Champions, they were the best team in the world. That white kit, Di Stefano, Puskas, all that. And so it was Madrid<br /><br /><b>[Steve McManaman talks about the difference between <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and Real Madrid]</b> At <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, especially towards the end of my career there, I always felt that the onus was on me to make things happen. Whereas at Madrid, we had seven players who could do that!<br /><br />It was easy to settle in, it was just easy to get the ball, pass it to someone in a better position than you and invariably someone would produce a little bit of magic. If it was <a href="luis-figo.html">Figo</a>’s turn to do the magic, he would. If it wasn’t then it was <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zizou</a>’s turn, or <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>’s turn or Raul’s turn. It was the way it was</p>

  <p><b>[Steve McManaman says <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> cannot find an XI he can rely on with a 3-0 defeat at Paris Saint-Germain]</b> It’s disappointing to lose 3-0. The goalkeeper was poor, certainly for the first goal. Madrid had numerous chances that they missed. <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> had a nice goal disallowed because it was accidental handball which they would say was harsh. But under the new rules, that is considered a foul. But they’ve got big problems, Madrid. They’ve got an abundance of superstars in their squad. I went through the team and it’s incredible. Yet they cannot find an XI that they can rely on and play well<br /><br />He keeps going back to <a href="casemiro.html">Casemiro</a>, <a href="luka-modric.html">Luka Modric</a>, <a href="toni-kroos.html">Toni Kroos</a>. That midfield three, and with respect to them, their best days were three of four years ago. Now they’re 32, 33, 34, and they need to refresh it very, very quickly. Tonight they had <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>, <a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a> and <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> up front and they need to do more for them</p>

  <p><b>[Steve McManaman says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are better than Madrid right now]</b> Is <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> ahead of <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>? Yes, right now it is. Because when you are playing well in England, for example, there are clubs in Spain that want those players. But now we are lucky because the best clubs are in England. So you don’t need to play in <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, for example, because the best teams are <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans are very happy with the <b>[Mane-Firmino-Salah]</b> trident. Right now <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are stronger than <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, Madrid or <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, but you need a bit of luck when you play in the Champions League.

But speaking right now, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> are Europe’s best clubs<br /><br /><b>[McManaman believes that while there have been memorable games for the Reds over their long history, that win might just top the lot]</b> There have been fantastic nights: when you lose 3-0 at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> and you play at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> without Salah and without <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> and you win 4-0 in a crazy, incredible atmosphere. I think it is one of the greatest nights in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> history, and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have lots of history, but that night against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> was very special</p>

  <p><b>[Steve McManaman says The <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> and <a href="joe-gomez.html">Joe Gomez</a> row which marred England’s preparations for a Euro 2020 qualifying clash with Montenegro blew over in 10 seconds]</b> To be honest, there are always clashes in training - when you live and play football every single day, there’s always heated incidents on the training ground. When the intensity is high and people are playing for places, you may get away with a tackle or a pull of the shirt and people get frustrated, it happens all the time. To me it was nothing; it was over in 10 seconds, both the players were fine and I was actually there on the day it happened at the hotel and it was quite relaxed afterwards<br /><br />I thought it was absolutely ridiculous what happened with <a href="joe-gomez.html">Joe Gomez</a> being booed at Wembley, but that is just part of what happens when a story gets out - people start taking one side or the other. In the world we live in now, it’s physically impossible to keep anything quiet anymore, and I think that’s the sad thing about it. I don’t think <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> necessarily has to give him any backing by starting him against Crystal Palace on Saturday. I think if everyone is fit, he will probably go with the team that beat <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, and if Joe plays it will be because he is a fantastic player - that’s all<br /><br />I think <a href="alex-oxlade-chamberlain.html">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> has been brilliant over the past month or so when he’s been given more time to play. I have no idea if he will start in the European Championships with England, but he deserves to be there, because his form is excellent. I thought he was brilliant last week in the Champions League for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, his performances are improving the more he stays fit, so I do hope he gets himself into the England squad for the upcoming European Championships.<br /><br />In terms of getting into the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> side on a permanent basis, their starting XI seems pretty settled at the moment when everybody’s fit and well, but of course we know in December that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have 10 games as well as going to Qatar for the World Club Cup, so everybody will get a chance to play and a chance to perform well. At the moment, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s starting XI deserves to be where it is because they’re in magnificent form</p>

  <p><b>[Steve McManaman says <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> too good for China if <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> adventure is over]</b> I don’t think his time is up, but he’s had six years there so it all depends on whether he wants to leave. If he does want to leave, then I’d love it if he came back to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I wouldn’t want him to go to China, because he’s too good a footballer. I’d love to see him back, showing the people of England just how good he still is. I know the situation in Madrid and I know that most of what we read in England is nonsense, because sometimes we’re obsessed with getting our players back in the Premier League<br /><br /><b>[Bale was jeered - not for the first time - by certain sections of the Madrid support when making a return to domestic action against Alaves]</b> Well I knew that the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> fans were going to boo him and take exception to it. I just thought it was a bit of a laugh and a joke really, but it was probably just ill-timed. The fact they had qualified and somebody has come out with the flag and done it, I don’t think Gareth was particularly bothered about it.<br /><br />I know as an ex-player, that your team-mates won’t be bothered about it. <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a> isn’t going to care about it, but of course fans are very precious about their own club. Because Gareth probably isn’t their favourite player at the moment, he was going to get a more disappointing reaction from the fans. I think Gareth will be fine if I’m being honest. Madrid fans are very fickle fans, they’re happy when things are going well, but they also complain when things aren’t going very well. As long as Gareth plays and he plays well then the fans will support him and of course his team-mates will support him. It’s all about the games and if you win the games, which they have done recently, and he’s playing well, then he will be absolutely fine</p>

  <p><b>[Steve McManaman says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are about a billion pounds away from competing with Manchester City]</b> In about a billion pounds? They need a lot, a lot of work. They need to bring in a number of players, a huge number of players with the quality that can do them justice. A few players are going to leave of course at the end of the season, players who are surplus to requirements, so you’re talking about six or seven players they need to bring in. Three or four are needed anyway, then you also have to replace the number of players who are leaving anyway. They’ve got an absolutely huge job on their hands, they’re going to have to spend a lot of money, they’re going to have to be very savvy and they’re going to have to identify the right players for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>.<br /><br /><a href="edward-woodward.html">Ed Woodward</a> has spent the money, but again there’s that question of who’s actually identifying the players. Who’s the person saying ‘This is the player for us, I believe in them, let’s sign them’? I don’t know whether it’s the manager who’s buying them, or it’s somebody upstairs who’s buying them, but the fans need to know. If the manager is picking the wrong players, then you will have problems. <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> is still out and that’s a blow, <a href="nemanja-matic.html">Nemanja Matic</a> doesn’t seem to be fancied, <a href="juan-mata.html">Juan Mata</a> doesn’t seem to be fancied and they’re coming to the end of their careers, so they’re going to need to be replaced.

I thought he was excellent in the first game, I think he was the one player who dragged Salzburg back into the game and I thought he was really good on Tuesday too. A couple of their players were very good also. I thought Hwang was good up front as well, <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> was okay, he didn’t have his greatest game on Tuesday and he missed a couple of chances, but <a href="takumi-minamino.html">Minamino</a> looked very lively and dangerous. If they’re talking about his buyout clause being £7.25 million, we talk about the prices being paid in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, then it’s an absolute no brainer really to pay that type of money for that type of talent. If he was £100 million then it would be a different conversation, but the fact that he’s the price that they think he is and they think he’s got the attitude that <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> wants then he could be an excellent addition to the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> squad<br /><br /><b>[German tactician is penning fresh terms through to 2024]</b> It’s a big statement actually because it eliminates all the uncertainty of ‘what if?’. I actually think that managerial contracts now are nothing, if Jurgen wants to leave at the end of the season he could probably just leave and retire or do whatever he wants to do, but I think the fact that he signed a new contract until 2024 stops all the uncertainty and all the talk about him leaving in two years or somebody poaching him. I think him signing a new deal until 2024 gives <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> that little bit of security and gives everybody the chance to breathe and plan for the future really knowing that Jurgen’s going to be there and that he certainly wants to be there at this moment in time<br /><br /><b>[He said of the <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a> talk]</b> He loves <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, he’s worked with the academy, he knows everybody, he knows the ethos of the club, so of course that will be the job earmarked for him in the future.

I’ve said for the last three or four years that he’s going to be the best around, but <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are flying at the moment and they don’t necessarily need <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> at this moment in time. They’re going to have to pay £250 million for him. Let’s be honest, that’s what he would cost<br /><br />If <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> cost £198 million, then <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> is going to cost a quarter of a billion. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are the best around at the moment, so if you’re going to take a jump like that then there’s going to be a lot of baggage that comes with that.<br /><br />Not him personally, but the transfer fee itself and that you’re already the best team and you could be upsetting the equilibrium by bringing another big, big forward in, who’s arguably already one of the best in the world, even at this slender age.<br /><br />It’s a lot to consider for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> if they are going to make this jump. It’s a risk. That’s exactly what it is. Have <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> upset their front three this season by bringing in <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Antoine Griezmann</a>? Did <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> do it when <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> and <a href="karim-benzema.html">Karim Benzema</a> were there? I think the happiness of the team is more important than anything and actually the harmony of the front three of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, where you’ve got <a href="divock-origi.html">Divock Origi</a> coming off the bench, to a certain extent it works.<br /><br />We know where everybody stands and we know that people are happy because they want to play every game. We also know that there’s a bigger role in the game and we all know that <a href="divock-origi.html">Origi</a> will play 30 or 40 games this season and he’s not even in the starting XI. Everybody has got their job to play because <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will play 60 games over the course of a season if they go far in the Champions League, so everybody knows that they have to play their part.<br /><br />Bringing in a world-class superstar does upset that. When <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> went to <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, it upset the balance and we all know that and it’s something you have to be very careful about. You have to do your homework, you need to know what else you’re signing as well as just the player. Do you sign a mad agent? Do you sign a mad entourage?<br /><br />However, to stick up for <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a>, all I’ve heard is that his attitude and everything is fantastic and he’s an incredible football player that would make <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s squad better, but you just need to be very careful, firstly with the price tag and secondly the effect it will have on the squad</p>

I think Militao was an excellent central defender at Porto and I think that’s the best time to judge him. I think the change of manager at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> has probably hindered him if I’m being honest, like it’s hindered a lot of their new signings</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> winger Steve McManaman has warned <a href="erling-haland.html">Erling Braut Haaland</a> against joining the Spanish giants this summer]</b> It’s too soon for him to leave <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>. He seems to be happy and more importantly he’s playing regularly and scoring goals. He should stay, he should play and he should get a couple of more years under his belt. He should move when he’s a more experienced player after playing 200 or so games for <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> and playing 20 to 30 games in the Champions League, which he should do. He can’t just go and jump ship and go to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. You’ve seen what’s happened to <a href="luka-jovic.html">Luka Jovic</a> this season, he’s hardly kicked a ball for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> after having a wonderful season last year in Germany. <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> doesn’t need that pressure.

So when I went to Madrid, the faces were different and they spoke a foreign language but the pressure to win trophies was all that mattered. <br /><br />If you had a barren year - the year before they had finished second in the league and hadn’t won any silverware, the pressure was on again for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. You had to achieve. It was quite easy for me. Of course settling in and getting on with your team-mates who all speak a foreign language that you’re trying to learn as quickly as possible, that’s difficult and can be lonely but you have to try your best.</p>

  <p><b>[Steve McManaman denies <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> suffered from problems with mentality]</b> We just had a few more failings certainly than the side now but against the teams back then that just pipped us to the title. You know on our day we could beat the majority of them, we could outplay the majority of them over the season<br /><br />We may have played more attractive football or scored more goals than them but it’s the couple of failings that we had. Maybe our rivals had a better squad or a couple of better players.<br /><br />I don’t think it was a mentality thing or anything like that. It’s just every single year there’s one team that beats everyone else unfortunately and if you don’t get to the top of the mountain then you can’t say you achieved it.<br /><br />That was one thing we all look back on and think were we good enough, we were on our day but over a 38-game period we probably didn’t just have enough.</p>

  <p><b>[Steve McManaman says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s decision not to pursue <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> should come as no surprise]</b> I think it’s going to be difficult this year for teams to spend a lot of money in the current climate. Teams are losing money, we know that, there’s no gate receipts, sponsorship deals will have to be rebated. I don’t think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will have the year they had when they bought Alisson and <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> but I don’t think they actually need that much to challenge again next year. It’s a case of picking and choosing your position, so a very sensible, prudent signing and maybe a couple of younger players joining the squad should suffice. You’d love them to go and buy a superstar but when has <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> gone out and bought a superstar that was at the tip of everyone’s tongue? <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a> and <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, at the time, were signings that came out of left-field to a certain extent. You never know with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, they’ve done a great job in the past with signings and maybe they’ve got one up their sleeve for the summer.<br /><br /><b>[McManaman is not overly concerned about having seen the Reds turn their back on Werner]</b> It wasn’t a surprise for me. I spoke about <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> a month ago. I think he’s a great player and can improve to be a better player, like with <a href="kai-havertz.html">Kai Havertz</a>, but if they joined <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> now they wouldn’t get into the starting XI. That’s a major problem when you’re shelling out £50, 60, 70m for a superstar player in Germany, you can’t then bring them to your team and put them onto the bench for half a season. I think he’s a really good player and a great goalscorer and he’ll suit <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> because of the forward options they’ve got at the moment. They’re crying out for a <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> to be very honest. He might not get into <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>’s team, so he’s not one for them and I think it’s exactly the same for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I think we just put Werner with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> because of <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, that’s all it was. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s said nice things about the players but he would do as a manager as his record speaks for itself</p>

I mean that in the nicest way because they move up to Melwood, and I love it when I don’t see them again because it means they’re at Melwood and they’re excelling at Melwood. There’s nothing better for these younger players with talent to play with better players, to play with players who are at the top of the game.
