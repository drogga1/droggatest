  <p><b>[How <a href="porto-fc.html">Porto</a>, <a href="costinha.html">Costinha</a> &amp; Howard helped create ‘The Special One’]</b> When we drew Man United, I remember Jose said to us, ‘Let the shark come,’. There was no fear factor that I remember and we won the first game 2-1 with two goals from <a href="benni-mccarthy.html">Benni McCarthy</a>. However, we went to Manchester knowing it would be tough. But the pressure was on them: they expected to go all the way to the final and to lose would be a disaster for such an iconic organisation. Probably 95 per cent of people thought Man United would find a way through, given they were the better and more experienced team. They had players like <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a>, <a href="ruud-van-nistelrooy.html">Ruud van Nistelrooy</a> and <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>. They were superstars of the highest level who could beat any team in the world. But Keane was sent off in Portugal, so we knew he would be missed in the second leg. We knew we had a chance<br /><br /><b>[Belief only grew after the 1-1 draw at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> that saw <a href="porto-fc.html">Porto</a> progress to the quarter-finals 3-2 on aggregate]</b> When I think about that game, I just remember the last few minutes because it felt like an eternity. We knew Man United were strong at the end of matches, always scoring in injury time and they went all out. But we stayed strong, managed not to concede and qualified for the next round. We knew then, after beating United, that we could beat anyone. It was at that point that everyone was sure we would get to the final<br /><br />No doubt, it was a life-changing moment in his career. I don’t know if he would have ended up there without winning that Champions League title. At the time, he was just a young manager of a club that was not widely known. We weren’t even a favourite in the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Cup the year before! But under <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> we won every European title possible and that’s why he attracted the attention of the big clubs. He did that not only through his success on the field but also through his interaction with media and television. His personality became very attractive to teams.<br /><br />When he was at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, he left me tickets at the box office with a note inside. It was a drawing of him making the movement down the touchline at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> and he wrote ‘You made everybody stronger that night’</p>
