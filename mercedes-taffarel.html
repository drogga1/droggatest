<blockquote>
  <p>[Emiliano Sala’s mother slams Cardiff ‘disrespect’ as she calls for justice] Emiliano signed in front of the press, in front of everyone, so they have to pay. Do I see this as a sign of disrespect towards my family? Yes, I think so. It would have been different if he had not really signed. Of course, they are also conducting their own investigation to find out what happened, that seems logical to me, but they must honour their word. His signature cannot be rubbed out. I am angry, yes, that is certain. They did not take care of him. A player worth that much money… they did not take care of him like he deserved.<br /><br />The enquiry is ongoing. I think at some point from now until the end of the year we will know what happened. We have to be confident. I want justice for Emiliano. Therefore I have to have confidence. We are waiting to understand why and how he died. In what circumstances did he die? Is it the fault of negligence by the airport? The pilot? The agent? I simply want justice for my son. The truth. Let justice determine whether there has been negligence, if someone had made a mistake and has to pay. We have talked about a lot of things. People said that one pilot did not show up and another came in his place, and so on. These are questions that we have asked to the British police. These are questions to which we still have no answers</p>
