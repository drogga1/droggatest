  <p><b>[Andre Gray says <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> remains one of the Premier League’s best]</b> People talk about <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> and it annoys me. Whenever I’ve played against <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, four or five times now, no-one can get near him. He might not set the world on fire and score top-corner goals. But you cannot get near the kid - he’s always somewhere you’re not and you can’t fathom it. Until you’re on the pitch with him, you’ll never understand. From the stands it’s like ‘oh, he’s turned him’. When you play the game and understand the midfield positions, you cannot fathom him</p>

  <p><b>[Watford investigate after claims Andre Gray breached lockdown rules with gathering]</b> <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> Football Club is aware of social media posts which suggest two players contravened government lockdown protocols. The club will fully investigate the matter and speak to the players concerned. No further comment will be made.<br /><br />We need to draw on it but it has gone now. It is in the past, it is three points on a day where we weren’t expected to pick any points up. Our focus now has to be on the present. The nature of being in relegation battles is being able to focus on the job in hand and we have to take care of our own performances. That is the benchmark you are aiming for. Not always achievable and teams are coming to terms with playing in a different environment. We have just got to make sure that our game is close to our best. If we do we have always got a chance of winning games, it doesn’t matter who you play against. How I measure our performance is against us, not really against our opponents. If we get our performance somewhere near our best we will always have a chance. We are looking to get as many points as we can. For me it is very much a case of preparing ourselves and having a single-minded approach</p>

  <p><b>[Andre Gray: <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> striker apologises for lockdown breach]</b> I wanted to wait to make a public apology as my first apology needed to be to my team-mates and staff first for not being able to be involved in yesterday’s game and the risk I may have caused! I just want to reiterate that it was not a late-night party like what is being portrayed and only a gathering of friends which turned into a sort of football tournament on my birthday! I understand my responsibilities and will do what it takes to make it right, apologies again!</p>
