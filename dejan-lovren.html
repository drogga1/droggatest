  <p><b>[Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren will feature in a documentary focusing on his early life as a refugee fleeing the Bosnian War]</b> When I see what’s happening today I just remember my <b>[experiences.]</b>. I grew up in a town called Kraljeva Sutjeska. It was a real - I would say - family town. We had everything to be honest, everything. And then, it happened…People still avoid talking about it.

  <p><b>[Dejan Lovren speaks out on refugee crisis]</b> When I see what’s happening today, I just remember my thing, my family, and how people don’t want you in their country. I understand people want to protect themselves, but also <b>[these]</b> people don’t have homes. It’s not their fault; they’re fighting for their lives just to save their kids. They want to go away and have a secure place for their kids and their futures. I went through all this and I know what some families are going through. Give them a chance, give them a chance. You can see who the good people are and who are not.<br /><br />I would say we had luck - me and my family - we had luck. We had our grandad, who was working before in Germany, and because of that he had the papers to say, ‘yeah, come to us’. If not, I don’t know what we could’ve done. Maybe I could see my parents and me under the ground. I don’t know what could’ve happened. On one side we are happy, because I heard so many stories. I had one of my best friends in my high school - his dad was a soldier - and I remember he was crying every day. And I was thinking, ‘why?’ And he said, ‘my dad died’. So, you know, it could’ve been my dad … I had the luck with Germany. If they hadn’t allowed us to come in I don’t know where we would’ve gone or where we could go. I never ask about that. My mum said: ‘Germany is our second home’ and it’s true. Germany gave us their open hands. I don’t know which <b>[other]</b> country could do that at that time to welcome refugees from Bosnia<br /><br />I wish I could explain everything what happened. You hear so many stories, but nobody knows the real truth. It just happened. It just changed everything through the night - war between everyone, between three different cultures <b>[Muslim Bosniaks, Orthodox Serbs, Catholic Croats]</b>. I just remember when the sirens went on. I was so scared because I was thinking ‘bombs’ or that something will happen now. I remember my mum took me and we went to the basement, I don’t know how long we’d been sitting there, I think it was until the sirens went off. Afterwards, I remember mum, my uncle, my uncle’s wife, we took the car and then we were driving to Germany. They left everything - the house, they left it. The little shop with the food they had, they left it. They took one bag and ‘let’s go to Germany<br /><br />My mum said that every night, around 10pm, they switched on the radio and everyone listened to the news and what had happened in Bosnia because at that time we didn’t have television in this house. It was quite intensive, it was always like, ‘in which town are they in now?’ and ‘where were they going?’ The main question was, ‘when will the war stop?’. I think Zenica was more attacked because it was a bigger city, rather than smaller villages. But it was in these small villages where the most horrific things happened - people being brutally killed. My uncle’s brother was killed in front of other people with a knife. I never talk about it with my uncle, because it’s quite a tough thing to talk about, but he lost his brother, one of my family members. Difficult …<br /><br />I went to the training ground when I was six or seven years old. I took some pictures with the superstars at that time - Bixente Lizarazu and Lothar Matthaus. It was my hometown, my hometown … Because of that I loved Germany - Munich was a proper city, every third man was Croatian, a lot of Croatians are still living there today<br /><br />I hope for the next generation that it’ll be much easier, for my daughter and my son, maybe they’ll forget it and move on. I don’t know if they’ll ever understand my life or my situation, what I’ve been through, because they live in totally different worlds. If my little girl wants a toy or something, sometimes I say, ‘I don’t have the money’. It’s quite difficult to understand why I’m saying that, but she needs to understand that nothing comes easy. I’m working hard for her so she needs to understand you don’t need 20 toys, sometimes you need just one or two and you’re still happy - it’s about other things … I couldn’t imagine today to run away with my kids, and to really be scared for your life; it’s about your life, it’s not about a job or something like that<br /><br />It’s quite a sensitive thing to talk about, so people still avoid talking about that - it’s sad. Mum said to me ‘don’t tell them,’ and I said, ‘I will tell them’</p>

It was a tough challenge, but we have seen it many times before and if I talk it will be all over the newspapers<br /><br /><b>[Pressed over whether Barkley said sorry]</b> No, that is the only thing I do not like. If you make a hard challenge then be open about it and say sorry or something like that. Don’t talk to the referee and say it was not a foul. I think everyone saw it, especially me, but now it is over<br /><br /><b>[On Coutinho and Firmino’s performance]</b> They had a long, long flight back from Brazil. They did not even train with us. It was just a little session, but they are such quality players they don’t even need to train but I want to say about Lucas Leiva - he was brilliant today. He was playing like he has played 38 games in a row! Amazing! I was happy about him and everyone<br /><br />Listen, it is important - if you don’t have injuries, you will be in the place of Chelsea. Chelsea have not had one <b>[major]</b> injury, I do not think. Sometimes you need to be lucky in football, but we also played today without Henderson and Lallana who are massive players for us, but we showed we can play against everyone with other players. Now we need to show our qualities in our mind and repeat it against Bournemouth and take as many points as possible. If you want to play in the Champions League then you need to play like a Champions League team</p>

But when you are a top centre-back, I think it is normal and Virgil is one of them. Of course he needs some time to adapt in some moments because Southampton to Liverpool is different. He understands what the manager wants, sometimes I have to remind him also. I help him with as much as I know and can. It is a difficult period sometimes to adapt, but he is managing it quite well. Everyone is behind him and giving him support. We are a football team that likes to play with high pressure and I think he does this very good.</p>

  <p><b>[Dejan Lovren says Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has helped him through his struggles at Anfield]</b> When he took me out at Spurs, I was fuming. But after, when we spoke, it took a couple of days then he invited me into his room. I wanted answers but he said positive things. He said ‘If you just think about yourself like I think about you, you will be one of the best players in the world’. You know maybe, it’s sometimes just… just my self-confidence disappears in some moments. And he believes in me, you know? And I believe in him. Sometimes, I’m a person who thinks ‘Ah, I’m really good’. But other times I think ‘Ah, I did that, I’m not good enough’. He says always be level, but it’s difficult. You have sometimes self-confidence, sometimes not; sometimes good moods, sometimes not<br /><br />Everyone makes mistakes, but I play one bad game in 18 and everyone says, ‘Look, look, look’. Why? I don’t deserve that. People don’t see me in the ‘small’ games. They see 5-0 against Porto but nobody sees my part. Does it get me down? No. It’s a challenge. A personality challenge. After a mistake, are you ready to move on? I did it straightaway after Spurs when I was in that record of 18 games unbeaten. Big players don’t need six or seven games; big players in the next game prove you wrong. But some people don’t care about that Dejan. They’re just searching for the next mistake</p>

  <p><b>[Lovren hails Liverpool fans after Man City demolition]</b> It’s not just about scoring the goals, it is also about what we do when we don’t have the ball. Today we defended amazingly. This is what a good team does. We are concentrated from the first second until the end. It’s a brilliant result. In football you can never know. You relax and in one second it causes pressure. Against Man City they have the quality to score when they want and today they didn’t. It was crucial. It was a massive clean sheet for us today, not to concede in the Champions League<br /><br />I think it was the best atmosphere since I have been here. I saw from the first minute to the last minute they didn’t sit down, I think, on their chairs! It was amazing! We couldn’t hear ourselves. It was a massive point to have them<br /><br /><b>[Asked if the atmosphere had surpassed even the win over Borussia Dortmund in the Europa League in 2016 - when Lovren scored the winning goal in an epic 4-3 win]</b> Yes! I can only remember now how I felt after the goal <b>[against Dortmund]</b> but this is different. This is the Champions League!</p>

  <p><b>[Dejan Lovren admits that Liverpool hold regret over the way they started the season]</b> Definitely. The regret is definitely the first six or seven games of the season in the Premier League. We had many draws and they took us out of the first place. I would say we didn’t have any luck with injuries again and City didn’t have injuries all season. We didn’t catch up well from the beginning. They deserve to be champions but we are in good shape now and hopefully we can go to the final and it can be a good season for us. Also, we need to finish in the top four for next season. I’m definitely confident that next season we can push everyone, even ourselves to do better from the beginning to the end.</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah’s remarkable exploits at Liverpool have him in Ballon d’Or contention alongside Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> He is the one. He is becoming the superstar. It looks easy what he does but it is very difficult. If he continues like that - I don’t know if this is the right time to put pressure on him - but I believe he should be regarded as one of the best three in the world at the end of the year. He deserves to be mentioned for the Ballon d’Or - when people talk about Messi and Ronaldo they should also talk about Salah. He deserves the credit but I think he deserves even more to be honest. Forty-three goals guys, fucking hell.<br /><br />To be honest you feel powerful, you feel strong when you look around and see the players next to you. We have big names, we don’t maybe have lots of ‘superstars’ but it is not about the name, it is how we perform on the pitch. You know how we will react when we don’t have the ball and then we will not be afraid of anything else. You can see the system working, definitely. Every training session, every game we feel we are more comfortable and more confident. We just need to learn from our previous mistakes, we have to be more controlling of the game, that is where we need to improve, but I am pretty confident for the next leg</p>

  <p><b>[Dejan Lovren has seemingly taken a swing at Liverpool’s big-spending rivals by asserting that money is not the key to success]</b> There are teams spending a lot of money and buying top players from all over the world but it is not about money - it is about your team-mates. We have a squad that compares with every team in the world - we have shown that in the Champions League. We will now have a little rest and then we go to Spain for a few days team building and we will be ready for the final. The most important thing was that we beat Brighton and we are in the Champions League again. Everyone deserved that. Every year it is more difficult to get into the top four.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool defender reveals how his love affair with the European Cup began]</b> You see the copy of the trophy as soon as you walk in. It’s there, in your face, every day. From that moment on, you think ‘Wow, that was a big thing that his club achieved’, you know? It’s something you cannot escape as a Liverpool player, the European Cup, you have to think about it. You look at the walls in Melwood or at Anfield, or the famous pictures from down the years, it’s always that trophy. It’s just… part of the club.<br /><br />I think the first final where I was really aware of it was when Real Madrid played against Leverkusen in 2002. That was the moment I went, ‘Wow, this is a big one!’. Zidane scored that volley, that unbelievable goal. From that moment on, I really had my eye on the trophy. How can I get it, what do I need to do to give myself a chance? It started there<br /><br /><b>[Rafa Benitez’s Liverpool triumphing against the mighty AC Milan in Istanbul]</b> I was in Croatia watching it. I was 15 and it was still all new for me. But I remember after that game people were talking for many months about it, everywhere you went - how did Liverpool do it, how did they go from there to there? What actually happened there?! It’s natural that things like this will stick with you. A player always wants to be part of these games, on this big stage. It’s what you play for, no?<br /><br />Nerves are good. Of course, it makes your stomach turn because you’re preparing for a big game. It’s not a bad thing; it’s totally natural to have this feeling. It’s excitement. Everyone has wanted this for so long, and now it’s here. You just can’t wait to start. I wish the game was tonight, to be honest! The hard part is now, where everybody is talking about it, you are listening to TV and to the radio. You get a little bit tired of it. You want to get out there and get the game started<br /><br />We’ve been able to recover well and even get some players back who have been injured, like Emre <b>[Can]</b>. Yes, maybe seven days to prepare is better than 14 for a game like this, but we have been in similar positions to this; in January, I think we had nearly two weeks off after playing Everton in the FA Cup, and when we came back we played Man City and showed that we could pick it back up again. It’s not something that concerns us. You have to prepare like any other game. We maybe haven’t been in a Champions League final before, but we have been in similar situations with the pressure, with the media spotlight. We know what we can expect, and I think we are ready for it all<br /><br />Of course you feel it. When you know you are playing a big game against a big team, it brings out something different. But the difference now is that it is natural, it feels natural to us. We don’t need to push the button to say ‘Come on, guys, let’s do this, let’s get ourselves up for it.’ It just happens naturally now because of the work we have all put in and the mentality that we all<br /><br />Look, it’s the final of the Champions League. It’s Real Madrid. Half a billion people will be watching it all over the world. We are ready. We know we have our supporters behind us, and that is vitally important to us. The fans sing about 2005 and winning it five times. Hopefully after this weekend they’re singing about the sixth time! And for Lovren? What would it mean for him to get his hands on that trophy? It would mean I achieved my dream. Then I can say ‘I made it in my life’</p>

I haven’t spoken to him a lot, but hopefully he can be fit for the World Cup because I know it means a lot to him to play for his national team.<br /><br />Mo is the type of player who wants to play even when he feels pain. He showed that this season. There were a couple of games where people didn’t know <b>[he was in pain]</b> but in the end he scored a hat-trick or whatever! Of course it was disappointing for him that he couldn’t finish the game in Kiev, but he’s positive and hopefully he can move on and play for the national team<br /><br /><b>[Zlatko Dalic’s side were beaten 2-0 by tournament favourites Brazil on Sunday]</b> We love to be the dark horses, and I believe can do something big.

Of course <b>[we can surprise people]</b> like we surprised a few people with Liverpool in the Champions League. With our national team, we have real quality players; if you look at the team we have in the middle and up front, it’s quite scary to be honest. But it’s about the team, and like I said in the first half <b>[against Brazil]</b> we looked a good defensive team. I think we can improve in the next week or so<br /><br /><b>[On Fabinho]</b> I was reading something about this. Of course, I am always happy that we can welcome quality players into our squad.

You can’t stop him with one player, you have to defend like a team. You saw that with Iceland.<br /><br />We know how to play against the big teams and we are not scared of them.

I don’t want to go to the national team and to make problems so I preferred to stay on the side. That was still my mistake but I can live with that. And I made it right<br /><br />Without being arrogant, I think definitely.

  <p><b>[Dejan Lovren admits Liverpool are not happy to have seen him return from World Cup duty with Croatia nursing a bizarre stomach complaint]</b> I cannot train at all because of stomach muscle issues. I am suffering a lot of pain and will see a specialist doctor in the Netherlands. When did I start to feel it? I felt it during the World Cup. I played with pain and those three games killed me. But who wouldn’t play for Croatia at such a big tournament! After the World Cup finished, the pain increased. I can’t even sit in my car without feeling it and to get out of the car hurts like hell! I’d always grit my teeth and play for Croatia, but now I am paying the price. But no price is too high for what we achieved in Russia.<br /><br />Of course, they are not happy. I haven’t trained since I returned from holiday. I can’t. I’ll reassess things after seeing the doctor in Netherlands. I have to deal with that for now and believe it will be OK. I hoped it would pass during my holiday, but it didn’t. As I went for a swim, it hurt. I couldn’t even rest normally<br /><br />Where would I go from Liverpool? It is one of the biggest clubs in the world and I am too happy here to move. We have the team to challenge for the title. We have experience from last season, no key players left and we can be better than last season. In the Champions League final we lacked experience and it was the only reason Real Madrid won. Plus, of course, the luck they had, which is part of football - first with <b>[Mohamed]</b> Salah’s injury and then with the goals they scored. In the Premier League? Last season Man City made the difference at the start of the campaign and we must avoid losing points at an early stage this time</p>

  <p><b>[‘Angry’ Lovren backs Liverpool to produce ‘special’ Barcelona comeback]</b> It makes me angry. Angry and hungry to show them we are capable of doing something special at Anfield. We have big players and big players should show in big games and I think this is one of those games on Tuesday so I expect one of the biggest games at Anfield. This is why we are Liverpool. This is why we are a unique club. When people already said to us ‘They are already done, they will not come through’ we always show the balls to produce the biggest comebacks. It doesn’t look from the result at the moment, because they are 3-0 up, but football is unpredictable - especially in the Champions League at Anfield.<br /><br />Of course, we will never just accept that we already lost. It is just one game. It will be quite a tough challenge after 3-0 but I remember we did it many times and Liverpool are quite famous for big comebacks. I hope we can do it again but we need big, big support from the fans. This is, I think, the main thing. I hope Mo will be OK now after the knock because it doesn’t look good. We showed already many times we can play without Mo and also a couple of other players. But the most important thing is the crowd. The most important thing is to score quite early and if we can manage that then everything is possible. It will be a challenge but I believe at Anfield I believe in the supporters, I believe in this team. I hope we will have Mo back as he is quite important for us. Let us see what tactics we will have against Barca - we can maybe surprise them</p>

  <p><b>[Dejan Lovren has revealed that, despite wanting to leave <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, he’s happy to have stayed put and insisted that he turned down Roma as he didn’t feel he needed to prove himself there]</b> I feel relief after the transfer window is closed. I got tired of reading and listening every day about me leaving or staying at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Everyone wrote ‘Dejan is here, Dejan is there’, and they knew nothing! It annoyed me, I got a headache because of it throughout the summer. I didn’t want to force my way out of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Two years ago I signed a four-year contract and I’ve enjoyed every moment at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I’ve achieved big things that would not be possible had I not been at such a big club as <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. We played two Champions League finals, won one, and I enjoyed the coach’s trust. But after the World Cup I cracked - both physically and mentally. The best way to say it is that I was worn out. I didn’t feel the passion or tension that I did before and after three to four months out I got injured too.<br /><br />As I returned, <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> didn’t like some things and I understand that. I arrived at the training camp injured, although I didn’t know I was injured. I knew there were some problems but I believed I’d solve them as usual. I had put up with pain until I just couldn’t stand it anymore. And, as I returned from injury, it was hard to get in the team that was on a winning streak. The coach felt he didn’t need me that much. I played some matches but I wasn’t happy. I accepted my position, talked to the coach several times, talked about the season ahead of us and <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> made it very clear: he told me that I could leave if I found a new club and if I wanted to leave. But he also told me he and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> needed me.<br /><br />I did consider a move, I knew I gave my best for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, won the Champions League and I am not the kind of player that likes to be benched and earn money for that. Yes, some people around me advised me: ‘What do you care? You are at a big club, shut up and take the money’. But I am not happy sitting on the bench. Milan contacted me but Roma were the most persistent. But negotiations didn’t go well. I don’t want to go somewhere and prove to someone who I am and how I play and whether I’m ready or not. I am professional, won a Champions League, silver at the World Cup, I achieved big things in football and don’t deserve to go anywhere on loan. And to have someone checking me, my quality…<br /><br /><b>[Lovren, who is seemingly behind <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a>, <a href="joel-matip.html">Joel Matip</a> and <a href="joe-gomez.html">Joe Gomez</a> in the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> central defensive pecking order]</b> I feel very happy because I felt <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were by me all the time, I respect that a lot. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> told me: ‘Listen, buddy, you are top-class player, we will not let you go on loan, we need you’. When he told me that it was unclear to me because I know I’m in the worst position of all the centre-backs in the team. But there will be a lot of matches, some injuries are possible too. I wanted to leave, it didn’t happen, I was told <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> need me and I accepted that. It was not meant to be for me to leave. Last week I spoke to <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> again, he told me he understands me, knows I am not happy, but he also said: ‘Look, now it (the transfer window) is finished, I want you to reset your head, you’re important’. I feel I am in my prime, in great shape, mentally ready and you cannot buy experience. Not many players played in a World Cup and Champions League final. That is why <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> wouldn’t let me go on loan. You have to pay to get quality and not go somewhere and prove something to someone</p>

I think we have it, this is the great balance. We are used to playing big finals and the big games and we know how to manage it. Even when we are 1-0 down we know what to do. This is why it’s important to have a balance in the team. If we keep the important players and the core of the team here for many years, we will only grow<br /><br />Stay home and stay positive, stay healthy because we need to keep our nerves. Of course, there will be a moment when everything will come back together as normal. Stay positive, that’s what I would say to the fans</p>

  <p><b>[Dejan Lovren insists he is fully focused on <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s title charge, despite ongoing speculation surrounding his future at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>]</b> I’m always ready. If someone is injured and coming off, I’m ready to step in and show my quality. I think I proved that last season, when <a href="joe-gomez.html">Joe Gomez</a> or <a href="joel-matip.html">Joel Matip</a> were injured and I came in and played. My goal is to play and to win as many trophies as possible. But at the moment the focus is just to win the next two games and be champions. After that, we will see what happens<br /><br />It has been a test for me. But in these moments, I think you should stick with the team even more, to show your quality even if you are not on the pitch with the first XI. The next day in training, you should give everything, just to respect your team-mates. Of course, it’s not the happiest moment when I see myself on the bench, but it’s the decision of the manager. I respect it and I am always the guy who will work 200 per cent behind closed doors<br /><br />At this level, it’s normal to be exposed to criticism. To be honest, I’m not too bothered. If I feel criticism, it will be first from the manager, but my biggest critic is me. I can see when I perform well or not, it’s as simple as that. I don’t need somebody to tell me. I don’t read a lot of newspapers or listen much to the pundits. It is what it is. It’s football and we have to deal with it. Some players can’t do that and they go inside themselves, but accepting it is important. The criticism will just make me stronger. It has always been part of football and it always will be part of football<br /><br /><b>[Lovren added on <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> being the inspiration behind <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s transformation]</b> He came in and said, ‘Guys, I want you to think positively, to believe in yourselves. Without belief, we can’t do anything’. We do not stop. Even when we are at our best level, he sees that we can improve more. He had a whole picture already in his mind, he just missed a few pieces. So he bought Alisson, he bought Virgil, then it just clicked. He has done an amazing job</p>

  <p><b>[Dejan Lovren says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> kept focus on winning <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title before return was announced]</b> To be honest, even without a date at the beginning, our main focus and goal was, ‘Guys, let’s finish the season. There will, of course, be a date back, but just stay in shape, be in shape when we come back. We will do it and then we can say well done’. That was our main focus from the beginning. All the time we have been working in the gym, we know what is our focus. Of course we still have two games <b>[to win until]</b> we can say, ‘Yeah, we are the champions’ but our main focus is to win all the games. That’s the main target.<br /><br />The last two weeks before we came back together, to be honest, I was a little bit struggling with not knowing when we will start and when we will be back together. You put so many questions in your mind, ‘When will everything be back to normal?’, but this is a great challenge for yourself and to show to everyone that you care about yourself, you care about your team. So we did it and we did an amazing job. We came back in great shape. We did some physical tests and I think it says a lot about the team. Everyone respected all the planning and programmes that we got. This is what’s important for this team</p>

  <p><b>[Lovren admitted he was frustrated at his lack of game time and believed he could continue his professional career for five more years]</b> I’m patient. I’m working behind closed doors a lot and sometimes it is frustrating when you don’t play. You are fighting with yourself in your mind, asking ‘Why not?’ But you are accepting it, you are moving on and from my personal point of view, I want to be better every day in the training sessions.<br /><br />The day will come when I will get again the chance so I am happy that I am not injured - which is the most important thing - and I’m also happy that we are all together and we have a full squad at the moment. Of course I want to be in the team that wins many trophies. I think, and I feel, that I have quite a lot of years to give especially in professional football. I’m 30, so another good five years. I don’t think I’m just a throwaway. If the club needs me I am here, I am happy. But you never know what can happen in the summer. At the moment I am just focused on the point where I can say I made it <b>[as part of a great team]</b>.</p>
