  <p><b>[Shakhtar Donetsk coach Mircea Lucescu advises <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> to sign <a href="henrikh-mkhitaryan.html">Henrikh Mkhitaryan</a>]</b> He is a guy who needs to feel affection and there’s too much pressure on him at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. He would be great behind <a href="fernando-llorente.html">Fernando Llorente</a> and <a href="carlos-tevez.html">Carlos Tevez</a>. Mkhitaryan is much quicker and runs more than <b>[Wesley]</b> <a href="wesley-sneijder.html">Sneijder</a>. He is a complete player. He creates chances, wins back balls and always keeps on going</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City are being backed to win the battle for Fred]</b> Shakhtar Donetsk’s best player is Fred in the centre of midfield. He was a bit anarchic on the left. I moved him in front of the defence. He will go to City like Fernandinho before him.</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Cengiz Under? Roma finally have their replacement for Liverpool star Salah]</b> I also advised Di Francesco to persist with him and work patiently with him because his qualities would’ve come out in the long run. I’ll be counting on him a lot in the future. Cengiz will become a pillar of the new national team</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United’s £52.5 million move for Brazil international midfielder Fred has been confirmed]</b> I’m really pleased Fred has completed his transfer to Manchester United, I am proud of him. When I signed him at Shakhtar, Taison and Bernard were playing in his position. I transformed his position, giving him a more defensive role</p>

The London club fell in love with his performances when they faced us in the Champions League<br /><br />Absolutely, yes. I would be very happy if <a href="willian.html">Willian</a> chose <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. It would be exceptional to see him wearing that shirt</p>
