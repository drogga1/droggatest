  <p><b>[Tony Ferguson to Conor McGregor: I get next title shot, so you can go fight Mark Wahlberg]</b> No way man, the fans wouldn’t have it, they’d put up too much of a fight. He’s been fighting old men lately - he’s trying to fight Mark Wahlberg. Maybe that’s the fight for him. The dude’s got a couple of things, making his money, doing his thing. I don’t know if he wants to fight anymore, but he is not my concern<br /><br /><b>[it’s not something that is now at the top of his list because the mouthy Irishman is now irrelevant in the fight game]</b> He is like one of those ex-girlfriends. I stopped worrying about that dude. At first he was in line trying to go for the title, and once he became irrelevant I stopped caring about him. Now he’s mentioning my name? Get the fuck out of here dude, come on</p>

  <p><b>[Tony Ferguson lambass contract negotiations with champion <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>]</b> It was out of nowhere, you know, no talks. The manner that they did it really wasn’t the way I wanted it to go - it was really unpleasant. I put my fans in the grey … it was as smooth as a bumpy road but we got there<br /><br />They wanted to get this thing done really fast even though it was four months away. I’m happy with the way things are going, it’s the beginning of a whole new relationship. I’m only fighting once a year, dude, when I used to fight six times a year. The casuals don’t understand that when you beat everybody, there’s no more fish <b>[in the sea]</b></p>

  <p><b>[UFC 249: Tony Ferguson sends <a href="justin-gaethje.html">Justin Gaethje</a> chilling warning ahead of Florida showdown]</b> I train like a f<strong>**</strong> vicious dude. I’m always preparing for three to four people. And that’s why I’m ahead of schedule<br /><br />I haven’t had this confidence in a long f<strong>**</strong> time. It took the training and I needed an opponent. He’s not getting out of the cage<br /><br /><b>[Ferguson said of his opponents]</b> They sign on the dotted line. They know what they’re getting themselves into, because El Cucuy’s gonna get your a<strong>. I’m a f</strong><em>**</em> contracted killer out there<br /><br />The fight’s gonna play out one way. My hand raised in victory. And I’m gonna defend my belt</p>
