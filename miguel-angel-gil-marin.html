  <p><b>[Atletico Madrid ‘fed up with Barcelona’s attitude’ during public Griezmann pursuit]</b> We’re fed up with Barcelona’s attitude. That a president, player and a board member speak the way they’ve done about the future of a player with an existing contract and just a few days before disputing a European final, is an absolute lack of respect towards Atlético Madrid and its fans. Atlético de Madrid’s stance is very clear and has been made public on numerous occasions. Not once have we negotiated for Griezmann nor do we have any intention to do so. A few months ago, I personally expressed to Barcelona’s president that our player isn’t for sale nor are we going to sell him. At the same time, I let him know that his inappropriate conduct was against the integrity of the competition, especially since we’ve been competing for the league title throughout the season and Barcelona have been continuously pressuring one of the most relevant players from our squad. I also told him in that moment, that in the chance the player exercised his right to nullify his contract due to their pressure throughout the season that Atlético de Madrid would demand Barcelona compensation for their inappropriate behaviour. Enough is enough. I hope this statement serves its purpose and that us Atlético fans can enjoy this moment and prepare ourselves for a final like we should.</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Simeone is a blessing for Atletico Madrid]</b> I think it was a blessing for all parties, for me, for the club, for the fans, but also for him <b>[when Simeone arrived]</b>. We have grown a lot together and hopefully we can continue like this for many more years. In football, you cannot establish too many long-term projects at the sporting level, you can do it at structural levels. In the case of Diego, he has this season and the next, and evidently the perfect thing for both parties would be to extend the link for longer.<br /><br />It’s not an obsession. Obviously it’s a challenge and it would be beautiful, but it is not necessary, just a longing, because it would never be a failure not to achieve it</p>

There is no way he can change<br /><br />Facts speak better than words. Lemar is an important player who hasn’t been able to develop his game but who has characteristics that others don’t have. Let’s hope he has a good moment when he comes back from injury. Now, if Lemar can stay or not <b>[…]</b> we know that agents work in an exemplary way. Clubs work in terms of the needs of the clubs.
