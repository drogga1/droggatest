  <p><b>[Atletico Madrid CEO Gil Marin has admitted that it would be very nice if James Rodriguez were to cross the Madrid divide and join Los Rojiblancos]</b> I know that many clubs would like him. Even talking to a player, he believes that there are qualities that the player could bring and that it is good for us. I know that our coach <b>[Diego Simeone]</b> likes him, I know that James does not want to continue in Real Madrid and I know that Real Madrid doesn’t want him to continue, but there have to be many circumstances to make it possible. It would be very nice, but It depends a lot on the president of Real Madrid</p>

In addition, we would bring Spanish football to fans and supporters who live outside our country. It would be a great game that would mark the future</p>

  <p><b>[Atletico Madrid dismiss Thomas Lemar exit rumours amid <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> &amp; <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> interest]</b> Lemar is not for sale. There is no way he can change<br /><br />Facts speak better than words. Lemar is an important player who hasn’t been able to develop his game but who has characteristics that others don’t have. Let’s hope he has a good moment when he comes back from injury. Now, if Lemar can stay or not <b>[…]</b> we know that agents work in an exemplary way. Clubs work in terms of the needs of the clubs. But, as a footballer, every time he has been available, he’s played a lot more than he hasn’t played. His characteristics have always excited me. But he hasn’t been able to live up to expectations</p>

  <p><b>[That is the worry for Atletico. It’s not just the new players taking some time to settle in, but the old ones are not delivering in the way they used to.]</b> From the fans, I ask for confidence, because I am convinced that the team will continue to respond.

With him I personally learned to win, with him I learned to live with passion - the things that they make you better as a man and as a professional. I give a very strong embrace to his wife Vera, Dusan and Ana and tell them that they should be proud of the husband and father they had because, in addition to being a great professional and a wonderful person, he is in the history of <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> on its own merits</p>
