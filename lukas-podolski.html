  <p><b>[Former Arsenal star Podolski explains his decision to move to Japan]</b> Football in Japan is highly looked upon, even more than in the rest of Asia. The players are experienced. I often played against them. They are sophisticated, keep the ball moving well. Many Japanese players made it in Europe, which shows the quality. I don’t know <b>[about]</b> that from other Asian leagues.<br /><br />I am not moving there for a holiday, I want to prove myself on the pitch and I hope I will succeed in this half year to accelerate in the next season. I did not sign a contract for two-and-a-half years to leave after a few months. I want to integrate into the club and reach the visions we have. As I said, if we reach the top three in the first year, that would be a great success. We’ll see what’s possible in the coming years</p>

  <p><b>[How European mega stars are adapting to Japan &amp; the J-League]</b> It’s a really good country to live in. The people are friendly. It’s safe. It’s a great country for kids. You have a lot of places to visit, not only in Kobe, where we live. You have a lot of cities around you can visit. It’s really cool. It’s really fun, as well. I like the culture and I like to live there<br /><br />I think the Japanese league is a strong league, especially in Asia. Last year, a Japanese team won the Champions League and the national team is doing well in the World Cup. It’s a good league, a strong league but I cannot compare it to Europe. It’s different</p>

  <p><b>[Lukas Podolski says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are more of a team under <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a>]</b> Yeah I see it, like you explained, the level going up depends on running, fighting spirit. You see there’s more of a team on the pitch. With the fans, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is like one of the big five teams in the world. With this potential, we have to play every year Champions League and fight for the title, every year. We have to invest and I hope Mikel with his team around are doing a great job for next season.<br /><br />I think I have nearly three fantastic years at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because, for me, it’s always important to connect with the club, the city, the people in the club. Because you are there, you sign the contract, you earn money, but for me, everywhere I’ve played, it’s always important to connect with everything with the staff, the fans, the city. This is what I did because football on the pitch is much more than only the 90 minutes. Of course I like London. It’s a different culture, I’ve been in different countries. But I loved it, it was really nice. It was my first time outside of Germany, before I was only in Cologne and Munich. It was my first time and I really enjoyed it. It was the first time I had to speak English by myself, had to drive on the other side of the road! My time at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> on the pitch, I liked it. Of course, in the end, I didn’t get my minutes but there are always some reasons for that, maybe myself, maybe the coach, maybe something else. But I really enjoyed it and had fantastic games and three years at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. It’s a special club and playing for a special club like this is always motivating and something special</p>

  <p><b>[Podolski: I didn’t want to leave <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> but had to in order to get games]</b> There are always some things. You weren’t happy because you’re not playing, maybe the coach isn’t happy because you’re not playing how he wants, maybe he sees another player above you? I don’t know. I had some games I played very well, I scored goals or played well and the next match I was sitting on the bench again. That’s why I started thinking, ‘I’m going to have to change this situation’. I was thinking I was ready for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, I was thinking I was ready for the starting XI or to come on earlier but it was not like that. For any reason it sometimes happens like that in football or sport and that’s why I decided to move. This is life, this is sport, I didn’t want to but I had to because I wanted to play football. I wanted to be on the pitch but I would have loved to stay at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> for a couple more years because I felt really great there. The team, the stuff around the team and everyone at the club was so friendly - like a family. Great fans, great city, the stadium - everything! I really enjoyed it but in the end it is like it is. I had some talks with Arsene about my situation and I told him, ‘I want to play, I want to come on earlier’ and of course, he’s the coach, he has to decide, he can’t promise players a bonus or to always play. No coach gives you that. So I decided for myself to move forward.</p>

  <p><b>[Lukas Podolski admits <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> could not be blamed for dreaming of a switch to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> When you have a fantastic season like he had, many clubs are interested. When a player has a wish to play for a big team or a dream to play in Italy or Spain, or like <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> and his link with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. If he has a dream to play for this club when he’s young, then why not? As a player, you have to take this chance to play for a club like that. Of course for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, it’ll be a big loss if they have to sell him but this is the business of football. My opinion is you lose a big player, he had a fantastic season with a good scoring record, but you can make money on a player, sell him and you can invest in new players. For a player like me or <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>, when a big club is calling, you always want to have this dream<br /><br />I don’t feel stress when I play any game or training or when I join a club. I’m just confident and this was the same at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. When I look back at my stats per game, I think it was OK. I had nearly three fantastic years at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. It was the first time I was out of Germany but I enjoyed playing at such a big club</p>

  <p><b>[Lukas Podolski says <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> is a great player &amp; <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a>’s a better fit than Emery]</b> There is no discussion for me, he is a great player. Sometimes there is a problem with a coach or there could be an injury, things that happen in football and you have to deal with this situation sometimes. I think it’s a better fit than before (Ozil and Arteta). They have played together and know each other. <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> is back on the pitch and the games I have seen he is doing much better than with the former coach. Sometimes you have a coach and you cannot deal with him. He can have a different view of football. <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> is back at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and you see the team is much more organised, more fight and discipline. I hope they can build a good team for the next couple of years. They can do it but they have to work together<br /><br />The potential of what the club has, it has not been good enough. I think they know it themselves. They have the potential, the history, the facilities and I think they have the money as well. A club like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> has to play every year for the Champions League. Of course, <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is hard and even against the smaller teams. It’s not like other leagues with two or three teams fighting for the title</p>

  <p><b>[Rewind to June 8, 2008, and Germany are playing on the opening day. Their first opponents? Poland. The nation where Podolski was born, and who he would go on to score a memorable double against]</b> It was 12 years ago and the memories are still there, it was a special game against the country I was born. It was special to score two goals, but I didn’t celebrate. The emotion was there and it was a hard moment. This is sport and you have to deal with that but I’ll always remember that game, it was special for me and the Polish fans<br /><br /><b>[After the strong start, Germany would go on to suffer a shock loss against Croatia in the second game, despite Podolski scoring once again]</b> Pressure can be negative or positive. We knew we were strong since 2005 in the Confederations Cup where we finished third, then third again in the 2006 World Cup, we knew we were strong. We kept the same coach for 15 years and we built something up in the national team, that’s why I was happy to play for 12 years, and the pressure that comes with it, that’s life. People go to work to feed families, work in factories, work to build cars or planes for the public, this is pressure too. You have to deal with the pressure in every situation<br /><br /><b>[Unfortunately for Podolski, a <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> pass, and a <a href="fernando-torres.html">Fernando Torres</a> chip saw Spain win 1-0 to secure their first Euros in 44 years]</b> What can you do? We lost the game and as you know, the final is just one match, a couple of situations can decide it. Just like in 2014, when Argentina had great chances against us, the one-vs-one chances <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Manuel Neuer</a> saved. There is key points in every final and you just have to deal with that. It is just one game and sometimes it is the luckiest team who wins<br /><br /><b>[So what does one of Germany’s greatest players make of the young side?]</b> What we had in our team was a special team spirit and that’s what they’re missing now. We had players like me, <a href="philipp-lahm.html">Philipp Lahm</a>, <a href="bastian-schweinsteiger.html">Bastian Schweinsteiger</a>, <a href="miroslav-klose.html">Miroslav Klose</a>, <a href="jens-lehmann.html">Jens Lehmann</a> and <a href="michael-ballack.html">Michael Ballack</a> - a lot of players like that. But it’s a new generation now, the players are younger but there is a lot of them who have not played a tournament. We’ll see next year in the Euros, hopefully when there isn’t a virus around!</p>
