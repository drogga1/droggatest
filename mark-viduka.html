  <p><b>[Former Socceroos captain Mark Viduka provides an insight into his career with <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> United]</b> I had the chance to join <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> at the end of the 2001 season, after we made the Champions League semi-final. <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> were negotiating with Milan and wanted £38m. I was friends with <a href="zvonimir-boban.html">Zvonimir Boban</a> at the time, and we were negotiating terms through him. In the end, Milan offer the £38m, and <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> didn’t want to sell. That was that. I was a huge <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> fan. As a kid, I grew up watching <a href="marco-van-basten.html">Marco van Basten</a>, Frank Rijkaard and <a href="ruud-gullit.html">Ruud Gullit</a>. They were my favourite team. It just wasn’t to be<br /><br />I was in Manchester, and my agent at the time also had a lot to do with <a href="sir-elton-john.html">Elton John</a>. He said stay for the night and come to the show. He had backstage passes, and I’d get the chance to meet the man for myself. It was an offer I couldn’t refuse. So I’m there with Jacob Burns, my <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> team-mate and fellow Aussie, as we got ushered into his dressing room. As we enter, Elton swings around on a swivel chair and says, ‘Mark Viduka, you’re from Melbourne. I love that place!’. I was nervous, so I babbled on about my meeting with <a href="manchester-united.html">the Red Devils</a> that day and a possible move. Instead of going to our seats to watch the concert, Elton gets us to watch it at the side of the stage. About three songs in, he says, ‘I want to dedicate this next one to my good friend Mark, who is in Manchester today to make a big decision’. I’m thinking: ‘S***, please don’t say anymore!’ Thank God he didn’t. I didn’t sign for Man United. I think I loved living in <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> too much at the time</p>

  <p><b>[Former Australia captain Mark Viduka when asked about his career highlights]</b> There are so many moments. Everyone assumes scoring four goals against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> would be my highlight or captaining Australia at a World Cup. But I’d have to say kicking the ball in the family backyard with my dad will always be my greatest football memory</p>
