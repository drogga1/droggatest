But the talks with Paris were very complicated. We couldn’t understand how they could sign the player without breaking FFP.<br /><br />It was a deal between three parties. The Mbappes always said that it was going to be done by the best terms for us. Paris paid the price we asked, which was as much as we got from other European clubs</p>

  <p><b>[It was a desire to play for Pep Guardiola that forced the sale of Benjamin Mendy to Manchester City]</b> For a while, we held off. And then, we thought - in spite of the offers that we had had for him and him indicating that he wanted to leave - could he have another season like the last one? At first, I said, ‘no, you’re staying’. He replied: ‘But Vadim, I really want to go to City and link up with Guardiola’. On numerous occasions he said to me: ‘If it was Chelsea, I’d stay; but if it’s a chance to work with Guardiola, I want to go’.<br /><br />He’d spoken so frankly with me. So, when City met the asking price and when he became the most expensive defender in the world, there were no more arguments to have with him. We weighed up the for and against and said to him: ‘OK, you can go’.<br /><br />He’s a good kid but you can never be sure about a player’s psychology. It wasn’t just a good offer; it was the championship of his dreams, the manager of his dreams<br /><br /><b>[Vasilyev has no ill-will toward Mbappe]</b> There were several possibilities discussed between Kylian’s family and us. They had seen clubs from their side, we also had approaches made directly. The situation developed during the transfer window and ended with an agreement that suited all parties. His family have been decent and proper in their negotiations with PSG, I applaud them<br /><br />I do wish him the best. He has everything in order to become one of the world’s best players. He has helped us write a quite simply beautiful page in the club’s history book, along with his team-mates, and is living proof that our training academy is still one of the best in the world<br /><br /><b>[Vasilyev also admitted the fee Monaco is set to receive from PSG also helped matters]</b> There is no shame in saying that certain offers just cannot be turned down. Everyone knows our philosophy: we are a selling club</p>

  <p><b>[Monaco sold attacker Anthony Martial to Manchester United to comply with UEFA’s Financial Fair Play regulations]</b> In 2015 we had to sell in order to meet FFP conditions, so it was more of an obligation. We are, currently, financially safe and sound. You sell when you think it’s the right time. You’ve got to accept the risk <b>[to then sell someone at a lower price the next time round]</b> and it’s by taking risks that we have got here<br /><br />Sales, they are the consequence of having a great season, the league title, a great manager and an excellent recruitment cell and scouting network. We don’t want records. We want to maintain a competitive team while respecting our economic model. And today, we’ve managed it. My dream has always been to develop the model, in both an economic and sporting sense, as far as possible. I’d said that a few years ago with Forbes magazine; I see that it is a possibility<br /><br /><b>[Given Monaco’s past history with FFP violations, Vasilyev was asked to comment on his rivals’ situation]</b> I would need to know all the facts in order to be fully cognisant with the situation. I think that they have considered it more on a revenue and sponsorship angle, notably with Nike. UEFA will make a decision in due course.</p>

  <p><b>[Monaco vice president Vadim Vasilyev has admitted that his side cannot hope to compete on a regular basis with Ligue 1 behemoth Paris Saint-Germain]</b> We’re the first club behind this monster. We cannot compare the two projects. PSG have a budget of €600 million and almost unlimited resources. If we look at our direct competitors, the two Olympiques, Lyon and Marseille, we have done better. We were champions and we made a semi-final in the Champions League. No one has done better in the last five years, not even PSG. On the other hand, it is also clear that competition is intensifying. Lyon rely on their academy but also on their new stadium, which brings additional resources. Marseille have also begun a new cycle so there has been unprecedented competition this season. All good for French football!<br /><br />We are ambitious but realistic. To be realistic is not to want to compete with PSG in the long run. It can happen like last season but in the long run I would say it’s impossible. My president Dmitry Rybolovlev had the intelligence to change the project based on young people, future talents and make the club a reference in the development of stars of tomorrow<br /><br />There are always things to improve. We are ambitious and we always want to do better. But I think that the results of the last five years and two world records in the transfer market show everyone that our model is working well<br /><br />The training centre is in the DNA of our club. We have just to remember that when France won the World Cup in 1998, four players <b>[Thierry Henry, David Trezeguet, Lilian Thuram and Emmanuel Petit]</b> came from Monaco. We have a tradition that makes our training centre one of the best in Europe. It is a great satisfaction to see Sylla, Julian Serrano or Kevin N’Doram coming out of our centre and there are others who will follow<br /><br />Young people are watching what we do. Apart from our results, they watch James Rodriguez, Martial, Mbappe, Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco, Tiemoue Bakayoko, Bernardo Silva … They see that everyone leaves Monaco to go to the biggest clubs in the world. They think that by coming here and reaching the goals they will also be able to go to the bigger clubs. And that’s it, attractiveness. People are often wrong, they say it’s for business but no, that’s the attractiveness of our project: let one go so that others can follow<br /><br />These players could have gone wherever they wanted. There is no need to have good scouts to say that they are very good young people. You just have to be attractive, present the right project and make them choose ours in priority<br /><br /><b>[Is Monaco, therefore, the most attractive clubs for young players?]</b> Yes, I think we can say that. I would like a club that continues to shine on the national and European stages. I would like to see our projects with Cercle Bruges and our training centre to make the stars of tomorrow growing and become a reference club for young people in the long term. I would also like that in addition to the transfer market we can develop other resources internationally. Today we have an exceptional brand with Monaco. We invest a lot in China and I hope that in a few years we will see the results</p>

Here, we want to succeed with the loans of players where Chelsea did not really integrate them to their first team. Michael Emenalo’s experience will serve us a lot and I think we can do better than Chelsea. Not regarding the sport results but with the integration of young players. We respect what has been done at Chelsea but we are not inspired by it. On the other hand, the arrival of Michael Emenalo is a great satisfaction because it proves that Monaco has become attractive for top European leaders. The first time I talked to him was years ago, I started this idea and I was told ‘no’. Today it has become reality and I am very proud of it. He has demonstrated all his qualities at the highest level at Chelsea but also with the academy. That’s largely why I wanted him in Monaco.</p>

Therefore, we have made a decision to end our partnership with Thierry Henry.<br /><br /><b>[Vasilyev admitted that the club’s decision to sack Jardim, who won the 2016-17 Ligue 1 title with Monaco, was premature]</b> Leonardo Jardim’s time at AS Monaco, as I said when he departed, would be remembered as one of the brightest chapters in the club’s history. Today we realize that the story of Leonardo Jardim at the club did not end as it was meant to. Leonardo should have been given an opportunity to continue his job</p>

He told me: ‘Vadim, I think it’s too early, I’m Parisian, I do not want to leave my country like that, I want to become a great player here’. I told him, ‘Kylian, you’re right’. He wants to win. And of course the Champions League must be won for a player like that. If he wins it with Paris, it’s better. He remains the same person, the same Kylian. It’s just that he has gained importance, power in the global landscape. I know <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> quite well, and he always wants to break all records, go further.
