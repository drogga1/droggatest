  <p><b>[Sam Rainsy has said he was not allowed to board a Thai Airways flight from Paris to Bangkok in his attempt to return home to Hun Sen]</b> said they had received from very high up the instruction to not allow me to board … It’s shocking. I have done nothing wrong. This is all politics. I am a citizen, I have done nothing wrong so I must go back to Cambodia. Let me go to buy another ticket with another company</p>

  <p><b>[At Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris, an angry Sam Rainsy told reporters that he wouldn’t be cowed by being kept off his flight and said he plans to return via another neighboring country]</b> Never, never will I abandon. We need to continue, the days of Hun Sen are numbered. Democracy will be reinstalled in the near future. It’s our conviction and our determination<br /><br /><b>[He later made an online broadcast on Facebook, where he has almost 4.8 million followers, calling on his compatriots not to be disappointed and remain strong]</b> We will be seeking all the possibilities, all the options, in order to make sure that we are finally able to arrive in Cambodia to push for the regime change plan that our Cambodians are hungry to see</p>
