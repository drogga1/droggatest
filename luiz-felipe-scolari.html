  <p><b>[Luiz Felipe Scolari on Lionel Messi]</b> I think that <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> will continue to be the best player in the world for the next two years or so. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> not only plays for the team, but he also has amazing individual skills. He can decide a match all by himself with his ability. Now that he’s at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> can show his technical abilities and make the same individual actions as Messi</p>

  <p><b>[Luiz Felipe Scolari on Totti]</b> Totti’s love for Roma is incredible and us Brazilians really value certain bonds. He’s playing well and has incomparable qualities. If he was Brazilian, he would have a great chance of being selected for the World Cup, but he is fortunate to be able to be a part of a fantastic and spectacular national team. Throughout the world there are players who are head and shoulders above the rest. <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Pirlo</a> is one of those who has marked an era. He would get in any team in any league in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Luiz Felipe Scolari on Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> Everybody speaks nonsense about Cristiano <b>[Ronaldo]</b>. For me he is the best guy in the world to work with. He’s always ready, always trying his best, and always looking to try something different. No-one works harder than him. People complain because he puts gel in his hair, because he’s cute or a womaniser. They say he is vain because he puts cream on his legs after a game. Just leave him alone and let him do what he does best</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Felipe Scolari, former Portugal manager, is the latest voice to try to paint a different picture of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> off the field]</b> People have a different idea of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>. ‘Oh, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is a snob.’ He is very simple, very humble. He is a loved one. He treats many people like you wouldn’t imagine. In his private life he is fantastic</p>

  <p><b>[Luiz Felipe Scolari claims <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Nicolas Anelka</a> got him sacked at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> after refusing to play on the wing]</b> 
I had <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Anelka</a> playing up front. Nine. Top scorer in the league. The players return, I make a meeting, and in the meeting I say: ‘Look, now that the players have all returned, <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a> is back after two months, we will try to work a situation involving the two attackers playing one by the side, one in the centre, changing positions’<br /><br />Then <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Anelka</a>, the league’s top scorer, said: ‘I do not play on the wing’. Well, that’s when I said: ‘You don’t play on the wing, one’s going to be on the left, it’s over, I’m not going to stay here arguing with you guys. I left there and our team was third in the league, three or four points behind top. Qualified for the round-of-16 or quarter-finals of the Champions League. But there was this bad environment, that situation.<br /><br /><b>[Scolari says the Frenchman created a bad environment for him to manage]</b> I don’t know if I had continued, what would have happened. But it was interrupted. There, I got upset. They’ll say: ‘Oh, because you didn’t speak English perfectly’. Of course, I did not. I didn’t speak English perfectly. But I understood perfectly. We understood, with my English, and the English that was spoken there, we understood perfectly</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Felipe Scolari explains how <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a> and <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Nicolas Anelka</a> clashes cost him <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> job]</b> Our medical department thought that we should let <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> go and recover <b>[from surgery]</b> in Cannes, in the middle of summer. I thought he should stay in London. I’d also like to go to Cannes in the middle of summer. I’d stay there for a month, two months, enjoying myself<br /><br /><b>[In Drogba’s absence, <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Anelka</a> excelled, scoring 14 league goals by Christmas, but upon the Ivorian’s return to fitness further problems surfaced]</b> When he came back, I tried to adapt so that <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> and <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Anelka</a> could play together. <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Anelka</a> was the top scorer in the league. We had a meeting and <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Anelka</a> said: ‘I only play in one position’. So, there was a bit of a lack of friendship, of respect, of trying to play together with <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a>. They were both great, but someone had to do something different, to get back to help when we lost the ball. That was when it changed a bit. But we’ve met since then, me and <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a>. The last time was in Russia in 2018. We spoke openly about it. There wasn’t any ill intention from him or <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Anelka</a>. But it happened and I lost out on one of the great chances of my life</p>
