He’s playing well and has incomparable qualities. If he was Brazilian, he would have a great chance of being selected for the World Cup, but he is fortunate to be able to be a part of a fantastic and spectacular national team. Throughout the world there are players who are head and shoulders above the rest. <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Pirlo</a> is one of those who has marked an era. He would get in any team in any league in the world</p>

For me he is the best guy in the world to work with. He’s always ready, always trying his best, and always looking to try something different. No-one works harder than him. People complain because he puts gel in his hair, because he’s cute or a womaniser. They say he is vain because he puts cream on his legs after a game. Just leave him alone and let him do what he does best</p>

He is a loved one. He treats many people like you wouldn’t imagine. In his private life he is fantastic</p>

  <p><b>[Luiz <a href="felipe.html">Felipe</a> Scolari claims <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Nicolas Anelka</a> got him sacked at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> after refusing to play on the wing]</b>
I had <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Anelka</a> playing up front. Nine. Top scorer in the league. The players return, I make a meeting, and in the meeting I say: ‘Look, now that the players have all returned, <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a> is back after two months, we will try to work a situation involving the two attackers playing one by the side, one in the centre, changing positions’<br /><br />Then <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Anelka</a>, the league’s top scorer, said: ‘I do not play on the wing’. Well, that’s when I said: ‘You don’t play on the wing, one’s going to be on the left, it’s over, I’m not going to stay here arguing with you guys. I left there and our team was third in the league, three or four points behind top. Qualified for the round-of-16 or quarter-finals of the Champions League. But there was this bad environment, that situation.<br /><br /><b>[Scolari says the Frenchman created a bad environment for him to manage]</b> I don’t know if I had continued, what would have happened. But it was interrupted. There, I got upset. They’ll say: ‘Oh, because you didn’t speak English perfectly’. Of course, I did not. I didn’t speak English perfectly. But I understood perfectly. We understood, with my English, and the English that was spoken there, we understood perfectly</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has asked about the Chinese Super League amid talk of a lucrative move]</b> He has asked me more than once what life in China is like, Cristiano Ronaldo. Why is it that Ronaldo cannot go to China? Yes, he asked me what it’s like to live in China, I gave him all the details. We also have to understand that Ronaldo has brands, there’s an industry, China is the biggest country in the world. Then I told him what I always say: whoever has this opportunity has to go to China.</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar will never be like Pele]</b> In Brazil, we know who is Neymar and who is Pele. We know that there is only one Pele and there will never be another. A player can be very good, spectacular even, but they will never be like Pele because he has no heir. Nobody will ever equal him.<br /><br /><b>[When asked if a fellow countryman can match Messi and Ronaldo]</b> At Barcelona, he evolved a lot and he almost reached their level. But it is not something that happens from one day to the next. He is on the right road but he still needs time. Perhaps in one year or two he will be at their level</p>

  <p><b>[Palmeiras boss Luiz Felipe Scolari has revealed that he has been offered the vacant Colombia head coach post]</b> There’s an invite <b>[from Colombia]</b>. It’s a subject that now, with the end of the Brazilian championship, we can think clearly about.<br /><br />In the last 20 or 25 years, I spent 80% of that time outside Brazil. So, there’s some familiar issues to consider<br /><br />There’s another family to consider, the Palmeiras one. The way they treated me, there’s this connection between me and the fans. I have to think. They have to know that when you are in a place where you are recognised, it is worth much more than other situations</p>

We had a meeting and <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Anelka</a> said: ‘I only play in one position’. So, there was a bit of a lack of friendship, of respect, of trying to play together with <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a>. They were both great, but someone had to do something different, to get back to help when we lost the ball. That was when it changed a bit. But we’ve met since then, me and <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a>. The last time was in Russia in 2018. We spoke openly about it. There wasn’t any ill intention from him or <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Anelka</a>. But it happened and I lost out on one of the great chances of my life</p>
