<blockquote>
  <p>[Socceroos defender Milos Degenek was given an early reminder of the importance of learning Japanese in his J.League debut on Saturday] It’s obvious. I come here, I speak English, most of the players don’t speak such good English and I need to learn Japanese. If I learn Japanese then these things don’t happen.<br /><br />It was my mistake. Yeah, it’s a bit difficult with the language and I don’t know what Hiro [Iikura] said but it was my mistake. I should look where the player is, but I will look at the game and analyse the game and look to go forward<br /><br />I’ve just learnt the basics. Like ‘right’, ‘left’, ‘behind you’, ‘danger’, ‘time’ and just basic things I need for football but obviously in a game it’s a lot faster and you need to be able to communicate. I know three languages and now I still need to think of the Japanese. It’s the fourth language. Sometimes I say things in German or English on the field and I’m like ‘nobody understands you, who are you talking to?</p>

  <p>[Red Star Belgrade defender Milos Degenek believes Liverpool were guilty of underestimating his side in their shock 2-0 defeat] We played well and managed to shut them out. Pavkov scored two beautiful goals, but all the boys played really well. Now if only we could play like this every week. I think Liverpool underestimated us and consequently paid for that mistake.<br /><br />I spoke with Milner in the tunnel and he told me he’d never experienced anything like the noise coming from above. I believe we can repeat this against Napoli</p>
