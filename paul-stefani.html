<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Axel Witsel turned down the opportunity to join Manchester United because he would be appreciated more at Borussia Dortmund]</b> We chatted for a moment, Axel says: ‘Maybe I want to leave China’. I say to him laughing: ‘Axel, I promise that I will come up with something really great!’. I remembered that a few months earlier I had been to Dortmund, where I met someone from the club. I call that man and he brings me into contact with the management. Sports director Michael Zorc and CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke invited me to come and talk at a time when Axel was at the World Cup in Russia. There I heard that Dortmund were looking for a player like Witsel. I explained to them that the Portuguese lawyer of Witsel has negotiated a buy-out clause of €20m with Tianjin. That sounded like music to them, because they thought that Tianjin would ask for an amount of around €60m for Axel. When the transfer later started rolling, the Chinese still tried to get out of that buyout clause, but it was conclusive. There were other candidates. Manchester United wanted him, Napoli too. But I told Axel: ‘At Dortmund you are the number one, at Manchester you are one of the many… and at Napoli too.<br /><br />I know from a very good source that Mourinho said he wanted Witsel, but not in the first place. N’Golo Kante topped his list. Eventually Axel said: ‘Do me a favour and finish it as quickly as possible, because I really want to go to Dortmund’.<br /><br />The entire transfer from Axel Witsel has been like a fairy tale. If someone had told me four months ago that I would arrange the transfer from Witsel to Dortmund, I would have said it’s is impossible! Look around … Courtois, nothing yet. Hazard, nothing. Alderweireld, nothing. And who is the first one? Axel Witsel. Without problems, he did not have to skip training or anything to force a move</p>
