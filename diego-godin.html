  <p><b>[Godin says the happiness of the Uruguayan people depends greatly on what we do]</b> The nation of just 3.5 million inhabitants have twice been world champions before, winning in 1930 and 1950<br /><br /><b>[q:It has been a tough season with Atletico. Are you tired ahead of the World Cup?]</b> No, I’m alright. I’m encouraged after a great season in Spain and physically, I’m happy and confident, ready to compete in the World Cup<br /><br /><b>[q:It is your third World Cup and you are the captain. Do you feel the weight of it?]</b> Before, I was younger and less conscious. On and off the field, it is a lot of responsibility and sacrifice to take your country to a World Cup but I enjoy it all the same. Not because I feel like it is my last World Cup but because of how qualifying went. I feel more like the leader of the team and empathise a lot with the fans. I know that the happiness of the Uruguayan people depends a lot on what this team does<br /><br /><b>[q:That much?]</b> Yes. In addition, given our experience and belief, this can be a great World Cup for us, I feel that way. But football will have a say on whether or not I continue <b>[for Uruguay]</b> after this World Cup or go to another<br /><br /><b>[q:You are a competitive animal. You have a rough face on the field and a happy side off it. How do you do that?]</b> <b>[Laughter]</b> I’m not that bad. I’ve always competed like that, from birth. But I know how to flick the switch and change from how I am off the field to on it. I’m with my senses and in control of everything<br /><br /><b>[q:As a young man you were an offensive player and <b>[Enzo]</b> <a href="enzo-francescoli.html">Francescoli</a> was your idol. Are you not tired of the defensive role and of chasing strikers?]</b> As a kid, I played up front but I’m not tired of being in defence. In the beginning, it was tough but I learned to enjoy being a defender. Being a forward gave me many things but as a defender, your focus and concentration must be at the maximum. If I fail, we can lose and any forward can take advantage. I’m aware of that so I play with that responsibility<br /><br /><b>[q:Uruguay never has anything left over’ is something that is always said. Why?]</b> I think it is something cultural. As a country, we suffer a lot in everything and we are few. But we are always honest and fair. In football, we have great names but haven’t done as much as we should. With that motto, we feel strong because it identifies with us and with humility<br /><br /><b>[q:Do you think that <b>[Oscar]</b> <a href="oscar-tabarez.html">Tabarez</a> will change the way he plays?]</b> No. Knowing him, I don’t believe so. He will continue strengthening those who are already here and compliment the new players. We’re very good in possession, technically well equipped<br /><br /><b>[q:You play the same with Atletico as you do with Uruguay. That’s an advantage]</b> Yes, both have solid systems with the 4-4-2. We work very well as a team and can quickly turn defence to attack so I feel good when I’m with both<br /><br /><b>[q:You want to win it, I suppose, but… what would be a good World Cup?]</b> I can’t settle for anything other than winning. That’s my dream. Then, we will take it game by game. First, you have to get through the group stage<br /><br /><b>[q:Yours is the most even group in the tournament. You conclude it against the hosts, Russia]</b> Let’s see where we are when we get there. Uruguay have had difficulties, as happened in the Copa in 2011, when we were eliminated. Before we play Russia, we have two other games<br /><br /><b>[q:How do you imagine facing <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a>? Your opener is against Egypt]</b> Let’s see what happens with his injury. I’ve never faced him but it is clear that he’s very fast and I can’t go up against him in an open game<br /><br /><b>[q:So?]</b> So, football is not just about running. There are other ways to defend against him. With help from teammates, reducing spaces, that kind of thing<br /><br /><b>[q:After Egypt, you face an unknown quality in Saudi Arabia]</b> We will watch videos and we will study them. They aren’t well known but nowadays every team is competitive. You have to respect everyone because this is a World Cup<br /><br /><b>[q:What would be worse for you: facing <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Antoine Griezmann</a>’s France or against Spain of <a href="koke.html">Koke</a>, Saul and <a href="diego-costa.html">Diego Costa</a>?]</b> Those games would be very rare. I play with Uruguay and wouldn’t be focused on anything else but yes, it would be weird… and nice</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Suarez’s ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup still rankles with his Uruguay team-mates]</b> I’m convinced that if what happened against Italy hadn’t happened it would have been a different story. First, we lost our best player. Second, everything that happened affected us: it affected Luis and the rest of us. It was very hard to live through that, to see him dead, crying, fallen, kicked out of the World Cup. The whole country was sunk, indignant - and that was all we talked about until the Colombia game.<br /><br />For an ‘assault’ you get maybe four games. They took him out the World Cup, kicked him out like a dog. He wasn’t allowed at the Copa América. It was disproportionate, unjust, and no one will take that indignation from us<br /><br />Luis has got where he is because of the way he is: you see he gets angry, wound up, he fights, protests, competes. If he wasn’t like that, he wouldn’t be the player he is</p>

  <p><b>[Atletico Madrid captain Diego Godin does not understand how Antoine Griezmann was not nominated in the shortlist to win FIFA’s The Best award]</b> If we look at what he achieved in 2018, I think Antoine deserved to be there. He won the Europa League and was the decisive player in the final, he won the World Cup and was also the best player in the final. I don’t see what else he could have done. Oh yes, win the European Super Cup! And he did that, too<br /><br /><b>[Godin explained that Griezmann’s role]</b> It goes beyond scoring goals or making assists. Above all, he’s a team player who puts the collective before himself and who plays an important tactical function. He knows and feels what he has to do for the common good. He understands the game extremely well and makes the right decisions for others. What’s more, he’s got this intelligence to be in the right place on the field. He makes the difference<br /><br />As a team-mate, as a captain and as a friend, I hope with all my heart that he wins it. I know that it would make him really happy, and everyone at Atletico would share his happiness if that was the case</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Godin has confirmed he will leave Atletico Madrid at the end of the season]</b> I’m more nervous than for any game, it’s the truth. These are going to be my last days at Atletico Madrid. Atleti have been my family, my club and my home, and it’s very hard to say goodbye. I had a wonderful time and I wanted to thank all of you. The most beautiful phase of my career and my life comes to an end. I’m proud to have been a part of this club’s history. I’m very thankful. I refused a Manchester United bid one year ago because I decided to stay at Atlético Madrid. Now - one year later - it’s time to go.<br /><br />To be simple, I am captain of the team, have been here many years. We have not reached an agreement to continue, so my stage here is over. I would like to play here until I’m 40, but that is impossible. For me, the first priority has always been the club, this team, my team-mates. We did not reach an agreement, so I have decided to leave, nothing else. As a kid I dreamed of playing football, playing for Uruguay, playing in Europe, be a big player, but never thought I’d be at a stadium like this with the people cheering your name. There is nothing nicer than that</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Godin has taken aim at critics who have rounded on <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> by suggesting they do not play beautiful football]</b> I’d ask, what does playing well mean? I think there are two different things: it is one thing to play ‘bonito’, to play nice. And it is another to play well. For me playing well is winning. And victory is achieved by defending well and attacking well. There are so many teams that play beautiful football, they hold the ball for I don’t know how many minutes and then they lose. They are not complete, that is not good play. The important thing is the result<br /><br /><b>[Such a mindset has been readily associated with Uruguayan footballers since the nation won the first World Cup in 1930]</b> The whole world asks how it is possible that so many champions come from three-and-a-half million inhabitants. Simple: it is a cultural fact. Only those who have lived there can understand: there is no square meter in the whole country where you do not see a ball rolling and a child running after it. Every family hopes that their child excels and can solve their economic problems. And so we play everywhere: on the road, on a hill, on earth. There is immense competition. And it is played in all weather conditions: cold, heat, rain, sun. We can play in any conditions</p>

The health system collapsed, there are no intensive care beds to attend so many critically ill people and people who may have another illness, they cannot attend to them, so many professional doctors<br /><br />We continued playing for several weeks, we continued training, playing behind closed doors, until the positive of a <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> player was detected and we and the <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> players were quarantined.
