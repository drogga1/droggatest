  <p><b>[Former Real Madrid goalkeeper Santiago Canizares know exactly how it feels to lose a UEFA Champions League Final]</b> I cried more than Atletico fans did. I was famous for crying in the 2001 final versus Bayern Munich. It’s obvious that you feel disappointment, but at the same time there is admiration for having got there.<br /><br />I don’t even know if Kahn said anything. I was in mourning, wondering whether it was possible to rewind and retake our last penalty. At that moment, nothing else matters much. I grew up with the dream of winning the UEFA Champions League<br /><br />I had a really good time with the fans. It’s Impossible to live a match like that with a low pulse. I was sure they were going to lose the MasterCard challenge<br /><br /><b>[Atleti face an uphill task at the Vicente Calderon]</b> The tie is pretty much over. I think that if you had asked both teams beforehand, they would have said that a 3-0 win in the first leg would finish it and that it is impossible to come back<br /><br />The Madrid derby is a match that is charged with emotions and you live it intensely. The Calderon heart is something that is never in doubt and Atletico can always be proud of that. And they can also be proud of their current squad. Before, they were watching on television, but now they are fighting for these titles</p>

  <p><b>[Former Real Madrid goalkeeper Santiago Canizares says that nothing compares to the heart-stopping UEFA Champions League]</b> I had a really good time with the fans. It’s impossible to live a match like that with a low pulse. I was sure they were going to lose the Mastercard challenge.<br /><br />The Champions League is the title with the most prestige, that is something everybody agrees on. It gives prestige to teams, there is the television rights, the fans. It’s a unique competition and, even though they have won it 11 times, Real Madrid fight tooth-and-nail to win it every year<br /><br />Winning the Champions League is the objective of all of the big teams at the start of the season and for some other sides I have played for, winning it was their biggest dream. It is the competition with the most emotions, one that the best players save themselves for. Without doubt, winning the Champions League means being the best team in the world</p>

  <p><b>[The humiliating 7-0 defeat by Barcelona at Camp Nou in the Copa del Rey semi-final first leg]</b> Valencia’s defeat is the worst I can ever remember. I expected him to resign there and then and to apologise. Maybe I’m ignorant but I’m surprised he didn’t resign. I thought he was an honest man.</p>
