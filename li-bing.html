  <p><b>[Li Bing, who is set to be replaced by Spanish coach Gregorio Manzano at Guizhou, had singled out Hulk both at his post-match press conference and later on Weibo]</b> In the corridor, Hulk cursed our assistant coach in English. We argued with him and he punched our assistant coach Yu Ming and caused him to fall to the ground. Foreign players come here to help with the development of Chinese football, but no matter how well you play, you cannot despise Chinese people, let alone beat our Chinese coaches</p>

  <p><b>[Li Bing, Guizhou Zhicheng’s outgoing caretaker coach, has taken to Weibo]</b> I am just an ordinary football coach and I told the whole story in a matter-of-fact way, singling out Hulk for his bad behaviour as a professional player. He is a world-class star and I admire his footballing skills. However, to err is human and I suppose he is afraid to admit when he makes a mistake. The truth is Hulk provoked <b>[my assistant]</b> Li Sheng, started the argument and then punched <b>[another assistant]</b> Yu Ming.<br /><br />What matters is not the seriousness of his punch, but the nature of his behaviour. Given the fact that a CCTV camera is erected in the lobby and another one along the corridor, I am convinced the incident will present itself clearly. Unless the cameras are out of order</p>
