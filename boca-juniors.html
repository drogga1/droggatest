  <p><b>[Boca and River agree to prohibit away fans from Copa Libertadores final]</b> Boca Juniors and River Plate have reached an agreement for the Copa Libertadores final to be played without the presence of away fans. This was agreed <b>[on Monday]</b> afternoon, following a meeting of the presidents of both clubs, <a href="daniel-angelici.html">Daniel Angelici</a> and <a href="rodolfo-d-onofrio.html">Rodolfo D’Onofrio</a>, in the Argentine <a href="fa.html">Football Association</a> headquarters with its president Claudio Tapia present.<br /><br />At the meeting, the presidents of both clubs agreed that despite the local and international appeal generated by the Superclasico with the presence of both sets of fans, this could create problems for members of both clubs.<br /><br />In addition to the 4,000 seats for the away fans, thousands of other seats would also have had to be restricted in order to place an empty space in between as a safety area, narrowing down considerably the available space for the home fans.<br /><br />Despite this decision, Boca Juniors and River Plate value and recognise the interest of president Mauricio Macri in promoting the presence of away fans in the two legs of the final that will have historical significance.<br /><br />To that effect, both clubs commit to take all the necessary measures to make it possible for the presence of both fans in each league match</p>

  <p><b>[Boca Juniors fail in bid to postpone Superliga restart due to Olympic qualifying clash]</b> The new leadership of the club considers that restarting the championship as planned means a sporting disadvantage for our institution, due to the players that we have contributed to the national team, and we ask for the corresponding postponement.<br /><br />If there is something that characterises Boca throughout its history, it is the commitment to the national teams in all its representations. And the only thing we want is to continue with that commitment <b>[while]</b> taking care of the interests of our club, which is the task entrusted to us by the members in the elections of December 8, 2019.<br /><br />For this reason, through a letter to the Superliga authorities signed by president <a href="jorge-amor-ameal.html">Jorge Amor Ameal</a>, Boca requests the postponement of the start of the tournament in question, as well as a meeting to discuss economic aspects</p>

Of course, no one is going to argue that <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Cavani</a> isn’t a great player, but we have to think more about our existing players and believe in them</p>
