  <p><b>[Barcelona ‘200 per cent’ certain that Neymar will stay amid PSG rumours]</b> At 200%, Neymar will not leave the club this summer. This morning I read that the PSG denied it flatly. There is no reason to change the relationship between clubs.<br /><br />We will always talk about players who are part of our squad, we will not talk about players who are not. this is a very attractive club and that makes many want to be here</p>

  <p><b>[Quizzed Yerry Mina’s situation]</b> It’s top secret. We have to be very careful because Yerry Mina arrived last season and he’s very young, but we will see. We will see. The final opinion <b>[on if he stays or goes]</b> is with the coach <b>[Ernesto Valverde]</b>.<br /><br />Yerry’s a great player. As he showed, he’s also a goalscorer, but what we want, above all, is <b>[for him]</b> to defend. Maybe with the national team they want him to score goals, and that does also interest us, but, above all, we need him to defend. We already have players that score goals</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona have been distanced from Ajax defender Matthijs de Ligt]</b> I don’t know why they’re saying this because <b>[De Ligt]</b> hasn’t signed. <b>[Gerard]</b> Pique is evidently one of the best central defenders in the world, if not the best. After him, we have players like <b>[Clement]</b> Lenglet, <b>[Samuel]</b> Umtiti and we’ve signed a very young player in <b>[Jean-Clair]</b> Todibo. The defenders we already have are of the highest level. In De Ligt’s case, we’ll speak with the sporting director at the end of the season and we’ll speak not about De Ligt, but about what they say</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona vice-president Jordi Mestre has admitted that everyone likes Paul Pogba]</b> Everyone likes Pogba. But not every player that we like comes to Barcelona. I like him a lot, you can’t question the quality that Pogba has, but you could say the same about <b>[Mohamed]</b> Salah or <b>[Eden]</b> Hazard - they’re world class. But not all world class players, and those that I like, come to Barcelona. What we need to do is make sure those that are with us at the moment are very happy<br /><br />Rakitic has a contract <b>[at Barcelona]</b>, we renewed it last year. He’s a great player, a very important one in the squad and he’s a sensational person. We’re in love with Rakitic</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona vice-president Mestre believes Catalan giants’ success can help grow female football]</b> Football and society are linked aspects. We must speak about female football as we do with a female surgeon or a female entrepreneur, with no differences. Success brings media attention and they bring it to the public. Progressing in the Champions League allowed us to be on the front pages of many newspapers and televisions, this is already a big success.<br /><br /><b>[Lyon]</b> have won UCL many times because, between other aspects, they have a higher budget than us and they don’t have the amount of professional teams as we have. The female team has shown a very high capacity for progression. They turned from an amateur team with no professional local players and a low budget to a professional team since 2015, with a higher budget and resources and a lot of local and international players whereas the male team experienced this process a long time ago<br /><br />We have a very important role here. I’ve known the female team since we arrived in 2010 and since then it has grown a lot, not only at Barcelona. In our case, winning the league in 2011 allowed us to play in the Champions League and we felt a big improvement which was reflected in the social aspect, and it has kept growing since then. After that, Iberdrola joined as a sponsor and the games began to be televised and now the engagement is even higher<br /><br />Reaching the semi-finals and now the final is already a success. We began in 2010 with no titles and we were able to win La Liga, Copa de la Reina and Copa Catalunya, and we have been growing in Europe - but winning the Champions League would be a good prize</p>

  <dd>Vice-president Jordi Mestre has stepped down from his role, leaving <a href="josep-maria-bartomeu.html">Josep Bartomeu</a> as the main engine behind the pursuit of <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>. The upheaval behind the scenes at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> has added a new chapter with yet another boardroom exit - but it can confirm that will not affect <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>’s status as the club’s top transfer target this summer. Of the group of directors that engineered the Brazilian’s controversial, murky arrival back in 2013, president <a href="josep-maria-bartomeu.html">Josep Maria Bartomeu</a> is now the sole survivor. Jordi Mestre, <a href="josep-maria-bartomeu.html">Bartomeu</a>’s vice, has resigned from his post, a further sign of the internal battles that have afflicted <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> over the last four years</dd>

I came off badly in that. If he had come back and the club had benefitted because of it, I wouldn’t have a problem with that. I’m not that proud. On sporting terms he could come back but on a series of conditions. Firstly, <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> have to agree, then he would have to withdraw his lawsuit and acknowledge that he was in the wrong and after that, all the birthday parties in Brazil would have to stop. There were players from the first team squad who were at a wedding with him but had no idea that he wanted to leave<br /><br />I felt I’d been fighting an uphill battle for some time. I had a different ideas about things to other board members but it wasn’t important. I realised that I was the only one who thought in a certain way. The football committee which comprised <b>[Josep Maria]</b> <a href="josep-maria-bartomeu.html">Bartomeu</a>, <b>[Javier]</b> Bordas, <b>[Jaume]</b> Elias and <b>[Xavier]</b> <a href="xavier-vilajoana.html">Vilajoana</a> were not in agreement with me or with <a href="pep-segura.html">Pep Segura</a> in his role as general manager. I was the only one who defended him and I felt alone<br /><br />You have to recognise the merits of everything they have achieved in recent years. The least they deserve is some respect and gratitude but you also have to be aware that nothing lasts forever. We are going through a transition and so you have to give people time and be patient</p>

  <p><b>[Jordi Mestre has revealed that the club has attempted to sign both <a href="thibaut-courtois.html">Thibaut Courtois</a> and <a href="alvaro-morata.html">Alvaro Morata</a> in recent years]</b> There was insistent talk of signing <a href="thibaut-courtois.html">Courtois</a>, but they finally brought in <b>[Marc-Andre]</b> <a href="marc-andre-ter-stegen.html">ter Stegen</a> at the discretion of Zubizarreta<br /><br />Following the opinion of the players, bringing <a href="alvaro-morata.html">Morata</a> would have created a possible conflict in the locker room. He would have liked to play and not be a substitute. There were two issues with <a href="alvaro-morata.html">Morata</a> - one concerned controlling the club’s budget which <a href="pep-segura.html">Pep Segura</a> was in charge of and he was always extremely careful about not going over budget. Then there was the sporting side - <a href="alvaro-morata.html">Morata</a> was an international and, therefore, not the kind of player who should be sat on the bench in every game. He didn’t want to be a substitute and the atmosphere within the squad was very good - if he had joined, it would have unsettled that but, as I say, it’s not the players who make those decisions<br /><br />I felt I’d been fighting an uphill battle for some time.
