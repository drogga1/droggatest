  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> vice president Jordi Mestre has resigned amid reports he is unhappy about the apparently imminent dismissal of sporting director Pep Segura]</b> Jordi Mestre, until today the vice president responsible for sports at the club, presented his irrevocable resignation this afternoon. Jordi Mestre wishes to thank the trust placed in him by the presidents <a href="sandro-rosell.html">Sandro Rosell</a> and <a href="josep-maria-bartomeu.html">Josep Maria Bartomeu</a>, and the opportunity and honour of having served and defended the interests of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">FC Barcelona</a>.</p>

<p>: 2019 07 04b
Vice-president Jordi Mestre has stepped down from his role, leaving <a href="josep-maria-bartomeu.html">Josep Bartomeu</a> as the main engine behind the pursuit of Neymar. The upheaval behind the scenes at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> has added a new chapter with yet another boardroom exit - but it can confirm that will not affect Neymar’s status as the club’s top transfer target this summer. Of the group of directors that engineered the Brazilian’s controversial, murky arrival back in 2013, president <a href="josep-maria-bartomeu.html">Josep Maria Bartomeu</a> is now the sole survivor. Jordi Mestre, <a href="josep-maria-bartomeu.html">Bartomeu</a>’s vice, has resigned from his post, a further sign of the internal battles that have afflicted Camp Nou over the last four years</p>

  <p><b>[Jordi Mestre said <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> can forget about birthday parties in Brazil if the <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> star returns to Camp Nou]</b> The players asked for him, but didn’t pressure the club. I came off badly in that. If he had come back and the club had benefitted because of it, I wouldn’t have a problem with that. I’m not that proud. On sporting terms he could come back but on a series of conditions. Firstly, <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> have to agree, then he would have to withdraw his lawsuit and acknowledge that he was in the wrong and after that, all the birthday parties in Brazil would have to stop. There were players from the first team squad who were at a wedding with him but had no idea that he wanted to leave<br /><br />I felt I’d been fighting an uphill battle for some time. I had a different ideas about things to other board members but it wasn’t important. I realised that I was the only one who thought in a certain way. The football committee which comprised <b>[Josep Maria]</b> <a href="josep-maria-bartomeu.html">Bartomeu</a>, <b>[Javier]</b> Bordas, <b>[Jaume]</b> Elias and <b>[Xavier]</b> <a href="xavier-vilajoana.html">Vilajoana</a> were not in agreement with me or with <a href="pep-segura.html">Pep Segura</a> in his role as general manager. I was the only one who defended him and I felt alone<br /><br />You have to recognise the merits of everything they have achieved in recent years. The least they deserve is some respect and gratitude but you also have to be aware that nothing lasts forever. We are going through a transition and so you have to give people time and be patient</p>

  <p><b>[Jordi Mestre has revealed that the club has attempted to sign both <a href="thibaut-courtois.html">Thibaut Courtois</a> and <a href="alvaro-morata.html">Alvaro Morata</a> in recent years]</b> There was insistent talk of signing <a href="thibaut-courtois.html">Courtois</a>, but they finally brought in <b>[Marc-Andre]</b> <a href="marc-andre-ter-stegen.html">ter Stegen</a> at the discretion of Zubizarreta<br /><br />Following the opinion of the players, bringing <a href="alvaro-morata.html">Morata</a> would have created a possible conflict in the locker room. He would have liked to play and not be a substitute. There were two issues with <a href="alvaro-morata.html">Morata</a> - one concerned controlling the club’s budget which <a href="pep-segura.html">Pep Segura</a> was in charge of and he was always extremely careful about not going over budget. Then there was the sporting side - <a href="alvaro-morata.html">Morata</a> was an international and, therefore, not the kind of player who should be sat on the bench in every game. He didn’t want to be a substitute and the atmosphere within the squad was very good - if he had joined, it would have unsettled that but, as I say, it’s not the players who make those decisions<br /><br />I felt I’d been fighting an uphill battle for some time. I had different ideas about things to other board members but it wasn’t important. I realised that I was the only one who thought in a certain way. The football committee which comprised <a href="josep-maria-bartomeu.html">Josep Maria Bartomeu</a>, Javier Bordas, Silvio Elias, and <a href="xavier-vilajoana.html">Xavier Vilajoana</a> were not in agreement with me or with <a href="pep-segura.html">Pep Segura</a> in his role as general manager.

  <p><b>[Camp Nou is in crisis, with threats of legal action hanging over a boardroom dispute that looks set to have serious ramifications on and off the field]</b> It’s a divided board.
