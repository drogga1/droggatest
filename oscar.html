  <p><b>[<a href="guus-hiddink.html">Hiddink</a> confirms he will be leaving <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> Based on how well Guus has been doing so far, he could very well stay. He’s a very nice guy. Very smiley. He always looks to create a happy, positive environment. He has a very positive influence here and we’ve been playing well. We’ve had a lot of draws in that time but overall, in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, things have been going a lot better and it has given a huge boost of confidence to all the players<br /><br />And also for me on a personal level because I’m playing much better. And also for me on a personal level because I’m playing much better. Since he’s a popular figure, there’s a good chance he’ll stay</p>

  <p><b>[Oscar considers the high-profile players to have joined the ranks of the Chinese Super League to be pioneers]</b> I am one of the pioneers, along with those players who went before me, and I’m coming to China to help the league and help more players get to know this league. It is good for football that the game grows in new areas of the world. China has invested a lot of money in the league and every team now has good players. This will help raise the level of the league and football in the country. I haven’t stayed there a long time yet, just two days in Shanghai, but the impressions were great, the buildings are amazing and it is a very nice city. My priority is to win the league this season.<br /><br />My focus is on China but I still watch the Premier League sometimes. Of course I support Chelsea</p>

  <p><b>[Former Chelsea attacker Oscar has been banned by the Chinese Football Association for inciting a brawl]</b> Oscar’s immoral foul, which sparked a massive bust-up on the pitch, has had a huge negative impact on China’s professional football leagues. The CFA alway attaches great importance to the issue of discipline, taking great pains to root out the violent fouls and other unsportsmanlike behaviour. Hopefully disciplinary offences would be severely punished by all clubs and efforts shall be made to maintain the order of the games and protect the development of football.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Chelsea forward Oscar admits he could have a future in Europe despite having turned down Atletico Madrid and Juventus to head for China]</b> When I made my decision to come here, I was certainly thinking more of my family than of my career. Because in my career I had other very good offers from big teams in Europe. But I thought a little more of my family, and after that - I am still young - I can return. Whatever decision I make, somebody will talk good or bad about it, you know?<br /><br />When I was talking with Shanghai, I was talking to big clubs from Europe, as well. There was Atletico Madrid, who I almost joined. I liked them very much and what they were offering me at the time. There was also Juventus, Inter, and AC Milan. I had some options. But I opted for Shanghai and afterwards I can still return to Europe</p>

  <p><b>[What happened to Oscar? The ex-Chelsea wonderkid paid £21m a year in China]</b> Every football player, or every person who works, wants to earn money to help their families. I came from a social background in Brazil that is very poor. We didn’t have anything. This is the fruit of my work and when I earn this, it is because I conquered it. The same way I came here, I will be able to return to Europe.</p>

I can’t go into details, but, yes, one thing I can say: I want to play in Italy</p>
