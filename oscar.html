  <p><b>[<a href="guus-hiddink.html">Hiddink</a> confirms he will be leaving <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> Based on how well Guus has been doing so far, he could very well stay. He’s a very nice guy. Very smiley. He always looks to create a happy, positive environment. He has a very positive influence here and we’ve been playing well. We’ve had a lot of draws in that time but overall, in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, things have been going a lot better and it has given a huge boost of confidence to all the players<br /><br />And also for me on a personal level because I’m playing much better. And also for me on a personal level because I’m playing much better. Since he’s a popular figure, there’s a good chance he’ll stay</p>

  <p><b>[Oscar considers the high-profile players to have joined the ranks of the Chinese Super League to be pioneers]</b> I am one of the pioneers, along with those players who went before me, and I’m coming to China to help the league and help more players get to know this league. It is good for football that the game grows in new areas of the world. China has invested a lot of money in the league and every team now has good players. This will help raise the level of the league and football in the country. I haven’t stayed there a long time yet, just two days in Shanghai, but the impressions were great, the buildings are amazing and it is a very nice city. My priority is to win the league this season.<br /><br />My focus is on China but I still watch the Premier League sometimes. Of course I support Chelsea</p>

I can’t go into details, but, yes, one thing I can say: I want to play in Italy</p>
