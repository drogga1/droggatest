<blockquote>
  <p>[Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths has encouraged those who suffer from depression to open up about their feelings if possible] It was a slow drip that was building up and building up, and <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> saw that and stepped in. I owe a thank you to him because if he never stepped in who knows where I’d be. But I am trying to look forward now and be positive and trying to get minutes on the park and look forward to the season ahead<br /><br />[That is something he believes can not only help him, but others who also suffer from depression with his hope that others can be aided before it is too late] I’m just trying to be a bit more open, not keep stuff in, and just speak to people. Regardless of who it is - team-mates, coaches, PR people at the club, whoever it is. Just try to open up and if you’ve got something on your mind just say it, because ultimately you could be back in the same place and I don’t want to be there. What is happening in society nowadays, a lot of people are taking their own lives, and maybe if they open up and speak a little bit, it can save lives. Anybody who is suffering, open up and speak to someone. There is a lot of people out there that will help<br /><br />[Griffiths further credited those around him for getting him on the road to recovery] ’s been very hard, very lonely at times. Without the help of the club, friends, family and support that I had, I wouldn’t be sitting here now. So it’s a massive thank you to them. It’s been a long, difficult road but thankfully there is light at the end of the tunnel<br /><br />[Neil Lennon, is no stranger to mental health challenges] When he got the job it was a big relief for me because he went through it himself. If I have to turn to someone for advice or ask questions or just to speak to someone then he’d be the man. He gave me a clean slate and said this is a new season, go and do what you can do, show everyone you can still be a top player and that’s what I aim to do<br /><br />[Griffiths also thanked the support he has received from across the country] Not just Celtic fans but fans all over Scotland. Rival fans that see me as that rogue on the pitch, but away from that I’m just a man who tries to look after my family. It’s nice to see that fans can put football rivalry aside</p>

  <p>[Celtic vs Nomme Kalju. One man particularly eager to prove himself in the weeks ahead is Leigh Griffiths, who spent much of the 2018-19 season on personal leave to fight mental health challenges] It was very hard being away, and very lonely at times. Without the help of the club and support of friends and family I wouldn’t be sitting here now. It’s a massive thank you to them. It’s been a long and difficult road but thankfully there’s light at the end of the tunnel. Neil Lennon told me this season is clean slate and told me to go and show everyone that you can still be a top player - and that’s what I’m trying to do</p>
