  <p><b>[Patrizia Panico speaks about becoming the country’s first woman to manage a male national team]</b> I get a lot of letters from girls who have been excluded from football because they’re told it’s a sport for boys, or girls who play in mixed teams who never receive a pass from the boys. But times are changing. Women are slowly reaching roles that were previously denied to them. And in fact, it’s about time</p>

  <p><b>[Patrizia Panico hosted <a href="sarina-wiegman.html">Sarina Wiegman</a> across an intensive five-day training camp, during which her side played twice (against Turkey), and <a href="sarina-wiegman.html">Wiegman</a> observed the games as well as training and analysis sessions]</b> We get together 45 minutes before the training session starts and I explain to her what I’m going to do on the pitch. We talk about it together and then she comes to see the session. Afterwards we talk about how it went: the things that could be improved, the things that worked well. We talk about it all<br /><br />Then, in the matches we talk about the team I’ve picked. And we have a chat after the match too. She tells me how she thinks it went and what she didn’t like. It’s what a tutor does<br /><br /><b>[And their targets for the end of the Coach Mentorship Programme in November?]</b> To be fluent in English! <b>[laugh]</b><br /><br /><b>[Despite progress in recent years, women in the men’s game clearly still face some obstacles]</b> Maybe the biggest difficulty is the scepticism you see more from the outside than with the team. The players don’t care whether they’re coached by a man or a woman. The Federation, Club Italia and Maurizio Viscidi <b>[co-ordinator of the <a href="figc.html">FIGC</a>’s youth teams]</b> have shown a lot of faith in me<br /><br />Maybe there’s a bit of fear <b>[from the outside]</b>, the fear of seeing a woman in the dugout in the men’s game, of seeing that change. When something new happens it always generates a bit of fear. The way I see it, it’s more a question of getting people used to seeing women in the dugout, just as we’ve become used to seeing female police officers, lawyers and surgeons</p>

  <p><b>[Patrizia Panico traces her decorated career path]</b> I think the correct thing would be to say that I want to coach professionals. Then it makes no difference whether those professionals are men or women. That’s how I feel it. And from there a whole world opens up. I don’t think there should be any differentiation</p>
