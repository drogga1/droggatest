  <p><b>[Bradford support Ben Richards-Everton in taking action against police]</b> Bradford City is aware of an incident involving defender Ben Richards-Everton, which recently occurred in the West Midlands. The incident caused our player serious alarm and distress, and, having reviewed all of the evidence made available to us, we have instructed our specialist legal partners to take the matter further - on his behalf. We support our player’s judgement in making the matter public, as he saw fit, and would like to take this opportunity to thank our partners, Opus Law, for handling the matter. As the situation is now being dealt with legally, the club will be making no further comment at this time</p>

  <p><b>[Ben Richards-Everton says he felt humiliated when he was handcuffed by police in the area where he grew up after his vehicle was stopped]</b> People were outside the shops. People were recording it on their phones. It was just a bit embarrassing for me. I grew up in that area. The shopkeeper knows who I am. Having spoken to the shopkeeper just before it happened - he was saying ‘my god you’ve grown up so much’. He didn’t recognise me because of my beard, and stuff like that. We just had a bit of laugh and then to come out and … … obviously, he saw all of this. It was just embarrassing for me. My little sister was across the road and she must have missed what happened by, literally, minutes because she was over the road getting food for the family. She’s only 13 years old, I thank the Lord she did not witness this, her older brother going through something like this.<br /><br /><b>[Richards-Everton said he was left shaken by the episode at the time and still remains affected by the incident today]</b> I was distressed at the time, and all sorts of emotions were running through me and I tried to act as calmly as possible. But at the same time I was upset by the fact of what was happening. I’m just very distressed <b>[in general]</b> about the situation to be honest and I really want to get to the bottom of why this happened. I need answers</p>
