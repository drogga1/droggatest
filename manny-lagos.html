  <p>[Trades looming as MLS draft shapes up to be a wild one] We’re not going to look at the pick as anything other than trying to make our team better. The idea of having the pick because we’re supposed to have the pick and it would look good and shiny for TV? No. We’re going to take our time and think about what makes sense for us in the club. I think the staff did a lot of good work looking at the college soccer season and assessing it. I think we did a good job of it, and I think the kids have played really well and that just increases the value and asset of the No. 1 pick.</p>

  <p>[Minnesota United has signed American winger Josh Gatt. The 25-year-old joins Minnesota after spending the past six seasons with Norwegian side Molde] Josh has been on the American soccer radar for years. He’s a young player who left for Europe to build his career. He’s had some really good moments, and a couple of tough injuries. But I think this situation lines up perfectly, in regards to where Josh is as a player, and what we’re doing as a club.</p>

  <p>[Minnesota United has acquired keeper Bobby Shuttleworth from the New England Revolution in exchange for Femi Hollinger-Janzen] Bobby’s a great player who has had a lot of strong performances in goal for New England. His experience and quality will be an important addition and asset throughout the season here with the club</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Minnesota United announced the signing of Jan Gregus as the club’s third ever designated player] We are getting a really talented player who adds quality to an area of the field where we need to improve. Jan has been playing very well for his club and his country and he has great intentions to lift our club. We believe he can be our anchor in the midfield. He is a technical player in the middle of the field who will be a connector both offensively and defensively. He’s the type of player that we need in order to continue the development of our roster and our club.</p>
