<blockquote>
  <p>[Laurent Koscielny’s agent says the Arsenal captain was considering following Arsene Wenger out of the club before suffering an injury last season] At that time, Laurent was playing what might have been his final matches with Arsenal. Laurent started to consider a possible move away from Arsenal at the same time as Arsene. The moment was right, leaving as [a] new coach arrived. I had already anticipated this and two or three offers were making us think hard. We were open to a number of options. China was one, as much as a return to France. Laurent could not see himself playing for another English team outside of Arsenal. Since Marseille’s approach last season, the idea of a Ligue 1 return got him thinking – it was a real possibility.</p>
