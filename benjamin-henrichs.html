  <p><b>[Monaco sign €20m Benjamin Henrichs from Bayer Leverkusen]</b> I am very proud to be involved with AS Monaco, a European top club for many years. I will do everything to adapt quickly and help the team win many victories. I cannot wait to work with the staff and my new teammates.</p>

  <p><b>[Monaco full-back Benjamin Henrichs says it would be interesting if Thierry Henry replaced Leonardo Jardim]</b> For me, he’s an extraordinary player, a legend of Arsenal. It would be interesting if he comes here. But I can’t say more.</p>

  <p><b>[Monaco full-back Benjamin Henrichs believes Thierry Henry still has the potential to become a great coach]</b> I suffered with him. When a coach is sacked, it usually means that you’ve done something wrong as a team. For him personally, it is extremely sad. Although he did not succeed in Monaco, I’m convinced that he has the potential to become a great coach.<br /><br /> I was thrilled to get a legend like Henry as a coach. I really enjoyed training and playing under him. You can learn a lot from such a football personality. After the first training session for a moment I thought, ‘I’m dreaming’. Suddenly Thierry Henry was my coach. When he played at Arsenal or Barcelona, he was one of my biggest heroes and I cheered him in front of the TV. That he now gave me advice seemed almost surreal. For me personally, it was an outstanding time<br /><br />He is a perfectionist and has put a lot of emphasis on doing every single exercise cleanly. He was a little fanatic and I think he has learned a lot from Pep Guardiola from his time at Barcelona. He took over the team in a very difficult phase because nobody knew exactly how to deal with the relegation battle. In addition, some regular players were injured and young players with less experience had to fill these gaps. It <b>[the situatuon]</b> was very unfortunate for him<br /><br />Henry was one of the stars of the campaign and in one of the spots he showed one of his most famous skills. Even as a kid, I tried this skill often but never did it. After a training session I asked him about it and he practised with me for 25 minutes until I actually got it. After that, I went straight into the dressing room because I’m not sure I’ll ever do it again</p>

I think you should set goals. When I still was still in school in Leverkusen, I lived in Cologne and used to go past the BayArena by train every day. I always thought: ‘Please, dear God, let me play there’ - and now I’m a professional and living my dream. It’s important that you know where you want to go. That you have a goal in mind and that you are able to give everything, even when you are not playing</p>
