  <p><b>[Benjamin Henrichs names <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> star as toughest opponent]</b> In the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> it was <a href="douglas-costa.html">Douglas Costa</a> when we played against Bayern. He is so fast and nimble that it was not easy to defend. <b>[In Ligue 1]</b> I think <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>. With him, you don’t know what to expect. You really have to look at the ball and not at his body movements. He is very, very difficult to defend against<br /><br /><b>[When it comes to team-mates]</b> <a href="kai-havertz.html">Kai Havertz</a> is the greatest talent we have in Germany and in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> he was definitely my strongest team-mate<br /><br /><b>[Bayern Munich, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and Inter were reportedly interested in Henrichs and he takes the speculation as a sign that he is doing well on the field]</b> The fact that you are associated with such top clubs indicates that you have performed well and that your performances are rewarded. I think you should set goals. When I still was still in school in Leverkusen, I lived in Cologne and used to go past the BayArena by train every day. I always thought: ‘Please, dear God, let me play there’ - and now I’m a professional and living my dream. It’s important that you know where you want to go. That you have a goal in mind and that you are able to give everything, even when you are not playing</p>
