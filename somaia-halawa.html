  <p><b>[Mr Halawa’s sister Somaia confirmed that embassy officials had told them by phone that their safe passage from the mosque had been guaranteed. However, she said they did not feel they could leave the building safely]</b> There were thugs outside shouting that if we went outside they were going to kill us. There was also a curfew in place. We didn’t have the right to leave. We believed that if we left at that time, they had the right to arrest us</p>

  <p><b>[Recounting August 17, 2013, the day of their arrest]</b> We went to join a peaceful protest against the Rabaa massacre days earlier, where 1,000 people or so were killed. At 5pm we reached Ramses Square but there were police officers and thugs on the other side. Every time we headed to a different street there were more, and they were shooting at us. To avoid this, we went to the al-Fateh mosque.<br /><br />As we entered, all we could see was dead people around us. When we saw that the media was present, we felt calmer and safer. There was a feeling that no one could attack the mosque. But as soon as the media connection was lost, they attacked. <b>[A rush of tear gas, live fire and rubber-coated steel bullets hit the mosque]</b> Ibrahim had us surrounded in his arms. Everything was going to hit him first in the back. He was trying to protect us, even at 17<br /><br /><b>[Somaia says their mother ‘sees him behind two wired fences’ - a vision which has further depressed Ibrahim]</b> He has said in a letter that he can see mum crying and that he knows she’s upset because she can’t touch me physically</p>

  <p><b>[The Halawa family insist his imprisonment is unlawful and unjust]</b> We want to come together to show Ibrahim our support and that we haven’t forgotten him. We also want to call on an end to this nightmare. We call on more serious and assertive action to be taken to help free Ibrahim</p>
