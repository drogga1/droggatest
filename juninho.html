  <p><b>[A proposed return to Barcelona for Neymar has the support of Juninho]</b> If I was the owner of a football club, I’d want to have Neymar too. He’s one of the best players in the world. Who wouldn’t want a player like that in their team?<br /><br />He had the opportunity to create space for other players. His role is very important for the national team. We had a very good performance with individual players playing very well, like Gabriel Jesus, Daniel Alves and also Alisson, who was very confident. I think they make a difference, it is important that in competitive matches we look at the finer details to win</p>

  <p><b>[Nabil Fekir may still leave Lyon but the Ligue 1 club will sanction no other departures following a period of upheaval]</b> For now, the only possible departure is Fekir. I have spoken with him. It was about personal things, to know his life. I translated for the coach. <b>[Sylvinho]</b> likes him personally. It’s hard to convince him to continue – he’s a world champion and his generation has left. It’s not a closed matter, but I’m telling you the truth. We would like to keep him.<br /><br /><b>[Juninho, speaking at the presentation of new left-back Youssouf Kone, confirmed talks are continuing with Sampdoria centre-back Joachim Andersen]</b> We will be far ahead in the transfer market if we sign Andersen. I’m quite satisfied</p>

We can’t offer the same salary as <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, but we will wait for the right moment. We exchanged messages when I was in Brazil. I felt like he would like to come.

  <p><b>[Lyon sporting director Juninho has confirmed <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> have priority access to re-signing <a href="memphis-depay.html">Memphis Depay</a>]</b> It’s true that <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> have a priority to buy back <a href="memphis-depay.html">Memphis Depay</a>. These things exist in football. But until now, we’ve not received anything on Memphis.<br /><br />Each time there’s only a year left on a contract, the conversation over a renewal becomes rather difficult. But I think that he’s really happy in <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> at the moment. It’s also the same with Moussa <a href="ousmane-dembele.html">Dembele</a>, but the president and those that know football are conscious that, if you want to start winning titles again, to fight in the Champions League and in <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a>, it’s important to keep players like that in the squad for a long time. For the moment, nothing is being done concerning Memphis. We’ll start discussing a contract extension by the end of the year<br /><br />It’s head coach <a href="rudi-garcia.html">Rudi Garcia</a> who decides who the captain is. He’s almost given it to Memphis. I think he deserves it today. He’s really a technical leader and he’s got a little more importance in the locker room too</p>

  <p><b>[Lyon sporting director Juninho has admitted that the club could lose both Houssem Aouar and <a href="moussa-dembele.html">Moussa Dembele</a> this summer, but he hopes that <a href="memphis-depay.html">Memphis Depay</a> can be persuaded to sign a new contract]</b> Moussa and Houssem are among the best players in the squad but their cases are different. Houssem came through the academy here and he’s been here a long time. He brings a technical touch in the midfield, but we know that most young players trained at the club with the talent of Houssem will leave at one time or another. It’s president <a href="jean-michel-aulas.html">Jean-Michel Aulas</a> who will decide. If we receive propositions, we’ll analyse them but he’s an important player. Moussa’s had a good season and still has a margin to progress. He’s a pure centre forward who brings us strength and presence in the box. He scores goals. If we lose a player of that level, we’ll look for replacements of the same standard<br /><br />When you lose a big star due to injury a year and a half from the end of his contract, it’s a challenge. Memphis is really important to us. We hope he’ll stay and we’ve started talks on an extension. He’s enjoyed being here and has taken the captain’s armband. He’s become a true leader. I hope we find a solution<br /><br />We know that after six months out, players need time to regain their form, but in any given match he can help us with his talent and his desire. I think he’ll be ready to play <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, even if it’s up to <a href="rudi-garcia.html">Rudi Garcia</a> to decide. Maybe if he helps up win matches like that and he feels there’s a strong project behind him, he might decide to stay.</p>
