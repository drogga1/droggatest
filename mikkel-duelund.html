  <p>[Chelsea and Maurizio Sarri will continue their hunt for European success when they welcome Dynamo Kiev to Stamford Bridge in the last 16 of the Europa League] We don’t fear Chelsea - but of course we have a lot of respect. Chelsea have struggled a bit, maybe sometimes needed a bit more structure in their style this season, even though their players have fantastic individual quality. There is a great self-confidence in Dynamo, a great top-club culture and winning mentality. It is a huge club used to winning titles. Dynamo has a great history in Europe and of course we want to write a new chapter. We have a good squad, and we know our own quality. We know how to work hard and we know how to work together. That is probably our best weapon against Chelsea - our teamwork</p>

  <p>[Dynamo Kiev ace Mikkel Duelund is confident that his side can provide a stern test for Chelsea] We don’t fear Chelsea - but of course we have a lot of respect. Chelsea have struggled a bit, maybe sometimes needed a bit more structure in their style this season - even though their players have fantastic individual quality. Of course, it is a difficult opponent for us - as they would be for anybody. There is a great self-confidence in Dynamo - a great top-club culture and winning mentality. It is a huge club used to winning titles and with the DNA of always playing in Europe - both Champions League and Europa League. Dynamo has a great history in Europe and of course we want to write a new chapter. We have a good squad, and we know our own quality. We know how to work hard - and we know how to work together. That is probably our best weapon against Chelsea - our teamwork.<br /><br />When I played with FC Midtjylland, we beat Manchester United at home in a Europe League game, and Dynamo is at a much higher level than I was used to in Denmark. So I have a lot of expectations and hopes on behalf of my new club. I know from beating United that anything can happen on the pitch. But I also have a lot of respect for a great opponent like Chelsea. We have a few problems with injuries - like Fran Sol and myself plus a ban for our really important offensive player Benjamin Verbic, but if we get a good result at Stamford Bridge, our chances will be very much alive back in Kyiv with more than 70,000 in our amazing stadium<br /><br />I have been working hard to be back for the Chelsea games - and the second leg is my realistic goal. I had a double ankle fracture in our Europa League match in December, but my recovery has been fantastic, and I am back more than a month quicker than expected. I have been training with the team for the last week, so I am close. It has been a huge motivation to get back to face Chelsea because games like this in the knockout phase of the Europa League are what I was dreaming of when I moved to Dynamo from FC Midtjylland last summer. I was 20, and I had played 100 games already at the Danish top level, and so I needed a great club like Dynamo to step up to another level than back home in Denmark. I am at an early stage of my career, where it is all about learning and developing myself to become the player that I believe I can be<br /><br />After my injury I can’t wait to be back on the pitch for what looks like an incredible final phase of the season. We are second in the league and play for the Ukrainian championship, we face Chelsea in the Europa League - and I am looking so much forward to the U-21 Euros this summer with Denmark</p>

  <p>[Mikkel Duelund is aiming to fire Denmark to the semi-finals of the 2019 European Under-21 Championship] We have a lot of quality in our squad - so look out for us. We can’t wait for the Euros to start, and we want to jump to the centre of the stage. So bring it on! If we reach our best level, we could have a really great tournament. Our ambition is the semi-finals - and when you are there, then everything can happen. We’re an attacking team. We enjoy having possession, creating chances for each other, usually scoring lots of goals, and when things work out for us, we really look good. Of course, one of the challenges for us is to keep the balance in the team because everybody wants to attack, and we can’t be naive when coming up against quality opposition in the Euros. Germany are the favourites in our group, but we always play to win.<br /><br />[Denmark suffered setbacks in friendly matches against Spain and England] We won the qualifying group in front of Poland, who were good and still managed to go through to the finals via the play-offs, and then we learned an important lesson in friendlies against England and Spain - and definitely learned how not to play against the best teams. A good part of the regular players were missing in those two games, but that happened for us again this year, when we met another two great U21 teams in Belgium and France. We had improved a lot tactically and won both these games. That gave us a good boost of belief in ourselves before the Euros.<br /><br />Under-21 football is about learning and developing, but definitely also about playing good football and then obviously about winning. I was also a part of our ‘old’ U21 team in the Euros two years ago, and it is always great to represent your country at a big tournament, but this time it is a culmination of all the years with the youth national teams, growing up and developing together. As a group we are looking so much forward to this ‘last night with the gang’ at the Euros<br /><br />[Duelund departed Midtjylland for the Ukraine last summer] A lot of us have left Denmark to play abroad in big clubs, and that has raised the level of the individuals and of the team for sure. I chose myself to develop in the Danish Superligaen, playing more than 100 games and winning two league titles with FC Midtjylland, before moving to Dynamo last summer. And I must say, that it is a huge step to take to go to a top club in Ukraine. The Danish league is not bad, but it is not in the top 10 in Europe - like the Ukrainian league, for example, where the technical level and the tempo is much higher.<br /><br />For all of us it is a big step to go to a bigger and better league than Superligaen, but that step is not only a big advantage, but actually necessary in order to develop into an international quality player. When you move abroad, your entire focus is on football, and you mature a lot as a person - and therefore, in my opinion, also as a player - when you are learning a new language and how to adapt in a new country. And then, of course, the much higher level in football - when you perform at a higher level both at training and in matches, obviously you have to develop yourself every day<br /><br />I can’t wait for the Euros to kick-off, but after that I also have my eyes set on next season. During my time out with injury I have actually settled in the club and in Kiev extremely well, I have learned the language pretty well, and it is a pleasure to play for this huge club. Dynamo is a club with a great young squad, and we want to go for the title next season - but it is also a historic giant, who has the record for most league titles in both the Soviet Union and the Ukraine, and a club that has developed Ballon d’Or winners as well. And that greatness is in the air in the magnificent training ground, our stadium, which was used for the Champions League final last year, and in Kiev in general.<br /><br />I am so delighted that I won the race against time to get back and to be 100 percent ready for the Euros. It was a bit of a horror injury for me back in December in that Europa League game, and it took a long time to get back to my best level. It has been frustrating, when you are in a new club and just want one thing: to prove yourself out there on the pitch with your team-mates. But I have turned the frustration into working like mad, and actually now physically I have never been stronger or more fit<br /><br />[Compared at home to legends like <a href="michael-laudrup.html">Michael Laudrup</a> and Jon Dahl Tomasson, Duelund is keen to cut his own reputation in his career] I love to score goals, and I love to give an assist for a team-mate. As long as I am a decisive part of the attacking action, I am happy. That is my aim every time I enter the pitch, and how I best work to help my team win</p>
