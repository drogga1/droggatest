<blockquote>
  <p>While terrorism in Europe and South Asia grips the headlines, the obscure but savage insurgency in southern Thailand remains an afterthought even for many politicians in Bangkok<br /><br />On May 9 2019, the insurgents hit a supermarket in Pattani with a double-tap attack, detonating a small bomb at 2:10 pm and another soon after<br /><br />The Thai government is now negotiating with apparent representatives of the insurgency, yet experts have noted a divide between younger military commanders in southern Thailand and older political leaders, many of whom reside far from the battlefield in Malaysia. Negotiations exclude the National Revolutionary Front (BRN), which spearheads the insurgency in the south, undermining the credibility of the peace process and the Thai government’s commitment to it<br /><br />The insurgents rarely speak to journalists to maintain their aura of mystery and secrecy. This strategy thus frees the Thai government to promote its worldview that the Thai Royal Army and Police are fighting terrorism<br /><br />The Thai government has exacerbated the difficulty of separating civilians from the state by encouraging sectarianism in the south … Such overlap between civilian and state can contribute to the impetus behind attacks such as the one on May 9, which targeted apolitical, innocent Buddhist and Muslim shoppers to send a political message to the Thai government and military<br /><br />In the face of these difficulties, Bangkok appears to lack interest in resolving the insurgency through either a military victory or political settlement. Instead, the military dictatorship has redoubled its efforts to muzzle the press and quash dissent, inserting itself into everyday life. Officials have prioritized foreign policy over national security, looking to improve their military relationship with the United States and planning for Prime Minister Prayut’s visit to the White House<br /><br />A May 22 bombing in Bangkok indicated that the south will prove far from the Thai government’s only dilemma in terms of security. With other concerns dominating Bangkok’s attention it was only on June 5, almost a month after the supermarket bombing in Pattani, that the government saw fit to increase patrols along the Malaysian-Thai border<br /><br />Thailand’s military prefers governance to war, explaining its challenges with the insurgency … Rather than confronting the difficulties that it faces in the Deep South Thailand, the military dictatorship has opted to avoid or ignore them, reinvigorating the insurgency<br /><br />In an effort to counter the insurgency through soft power, the Thai government is seeking to strengthen the south’s economy. These measures will likely prove pointless without tackling the insurgency itself<br /><br />By excluding the BRN from the peace process, the Thai government can never hope to defeat it, for history has shown that the Thai military lacks the discipline and skill to best an insurgency on the battlefield. Instead, Thai officials and soldiers should reinvest in peace. According to Pathan, the ongoing peace talks will fail ‘without BRN participation because this movement controls virtually all of the combatants on the ground’</p>
