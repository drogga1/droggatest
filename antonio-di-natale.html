  <p><b>[Antonio Di Natale has backed Mario Balotelli to lead the line for Italy at Euro 2016]</b> When he played against us <b>[in Milan’s 3-2 win in September]</b> he was impressive. He’s beyond discussion. He knows how to get things done. I think he’ll go in the end because he’s strong, even though Conte is right when he says that just a couple of games aren’t really enough.<br /><br /><b>[Fabio Quagliarella could make his first Italy appearance since 2010]</b> Quagliarella isn’t old, but out of the veterans I hope he’s the one to make it, because he deserves it</p>

  <p><b>[Former team-mate Antonio Di Natale says <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a> is an exemplary professional and will rediscover his top form at <a href="inter-milan.html">Intermilan</a>]</b> Sanchez to Inter would be an extraordinary coup and a gamble that both parties could win comfortably. Alexis is an exemplary professional, someone who always arrived early for training sessions and never held back during a match. He is returning to Italy, where he left an excellent reputation, and he was strongly wanted by a great coach like <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>, who had asked for his signature back when he was at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. He has all the ingredients needed for a great season. Alexis needs people to have faith in him and I am sure he’ll do well with <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>. I think he had some fitness problems over the last 18 months and he certainly had difficulty settling in at Manchester United<br /><br />Sanchez has to play consistently and feel important to give his best. That didn’t happen in Manchester, but it’s impossible to doubt his talent. He’d also be playing the 3-5-2 system with <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>, which he had at Udinese under Francesco Guidolin and allowed him to become a decisive player. He’ll have <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> by his side and as a second striker, Alexis becomes impossible to mark with his pace and power. You’ll see, he will score many goals. His time in England seemed to be over as he needed a new challenge and Inter are the right club for a relaunch, with <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> the best coach to get him back to the top level. I can assure you, Sanchez will want to prove himself in Serie A</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Di Natale has revealed that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> wanted to sign him at all costs when he was at the peak of his powers with Udinese]</b> I wanted to remain in Udine and had just signed a four-year contract, I’d won the Capocannoniere title, felt important here and simply didn’t want to change everything. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> wanted me at all costs too, they were prepared to do anything to get me to sign for them, but it would’ve made no sense for me to go to England when I’d already turned down Juve<br /><br /><a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> would’ve been an ideal team-mate, because he is so quick with his legs and his mind. I was a little bit like him back in the day, so it would’ve been fantastic for us to play together</p>
