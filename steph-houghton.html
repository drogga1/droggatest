  <p><b>[Scotland’s Kim Little looking to make up for lost time against England]</b> If you look back to the Euro 2017 game, they were hit with a lot of key injuries and they’ve got those players back now. With the likes of Kim Little, Jennifer Beattie and now Erin Cuthbert coming through the ranks, we know that they are going to be players that we are going to have to stop and make sure their rhythm doesn’t get anywhere near what they are used to.</p>

  <p><b>[England centre-back Steph Houghton was elated to book a spot in the final four of the competition and believes they will be even better in the next round]</b> We know we are one game away from a final. We’ve been ticking games off in our head. The performances are getting better. You know a semi-final will be tough no matter who we play. We look forward to watching them <b>[France and USA]</b>. We’ll be going to the training pitch and getting even better</p>

  <p><b>[England captain Steph Houghton ‘heartbroken’ following USWNT loss. She missed a penalty in the second half]</b> I’m heartbroken but I’m very proud of the team because we fought so hard in this tournament. It was so close against the best team in the world, but we are so disappointed. I thought we were the better side in terms of how we played football, but ultimately, lapses in concentration cost us. I got told today that I was on the penalties and I was confident because I had been scoring all week, but I didn’t connect with it properly and the goalkeeper guessed the right way.</p>

  <p><b>[Steph Houghton ready for biggest game of the season against Man Utd]</b> Yes I think <b>[it’s the biggest game of the season]</b>, in terms of the history between the two clubs. Obviously from the women’s point of view, the history starts on Saturday. I’m excited because I think this is what women’s football needs in this country, these types of games, these types of rivalries. You’ve got the north west derby in terms of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, you’ve got <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> vs <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> so it’s getting exciting for the fans to come and watch<br /><br /><b>[And with record crowds at <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>, <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> last season, there is a growing appeal for club football]</b> You look at those fixtures and you want that, you want to be a part of that. It’s only right that the club is supporting us by playing at the Etihad. We’ve got people that want to come and watch us play. We won trophies last season, we’ve played really good football</p>

  <p><b>[Steph Houghton on his playing time]</b> From a personal point of view, I also knew I couldn’t have given any more to be the best centre-half there and to lead my team in the best way possible. Even though it didn’t end the way I wanted it to, I can honestly look back and say I enjoyed every minute</p>

  <p><b>[The One That Got Away: Steph Houghton reveals all about 2015 Women’s World Cup semi-final heartbreak]</b> I look back at that tournament and I just think it was unbelievable, one of the best I’ve been involved with in terms of getting to visit all the different places and have your family follow you around. The fans absolutely loved it but I always say whenever you’re in a tournament, you just tend to be in your own little bubble and you don’t really understand what’s going on back home and especially with the time difference as well, it was quite hard to have that connection<br /><br />The games were on late over here <b>[in England]</b> and we knew there was a lot of excitement back at home but we didn’t realise until we got back that it changed women’s football for the better.<br /><br />There wasn’t that much expectation on us to go and do amazingly well. I think people would have been happy with us getting out of the group. We knew we could do something special and I think that’s where the confidence grew but we went over there quite quietly and there wasn’t as much hysteria compared to the last World Cup</p>
