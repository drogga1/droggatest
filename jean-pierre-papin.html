  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain trio Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani have to put their personal ambitions aside]</b> With PSG, they’re not heroes, they’re egos. At some point, whatever your status is, you have to serve the team. There’s a difference between stars we see abroad and those we have in France. In France, we’ve got the impression that they’re impossible to manage. Why can Liverpool put their players into line and not here? When Neymar was playing with Barcelona, he defended from time to time … .<br /><br />Quality is permanent, it’s in the DNA of these players. There’s no problem there. But they must come together, let everyone around him benefit from their qualities. They cannot care who the star of the team is. The club’s project is to win the Champions League. If the players don’t have that in their head, they’ll never win it<br /><br /><b>[Asked what the trio are missing]</b> The type of match that serves as a switch. At PSG, they’ve never beaten a great team together. They are so strong … The only cement that’s missing is, after having crushed everything in France, wanting to crush everything in Europe. When I was at Marseille, every time we went to play a big European team, we went to beat them. Yes, in terms of footballing and technical qualities, they are much better than us, but in mindset we were stronger</p>

  <p><b>[Kylian Mbappe is the real star at Paris Saint-Germain]</b> He has played so often because of injuries to others. The real weapon of PSG is not Neymar, it’s him. We could have predicted that. Even if Neymar is galactic, the real star of PSG is Mbappe. For two years now, Neymar has offered some fabulous flashes, but Mbappe is there all the time.<br /><br /><b>[Papin added on being joined in the 30-goal club]</b> It was about time! I’ve been part of the story and it’s good when others improve things. Thirty goals is a lot, especially for a 20-year-old kid. The difference with me is that I did it once and he will do it several times. When, at 19, you win the World Cup, you score goals in the Champions League and you reach 30 goals in Ligue 1 … He is able to score all the time. There is nothing to say about the quality of Kylian. He is just exceptional<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on who is the best]</b> Kylian, of course, but we can put <b>[Antoine]</b> Griezmann and <b>[Karim]</b> Benzema next. Benzema scored another hat-trick this weekend and has scored goal after goal with Real. It’s so difficult. Kylian’s difference is his age<br /><br /><b>[Asked about what the future could hold]</b> Kylian is the golden generation. He arrived at the right moment, he is a world champion and plays for PSG at the top. The next step is the Champions League and the Ballon d’Or</p>
