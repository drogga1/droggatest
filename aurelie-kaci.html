  <p><b>[Aurelie Kaci arrives after two years with <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>, where she picked up two more league titles, but her decision to leave and join their new rivals was explained in one short quote that has been uttered by many ‘Galacticos’ over the years]</b> When Real contacts you, it is difficult to reject it. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> is the most historic football club and I have ambitions at the height of the club. If we cannot have the title, it will be the Champions League <b>[we aim for]</b>. <b>[The team]</b> do not want to call themselves <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> to finish second or third. We are here to win<br /><br /><b>[It doesn’t seem like the Galacticas will stop arriving then either]</b> Players will be recruited. I can promise you that. I know players want to come here too. I have already received messages from international players who are eager to come<br /><br /><b>[<a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>’s Olga Garcia, Levante’s Eva Navarro and another Brazil international, Kathellen, have all been linked, although Bordeaux are standing firm about keeping the latter, with her still under contract. But the draw of such an exciting project is likely to be too big for many teams to withstand]</b> I have been told that <b>[we will just be known as Real Madrid]</b>, not <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> Femeni. It is a step in the equality thinking that we are not called ladies. We are a football team. We are <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and next year I will put on the world’s most beautiful shirt</p>
