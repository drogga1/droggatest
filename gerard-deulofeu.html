He is a great coach, a lovely person and I have very good memories of that time but I would have liked to have had a full year with him. I was very young and I wasn’t in the dressing room much, but I’m very grateful for the opportunities he gave me<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether he would like to link up with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> again one day, possibly at the Etihad Stadium]</b> Of course, that’s why I keep working. I like their wingers a lot, <b>[Kevin]</b> De Bruyne, <b>[Leroy]</b> Sane, <b>[Raheem]</b> Sterling and <b>[Riyad]</b> <a href="riyad-mahrez.html">Mahrez</a>, they are guys who play as I do, so why not? I’m going to fight for that, although for now, I’m focused on doing well at Watford</p>

  <p><b>[The pressure of being likened to living legend <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has been a big burden to bear, and one that Deulofeu has come to understand was terminal for his Blaugrana career]</b> It was more harmful than beneficial. Normally I don’t read the newspapers, but I remember those headlines well and it ended up hurting me because there were too many expectations on me from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> fans. There is only one Messi<br /><br /><b>[This is the kind of form makes big European clubs stand up and notice, with Deulofeu admitting he has ambitions away from the English club]</b> <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> has a certain profile but for now it’s not a top club.

  <p><b>[Deulofeu reflects on life behind legends at Camp Nou]</b> When you’re young at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> there are a lot of eyes on you, many people who think you will be the next <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a>, the next <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, stars of football. That is hard because young players have to work calmly, every day, without pressure. You should learn and work but some people talk too much and they create a dream for you that is very difficult to reach. I’m proud to have formed at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> because I learned a lot from their academy, but all people know my time in the first team wasn’t the best. That was my objective and I did not manage to reach it<br /><br />It was very hard because you’re playing well for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> B and you know that you have <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> and <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a> ahead of you, a lot of really good players and you have to decide if you want to be patient or leave and live other experiences, and play. I’m someone who doesn’t want to be on the bench. I want to play, and that doesn’t matter if I’m at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> or Bayern. What I want is to be on the pitch and be happy. You can be much happier at Waford playing than being a substitute at a team like <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. If you don’t play, you aren’t happy, that’s my mentality</p>

  <p><b>[Watford winger Gerard Deulofeu has hailed the impact of <a href="ismaila-sarr.html">Ismaila Sarr</a> and backed him to become a key figure for the club]</b> It’s really tough because I know my teammates are going to miss me because I’m doing really good things for the team. But there are more players who are going to take this opportunity. We have great players who are going to help the team and we’re going to achieve our objectives to remain <b>[in the league]</b> of course. He’s <b>[Sarr]</b> a really good player, really young, his pace is amazing and it helps the team a lot because when we do the counter-attacks from both sides - from my side and Ismaila’s - the team can go up <b>[the pitch]</b> and it helps the team a lot. He gets good assists, good goals. In the present and in the future, he’s going to be a really good player for <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> so we’re really happy to have him in the team</p>
