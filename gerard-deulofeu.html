  <p><b>[Gerard Deulofeu has admitted that his poor spell at Barcelona is his own fault]</b> A lot of it is my fault. At the end of the day, it’s me who has to earn the right to play more. I think I was better off the bench than when I had the chance to start games. I know I didn’t prove myself. I believe in myself more than anyone, but I recognise I was not consistent enough. I told <b>[Ernesto Valverde]</b> when I left <b>[for Watford]</b> that a lot of it was my fault because he’d given me the opportunities I wanted.<br /><br /><b>[Deulofeu does not believe he will return to Camp Nou]</b> I think it will be very difficult to go back. You don’t have to be too clever to know that if Barcelona loaned me to another team, it’s because they have little interest in me. I was also in agreement that I had to leave because I hadn’t played for a month-and-a-half and things weren’t working out. I want to play and be happy. I am not happy being on the bench. At the end of the season, we will have to talk to Barca and my agent, but I can’t say what will happen because I don’t know myself</p>

  <p><b>[Deulofeu reflects on life behind legends at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a>]</b> When you’re young at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> there are a lot of eyes on you, many people who think you will be the next <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a>, the next <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, stars of football. That is hard because young players have to work calmly, every day, without pressure. You should learn and work but some people talk too much and they create a dream for you that is very difficult to reach. I’m proud to have formed at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> because I learned a lot from their academy, but all people know my time in the first team wasn’t the best. That was my objective and I did not manage to reach it<br /><br />It was very hard because you’re playing well for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> B and you know that you have <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> and <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a> ahead of you, a lot of really good players and you have to decide if you want to be patient or leave and live other experiences, and play. I’m someone who doesn’t want to be on the bench. I want to play, and that doesn’t matter if I’m at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> or <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>. What I want is to be on the pitch and be happy. You can be much happier at Waford playing than being a substitute at a team like <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. If you don’t play, you aren’t happy, that’s my mentality</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> winger Gerard Deulofeu has hailed the impact of <a href="ismaila-sarr.html">Ismaila Sarr</a> and backed him to become a key figure for the club]</b> It’s really tough because I know my teammates are going to miss me because I’m doing really good things for the team. But there are more players who are going to take this opportunity. We have great players who are going to help the team and we’re going to achieve our objectives to remain <b>[in the league]</b> of course. He’s <b>[<a href="ismaila-sarr.html">Sarr</a>]</b> a really good player, really young, his pace is amazing and it helps the team a lot because when we do the counter-attacks from both sides - from my side and Ismaila’s - the team can go up <b>[the pitch]</b> and it helps the team a lot. He gets good assists, good goals. In the present and in the future, he’s going to be a really good player for <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> so we’re really happy to have him in the team</p>
