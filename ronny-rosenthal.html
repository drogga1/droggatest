  <p><b>[Ronny Rosenthal says Nobody will contest <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> being handed title]</b> They’ve been amazing this season. They’ve been building to this for the last few years and they’ve now got all the qualities you need to be successful. They’ve got a very balanced side with players who can defend as well as attack and anyone from within their first 16 is capable of winning the game on any given day. Whether they stop <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> or not, for me <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> won the league. I don’t think anyone will contest it. My opinion is to wait and try and plan to finish the season whether that’s in one, two or three months or even cutting into the time when next season would have normally started. It might have to be behind closed doors or intensive like a tournament with two games every week to finish.<br /><br />Of course there’s no way that we thought <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> would go another 30 years without winning the league. If you’d have suggested that at the time, people would have looked at you like you were from another planet. I think that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s failings were down to a lot of developments within English football. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> started and scouting systems became more advanced. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were known for always taking the most-talented players in the British Isles but talent alone is not enough now and all the players need to be athletes who can run as well but I think for a long time, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> did not fully appreciate this</p>
