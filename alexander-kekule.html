  <p><b>[Alexander Kekule says <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> could return in May with ‘draconian’ measures]</b> Everything is possible. You have to think about how you can sure that the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> players are able to play. You would have to extend the lockdown for them. They would have to continue living privately under special security conditions. The whole team would have to go into a special quarantine. In addition, they would have to be retested before each game. From a purely virological point of view, the problem could therefore be solved, but only if you create a kind of special bubble for the football players<br /><br />I wouldn’t plan anything with fans this season. I would be pessimistic. It doesn’t look like something that we can seriously consider</p>
