<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> coach Udo Lattek has underlined the importance of a victory for Jupp Heynckes’ men in Saturday’s <a href="dfb.html">DFB</a> Pokal final against Borussia Dortmund]</b> For many in Bavaria, the cup has been more of a necessary evil or a consolation prize in the past. If you could not win the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, then at least you would win this trophy. However this time it’s different. This time the cup is really important for the Bavarians. There are a whole host of reasons: they need to win the cup. They will want to avoid <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> doing the double. They do not want to lose for the fifth consecutive time against <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. They must prevent the continued national rise of <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. But most of all they will want to get self-confidence for the match against Chelsea</p>
