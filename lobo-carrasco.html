  <p><b>[Lobo Carrasco, former barcelona team-mate on Maradonas]</b> When <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> ran with the ball or dribbled through the defence, he seemed to have the ball tied to his boots. I remember our early training sessions with him… the rest of the team were so amazed that they just stood and watched him. We all thought ourselves privileged to be witnesses of his genius</p>

  <p><b>[Camp Nou legend Lobo Carrasco is opposed to the idea of re-signing Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain]</b> do not want Neymar to come in. I want Griezmann, a centre-back, a left-back and a centre-forward to come in. That’s my road map and I would not change it, whether I’m Josep Maria Bartomeu, Lionel Messi, sports director or coach<br /><br /><b>[Ernesto Valverde’s side squandered a commanding semi-final first-leg lead against Liverpool to bow out of Europe once more, and Neymar is not considered to be the answer]</b> With the signing of Neymar, Barca would lose even more at the back. They were swept in Europe, they <b>[Liverpool]</b> got us 4-0, 3-0. If we have a further breakdown in defence, are we going to go from four to six goals?<br /><br /><b>[Carrasco believes he has the answer for Barcelona, but the challenge facing the Blaugrana is not an easy one to complete]</b> Barca needs to have a Carles Puyol.</p>
