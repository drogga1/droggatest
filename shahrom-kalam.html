  <p><b>[Perak want to hit the ground running in 2017 MSL]</b> We have to be realistic in our expectations of becoming Super League contenders. We hope to qualify for the Asian Football Confederation <b>[AFC]</b> Cup as well as league title contenders.</p>

  <p><b>[Perak defence improved in win against JDT]</b> All the guys gave their fullest commitment, and that’s the reason we won. We <b>[the defence]</b> focused really hard in the game, as we’ve conceded numerous times previously and have had to improve. Thank God today we were more disciplined, and we will do even better in future matches.<br /><br />We have no troubles in that department, as our backup players are equally reliable, such as Idris Ahmad. I’ll be suspended for the next match for having picked up three yellow cards, but I trust my replacement <b>[will do a good job]</b> when Thiago <b>[centre back Thiago Junior Aquino]</b> or I are absent</p>

  <p><b>[Perak captain, Shahrom Kalam believed the 4-2 defeat to Kelantan has put the Bos Gaurus under pressure]</b> We lost this home game due to our own mistake. The philosophy <b>[by Mehmet Durakovic]</b> is still the same. We must be very disciplined and give our full focus. The mistakes tonight came from the players. We have to admit this because we conceded soft goals to them. We lost our focus, and in football, that is a big mistake so that is the reason we lost the game. We must bounce back in the upcoming match</p>

  <p><b>[Captain Shahrom Kalam has given his backing to Mehmet Durakovic, saying that the Australian has its own way in building his team]</b> I am confident that Durakovic has his own recipe for success. I used to play under him in 2014 and 2015.</p>

  <p><b>[Mehmet Durakovic and Shahrom Kalam both agrees that Perak still have plenty of room for improvement]</b> First of all, it’s a disappointment to only get a point because we are playing at home. But it’s good character to draw it so late in the game. We’ll need to continue improving and remain positive for the next game.<br /><br />We have to look at game by game. For me, it’s not easy to play against these lower teams. They are the underdogs and have nothing to lose, so they will fight very hard</p>

  <p><b>[Shahrom Kalam wasn’t too happy that his Perak side couldn’t hold on to the lead and had to share points for the third match in a row]</b> We already gave our best but it’s a missed opportunity because we’re playing at home. We still have a lot of improvement to do but I have to say well done to Kedah as well. We have to stay positive and move forward to face T-Team.</p>

  <p><b>[Shahrom Kalam wants Malaysia to keep their minds only for the Hong Kong match]</b> It’s a tough task but nothing is impossible. If we approach the game right, I think we can get it. A win is important for us to move forward. We have to stay positive and go game by game. We need to get the three points against Hong Kong, then we will think about the rest.<br /><br />I think everyone is here knows their responsibilities. Yes, it will take some time but we will get it right in our backline through the drills that we do until the day of the match. When we played in Melaka, we controlled the game but we just didn’t convert our chances. We need to start converting those and ensure that we don’t make mistakes at the back</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Shahrom seeking a win for Malaysia in Hong Kong]</b> For us players, we know that tomorrow is a very important match for us. We need to get a positive result to open our chance to qualify for this Asian Cup. We know we bring the hope of the entire nation. What we need is be focused and disciplined. We know what we need to do to get those 3 points.<br /><br />What we need is not play more than 11 v 11. Of course we hope to get a fair officiating of the match. The players are in good condition, physically and mentally because we know tomorrow is going to be a tough match. It’s not going to be easy but we are ready. We are not here for a holiday, we want to take a good result back</p>
