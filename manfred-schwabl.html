<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Karim Adeyemi: The teenage <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> target who was once paid in pizza!]</b> From a sporting perspective, it was completely clear that he could become a professional. The only thing that could ruin the career of the boy was if he got injured or if we personally got something wrong. I met him in the beer garden and asked him if he wanted to have a pizza. At that time, I said to him: ‘We’ll make a deal. I pay you in pizza if you knock out 1860 and Bayern’<br /><br />He said to himself, ‘I’m only marginally interested in school, I’m going to be a professional footballer anyway. In school sports, he forgot his sportswear; in math lessons, his geometry equipment - just small mistakes<br /><br /><b>[He was also warned that his replacement in the team would be able to develop while Adeyemi was away, which lit a fire in the boy to show that he could learn and resume his passion]</b> It spurred him on. A few weeks later, we received feedback from the school that Karim is becoming a model student, always courteous and always helpful to his classmates<br /><br />In January 2018, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> requested I flew to London with Karim and his father<br /><br /><b>[Unlike in Germany, Austrian clubs are permitted to play 16-year-olds in senior football - which meant Adeyemi could make the next step in his career sooner rather than later]</b> It was like winning the lottery for him. We knew that he was physically ready, so why should he stay in the U19-Bundesliga? This is a children’s league and has nothing to do with men’s football.<br /><br /><b>[His record of 13 goals and nine assists in 32 matches for the club has seen some question how long it will be until he is recalled to join the likes of <a href="erling-haland.html">Erling Braut Haaland</a> and Dominik Szoboszlai in the Salzburg first team]</b> I think they will recall him in the winter. Then, he has every opportunity, and he could be ready for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> in a year and a half<br /><br /><b>[Schwabl, though, is proud of not just how Adeyemi has grown as a player, but also a person]</b> The boys can all kick. But staying down to earth is the real art and Karim apparently understood that, which makes me very proud personally.</p>
