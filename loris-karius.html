  <p><b>[Loris Karius determined to keep Liverpool out of the goalkeeper market]</b> If you read the press as a Liverpool player then every week we would have five new signings in every position. You can’t go crazy about the speculation. When I look at the training, I think we do have good quality already with the keepers. I think we’ve been a bit unlucky at times. Often you don’t have much to do. Then if you don’t do something 100 per cent right it weighs a lot heavier than for other goalies at smaller clubs who have several more saves to make in a game. That’s life at a big club like Liverpool and you have to deal with it. I just want to present myself well and then I’ll have the chance to play at this club for the next season as well. That’s the challenge facing me personally. I also want to help this team achieve as much as we can. As well as the top four, we still have the Champions League. We want to go forward in that and why not win it? There are lots of big aims for the rest of the season.<br /><br />It was difficult in the first half of the season but I didn’t do too bad. I still had high quality games in the Champions League and I knew my chance would come in the Premier League. I went in and out of the team a bit but I showed the manager that when he needs me I’m there. Of course I was happy with the decision (to become No. 1). You get more in a routine game by game but I know I need to keep performing</p>

  <p><b>[Loris Karius believes Liverpool played to their highest level against Manchester City]</b> Not to concede was very important but then three goals; it’s probably the best result you can ask for. We played at our highest level. We’re a good football team. We defended really well. The second half they put a bit more pressure on. They had their moments, but they weren’t really clear. The fans pushed us on to get over the fatigue. They were amazing tonight and played a big part in pushing us forward so much. They helped a lot. Especially in moments when it gets harder, when you have to stick together. The fans, they push you on to go over that point where it hurts. On the way to the stadium when you see the fans supporting you like this you want to pay back and show them everything you can. So we did. There were moments when we had to stick together. We were deeper than in other moments of the game but that’s what you expect against a team like this. You can’t press for 90 minutes. There are other moments and we defended perfectly, starting from the front all the way to the back. That’s the only way you can do it.</p>

  <p><b>[Loris Karius has issued an apology to his team-mates and the club’s fans after making two costly errors in Saturday’s Champions League final defeat]</b> Haven’t really slept until now… the scenes are still running through my head again and again… I’m infinitely sorry to my teammates, for you fans, and for all the staff. I know that I messed it up with the two mistakes and let you all down…<br /><br />As I said I’d just like to turn back the time but that’s not possible. It’s even worse as we all felt that we could have beaten Real Madrid and we were in the game for a long time…Thank you to our unbelievable fans who came to Kiev and held my back, even after the game. I don’t take that for granted and once again it showed me what a big family we are. Thank you and we will come back stronger</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius suffered a concussion during his side’s defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League final]</b> On May 31, 2018 Mr. Karius underwent a comprehensive examination by Dr. Ross Zafonte and Dr. Lenore Herget in Boston at Massachusetts General Hospital and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. After carefully reviewing game film and integrating a detailed history - including his reported present and immediate post-contact subjective symptoms - physical examination and objective metrics, we have concluded that Mr. Karius sustained a concussion during the match May 26, 2018.<br /><br />At the time of our evaluation, Mr. Karius’s principal residual symptoms and objective signs suggested that visual spatial dysfunction existed and likely occurred immediately following the event. Additional symptomatic and objectively noted areas of dysfunction also persisted. It could be possible that such deficits would affect performance. We also note that Mr. Karius has reported significant and steady improvement since the concussive event, and we expect him to make a full recovery based on the results of the examination. We expect that with treatment and by following prescribed activity protocols he will continue to improve. We have encouraged vigilance and an emphasis on safety in his eventual return to full activity.</p>

  <p><b>[Loris Karius can’t explain the costly errors he made during Liverpool’s Champions League final defeat to Real Madrid]</b> I still can’t explain the mistakes I made against Real Madrid. I have to get my confidence back and come to terms with the past. Oliver Kahn also made a big mistake in the World Cup final in 2002 and came back stronger, which is what I prefer to do rather than think about how long I will be haunted by the Champions League.<br /><br /><b>[Ramos - with the Madrid skipper having also been blamed for the injury which forced Liverpool talisman Mohamed Salah from the field]</b> I don’t know if he meant it or not. Only one person knows that: Sergio Ramos. I fell to the ground and thought to myself ‘what’s going on?’ I had adrenaline rushing through my blood and just wanted to play. But I don’t want to hide behind any excuses<br /><br />I have no problem with Jurgen Klopp, in fact we have a great relationship, he transferred me from Mainz. He never blamed me. The pressure got so big at some points from the media and the public that Liverpool had to react, which was not good for my situation, but that happens in football. Nobody told me to leave Liverpool. I didn’t run away from Liverpool. I am at an age where I need to play regularly. After Alisson Becker’s transfer I decided to move to Istanbul and join Besiktas</p>

  <p><b>[Loris Karius has revealed that Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos failed to apologise for elbowing the Liverpool goalkeeper]</b> No. I don’t think that he has got my number. He’s a hard player but I have nothing against him personally. I don’t know whether he did that on purpose, but that doesn’t matter to me in the end. Only one person knows and this is Sergio Ramos. I went down and thought: ‘What’s going on now?’ No reaction from the five referees. I felt the adrenaline rushing through my body and thought only about playing on. A concussion was proven, and it harmed my spatial vision. The club asked me to go see a specialist. But again, I won’t use this as an excuse. I performed constantly throughout the whole season, so you can put it this way: under ordinary circumstances I cannot explain those mistakes.<br /><br />Yes, I’ve watched that Ramos scene. And the highlights. You sometimes don’t understand how a certain situation could arise. I wanted to have better judgement, that’s why I watched it in the night and the next day again</p>

Of course it’s an option and a good option to still be there. Maybe I’ll play for them again, you never know. It’s still far ahead. If it’s not <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, it will be another decent team, so I’m not worried about any scenario.<br /><br />The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is the best league so it is interesting of course. If you play in England you’re always a bit more in the spotlight, but I’m at a good club now so we will see what happens at the end of the season. I don’t think about Kiev anymore, it’s so long ago, nearly two seasons now… There were so many circumstances. I had a bad injury and nobody was talking about it. People can say what they want, it doesn’t really concern me anymore. After I was assessed, we realised <b>[about the concussion]</b> but while the game is going on, you have too much adrenaline to realise. I am happy <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> won the Champions League the following year, and they have a good chance again this year, so let’s see where it takes them. I still speak to the goalkeeping coach and some of the players<br /><br /><b>[In his stead, <a href="adrian.html">Adrian</a> has stepped up, and Karius says he has liked what he’s seen from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> so far]</b> Every goalkeeper would feel comfortable behind that defence but <a href="adrian.html">Adrian</a> is doing a good job’. He seems like a nice guy; I am happy he is getting game time. The defence has improved brilliantly over the last season and a bit and they rarely concede goals anymore. It was solid even back then but now it’s on another level because the whole has team improved. The longer people are together the better it works. They have been playing together quite a bit and with the potential they have it looks really promising. I hope they can win the league. The season is so long but it’s always good to have a good start and get some points ahead so it looks good. I can’t see them losing a game</p>

All my efforts and good performances before were suddenly no longer relevant. The reactions were over the top and disrespectful, especially that it has been drawn out in this way. Errors are measured with different, even abnormal, dimensions and are not assessed fairly. We players face extreme hostility on the internet. If you read every message, you wouldn’t be able to sleep for two days. It’s insane what people say under the guise of anonymity, badly insulting others, discriminating against them and then becoming racist. You can’t blame fans if they whistle a player. You pay an admission <b>[fee]</b> and have the right to be dissatisfied. A professional has to endure that. If there are personal insults or death threats, the line is then crossed. There were some of them <b>[death threats]</b>. But I can’t take that seriously. These are people who write anonymously and don’t even show their faces in their profiles.</p>
