  <p><b>[Loris Karius still believes he could return to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> someday as the goalkeeper says he is no longer concerned by the infamous Champions League final that came to define his <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> career]</b> Will I play for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> again? Of course it’s an option and a good option to still be there. Maybe I’ll play for them again, you never know. It’s still far ahead. If it’s not <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, it will be another decent team, so I’m not worried about any scenario.<br /><br />The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is the best league so it is interesting of course. If you play in England you’re always a bit more in the spotlight, but I’m at a good club now so we will see what happens at the end of the season. I don’t think about Kiev anymore, it’s so long ago, nearly two seasons now… There were so many circumstances. I had a bad injury and nobody was talking about it. People can say what they want, it doesn’t really concern me anymore. After I was assessed, we realised <b>[about the concussion]</b> but while the game is going on, you have too much adrenaline to realise. I am happy <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> won the Champions League the following year, and they have a good chance again this year, so let’s see where it takes them. I still speak to the goalkeeping coach and some of the players<br /><br /><b>[In his stead, <a href="adrian.html">Adrian</a> has stepped up, and Karius says he has liked what he’s seen from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> so far]</b> Every goalkeeper would feel comfortable behind that defence but <a href="adrian.html">Adrian</a> is doing a good job’. He seems like a nice guy; I am happy he is getting game time. The defence has improved brilliantly over the last season and a bit and they rarely concede goals anymore. It was solid even back then but now it’s on another level because the whole has team improved. The longer people are together the better it works. They have been playing together quite a bit and with the potential they have it looks really promising. I hope they can win the league. The season is so long but it’s always good to have a good start and get some points ahead so it looks good. I can’t see them losing a game</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> flop Karius says he should have dealt with ‘below the belt’ criticism ‘more aggressively’ after Champions League final]</b> Believe me, I’ve learned a lot from that! In retrospect, I should have dealt with it more aggressively in public. I had a concussion after a blow from <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a>, which restricted my spatial vision. This was unequivocally ascertained in a detailed study by one of the world’s leading brain specialists. At first, I was happy to know what went on in this game. I didn’t want to make it public myself. When the result was released, there was a lot of malice and insult, often well below the belt. I never used it as an excuse. But when people make fun of someone who has badly injured their head, I have no understanding<br /><br />When I was just 24, I was in the Champions League final. Only <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Manuel Neuer</a> and <a href="marc-andre-ter-stegen.html">Marc-Andre ter Stegen</a> were among the active German goalkeepers who had played in the final. All my efforts and good performances before were suddenly no longer relevant. The reactions were over the top and disrespectful, especially that it has been drawn out in this way. Errors are measured with different, even abnormal, dimensions and are not assessed fairly. We players face extreme hostility on the internet. If you read every message, you wouldn’t be able to sleep for two days. It’s insane what people say under the guise of anonymity, badly insulting others, discriminating against them and then becoming racist. You can’t blame fans if they whistle a player. You pay an admission <b>[fee]</b> and have the right to be dissatisfied. A professional has to endure that. If there are personal insults or death threats, the line is then crossed. There were some of them <b>[death threats]</b>. But I can’t take that seriously. These are people who write anonymously and don’t even show their faces in their profiles.</p>

  <p><b>[Karius terminates loan deal with <a href="besiktas.html">Besiktas</a> following pay dispute]</b> Hi everyone, today I terminated my contract with <a href="besiktas.html">Besiktas</a>. It’s a shame it comes to an end like this but you should know that I have tried everything to solve this situation without any problems. I was very patient for months telling the board over and over again. The same things happened already last year. Unfortunately they haven’t tried to solve this situational problem and even refused my suggestion to help by taking a pay cut. It’s important to me that you know I really enjoyed playing for this club a lot. <a href="besiktas.html">Besiktas</a> can be proud of having such passionate fans behind them always giving amazing support. You always supported me in good and bad times and I will always remember you in the best way! Also I want to say thank you to all my team-mates, coaching staff including all people working for the club. You welcomed me with arms wide open from day one</p>

At 16 you could sign your first professional contract. I had offers from all sorts of clubs back then, but <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> went out of their way to help me. They showed me a concrete plan, for example how I could make it to the senior game. That fascinated me. I could just as well imagine staying in Stuttgart - but the concept and their plan for me did not convince me as much as that of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>. So I said to myself: I’m going to take the challenge and I’m going to England.<br /><br />Who else was interested? It felt like half of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. In Germany, I actually only dealt with Stuttgart because VfB was and is known to do great youth work. I enjoyed great training there. At that time I only listened to the plans of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and VfB. At that time, the arrival of investors <b>[in clubs]</b> was only just getting started. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> was actually a club that relied heavily on its own youngsters. Many made the breakthrough, the academy was in a good position - that’s why I decided in the end on this club</p>
