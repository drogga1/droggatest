He’s not a million miles away. He had a bit of swelling on the knee but it was good news from the surgeon. <a href="tomas-kalas.html">Kalas</a> is difficult to say at the moment, I’ll be honest with you. It could be one of them that’s three days or it could be one of them that’s three weeks I’m not sure<br /><br /><b>[While Johnson also explained that the decision to play O’Dowda as left wing-back against the Baggies, was a tactical decision and not to do with resting Tommy Rowe, who then came on after 40 minutes]</b> The idea was to be able to exploit the left-side where they press narrow and be able to get the ball to O’Dowda and have a natural winger and try and attack. But too many individuals didn’t start with enough quality. That’s the bit I’ve got to process why. Is that a tactical reason or a game state reason or is it just that we’re not good enough?</p>

He’s not been quite right physically for a while now so if we can get him back in the last months of the season that can only be a positive</p>

I have really enjoyed it because I have been able to get down and dirty in terms of coaching individuals, some really enjoyable individual sessions working on technique and various elements of their game and we do need that as a squad because we have so many young players and that is what they really enjoy and I think it is very beneficial, I think we have had a nice blend so hopefully we should be razor sharp going into this game</p>

I watched it in the end, I wasn’t going to but I did end up watching it, it showed that Shrewsbury are a good side and in those individual cup matches anything can happen. Also with Max <b>[<a href="david-o-leary.html">O’Leary</a>]</b> playing there was another reason to watch, he pulled off some great saves and done well, he is a very good goalkeeper and one we feel can help us moving forward</p>

  <p><b>[Reading up next, do you face them at a good time having played Saturday or does their form present you with a tough test?]</b> Well I went to the game at the weekend, but I don’t think I learned an awful lot because the team they fielded maybe has two players from that starting eleven who may start against us. I always enjoy going to Reading because it is an open game and we are usually well supported by our travelling fans whenever we go up there. They are loaded with quality, you could say they were underperforming considering the individual talents they had at their disposal, in fact the start of their turnaround was probably after we beat them earlier in the season</p>

  <p><b>[Do you have anything close in terms of transfer incomings?]</b> I feel like a broken record at the moment because if you look at the market as a whole not a lot has happened really, there has not been huge amounts in terms of transfers in the championship. I think there will be a mad flurry in the last few days all over football and that will inevitably effect the food chain in terms of transfers, obviously people in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> have different priorities and some are still in the cup so they are playing their back ups so those are the types of players that clubs like us are interested in. We are active, we are trying it is not easy but they have been identified in terms of the players and the positions and it is about getting over the line and it is not easy let me tell you, but it has been nice we have enough experts in the football club which means I can focus on the boys coached and motivated for the big games coming up</p>

  <p><b>[Josh Brownhill: there has been a lot of speculation about his long term future with some reporting that he might have a release clause in his contract, where do you see his long term future?]</b> I think to broaden it, there is going to be interest in our players, the players that we sign and develop the way we do is bound to attract interest and offers. We are trying to move towards becoming a sustainable football club because we are becoming a club that trades, you have got to expect the young players O’Dowda, Massengo, Brownhill, Eliasson particularly if they are playing well are bound to attract major interest. Of course from our end when we are buying we need to look at players towards the younger bracket from about 24 to 21. But yeah it would not surprise me if we were to have offers for some of these players towards the last few days</p>

  <p><b>[Is Liam Walsh out of contract in the summer?]</b> He has a year option on him. I think he is performing extremely well, according to our statistics he is the second best midfielder in League One and my thought process with Walshy was he needs 40 games on the spin, whether that is here with us or at Coventry. This is a player that is extremely talented, better in a midfield three than a two due to his attributes and the cover he needs in other deficiencies. I think he has done extremely well with Coventry they are a good team and they have a good manager and he has one that I keep a close eye on with the loans because he is a very good football player. If they are one of the best players in the division then we will consider them as a long term prospect for this club, unfortunately with Mo <b>[Eisa]</b> we did not feel the same way therefore we sold him, with Sammie <b>[Szmodics]</b> it is a different situation because we were looking for a loan towards the lower end of the Championship</p>

  <p><b>[Is everybody in agreement over transfer targets?]</b> I think so, it doesn’t really get to a point where someone is saying yes or someone is saying no, maybe financially there is a point where someone says no but if so that will be Mark Ashton or the owners, but we don’t usually get to that point to be honest because we are all in cohesion in terms of communication which is quite good at this club. Steve <b>[Lansdown]</b> is unbelievably supportive because he wants the best for this football club, that is why I think we have traded and traded very well at that, but it would be very nice for them to come to us and we say no more scouts at Ashton Gate. There is an integrating period, even if we feel that our replacement is even better than who we have sold we must afford them time to adapt to new surroundings and the culture, for example Jamie Paterson coming back, a lad that knows this club since he has come back from loan he has felt like a new signing</p>

They have chosen to keep the player and the circumstances leading up to that is nothing really to do with us and if Eddie is getting minutes at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> who can complain? Not <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>, Not Bristol City, not any other club that was interested in a good player, I am not going to deny interest because he is a good player and we were interested but at the same time, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are his parent club so if he is getting minutes for them then that is there prerogative and nobody can really complain. What we want more importantly is the good relations with the big clubs so when there is a player available they know that they can send them here and they will be in good hands as much as we believe in them</p>

  <p><b>[Is the January transfer window annoying for you as a coach?]</b> It is funny because there is so much emotion, pressure, financial reward, cost, you are permanently weighing up all these decisions and you have got to find a bit of time to enjoy it. The pressure for me is all internal because I want success for this football club, for the players because I have got a lot better at managing the outside noise if you like, which can be extensive because there is really passionate people that follow this football club, you look at any level when your in the media the swings of emotion every week in the various parts of the country, we try to keep this consistency because we believe we are a young-ish group and we had the perfect balance at the start of the season between youth and experience. But we have made up ground on the top clubs and now it is about adding quality to bridge the gap further, if we can’t we still have got quality here</p>

There’s definitely reasons to be optimistic, I think that’s the key. Players like Benik Afobe, with seven months out, have had two or three months to get a head of steam to be able to be reintroduced back to the first team squad. The likes of <a href="tomas-kalas.html">Kalas</a>, who has been struggling pretty much all season with a bit of a knee injury that’s affecting him so we expect to get him back. It’s not only the name on the teamsheet but the human being at their best, mentally and physically, having a clean run at it. We always talk in pre-season about how important they are, every player that seems to have a solid pre-season, it gives them a base</p>

  <p><b>[Connor Wickham and Massimo Luongo scored from corners as <a href="sheffield-wednesday.html">Sheffield Wednesday</a> dented Bristol City’s play-off hopes with a 2-1 win at Ashton Gate]</b> It’s so disappointing because I felt our performance was an improvement and that we deserved something from the game. But to concede twice like that from set-pieces was unforgivable. You can’t hope to win games at this level if defenders don’t do their jobs<br /><br />If one is blocked at a corner, there needs to be enough communication for another to react. But that didn’t happen with the first goal. The second was equally frustrating because we had chances to clear at the near post before the ricochet that led to the chance<br /><br />The changes worked and we looked more threatening. There were some decent opportunities for us to score more than one goal. Their first goal was against the run of play because we started well. What we lack is a Barry Bannan-type player to pull the strings for us in midfield. I still believe we can go to <a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a> and win our next game, but not if we defend like that</p>

I can only apologise for the 10-game form, but we’re talking about today<br /><br />Results haven’t improved, but the performances have and I still think that if we play like that for the last six games, I think we can get a lot of points out of them. I feel for the fans and everybody because I can assure you it’s not for the
