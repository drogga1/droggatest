<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Mario Mandzukic has been ruled out of Croatia’s Euro 2016 qualifying fixtures with Bulgaria and Malta due to a hamstring injur]</b> Unfortunately, he has picked up a hamstring injury. Today <b>[Wednesday]</b>, we have reviewed it and conducted an ultrasound and according to the finding he will not be able to play in these two games. I think he needs another two weeks to begin full training, with a high percentage of certainty that there will not be a relapse. Of course, he was not happy with such news, but his health has to come first.</p>

England’s dramatic 4-2 loss to Romania on Friday may not mathematically spell the end of their European Under-21 Championship hopes - but it is only a matter of time, with France only needing a draw against Croatia later in the evening to confirm the Young Lions’s elimination</dd>
