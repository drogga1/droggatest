  <p><b>[From <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> unknown to history-maker in Brazil - How Pablo Mari made it to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> I’d only been there for my medical. I’ve never met <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> or any of the first-team players<br /><br />I liked the idea of playing for a huge club. They told me that they wanted to win titles. Which footballer doesn’t want to win titles?</p>

  <p><b>[Pablo Mari is convinced he has joined an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> team who are on the cusp of achieving great success]</b> When I spoke to my agent, it was a big thing that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> were interested in me. This is one of the best clubs in the world, so I’m absolutely delighted to be joining. I’m really looking forward to playing in this jersey and helping my team. I’m a very professional player. I like working hard every day to achieve objectives<br /><br />I want to take it one day at a time and achieve big things at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. Right now I want to focus on the day-to-day side of things. I think we need to put the plans to one side for now because the most important thing is to take things one day at a time and focus on achieving short-term goals. We need to change the dynamic around the team, so the short-term objectives are the most important thing. As I’ve said, we have Mikel’s ideas, aligned with the club, and we need to perform very well to change things<br /><br /><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are streets adrift of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> this season]</b> Obviously they’re in great form at the moment and they’re among the best players in the world, but we also have a fantastic team with top players. This is football and that’s the way you have to look at it. You have to compete against every side, whether it’s <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or any other club in the world. I have a lot of faith in this great club, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, and I know we’re going to do very well</p>

He has great vision and there’s real talent there in terms of his dribbling and his ability to choose the right play. His decision-making is improving all the time. <a href="gabriel-martinelli.html">Martinelli</a> still has a lot more to show but he has incredible talent and I think gradually he’ll keep developing and become a top player<br /><br />He has exploded on to the scene and is showing that he’s a great player with a lot of talent. Obviously he’s still very young, but he’s already had a taste of playing at the top level and he’s doing very well. I’ll say congratulations when I meet him, but now he just needs to keep it up and work hard because he’s really talented</p>

In that time, for me in my mind, I wanted to play with them. This was not possible. So now for me it is another situation. I’ve learned a lot <b>[since leaving]</b> because when I was there I was young, now I am little bit older. I learned a lot in all the teams I have played. So I don’t want to look back, I want to look forward. Now I am in a really good club and I want to continue here for a lot of years</p>

  <p><b>[Pablo Mari salutes new <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> centre-half partner]</b> We know that David is an unbelievable player. He’s had a good career and is a good football player, and also playing with him is so easy. These two games with him in the starting XI were nice because I only focused on my job and I didn’t need to focus on other jobs.<br /><br />This is easy when you want to have a big game. We know he’s an experienced player and sometimes when you need to do different things in the last minutes, like when you need to make calls or something like this, he can do it. For us, it’s easy to play with him.<br /><br /><b>[Mari has instantly endeared himself to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">the Gunners</a> faithful with his composure at the back and even has his own song]</b> For me, it was an unbelievable day. It was a nice night for everybody and we won the game, which is the most important thing. Also my feeling on the pitch was really nice.<br /><br />With our fans, with our team, in our home, I think I had everything there to enjoy it. I enjoyed that game a lot and I hope I’m going to play the next games to feel the same with our team-mates and also for the club.<br /><br />The fans did a little bit of a song for me when I was named in the starting XI, and I’m so happy about that. This means they are feeling happy with me, with my job, so this is nice. I’m going to try to do my best in all the games, to win games, to get points. This is the most important thing, to win games, because we want to move up the table</p>

So, I hope that me and the club go at the end with good things to do a permanent transfer.

I always go when I’m on holidays in Spain. I go to the beach with some family. I like to go there because I’m alone and I can think. I’ve not had a chance in England yet but I want to in future. I love England and so does my wife. The centre of London is unbelievable.

It’s because of speed, intelligence and their characters.

They won everything and they won every game in the league. They are a really strong team. But we had one thing that we thought we could beat them with and that was our mentality. We had nothing to lose and everything to win so we could put this mentality in the pitch to try and win against them. But it was proved that in one action you can lose the game. But I thought we were fighting really well against them. Of course it was a really difficult to play against the front three because you know they are fast, they are strong and they know every player and what to do and they have really good quality. Of course it was difficult but I was focused 100% in that game and I know it was a difficult game but I felt like I improved a lot in six months there playing in <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a> so that I can play against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and these three players. My focus when I arrived in <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a> was that we knew we would play against a club like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in this final and that if we improved a lot we could beat them</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s on-loan defender Pablo Mari says he always believed he would make it at a big club, despite never being given a chance at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> You go <b>[to City’s training campus]</b> for medicals each year - blood tests, urine, scans - but when I went to the Netherlands and Coruna, the <b>[City]</b> first team hadn’t started pre-season, so there was no one there. You never cross paths. That can feel a bit strange, but City were transparent. The plan was always to go on loan. They help you find teams but never oblige you and the last word always has to be yours. After two years, I said I wanted to return to Spain, go step by step awaiting a chance in the Primera. Look, a player has to have one thing very clear: how much you’re prepared to lose to be a professional. You have to ask yourself that question and be honest. It will never, ever be all lovely. Or all awful. My objective was clear: whether it was City or not, I was going to get to a big club. I was absolutely convinced, ever since I left home at 13.<br /><br />I never thought of giving up. Never. I’ve had really bad moments, but you can’t ever leave something you love. Football might have thrown me out, but I was never going to throw it out<br /><br /><b>[Mari took some time to reach full match fitness at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> Bit by bit you get through the days, the weeks, and the moment you say ‘I’m ready, I can compete’, this happens. The first thought was: ‘Damn, I wanted to keep playing.’ But this is no small thing; it’s not a cold or flu. When you see its magnitude, professional questions are secondary. What matters is everyone’s health</p>
