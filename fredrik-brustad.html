<blockquote>
  <p><b>[The day <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> scored four for <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> in front of a <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> scout!]</b> I remember that the players knew that scouts from Manchester would be there. His performance was incredible. After the third goal, we only looked at each other in disbelief on the bench. It was the perfect game for him, the defence was high and gave him a lot of space to bump into. It was just fun to watch him from the bench. After the game, all eyes were on Erling. But he didn’t mind at all. Rather, pressure makes him even better. He was the player with the most potential I have ever played with. The coach (Solskjaer) made a short speech after the game praising <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a>’s performance. We were all aware that we had just had a very special game. <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> himself held back after the game, he’s not a guy for big speeches</p>
