  <p>[More than a movie! Madagascar producing a magical Africa Cup of Nations] All teams are better on paper than us. We don’t have any stars in our team. The star is the team. We have a real team of friends but also with talented players, who are very good but perhaps not stars<br /><br />[Having failed to win a game in 2017 AFCON qualifying, Dupuis is desperate to instigate a radical overview of football development in a country where the beautiful game has previously hidden away] I’m raising the alarm because the national team is the tree that hides in the forest. There is nothing being done from a technical standpoint at the national level, there’s no work in terms of youth and it’s serious. If we don’t question everything, if we don’t get back to work, in two years, there will be no more team and in four, even less so. It would be a shame because there’s a real breeding ground and it’s quite an old team. My role is to sound the alarm and tell officials there are lots of things in need of change in Madagascar<br /><br />[Considering how his side have performed in Egypt to date, it’s safe to say Dupuis has well and truly got sirens ringing across Madagascar] We’re not too aware of what we’re doing, except when we get sent photos from Madagascar, where it’s madness right now. We’re trying to live in the moment as best as possible because these moments are rare. It’s in these rare moments when you realise that we have the best job in the world</p>

  <p>[Madagascar vs Tunisia. Head coach Nicolas Dupuis said when asked about the impact he has had on the team] The players are very attentive, I’m so lucky. During the game, I give them carte blanche. They have the duty to produce their best and they know how to do it. Possession must be our hallmark. Defensively we can, unlike many African teams, put together a coherent bloc. That’s what’s made the difference … they have great tactical discipline<br /><br />[Starved of success on the football field, Madagascar has gone mad for its national team] We didn’t really realise it. There is talk of 25 million people who are moving to the rhythm of the AFCON and our performance, it’s fantastic</p>
