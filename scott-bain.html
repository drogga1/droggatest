<blockquote>
  <p>[Celtic goalkeeper Scott Bain is excited at the prospect of a new era for Scotland under the management of Steve Clarke] He commands respect. He speaks his mind, which players respect because a lot of the lads feel the same way. They like to speak their minds at times too and it’s good to have a manager who does the same. I’ve not really spoken to people at Kilmarnock about Steve Clarke but I’ve spoken with him after games. I can only judge from the outside looking in, from Celtic playing against Kilmarnock, but it seems that nobody puts themselves above the team. Everyone works selflessly and that’s how Kilmarnock have had such good results.<br /><br />He has done a fantastic job at Kilmarnock. I don’t think you would have found many people who could have predicted what he would achieve there. He’s taken them so high up the league. Killie are very difficult to play against and they’re very well organised. Everyone knows their jobs and they’re very hard to break down and score against. That’s why he’s a great fit as Scotland manager. He’ll have us organised and difficult to beat. We have a number of big games coming up and a starting point would be to make us difficult to beat. The main issue for the national team is that we don’t get a lot of time together so you have to create an environment where everyone knows their jobs and is willing to work hard to get over the line for the team and the country</p>
