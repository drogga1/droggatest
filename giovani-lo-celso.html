  <p><b>[Giovani Lo Celso says he is unconcerned by interest from Barcelona and Real Madrid]</b> A return to France? I don’t know what may happen tomorrow. I try to focus on the present right now. We’ll see when the time comes. Barca and Real’s interests, I don’t think about that. I’m young and I still have a long career ahead of me. My main objective is to finish the season as high as possible <b>[in the standings]</b> with Betis.<br /><br />You have to stay focused on what you’re doing and continue to do what you’re doing to keep moving forward. It’s not good to think about the transfer window rumours</p>

  <p><b>[Midfielder of the season in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>? How Lo Celso has exploded as Argentina’s new young talent]</b> <b>[<a href="real-betis.html">Betis</a>]</b> are in a situation that isn’t ideal at the moment, but we will fight until the end. We know what the club represent, what they aspire to and the goals that we set ourselves at the beginning of the season. Luckily this year I scored a lot, but the most important thing is trying to help the team</p>

  <p><b>[Giovani Lo Celso insisted ahead of the nation’s decisive Copa America clash against Qatar that <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>’s presence for Argentina is a privilege not a nuisance]</b> I think not, I see the opposite. Having Leo as a partner and playing with him is a privilege. On the contrary, it always solves everything. In that sense, of course we try to take advantage of it. So having him in training, like in games is a privilege. These are things that do not happen every day, sharing trainings and matches with him. When I’m young, I try to observe, to learn a lot. Because it does not always happen and for me it’s a privilege and try to learn as much as I can alongside it.</p>

  <p><b>[Argentina vs Chile. Giovani Lo Celso eased fears over his fitness following a pair of injury scares in Argentina’s friendly against Chile in Los Angeles]</b> It was only a blow, nothing to worry about<br /><br /><b>[Lo Celso almost made the breakthrough for Argentina when he volleyed marginally wide of <a href="claudio-bravo.html">Claudio Bravo</a>’s goal shortly before the interval]</b> We deserved a bit more. We had a lot of chances to score but it wasn’t to be. We had a good game, generally speaking. The first half was where we had the most chances. We created some good opportunities with a lot of people in attack. We were up against a very tough opponent and we were up to their level</p>

  <p><b>[Giovani Lo Celso says It will take time for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> to fully adjust to <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>’s new ideas and tactics]</b> We know that it takes time when you’ve got a new coaching staff, a new head coach. It takes time for the team to take on board all the new ideas - we know they bring with them new ways of working, new methods, new ideas. The main thing is this period started with a victory initially and that gives confidence, not only to the players, but also to the coaching staff and manager as well. I think it will take time to really take on board the new ideas and tactics, but I think we’ve started well and that’s a positive<br /><br /><b>[Lo Celso, who is still looking for his first appearance under <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>]</b> It’s all about trying to do the best for the team. It’s the manager’s decision at the end of the day, we’re just professional players. I’m here first and foremost to improve and grow as a player and an individual and give 100 per cent on the training field and on the pitch. After that, it’s down to the manager to decide</p>
