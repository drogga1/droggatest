  <p><b>[Tore Andre Flo believes Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s call-up to the England squad for the 2018 World Cup could give him the impetus he needs to become a first-team regular at Chelsea]</b> I really have high hopes for Ruben. He is a brilliant player and I have been following him through his years in the academy as well. He seems to have taken that step well into senior football. He is very very exciting and I hope he gets his chance at the World Cup and that he takes it. He has definitely got the potential and he is exciting to watch. He might be ready for Chelsea, that’s up to the manager to decide, I guess. I think it is something that we will continuously discuss. He is one of those that we think might be ready, we need to have the manager in on that, with a good World Cup again he could really be in the Chelsea squad again but it is not for me to say, yes or no on whether he will definitely do it. I think so, yes <b>[that he is ready to start]</b>. Obviously, he is still quite young and maybe a bit inexperienced when it comes to these types of games but he has got the quality to do it. He might be eased in a little bit but he can also come on and make an impact..<br /><br />Yes, it is a very very proud moment. He has done so well there especially in the second part of the season. This was his first loan and the first time in senior football, it took him a little bit of time to break into the team at Vitesse where he played, but from then on he was brilliant. Fourteen goals, voted player of the year, he has got a great future. He is a really really good talent</p>

  <p><b>[Loan army! How Chelsea &amp; Sarri decide who says and who goes]</b> We look after these players. We make sure that they get the best possible help. I think that most of them benefit from that, instead of going to another club. Obviously, when they are not ready, they go to a lower team, maybe even a division down. But we help them with their game, tell them what they have to improve upon, what they are doing well and each individual have a really good follow-up. I think they benefit from that but we also need to make them aware that to break into Chelsea’s first team is an extremely difficult.</p>

  <p><b>[Tore Andre Flo says <a href="erling-haland.html">Erling Haaland</a> can handle the intense spotlight on him thanks to his footballing father Alf-Inge <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a>]</b> I think it is all about keeping your feet on the ground and for him to continue to work hard. If you don’t keep your feet on the ground, your mind wanders everywhere. Knowing his father, he can control that. If we talk about someone who has surprised me, he has taken the step up unbelievably well. He is now the wonderkid of the whole world. I first knew about him playing for Molde in Norway, he was starting to do well there. I think he was similar then but he has more of everything now, more power, quicker and very effective in front of goal. His best quality is to be effective. He has some of the best stats I have seen for a very long time and he is only 19 years old. He has a bright future<br /><br />We have a second chance in this Euro 2020 play-off against Serbia. Suddenly, Norway has got plenty of talents coming through. It is similar for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> now and I hope we can finally make it after so long out of these summer tournaments</p>

  <p><b>[Tore Andre Flo does not believe that <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>’s reform of football’s loan system will negatively affect <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> We expected changes, we’re doing our planning now and we will adjust things if we need to. Club-trained players under the age of 22 don’t count under the new rules and they’re the main focus of our programme, which is about sending our academy graduates out on loan. So, I don’t think it will affect us much. As a club, we already have fewer players out on loan now than before, so it is already a bit more focused. We can work a bit more with each player. I think that this season has been a success story for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s loan programme overall. It has been a brilliant season. We have had so many players from previous years go into the first team and be an amazing success for the club. It is nice, especially for those of us who work with the youngsters to see that our policy is working. This is something we have been working for a long time and we are really seeing the benefits of it now in the last few years. It is very important for these guys to show the younger ones a way to get through to the first team. It is important for the academy and young players. It has been a great year and <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> has definitely made our jobs easier. I think everyone working for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are very happy to see these young players coming through and getting the chance. They all have surprised us a little bit by making the step up so quickly. But it just goes to show that when you give them a chance, they can take the opportunities. They have definitely done that this season.<br /><br /><b>[Flo is not expecting as many academy graduates to break into the senior squad next season but he has been hugely impressed by Gallagher’s development]</b> It has been a decent year for us. But in terms of how many players we have in the first team, that will go up and down year-by-year. Still, the likes of Conor have been very good. This is his first year as a senior player and he has got a lot of valuable experience by playing football at Championship level, which is great. So, he’s a very exciting prospect for us</p>
