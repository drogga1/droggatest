  <p><b>[Sadio Mane is flourishing at Liverpool]</b> I think he is up there, but sometimes - whether it is fair or not - the critics are saying he doesn’t score enough goals. I think this year he is doing it more. Even though this year he is on 20 goals, I think he could have been on 24 or 25 goals if you look at some of the chances he missed at the beginning of the season. Of course, if we talk about Ballon d’Or, you talk about trophies and he needs to win trophies. He knows that. And whoever plays for Liverpool as well, as a club, they have been starving for years for trophies and now is the right time. Mane is on fire, Salah is on fire and now is a good time to bring a trophy back<br /><br />I think it’s fantastic to see Sadio doing better. So this year he has stepped up another level and I think people are thinking he has been very clinical in comparison with Mo Salah. I think the fact he lost the <b>[African version of]</b> Ballon d’Or, through that <b>[lack of goals]</b>. And that is where he has to be more clinical. I think that hurt him a lot and I see him gaining maturity and people are seeing everything he can do. He is getting more versatile on the pitch as well and I see him doing a lot more as a striker. I think they complement each other <b>[in the front three]</b> and that is just great with Roberto Firmino dropping off and Salah or Mane taking on those positions. I think all that is helping him to be more clinical in front of goal</p>

  <p><b>[How Sadio Mane became Liverpool’s main man]</b> Everyone wants to be Sadio Mane in Senegal - and why wouldn’t they?<br /><br />Senegal is mad about Liverpool. And we try to use the game, and people like Sadio, as a tool, to show the kids what can be achieved if they go to school and if they work hard. For Senegalese people, when Sadio does well and when Liverpool win, it is like a victory for the whole country. It means everything<br /><br />If you look at last season when the Ballon d’Or list came out. <b>[Mohamed]</b> Salah was right up there, but Sadio wasn’t. And that was purely because of the goals. Salah was more clinical in front of goal, and that was why he got all the awards and the praise at the end of the year. I think Sadio recognised that, and you can see how he has used that this season. He’s more focused in front of goal, he’s more clinical, and that is making the difference. He has taken another step, and I think if he carries on this development then we will have a great chance to win trophies, big awards, and he will get the kind of recognition that Salah has had<br /><br />It’s still home to me. I always say with Liverpool, the first thing you miss is the people. I have many friends there, and many great memories. It’s a fantastic place<br /><br />Today, you cannot be only a good coach. You have to be a great psychologist as well. You have to connect with players and find ways to get the best out of them. Klopp does that. He’s an extrovert, and a great communicator. I think that suits the people of Liverpool, because he shares their mentality. He is authentic and open, and the fans respond to that. You can see that there is synergy between the stands and the pitch, and that can make a big difference to a team<br /><br />Everything is still on the table. It’s all there to be taken. But no matter what, you see everything that is going on around the club, and it is just all so positive. The club is in good health, the team is doing well and, as a Senegalese, to have Sadio doing what he’s doing as well, it’s just perfect. Well, nearly perfect!</p>
