  <p><b>[Alan Kennedy says With one or two signings <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> can dominate for six years]</b> I want to give them praise but I think there is a lot more to come when they get experience and they might need to add one or two other players but I think the football I’ve seen is the best since I played back in the 70s and 80s.<br /><br />This team that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have now is probably the best since that era of invincibility. We were all out attack from the first minute of the game. I sometimes wonder if <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> watched <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> play in the 70s and 80s and copied what we did. The quality is so good that even when someone gives the ball away, just once, you think: ‘what is he doing giving the ball away, what will we do?’ Well, they just get it back.<br /><br />I really do enjoy watching this team. All credit to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> who have been at the top for the last five or six years - and they are still there because they are still chasing with others - but <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, if they can get their act together, can be dominant for the next five or six years<br /><br /><b>[Kennedy is a big fan of his fellow left-back, adding on Liverpool’s options]</b> My job, Phil Neal’s job and <a href="alan-hansen.html">Alan Hansen</a>’s job was to stop them playing, stop them scoring and that’s exactly what I see in <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> and whoever plays alongside him and, of course, <a href="andy-robertson.html">Andy Robertson</a> and <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> as well. I have been very, very impressed by both full backs. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> broke the record for a full-back at the particular time I signed. <b>[But]</b> I was never assured of first-team football at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and you had to earn the right to be No.1 and that’s exactly what <a href="andy-robertson.html">Andy Robertson</a> has done.<br /><br />I just think that Andy is a player who is the best in his position <b>[in England]</b>. There may be one or two others who I haven’t really looked at in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and people will say: ‘what about this one?’ but I watch Andy every week and I’m always impressed with his ability to defend - because that’s what his job is - and then to get forward to support the attack. He knows exactly what he has to do and I think he carries out the instructions perfectly</p>
