You could feel it in the city that people have really taken notice, people are proud and excited. Tonight was a speical night and ten days from now we want to do one better</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Bradley comments on the appointment of his father <a href="bob-bradley.html">Bob Bradley</a> as Los Angeles FC’s first ever head coach]</b> For 33 games next year I’ll be LAFC’s biggest fan, there’s no two ways about that, but I’m not going anywhere. I love Toronto. Toronto’s my home. Toronto’s my club, and I’ve never been more committed to trying to finish what I went there for, which was to win, to hold up trophies</p>

  <p><b>[Saturday’s 6-0 rout, coupled with the 4-0 win against Guyana, have helped eased some of the concerns surrounding the USMNT after back-to-back friendly losses against Jamaica and Venezuela]</b> We weren’t ready to kill ourselves after the results in the two friendlies and we’re not ready to anoint ourselves champions of the world either. This is still a work in progress. We feel good about the work that’s going into it. We feel like we’re on the right path. We feel like we’re building something that can continue to get better and better, but we understand these are all steps along the way.<br /><br />The first two games have been good, but they’re just the start. We understand that as the tournament goes on games get harder, things get more competitive, and the level from everybody has to go up</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico vs USA. Captain Michael Bradley, meanwhile, has been full of praise for the job done by Tata Martino since taking over as Mexico boss in January this year]</b> When I watch them right now, I think that Tata Martino has done a very good job of putting his imprint on the team in a short amount of time. You watch them and you see a Tata Martino team. They’re mobile, They’re dynamic. They are very good in transition when they can win balls and get guys moving forward. They look to press and be aggressive</p>

  <p><b>[Gregg Berhalter watched his team attack Mexico’s defense relentlessly in the first half. Michael Bradley were clearly worn out after the first 60 minutes]</b> As we continue to grow and mature as a team, one of the things we’ll always need to work on is the balance of using the speed and direct attacking ability of guys like Christian and Jozy, Jordan Morris and Paul Arriola. A bunch more guys as well whose ability to be fast and mobile and on the move in a vertical way towards the goal is quite good. We want to use that, we want to take advantage of that, but we also then, in other moments, want to know how to slow things down. Know how to make the first pass or two out of our half, but then be able to manage things and connect passes and drive the other team back a little bit. It’s a balance</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Bradley admitted that he is frustrated with missing out on the chance to join up with the U.S. men’s national team for upcoming friendlies due to Toronto FC’s <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> schedule]</b> It’s the worst part about the league: the fact that teams play through <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> dates because as you’re trying to give everything you have for your club team and the national team, there’s too many moments where you’re missing something. It’s got to be one of the next steps for the league in terms of respecting the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> dates, not playing through summer tournaments. And it always comes back to scheduling issues and all this. I get it but it has to become something where it gets worked around. Because you can’t have the rest of the world respecting the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> calendar and <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> dates and then there’s still a full slate of <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> games … It’s not the right way to do things<br /><br />I love playing for the national team. I’m very committed to what’s going on there and with <a href="gregg-berhalter.html">Gregg Berhalter</a> and his staff. But for right now, for this next period, given how many games we have, given how important the games are here, it’s really important that I’m here.</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Bradley says he hopes to remain with Toronto FC for a long time]</b> My position is I love the club, love the team and love the city. And I’ve never felt more at home anywhere in my life than here, in every sense - in a sporting sense, in a family sense. That part, that’s an incredible feeling. When you walk out on the field the other night and see a banner like that, it gives you goosebumps. It’s another reminder of how lucky I am to be here to play for this club, to captain this club … So I’m not going to talk specifically about contracts or negotiations or anything in that way because I said at the beginning of the year that I didn’t want anything taken away from the team and the focus of what we’re trying to do. Everything will get sorted out in the right time. But again, I love it here. I’ve loved every second here and I certainly hope that I’m going to be here for a long time still</p>

  <p><b>[Jozy Altidore still questionable, but ready to help Toronto FC]</b> Jozy can play. Jozy can not play and you can put somebody on for him in, more-or-less have it be a straight swap; and Jozy can not play and you can find a different way or two to finagle things<br /><br />We have enough experience with all three of those scenarios, we’ve worked through all three of them. And now over the next day or two, we’ll figure out exactly how he is feeling, whether he is good to start, to come off the bench, and then figure out from there what the best way to go about things is. We’ll be ready regardless.</p>

  <p><b>[The Seattle Sounders and Toronto FC will collide on Sunday for an <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup rubber match that looked all too improbable just several weeks ago]</b> It’s the same opponent. Their team has changed a little bit, and so has ours. We feel like we have a pretty good grip on them, what makes them good, who makes them good. The things that they try to do as they go into games. I’m sure they feel in a similar way about us. But there’s still a part to this third final where, two years on, both teams have changed and evolved. The setting is different. You always use past experiences to help you in every possible way. I don’t think anybody is going to spend too much time thinking or worrying about what’s gone on in the past</p>

  <p><b>[Midfielder Michael Bradley says that <a href="donald-trump.html">President Donald Trump</a> is ‘completely empty’, adding that there ‘isn’t a moral bone in his body’]</b> We have a president who is completely empty. There isn’t a moral bone in his body. There’s no leadership. There’s no leadership from the president, there’s no leadership from the Republican senators who have sat back and been totally complicit in everything he’s done for the last three and a half years. I’m angry, I’m horrified, I’m sad and I’m determined to do anything and everything I can to try to be a part of the fix. Because it has to end. And we all have to be part of that fix. If we want any chance to start to fix those things, then Trump can’t be president, it’s as simple as that<br /><br /><b>[The USMNT midfielder says that the last week has only further illustrated how important it is for Americans to make their opinions heard and vote in their federal and local elections]</b> I just hope that people are able to go to the polls in November and think about more than just what is good for them, more than what is good for their own status, their own business, their own tax return. I hope that people can go to the polls and understand that in so many ways, the future of our country and the future of our democracy is at stake. We need as many people as possible to understand that at a real level, to think about what four more years with Trump as president, what that would mean, how terrible that would be for so many people.</p>
