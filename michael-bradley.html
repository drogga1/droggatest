  <p><b>[Michael Bradley said when asked what would be the key to breaking down a defensive-minded team]</b> Patience is important. You understand that when you play against a team that has a lot of guys behind the ball, and lines are tight, the understanding that things aren’t going to come easy. There’s not going to be tons of space. It’s not going to be, I wouldn’t think, a wide-open game. We’ve worked on a few things in terms of how we would like to go about things so that we can put them on their heels a little bit, and be dangerous and tilt the bar in our favor.</p>

If, in the end, it means that we take one then so be it, but we’ve got to follow up the good performance on Friday with another one here on Tuesday night.<br /><br />The result the other night won’t sit well with them. We expect that, playing at home, they’ll come out and really be aggressive and try to use the support to tilt the bar in their favor. We know them pretty well, both in terms of playing against them as a national team many over the years, and obviously the other part to it now is a lot of their players play in MLS, and are teammates and opponents of ours on a weekly basis. We have a lot of respect for them. They have a unique and interesting blend of skill and athleticism that always challenges us in a big way<br /><br />We feel good about things. It’s been a good week. Obviously we all understand that just because we’ve had one good result doesn’t mean that we’re out of the woods yet</p>

  <p><b>[USA District Court in Texas has dismissed a class-action lawsuit filed by a trio of youth clubs against the MLS Players Union and U.S. national team stars Michael Bradley, DeAndre Yedlin and Clint Dempsey. Bob Foose said]</b> We have said consistently that training compensation and solidarity payments are bad for players, and would treat players differently than employees in any other industry, including sports. For example, it’s absurd to think that a business school could demand a fee from a company that hired one of its students. Yet, that’s the kind of payments the youth clubs seek.<br /><br />No player should have the market for his services adversely affected by these payments. This is not to say that players and the Players Union don’t believe in and support youth development. We do, but it should not be funded through a tax on randomly selected professional players’ contracts</p>

  <p><b>[When asked what makes Arena so effective]</b> I think his ability to size up the group, and his ability to understand that you are always going to have different personalities. You can’t necessarily treat every guy and every group the same way. You have to use your experience, your feel for people, and allow that to shape the way you coach a team. I think his experience and his ability to find the right ways to put together teams is certainly at the highest level. I think we’ve all seen that for the past few months.</p>

You can see what a good kid he is, how much he loves to play, how much he enjoys the time with our group.

I love to play, I love to train, I love to compete and ultimately when those are your starting points then it doesn’t feel like work. It’s never a burden for me to wake up and go into training because it’s genuinely what I love doing.<br /><br />I try to live the right way. I look after myself. I live my life in a way that I hope means that I have my best years in front of me. I will continue to try to push myself, challenge myself to improve, look at things that need to be better, and ultimately take everything that I do on the field and in the team and make it count for more and hold up in the biggest and best moments.<br /><br /><b>[Bradley said of the winning ways TFC and the USMNT are enjoying in 2017]</b> I did envision it this way. When you go through moments where things don’t go your way, there’s no time to feel sorry for yourself. There’s no time to stop. We had conversations in Toronto at our training ground the morning after we lost the final. When you looked around, you could see in guys’ eyes that we wanted the season to begin the next day<br /><br />There was a similar feeling in January camp when we started with this group. We understood that we let things get away from us at the end of the year and there was big motivation to make sure that we put things right. We all understand that getting to a World Cup is pass or fail, and at the end, it doesn’t matter who the coach is. Nothing else matters. It’s up to us players to step on the field and make sure that we find the right ways to do whatever it takes to qualify<br /><br />The chance to captain the national team and my club, it’s a huge honor, and it’s been a good year so far, but I also understand that we haven’t done anything yet. We haven’t done anything yet in terms of qualifying, even though the Gold Cup was a big moment for us. We haven’t done anything yet with Toronto. The biggest games are still to come. The big prizes are still coming, and as long as that’s the case, I’m going to keep going</p>

We had 90 minutes to play our way into a World Cup, not needing to rely on anything else, and we let ourselves down. Plain and simple.<br /><br />We’re not the first big country to miss out and won’t be the last. We had our chance to get in. On the night, it was a perfect storm in three stadiums that led to us not. When we dropped points along the way, we knew we were going to be at the mercy of a night like that.<br /><br />A bounce here, ball goes off the outside of Omar Gonzalez’s foot and into the goal, Clint <b>[Dempsey]</b>’s shot goes off the outside of the post at the end… margins were fine. We have nobody to blame but ourselves for that. When we let the points get away, it meant we lost any ability to be above that stuff. The way things unfolded, we weren’t able to take care of our end of the bargain.<br /><br />I have a huge responsibility here as captain to make sure not one ounce of anger, or frustration, or disappointment carries over. That wouldn’t be fair to anybody; teammates, coaches, our fans. I can promise that in no way is the disappointment of not qualifying going to play into what we’re doing here over the next two months. We’ve had an incredible season, we’ve won two trophies, and we are ready to give everything to make sure we lift the third.</p>

How that goes is completely up to them. As players, as competitors, you enjoy playing in big games, you enjoy competing when everything’s on the line. You enjoy playing in big atmospheres.

They shouldn’t even be anywhere close to our locker room, and somehow there’s 10 of their players and a bunch of their staff five, seven feet from our locker room. They shouldn’t even be here. So right away the red flags go up<br /><br />Games at this time of year can get turned on their head pretty quickly and the game tonight got turned on its head.

  <p><b>[Can TFC-Sounders be the Lakers-Celtics rivalry of MLS?]</b> For the league to have more and more clubs that are willing to spend in different areas, willing to do whatever it takes to make sure that on and off the field things are done at the highest level, that’s how the league gets moved forward. It’s even more exciting when you have another season where the two teams standing at the end are two of those types of clubs, because I think it justifies everything that is being done and it encourages everyone else to do the same to try to keep .</p>

We want to play and represent them in a way that makes them proud, that makes them leave here and feel like they were a part of something different. We all feel like that and we hope they do too.</p>

  <p><b>[On Toronto FC’s MLS Cup]</b> This has been our dream, our obsession, for the last year. And to be able to take care of everything that we wanted, to be able to lift that trophy in this city, in front of our fans - to be able to give everybody a day like this, this is why every single one of us are here.<br /><br />Somebody reminded me yesterday and they referenced the Blue Jays in ‘92 and ‘93. They won, but then they won again the next year. So we’re gonna enjoy this for little bit longer and then we’re gonna dust ourselves off and make sure we get back to work so that we can be lifting that trophy again next year</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto FC out to prove MLS worthy of Liga MX attention]</b> These opportunities to test yourself individually and collectively at the highest level don’t come around every single week - where there’s so much on the line, even in terms of just perception, right or wrong. The opportunity to prove ourselves to a few people who don’t think we’re as good or the quality of the league is as good. We take the responsibility very seriously. We obviously put a lot into <b>[the first leg]</b> on Wednesday night and we’re ready to do it again.</p>

To play well, to win, to show individually what you’re about and what part you can play in things going forward. But, on the flip side, it’s March of 2019, in the big picture these are friendly games. It’s still important that we’re building a team. It’s still important that everybody has the right amount of patience and understanding with what Gregg is trying to do with some of the younger players, and the team as a whole. Saying that doesn’t take the two games and make them any less important. When you look at the big picture, it’s still important for everybody to realize that this is one of the first steps along the way</p>

  <p><b>[Saturday’s 6-0 rout, coupled with the 4-0 win against Guyana, have helped eased some of the concerns surrounding the USMNT after back-to-back friendly losses against Jamaica and Venezuela]</b> We weren’t ready to kill ourselves after the results in the two friendlies and we’re not ready to anoint ourselves champions of the world either. This is still a work in progress. We feel good about the work that’s going into it. We feel like we’re on the right path. We feel like we’re building something that can continue to get better and better, but we understand these are all steps along the way.<br /><br />The first two games have been good, but they’re just the start. We understand that as the tournament goes on games get harder, things get more competitive, and the level from everybody has to go up</p>

You watch them and you see a <a href="tata-martino.html">Tata Martino</a> team. They’re mobile, They’re dynamic. They are very good in transition when they can win balls and get guys moving forward.

A bunch more guys as well whose ability to be fast and mobile and on the move in a vertical way towards the goal is quite good. We want to use that, we want to take advantage of that, but we also then, in other moments, want to know how to slow things down. Know how to make the first pass or two out of our half, but then be able to manage things and connect passes and drive the other team back a little bit. It’s a balance</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Bradley admitted that he is frustrated with missing out on the chance to join up with the U.S. men’s national team for upcoming friendlies due to Toronto FC’s <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> schedule]</b> It’s the worst part about the league: the fact that teams play through <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> dates because as you’re trying to give everything you have for your club team and the national team, there’s too many moments where you’re missing something. It’s got to be one of the next steps for the league in terms of respecting the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> dates, not playing through summer tournaments. And it always comes back to scheduling issues and all this. I get it but it has to become something where it gets worked around. Because you can’t have the rest of the world respecting the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> calendar and <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> dates and then there’s still a full slate of <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> games … It’s not the right way to do things<br /><br />I love playing for the national team.

  <p><b>[Michael Bradley says he hopes to remain with Toronto FC for a long time]</b> My position is I love the club, love the team and love the city. And I’ve never felt more at home anywhere in my life than here, in every sense - in a sporting sense, in a family sense. That part, that’s an incredible feeling. When you walk out on the field the other night and see a banner like that, it gives you goosebumps. It’s another reminder of how lucky I am to be here to play for this club, to captain this club … So I’m not going to talk specifically about contracts or negotiations or anything in that way because I said at the beginning of the year that I didn’t want anything taken away from the team and the focus of what we’re trying to do. Everything will get sorted out in the right time. But again, I love it here. I’ve loved every second here and I certainly hope that I’m going to be here for a long time still</p>

And now over the next day or two, we’ll figure out exactly how he is feeling, whether he is good to start, to come off the bench, and then figure out from there what the best way to go about things is.

Their team has changed a little bit, and so has ours. We feel like we have a pretty good grip on them, what makes them good, who makes them good. The things that they try to do as they go into games. I’m sure they feel in a similar way about us. But there’s still a part to this third final where, two years on, both teams have changed and evolved. The setting is different. You always use past experiences to help you in every possible way. I don’t think anybody is going to spend too much time thinking or worrying about what’s gone on in the past</p>

I hope that people can go to the polls and understand that in so many ways, the future of our country and the future of our democracy is at stake. We need as many people as possible to understand that at a real level, to think about what four more years with Trump as president, what that would mean, how terrible that would be for so many people.</p>
