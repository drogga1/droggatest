He possesses a level of self-assured arrogance, which is a positive as he’s not too arrogant. On the contrary, he’s a bright lad who is mature for his age. He’s a wonderfully gifted player with great balance and the ability to go past people. When I see his poise on the ball, he has characteristics of Johan Cruyff</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United manager David Moyes believes the club have fallen out of competition for silverware because of their ambiguous transfer strategy]</b> For a while it would be difficult to know what direction United have gone in. Whether they have been signing players for marketing, which they are fantastic at, or whether it has been signing players for on the pitch, I am not quite sure. What Manchester United had was great values and class. Manchester United’s values weren’t always to buy the most expensive players but to do it their way which was bringing in the boys from the academy and picking up the best young players. Now and again there would be a sprinkling of stardust, like an Eric Cantona, or someone who they signed to make the difference, like Robin van Persie. I never thought they were a club who thought it was all about spending the money, but if they needed to, they could</p>

  <p><b>[David Moyes has claimed Harry Maguire had a big arse. The Scot admits to being aware of the potential of the former Sheffield United man]</b> We didn’t try to sign him but we flagged him up at that time. I was very aware of the players in the lower leagues and had a made good career out of bringing them to Everton - whether that be Tim Cahill or all the ones we did through the years. Harry Maguire was another one I recognised. He played against Preston North End at home in a league game and I watched him and thought he played really well but at that time he was really big - he had a big arse. You thought: ‘My goodness, how big is Harry going to be’ because he was a relatively young boy at that time.<br /><br />To be fair he looks in terrific shape and he hasn’t changed at all really. When I went to United, we had Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand, Jonny Evans, Michael Keane, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling so for us to go and buy another young centre-half wasn’t the biggest thing we needed at the time. And Harry Maguire has had to go on his journey. Sometimes the players need the journey to get to where they have to go. He might have struggled then<br /><br /><b>[He added on the divisive World Cup winner Paul Pogba]</b> I think Manchester United should keep Pogba because he is one the top players in the world. He has got really good ability. He might have just needed a bit of time to settle. I think it has been unsettling because of the way him or his agent have come out and said he wants to move again. But if you look at Manchester United’s midfield on Sunday, not having Paul Pogba would have made them much weaker</p>

  <p><b>[David Moyes has expressed his interest in joining the ‘magic’ of David Beckham’s new MLS franchise, with Inter Miami an opportunity he would not pass up]</b> It is something which looks a really interesting project. I watch the MLS quite a bit and it is getting better. I don’t know how many people have seen Atlanta. The soccer team are getting more support than the NFL team. We talk about Tottenham’s stadium and that is incredible but wait until you see Atlanta’s stadium, it is unbelievable. So MLS is growing and Miami is a great city. It is something which I would consider as an option. Miami has got a bit of magic about it. Atlanta’s training centre is as good as anything in the Premier League and I know Miami are trying to do the same over there. The MLS is an exciting league<br /><br /><b>[Moyes is still looking for a job in England at this stage]</b> My preference would be to be back in the Premier League bit if the opportunity came around, I would have to look at it.

I think Wayne eventually put a transfer request in and the owners of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> turned round and said ‘you don’t think we listen to transfer requests, we had far better players, many players who have put in transfer requests, we tell them when we want them to leave Manchester United’<br /><br /><b>[Moyes insists <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, who were an emerging force at the time, were not the destination <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> had his eye on]</b> No he wasn’t going to cross the city.

I do believe that the squad of players I’ve got here is a better squad of players than when I took over before, so I am looking forward to working with them. I think there’s got to be a short-term goal for us just now to get the wins to get us away from the wrong end of the league and what we’re going to do over the next six months, then what we’re going to do over the next period as well.

I’m going to make it impossible that that clause can’t be activated. It’s up to the players to make sure of that now. It says an awful lot about the owners that they think the job I did with my backroom staff to give me another chance. This time, I’m going to give them no choice but to extend it. Last time when we came in, we needed results and it’s similar this time but I know I’ve got a little bit longer this time to execute my plans<br /><br />I’ve tried to make sure I’ve educated myself while I’ve been off. I’ve worked with <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> and I’ve tried to watch every Champions League game. For me, it was about staying in touch with football. I watch a lot of football, I am at games most weekends, I’m a football man. You’re always looking to pick up new ideas. There are a lot of new modern things, but there has also been signs recently of going back to old times. Maybe possession isn’t always key to winning games. We want to see more attacking football, action, excitement. The biggest thing I want to see is the supporters enjoying watching the team<br /><br /><b>[Moyes feels the squad he is inheriting from Pellegrini is stronger than the one he left behind in May 2018]</b> I believe it is <b>[stronger]</b>. The club have spent well on players. If we’re being truthful, we need those players to stand up. They will have a massive impact on the support and they need to stand up in the coming weeks. I think there is money there to spend. I am more interested in the players at the club at the moment, to see how we can mould them into the best possible team and formation.

We know he will give us something else as a midfield player but he showed he was defensively sound when he goes into the back line as well.

  <p><b>[David Moyes expects <a href="declan-rice.html">Declan Rice</a> to become club captain at West Ham]</b> Declan will go on to be a future captain of <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>, there’s no doubt about that. I can see big improvements from when I left. He’s now someone who is physically much better: he’s much quicker, much stronger. And he has a better understanding.<br /><br />I think he’s learning under <a href="mark-noble.html">Mark Noble</a> the leadership side of it. He was a quiet boy when I first came to the club, but he’s developing a good personality. He’s got a lot of things to do better but as a young boy, he’s doing very well.<br /><br />So many of the young boys these days are looking to be improved by coaches but quite often it’s your own self-development as a player. You have to develop yourself, you have to understand, you have to pick things up very quickly and not always rely on you coaches to be your guide.<br /><br />Many of the great players got into a team and had to find their own way to do things. Declan’s doing that himself. He is self-developing - and he’s doing an awful lot of things which prove why he’s getting into <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a>’s England squads<br /><br />There are bits of his game which we are hoping he’ll improve with time, with development. But at the moment he’s taking a big role at the club. There’s no one better for him to look up to at this club. Mark will give him a true reflection on how he is and how the club is. He’s good that way. But Mark probably learnt from really good people in front of him over the years, he had people to look up to. You need people the young players should be aspiring to</p>
