He possesses a level of self-assured arrogance, which is a positive as he’s not too arrogant. On the contrary, he’s a bright lad who is mature for his age. He’s a wonderfully gifted player with great balance and the ability to go past people. When I see his poise on the ball, he has characteristics of Johan Cruyff</p>

We really like him, he’s infectious, and he’s a good character. I spoke to him a few weeks ago and said I thought his levels had just dipped a little, but that would be normal for a young player when you think of the games we asked him to play in and the position the team had been in. But in the last week or so he had started to look fresher in training and the injury is a real blow for him, and for us</p>

  <p><b>[Moyes praises Chicharito as transfer rumors swirl]</b> The form of Marko Arnautovic and Michail Antonio, at the start, has probably made it difficult. When I joined, Javier was injured and we had to go with Marko and Michail up front in different games. They’ve both done really well. Chicharito is a really good player and his finishing ability is as good as there is anywhere. He thrives on balls in the box and maybe in a lot of games we’ve not had that service to give him. We’ve got players like Chicharito who need supplying in the box. We’ve got Andy Carroll who probably needs to be supplied with crosses. We’ve got Andre Ayew who looks for good balls into feet in and around the box. We’ve got very different forward players who I think we will need at very different times in games. We can do with them all being fit so I’ve got options in the games.<br /><br />At United, Sir Alex Ferguson used to play him from the bench quite a lot. I was well aware, when I joined Manchester United, that Chicharito would want more minutes. Also, I had Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Danny Welbeck, to name a few. The competition at football clubs is hard, but if you’re a good player then you get there, and Chicharito is a good player</p>

  <p><b>[Pickford urged to ignore Bayern talk and stick with Everton]</b> I think Everton is the right club for Jordan. It’s a big club, he’s only just moved and I would say to him it would be stupid to even consider another move if there was to be an option for him. I think it will help him being at Everton because he will get enough work and he’s got a chance to develop without every single thing he does being scrutinised. He is still young and he just needs to keep getting his games in. The last thing he needs to bother about is any speculation. If you go to the World Cup and do as well as he has done, you’ve shown you can stand on any stage. But all he needs to do is go back to Everton, keep working and look to improve. Don’t let anything slip, don’t be complacent. At the moment he is a young player who has played very well. But the key to being a top player is going back and performing just as well.<br /><br />Near enough everybody accepts him as England’s No. 1 now and, at the age he is, that shows how good he is. But there’s also a chance that if he does it right, there is longevity for him. He could easily be England’s No. 1 for the next 10 years. He was always going to reach the top level because he’s got the ability. It was always about him putting the hours in, making sure he eats well and lives well. He looks much leaner now and he’s got himself in really good physical condition. But now it is up to him to maintain and improve on his standards</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United can take charge of the Premier League title race by making the most of a favourable fixture list]</b> I agree to the point that it doesn’t matter who you’re playing in the Premier League, they’re tough. But if you look at the games that Manchester United play in the first nine or 10 games, you’re not playing a City, an Arsenal, a Chelsea in that period. I wonder if Jose’s words the other day, ‘Let’s wait until the end of November’, I would be very surprised if United weren’t top of the league come the end of November. I think that the fixtures that have come out for them and the way it’s worked, I think will give them every opportunity to be there.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United, Everton and West Ham boss David Moyes has invited an offer from the U.S. national team]</b> I would have to consider the USA job if I was approached because it’s one of the big nations in world football, with massive growth potential. They have a constantly improving league, you’ve got David Beckham’s team coming into Miami and Nashville as well, so if it came up I would have a real interest.<br /><br />Our mission was to keep the club up. We achieved that and we beat Barcelona in the process. I really enjoyed it, had the chance to see a different side, and would be interested in working in Spain again - or any of the other major leagues in Europe. I recently went out to see the Red Bull model at Salzburg and I’ve been keeping busy watching games and would be interested working in Europe again if the opportunity arose<br /><br />Only Sir Alex, Arsene Wenger and Harry Redknapp have won more games in the Premier League than me. I would still consider myself in the elite group of managers. If it was me against someone else I’d trust myself. I’ve had my down times, as every manager does, but I bounce back pretty quickly. I now have the same excitement, determination and hunger as I’ve ever had. You get knocks but you get back on the horse - and I am ready again</p>

  <p><b>[David Moyes says Everton were just one piece away from challenging for Premier League glory during his tenure]</b> I was here for 11 and a half years, and I think by the time we finished, we had a great team. I think our style was as good as anyone. We were probably a centre-forward away from being contenders for the Premier League. We had Mikel Arteta, Steven Pienaar, Leighton Baines, Seamus Coleman, Sylvain Distin, Phil Jagielka, you could go on with the players we had. It was a terrific team.<br /><br />I think it’s good they’ve spent money but we signed fantastic players with a great spirit, we had a great ethos at the club and what the club stood for - I think they’ve gone off that, a little bit. I don’t know who made all the signings over the past few years, was it the owner, the sporting director or coach? But I know when I was here it was me, and I was always supported by Bill Kenwright. There’s a lot of players who have come in and I’m not sure I would put all of them down as Everton-type players. But, for example, Richarlison was a great player for Watford last season, and he’s got a good chance of improving too. You’ve got to be hungry, with a desire and energy, but you’ve got to have that style about you where you can play. You’re under pressure here. The crowd are demanding, but they also want to see you’re committed</p>

But it was only going to get done at the end of the season before he joined Real Madrid.<br /><br />Do I feel I should have been given more time? Of course I do. To go to a club like Manchester United and follow someone like Sir Alex after the time he had been there, to stay for ten months … It couldn’t be a revolution at Manchester United, it had to be evolution. It had to take time. I wasn’t going to come in and change all the things Alex had done, but there were lots of things that had to be changed at the club. You look at the way Chelsea and Man City had been doing things and changing things along the way - Manchester United had been winning because they had a special manager and a special group of players. But when that all changed, it was going to take time to find its way. I still think they’re having difficult times at the moment</p>

I think there’s a big demand. Whoever gets the job, you have to win the games and I fully understood that. I didn’t go in thinking that wasn’t the case. I didn’t win enough games, and ultimately if you don’t win enough games you lose your job. The most asked question I get is ‘what would you do different David?’<br /><br />I wouldn’t do anything different. I’ve got some small things - I might have in hindsight kept one of the staff which Sir Alex had. I tried to do that and it didn’t work out. I offered Rene <b>[Meulensteen]</b> the job, and he didn’t take it, and in hindsight I would have been better keeping Mike <b>[Phelan]</b>.

The Scotland job is difficult for anybody because there’s great expectation. I don’t think there’s any one way we can fix it. I don’t have all the answers, but I’ve got some ideas and thoughts. There are many things we’re not doing in Scotland, we’ve chosen to bring in lots of foreign players, and cheap foreign players, and maybe a lot of the young Scottish players are not getting the opportunities.

We have to win our games and perform better than we have done<br /><br />I think Declan could arguably be my best centre-half and my best midfield player so we have to try and see what we’ve got and who is fit (against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> on Tuesday) and use him the best we can. We know he will give us something else as a midfield player but he showed he was defensively sound when he goes into the back line as well. It’s really good for Declan that he’s improved so much and can play both positions. Going forward for himself and for us it’s a great thing to have, the ability to use him at the back and as a midfield player.</p>

  <p><b>[David Moyes: <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> have faced ‘Champions League quality’ sides since restart]</b> I’ve played two teams who would not look out of place in the Champions League if they qualify for it in <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. You have seen how well <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> have started the season <b>[since the restart]</b>, we know what <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have got, so I actually think we were always having a difficult return with the teams we had to play and it proved to be. I actually think that we have done a lot of good things. Sometimes when teams are in this position you get questioned a little bit, but we had our second-best physical stats in the game against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, we had our third most sprints of the season.

We gave it up so quickly after getting the second goal, we didn’t give ourselves a chance to even get the ball back or settle ourselves down and that’s probably the more disappointing thing. The dressing room knows what I feel like, but in the same breath, they also know that coming here to a <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> team that have shown good form since coming back from lockdown and had some really positive results, it wasn’t the worst result<br /><br />I was sickened <b>[by the second equaliser]</b> just because of us working so hard to get a goal back and then giving it up so quickly.

So I’m not disappointed with that, I’m just disappointed to give that second goal up especially and some teams could have gone under then but credit to the lads, they showed real resilience not to go under and give up and third goal</p>

At this moment in time getting the points and getting over the line is the big thing.
