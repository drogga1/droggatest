  <p><b>[Abdelhak Nouri’s brother Abderrahim Nouri said]</b> The doctors are quite confident that he will not recover. If he were to wake up, he would not be able to think, eat, talk, walk or even recognise people. He would not be able to function normally. But we are not giving up, God will decide his fate. Our religion teaches us to accept things and we are praying for his recovery. We think this life is only temporary and the eternal comes after this one, but everybody would have liked to see him score goals first.</p>

  <p><b>[Abdelhak Nouri’s brother thanks fans for tributes to Ajax midfielder]</b> We want to thank everyone, everyone, absolutely everyone who was there or not; Muslim or not Muslim, Ajax or Feyenoord, dark or white, old and young for the support and especially the wonderful tribute yesterday. It’s indescribable what this has done and is doing to us. Through his good manners, good behavior and good character, so many people have come together who would never to come together these days.<br /><br />These are very positive signs for us about the place and rank Abdelhak will receive in the afterlife if the worst scenario happens. When I visit my brother, I will whisper it all in his ear. Thank you and continue to trust in God and keep praying and accept what God has for done and has in store for him. On behalf of the Nouri familly, thank you</p>

  <p><b>[Abderrahim Nouri speaks about his young brother Abdelhak ‘Appie’ Nouri]</b> Being sad doesn’t help. Crying all day doesn’t help. Being positive helps. Praying for him helps. When I’m next to his bed, talking with him, saying good things to him, those things help. We’re with my brother 24-7</p>

  <p><b>[The brother of former Ajax star Abdelhak Nouri has offered a positive update on the condition of the 21-year-old following his on-field collapse back in July 2017]</b> His neurological situation is better than a few months ago. Physically it’s very difficult, though. His physical condition is in decline because he doesn’t move. He’s lying in bed most of the time and he can’t move his body on his own. Only his head. Sometimes we get him out of bed to let him sit in his wheelchair. Earlier, that was really hard. At the beginning that was going really well, but later it became more difficult, with lots of ups and downs. His immune system is weakened and it fluctuates a lot. I don’t want to go into details, but he has had a hard time. That’s normal for someone who has had brain damage. Those were very tough times.<br /><br />At the beginning we couldn’t communicative with him, when he was in coma, with his eyes closed. But later he became more awake. So now there’s a way to communicate with him. If you ask him anything and you say ‘open your mouth’ or ‘move your eyebrow’, then he can do that</p>

Some communication is possible, for example raising eyebrows</p>

  <p><b>[Abderrahim Nouri reveals <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> star Nouri improving and watching football after waking from coma]</b> He has not been home very long, we take care of him there now. I must say that since he is at home it is going much better than before in the hospital. He is aware of where he is, he is back in a familiar environment with his family. He’s no longer in a coma. He’s just awake. He sleeps, he sneezes, he eats, he burps, but it’s not like he gets out of bed. He’s very bedridden and still very dependent on us. On his good days, there is a form of communication, for example, confirmation with his eyebrows or a smile. But you notice that he can’t last that very long. We talk to him like he’s not sick. We take him into our conversations and we watch football with him in the living room, for example. Then he watches. You notice that he likes that very much. He often shows emotions. Sometimes he is emotional, but often there is also a smile. That does us good. That makes you really appreciate a smile</p>
