  <p><b>[Abderrahim Nouri speaks about his young brother Abdelhak ‘Appie’ Nouri]</b> Being sad doesn’t help. Crying all day doesn’t help. Being positive helps. Praying for him helps. When I’m next to his bed, talking with him, saying good things to him, those things help. We’re with my brother 24-7</p>

  <p><b>[Abdelhak Nouri’s brother Abderrahim tells Dutch television programme De Wereld Draait Door the positive news that his Nouri is out of hospital and communicating with his family at home, after suffering brain damage in an on-pitch heart attack in 2017]</b> He sleeps, eats, sneezes and burps but is very dependent. Some communication is possible, for example raising eyebrows</p>

  <p><b>[Abderrahim Nouri reveals <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> star Nouri improving and watching football after waking from coma]</b> He has not been home very long, we take care of him there now. I must say that since he is at home it is going much better than before in the hospital. He is aware of where he is, he is back in a familiar environment with his family. He’s no longer in a coma. He’s just awake. He sleeps, he sneezes, he eats, he burps, but it’s not like he gets out of bed. He’s very bedridden and still very dependent on us. On his good days, there is a form of communication, for example, confirmation with his eyebrows or a smile. But you notice that he can’t last that very long. We talk to him like he’s not sick. We take him into our conversations and we watch football with him in the living room, for example. Then he watches. You notice that he likes that very much. He often shows emotions. Sometimes he is emotional, but often there is also a smile. That does us good. That makes you really appreciate a smile</p>
