Neymar resumed Brazil training on Friday, easing fears over the star forward’s knee injury</p>

French star <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> ensured Paris Saint-Germain’s 2018-19 campaign entered the history books on Friday night, despite a final day defeat at Reims. The Ligue 1 champions lost 3-1 at Stade Auguste-Delaune to their eighth-placed hosts, but they were still able to make their mark thanks to <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a>’s scrappy 59th-minute effort. The goal meant that PSG had become the first team to score in each of their 38 matches in France’s top flight</p>

  <p><b>[PSG dedicate <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> title triumph to ‘everyday heroes’ on coronavirus front line]</b> We would like to dedicate this 2019-2020 <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> title to healthcare staff and to all the everyday heroes on the frontline whose commitment and self-sacrifice over many weeks have earned our deepest admiration. We understand, respect and support the decisions taken by the French government to end the championship. Health, as the government has always said, must be everyone’s priority. I would like to thank the players, the coach, the technical and medical staff as well as all the club’s employees for their tremendous work. This trophy is a reward for their hard work every day. In these difficult times, I hope that this trophy will bring a little happiness and hope to all our supporters, and I am grateful to them for their unwavering support which helps drive Paris Saint-Germain forward. I would also like to also thank all our partners for their loyalty throughout, and I look forward to being able to celebrate this title with all the PSG family when the conditions allow</p>
