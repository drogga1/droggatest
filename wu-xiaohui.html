<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Shanghai Shenhua chairman Wu Xiaohui has acknowledged big-money striker Carlos Tevez as a flop]</b> Our intention was to bring in an influential star player with high quality, and we all think Tevez could fit the bill. However, due to a lack of winter training and match fitness, he didn’t meet our expectations<br /><br />Of course I understand results are most important in competitive sports. I heard what everybody said about the club hierarchy. They can rest assured that, as the chairman, I will take full responsibility if we indeed make mistakes or don’t do good enough. And I’d like to say, for the record, that if anybody can do a better job than us, we would vacate our offices at any time. We have no problem with that. We would quit as long as it is in the best interest of Shenhua. We are not driven by self-interest - not in the slightest</p>
