  <p><b>[Mainz goalkeeping coach Stephan Kuhnert has revealed what it was like to work alongside Jurgen Klopp]</b> I had a special connection with Kloppo because I played alongside him. No one can match his intense emotion but I always saw eye-to-eye with him. He could present ‘Wetten, dass..?’ (a famous German TV entertainment show) and wouldn’t really have to prepare for it. It just comes naturally. You can see that with the positive interactions he has with his players. Even the 20th man in the squad is always ready, you never hear anything bad said about him. Kloppo is a people person - dealing with people is his greatest strength<br /><br />We both wanted to go to a Schützenfest (a traditional German festival) in the region on a day off at the training camp in Herzlake. So we got on the bikes and rode through the middle of nowhere forever. It was almost really dark and then we finally got there. At the entrance to the village we saw a huge sign and it said that the fete didn’t take place until a week later. I don’t know, I somehow made a mistake. Anyway, we had to cycle all the way back and he insulted me the whole way. I had to take a lot but I deserved it!<br /><br /><b>[Thomas Tuchel, who followed a similar path to <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> in heading to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> after a spell at Mainz]</b> I got on well with Thomas, he’s actually a pleasant guy. He gives off a different impression on the outside but there are times when he can fool around and be a funny guy. Appearances can be deceiving. Of course, he was sometimes tough to deal with and he wasn’t someone you could act up with. But he was able to really inspire the players because he is not only an excellent technical coach</p>
