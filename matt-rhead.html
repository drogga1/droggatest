<blockquote>
  <p>[Lincoln City’s fairytale FA Cup the stuff of dreams. Matt Rhead’s story is all the more remarkable when it is considered that he only turned professional at the age of 28, having previously worked for a construction company alongside playing] It was a massive decision to go full time. I had a young family and I don’t think the missus was too keen on it. It’s a bit of a risk. It could’ve been over in one season. I was getting less money than I was playing part-time with a decent job but I was the only part-time player at the club, probably the only one in the National League. It all boiled down to the fact that when you’re a kid, you want to play full-time football. I liked it at JCB but 12 hours in a factory is nothing like playing football every day. I didn’t want to live with regrets. I wanted to enjoy full-time football. It’s been four-and-a-half years and I’ve loved every minute.</p>
