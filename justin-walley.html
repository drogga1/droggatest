<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On CONIFA World Football Cup]</b> There was a chance that you may not succeed in getting your money at the end of it. That was 13 months ago. And I was very impressed with how transparent and open everything was - if you wanted to talk to the General Secretary, you just went and did it. I was looking for a fresh coaching opportunity, and I had the idea of working with a poor or developing football federation, either as an assistant manager or as part of a management team. I started looking at options, and thought about CONIFA, where a lot of the roles are voluntary<br /><br />Then there was the military coup, with the army on the streets and the police removed for a number of weeks. We lost training for a whole week because of that<br /><br />The pitches, on the whole, are shocking. They’re dirt pitches, and often have broken glass, bottle-tops and rocks all over them; it’s impossible to completely clean them up. There aren’t even markings on many of them. As for equipment, at many training sessions we sometimes had two balls between 27 players … Going to away games, having limited finances, we had 17 guys in the back of a Toyota pickup. If the thing was to turn over, they’d all be dead. But those are the circumstances</p>
