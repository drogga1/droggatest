  <p><b>[Manchester United have not made a formal approach to Luis Campos regarding a proposed director of football role at Old Trafford]</b> Manchester United have not spoken to me about this position. But I’m very proud that my name is mentioned as one possibility because Manchester United have such a fantastic history in the world of football.<br /><br />My function is to make the link with the players, the coach and the board. I have developed a large network worldwide. Normally, I build teams by using five players with experience and combining these with big talents who also have the potential to develop inside the club for its future. It’s very important for a sports director to make the link with everybody within the club. To create the best infrastructure and provide the best support resources - for recovery, for nutrition, for data on player performance. Everything to help the coach and the players to deliver their best. This is how I work</p>

  <p><b>[Kylian Mbappe is a champagne footballer destined to join Real Madrid]</b> Kylian represents champagne football, which we like to see and as a high level footballer I see him wearing the Real Madrid jersey because it is a club made to his measure, where the great players want to go. In the future, I imagine myself attending a match at the Santiago Bernabeu and enjoying the show that Mbappe can offer. Nowadays, he is more decisive than Neymar and considering his age, he’ll be much better than Cristiano Ronaldo. I see him winning more Ballons d’Or.<br /><br /><b>[Campos, who previously worked as a scout for Mourinho, believes a second stint in La Liga is possible for Jose Mourinho]</b> I was very disappointed by what happened <b>[to Mourinho]</b>. He would have wanted to build a great project in England. I see him as the ideal man to manage Real Madrid. He might return at some point because he is a great coach</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal, and any other suitor of Nicolas Pepe, have been made aware that it will cost €80 million]</b> I hope he will stay this winter. We’ll do everything to keep him. All the top clubs in the world have their eyes on him, and that’s normal, but the president has been clear. The idea is for him to continue at the club. In contrast, with my experience in football, I would say that if a club arrives with a big number and can convince the player… I would sell him for €80 million. That’s the price tag, but you’d have to convince the player and he’s been a big part of us being in second place</p>

  <p><b>[Lille sporting director Luis Campos has claimed it is unlikely that Jose Mourinho will take the Lyon job next summer]</b> He has won everywhere. Lyon is a great club, but I think that he is looking for an even bigger project. And, he is expensive..</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>’s former assistant Luis Campos says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> need to appoint a sporting director in order to avoid potential disaster]</b> I speak to Jose every week, sometimes every day, and I saw that Jose, in my opinion, had difficulties in Manchester because the club has another culture, which I respect of course. If the coach is alone he’s an easy target and he needs help. Everyone needs help in football. You can’t play alone. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is an amazing club with an amazing story and, for people around the world, it’s difficult to understand what has happened to this club.<br /><br />It’s difficult to see this club in difficulty, but if this difficulty is arriving it’s because you have one problem. In my opinion the problem is sensibility. It’s important to work together. Sporting with economy. If you don’t put these things together I believe you are heading for disaster! I know very well the situation of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and other clubs but, in my opinion, everybody needs a sporting director because the coach needs time to prepare for the next match and the super ego of the players too, so he needs people with sensibility. If a coach is alone it’s more difficult now.<br /><br />A sporting director is very, very important. Of course I believe I could help <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, but I respect the politics of the club. It’s very prestigious, very, very prestigious, but in modern football you need a sporting director. If you have a sporting director you have this sensibility. Before, the coach did everything, but now the information is arriving very fast. Now the world is very different. You need to know players in every part of the world. It’s important the club has one project and with a sporting director everyone understands where they go. You need one person with the sensibility for the sporting and economic situation. In modern football you need both to work together. If they don’t work together you have a disaster<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether he would like to work with a fellow Portuguese again]</b> Of course. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> is like a brother to me. I know him very well and for a long time. He’s a wonderful person and the best coach in the world. So, of course, if he called me I would speak. In my opinion, football needs someone like Jose. Football needs this special coach with this energy and strong personality. I believe the next work of Jose will be his top work</p>

I remember working with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and Kylian Mbappe: they know everything about football. <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> knew all the results of the second division in France. <a href="nicolas-pepe.html">Nicolas Pepe</a> is like that. He’s another example of the importance of a player liking football. After a game he watches the whole game again two times, to make himself more perfect</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Campos admits to offers amid <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> links but has no ‘crazy obsession’ to work in England]</b> There have been approaches and there are approaches to be able to give my career a new direction. Out of respect for the people who work in these clubs, I won’t talk about names. But there were proposals. It is perfectly normal depending on what has happened but, I repeat: I am very well where I am, I have an extraordinary relationship with my president. He was the one who convinced me to come, things have been going very well and I believe that it will be very difficult to leave the <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a> project<br /><br />I don’t know, it’s not a concern that I have. For me the present is very important and for now, or at least before this virus arrived, I felt good in the functions I had, where I was and how I was. I don’t have a crazy obsession with going to England and withdrawing from this project, which is very special and in which I have a large part of responsibility for what is happening, for very special reasons. The truth is I feel really good here. This is a club that was not well known in Portugal before there were so many Portuguese, but <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a> is a spectacular city in the north of France, a young city with a large student community, a very beautiful city. It has a wonderful stadium - the best stadium in France - it has a formidable training centre at the highest level, and it has fans who love the club intensely. So it is a city that breathes football and we are in the centre of Europe</p>
