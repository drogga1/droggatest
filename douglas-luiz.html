  <p><b>[Douglas Luiz says <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> improved me by 70 per cent in two months at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> I have no words to explain him. He’s a guy who is focused on football, his life is football. For me, he is the best coach in the world. In two months, the guy managed to evolve more than 70 per cent of my potential. I have a lot of affection for him, I thank him so much for everything he did. I feel very honoured to have this affection from a great coach, who for me is the best, for my football<br /><br />I didn’t expect to be sold, but I think God knows everything. I am very happy in this great club that, for me, is like Vasco. It has its ‘cauldron’ <b>[stadium]</b>, it has a very passionate crowd for the club. It is a club that is recognised throughout the country, and I’m sure the club is very happy. There is a clause that <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> can buy me in those first two years</p>

  <p><b>[Douglas Luiz exclusive: How <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> midfielder is leading by example]</b> Since I arrived here, I’ve always considered myself to be a leader and always wanted to be one. But it’s been complicated because I entered the hardest league in the world where I didn’t speak the language, so it was tough to communicate and to show that you really are a leader. After this break, I’ve had the chance to demonstrate my true qualities and of course, before the season started, I didn’t get the chance to do a pre-season. That’s not an excuse, but it meant I didn’t have the same amount of time to train. Now I’ve had that time, and I’ve been able to reflect on what the coaches want. I understand this better now, and that’s helped me on my return. I’ve been doing English classes since I got here, but it was hard to concentrate at first with all the games. During quarantine, I was able to study more on the aspects I found most difficult, and I feel it’s showing on the pitch<br /><br />The tattoo on my right leg means a lot to me. It’s a homage to myself as it’s my first goal as a professional for Vasco da Gama. They’re a club to which I’m eternally grateful as they took me in, they fed me and they opened the doors to me to be a professional. My hair is how it is as I always like to be stylish and in Brazil and in Spain, I knew people who could do my hair and take care of me! Here, at the start I didn’t know the right person, so I decided to go back to short hair. It’s nothing new to me as I had it like that when I was young as well, and I just felt like keeping with it. I’ve since dyed it to add a bit of style, and it’s something I like to do. I like to stay good-looking!<br /><br /><b>[Villa secured a battling 2-2 draw at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> in November]</b> We can take confidence from that game but also from the growth we’ve demonstrated since the break. The mentality of the group is strong because we played well against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, and the training has been good. The fans can see the improvement we’ve made, but of course it’s tough to talk about positive things because the results haven’t been there. Now is the time to fine-tune on the development we’ve shown. That means making the right pass in the final third to a team-mate. Our focus must be on getting the three points, not on securing another draw. <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> managed to win on Tuesday, so the gap is four points. Now is not the time for negative thoughts.<br /><br />I have a four-year contract with <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>, and my objective is to continue here, and to make history with the club that opened the door for me. Right now, my goal is to drag this team out of trouble, and to keep them in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I’m not thinking of anything other than winning games for this club.</p>
