  <p>[Brazil forward <a href="marta.html">Marta</a> is expected to miss her side’s opening Women’s World Cup match against Jamaica because of a thigh complaint] <a href="marta.html">Marta</a>’s condition has improved a lot, quicker than we originally expected. It was a problematic injury. But the truth is that she can’t play tomorrow. She can be on the bench if she prefers to join her team-mates, but she’s not in the proper condition to play yet</p>

  <p>[Vadao’s re-appointment followed the sacking of the team’s first ever female coach, Emily Lima, who was relieved of her duties after just 13 games in charge. Her dismissal prompted five players to withdraw themselves from selection for the national team, while an open letter criticising the Brazilian federation was published and signed by eight players, including stars such as <a href="cristiane.html">Cristiane</a> and Formiga] We, the players, have invested years of our own lives and all of our energy to build this team and this sport to its strength today. Yet we, and almost all other Brazilian women, are excluded from the leadership and decision-making for our own team and our own sport</p>
