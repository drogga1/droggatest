Liverpool are hoping to complete the signing of teenage defender Sepp van den Berg from PEC Zwolle.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool have confirmed their first signing of the summer, with teenage defender Sepp van den Berg joining from PEC Zwolle]</b> It’s just an amazing feeling. It is, for me, the biggest club in the world and it’s a dream come true. I am really excited. I’ve seen what kind of players from the Academy grew into the first team here. It is unbelievable, especially when this kind of big club does that. Of course, the trainer <b>[Jürgen Klopp]</b> is a great guy and one of the reasons they are successful - and also one of the reasons I came here. I think this is the best place for me to grow and hopefully play a lot of games here.</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Sepp van den Berg? Liverpool’s new signing labelled ‘Baby Van Dijk’]</b> I really didn’t see it coming. I already thought it was nice that I was <b>[in the squad]</b>. I was shocked enormously. The coach said I had to come on. I remember thinking: ‘Did I hear that right?’ I almost started to doubt myself. Then I sat and looked around, dreaming. After a few seconds, I carefully asked if I should warm up. ‘Yes, Sepp, you have to warm up now’. It sounded quite serious. Then I just went outside.<br /><br /><b>[An iconic centre-back for Netherlands and Manchester United, Stam merely wanted to encourage Van den Berg to be more of a commanding presence in the heart of the defence. Instead, he took it as an insult]</b> It is actually really simple. PEC would like to extend but until this weekend I hadn’t played for weeks. I see no reason to extend at the moment. Really, I am satisfied at PEC. This is my youth club. If I was always playing, I’d probably say: ‘I’ll sign’. Then the chance that I’ll play next season would automatically be greater. Now I’m in no hurry. With the last coach I played a lot. When a new coach comes in, you know things can change. But the fact I wasn’t even in the squad was quite a shock</p>

  <p><b>[Sepp van den Berg admits that he considered talk of interest from Liverpool to be a ‘a joke’ before seeing a £1.3 million move to Anfield wrapped up]</b> Can I put it into words? It’s just amazing. It is, for me, the biggest club in the world and it’s a dream come true. I am really excited.<br /><br /><b>[He added on the transfer talk which built quickly to this point]</b> I couldn’t believe it, I thought it was a joke. I was really happy and, to be honest, I was a little bit scared at first because such a big club had interest in me. So, I was a little bit scared but eventually I was really excited<br /><br /><b>[Van den Berg believes that he boasts the qualities to be a success at a Premier League giant]</b> I am a centre-half, I am calm with the ball, I am quite quick and can run, but I came here especially to improve myself more. I think this is the best place for me to grow and hopefully play a lot of games here<br /><br /><b>[Georginio Wijnaldum and Virgil van Dijk are established members of the fold, with the latter having helped to convince a new arrival that Liverpool is the best place for him]</b> I was thinking about <b>[the idea of]</b> training with Virgil. For me he is the best defender in the world right now, so I can learn a lot from him<br /><br /><b>[He said of his ambitions in England]</b> Longer-term, I hope I can play as much as possible here for the club. Short-term, <b>[my target is]</b> to be with the first team, develop myself, grow into the team and see how it goes. Long-term, I really want to be a legend here</p>

His former boss Jaap Stam says Liverpool have nothing to lose from signing teenage Dutch defender Sepp van den Berg from PEC Zwolle.</p>

  <p><b>[Sepp van den Berg is happy to have snubbed interest from the likes of <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> and <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> to live the dream alongside <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a>, <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> and <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> at Liverpool]</b> I had the chance to go to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> ­Eindhoven or <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I was amazed that such big clubs wanted to sign me and I thought <a href="psv.html">PSV Eindhoven</a> was a brilliant option for me because I have been a fan from a young age. But, once <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> came for me, I knew where I would go ­because I can only describe my feelings for the club as mega. It is such a big club, but, at the same time, it feels like a family club. Thanks to <b>[Jurgen]</b> <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s approach and vision, I am up against the best attackers in the world several times a week. He lets me train and play against <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>, <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> and <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>. That is ­something I could only have dreamt of in the past. These guys really belong to the very best attackers on this globe. Of course, it is hard. But when you are up against them every week and you learn some valuable lessons, then you only get better and stronger<br /><br />There is a massive amount of talent in this age group. I don’t want to say we’ve now arrived on the big scene because every one of us knows that we still have a mountain to climb. But the average age of the team against Shrewsbury was 19. We are massively proud of what we achieved on the night and we all talked about it
afterwards. The topic of our conversations was that we all want to get into the first team together one day</p>
