His former boss Jaap Stam says Liverpool have nothing to lose from signing teenage Dutch defender Sepp van den Berg from PEC Zwolle.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Sepp van den Berg is happy to have snubbed interest from the likes of <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> and <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> to live the dream alongside <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a>, <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> and <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> at Liverpool]</b> I had the chance to go to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> ­Eindhoven or <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I was amazed that such big clubs wanted to sign me and I thought <a href="psv.html">PSV Eindhoven</a> was a brilliant option for me because I have been a fan from a young age. But, once <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> came for me, I knew where I would go ­because I can only describe my feelings for the club as mega. It is such a big club, but, at the same time, it feels like a family club. Thanks to <b>[Jurgen]</b> <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s approach and vision, I am up against the best attackers in the world several times a week. He lets me train and play against <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>, <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> and <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>. That is ­something I could only have dreamt of in the past. These guys really belong to the very best attackers on this globe. Of course, it is hard. But when you are up against them every week and you learn some valuable lessons, then you only get better and stronger<br /><br />There is a massive amount of talent in this age group. I don’t want to say we’ve now arrived on the big scene because every one of us knows that we still have a mountain to climb. But the average age of the team against Shrewsbury was 19. We are massively proud of what we achieved on the night and we all talked about it
afterwards. The topic of our conversations was that we all want to get into the first team together one day</p>
