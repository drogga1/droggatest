<blockquote>
  <p>Amal Clooney, the lawyer wife of George Clooney, will accuse a former Conservative Prime Minister <b>[Ted Heath]</b> of authorising the torture of detainees in Northern Ireland in a controversial case being brought against the Government. She will travel to Belfast next month for a meeting with nine survivors, known collectively as ‘the hooded men’, who claim they were tortured by the British Army - and that Sir Edward Heath knew there was a policy of torture<br /><br />… she is also acting for the Greek government in a campaign to secure the return of the Elgin Marbles from the British Museum. The latter case has attracted worldwide publicity almost entirely because of Mrs Clooney’s involvement in it<br /><br />She has been brought on to the case by the men’s solicitors, Belfast-based Kevin R Winters and Co<br /><br /><b>[Kevin R Winters and Co]</b> It is well known in Northern Ireland as the leading firm representing Irish Republican militants, including two members of the Real IRA held liable for the Omagh bombing in which 29 people were murdered. The firm has also represented victims of terrorism<br /><br />Mrs Clooney is to meet the nine men for the first time in Belfast next month. She is currently based in New York where she is a visiting professor and senior fellow in the Human Rights Institute at Columbia Law School<br /><br /><a href="darragh-mackin.html">Darragh Mackin</a>, of Kevin R Winters, said they were awaiting a response from the UK Government to their application to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg but he expected the case to be given the go-ahead later in the year. He said the firm was also involved in a judicial review in Belfast which would challenge the failure to properly investigate the torture claims.<br /><br />The men claim they were thrown from helicopters they had been told were in mid-flight but were actually just a few feet above the ground. None of the men was ever convicted. It is claimed that when the UK authorities arrested and interned hundreds of men in August 1971, 14 of them were selected for ‘special treatment’ - torture in a specially-built interrogation centre at a British Army camp. They were allegedly subjected to the soon-to-be infamous ‘five techniques’ of hooding, stress positions, white noise, sleep deprivation and withdrawal of food and water - combined with beatings and death threats<br /><br />Last month Mr and Mrs Clooney were classed for the first time as being among Britain’s super-rich. The couple, who own a home in Sonning, Berkshire, are worth £121 million. The film star has a number of links with Ireland. His great, great-grandfather, Nicholas Clooney, came from Kilkenny and his paternal grandmother’s maiden name was Guilfoyle.</p>
