  <p>[Meet Dragan Stojkovic: The man Arsene Wenger wanted as his Arsenal successor] He was an inspiration for me to become a coach because of the experience of working with him for two years. We played nice football and we won the Emperors Cup, he became MVP coach of the year and I became MVP Player of the Year in an excellent group of foreign players. That was a big satisfaction for both of us and the club also. I realised that football is very simple. Under [Wenger’s] control, football is very simple but to be simple in football is so, so difficult. When he became coach I really started to enjoy playing football and felt huge pleasure to be on the pitch to do what I can do for my team. Every day was a pleasure to have training and preparation for the game, everything. I remember when I heard that he could become the new manager of Nagoya. I spoke with the president at the time Mr Nishigaki and technical director Mr Sogami who asked me if I knew Mr Wenger - but they didn’t pronounce the name well. I asked them to repeat because they were saying something like ‘Vengel’ and told them to write it on the paper. When I saw it written down I asked them, ‘Do you have a chance to bring this coach here?’ They said ‘yes’ and my answer was, ‘Just do it immediately, don’t waste time - bring him here’. I was 100 per cent sure that he would give [Nagoya] the football that people want to see. Then, in January 1995, we met in a hotel in Paris where he [Wenger] asked me about Japan and everything. I explained to him what he could expect there and told him that he would never get pressure from anyone and he could do his job how he thinks. I explained the respect culture in Japan and gave him good information about Nagoya and Japan.<br /><br />We share the same philosophy of football. I like his methodology of working and training, how to deliver nice football to the people. I’m very happy to share these ideas in the same way as this is exactly how I see my team today. He was my inspiration to become a coach and in my last examination to get the pro licence I was at Arsenal’s training ground where I spent one week there. I think his football philosophy is something very important because he always focuses on technical football. He’s not someone who is looking for physical presence on the pitch and long balls. In his view, the football is something different, it means the ball should be on the ground with a lot of quality movement. He’s focusing on the technical skills and that’s why he always signs players who control the ball well - intelligent players. His training methodology is very simple but interesting - I never had a boring training session with him. He’s very passionate about football and he thinks about football 24/7<br /><br />I’m very grateful that he knew my personality and skills as a player. He gave me one compliment and in 1996 when he offered me to join Arsenal I decided to stay in Nagoya just for one reason - because my children were there and started school and I felt comfortable there, as I was the star in the J-League. In the end, when we said good luck to each other, he told me that he worked with a lot of good players in the world but he said I’m in the top three in his career. I asked him for the other two and he told me ‘George Weah and Glen Hoddle’. I asked him who was the No.1. He said, ‘It’s very difficult to say but you’re the three best players I have ever seen.’ I was grateful to receive this kind of compliment for him. Professionally, yes, [I regret not joining Arsenal], because he [Wenger] explained everything and that he wanted to partner me with [Dennis] Bergkamp, and that [Patrick] Vieira was coming too. But I was comfortable [in Japan] and my kids started school so the change was too much [for them] - if not, I would have joined Arsenal. This offer showed how he respected me as a player and when someone like Wenger says you’re one of the most intelligent players he’s worked with that’s a big compliment for me<br /><br />Everybody knows what he’s done there [at Arsenal]. There was a big question mark when Mr Dein came to Nagoya and convinced him to come to Arsenal. Nobody believed that the ‘Professor’ could come and make that group of players champions. He was lucky that the players accepted after a few months his style of work and football. He’s a legend. It’s very difficult to say to someone that you’re a legend, but he’s a real legend. Leading one of the most important clubs in the world in that way for 22 years is amazing. He made a new era and a new Arsenal. There’s two Arsenals - before Wenger and one starting from 1996, which included incredible results and amazing skills of play every year, participating in the Champions League every year. It’s going to be strange to not see him on the bench because he was there for such a long time. I think the decision is a private one made by himself. I will call him to talk and to meet him in London like every year. Every time I’m back in Europe we have a lunch and talk about football. I feel very privileged that I can go and have a lunch and take a coffee with him<br /><br />I think the best thing is to take a holiday and travel around the world. It’s going to be hard for him because everyone knows him. He’s so intelligent that he knows what he should do. I think he needs a rest and after that we will see. I wish him all the best in the future but I think now he deserves rest and a little holiday with friends. What I’m definitely sure of is that he won’t say goodbye to football</p>

  <p>[Dragan Stojkovic has revealed that he turned down the Serbia job before current boss Mladen Krstajic was given the job permanently last December] That is true. But since I’m in Guangzhou and signed a contract here, it’s hard to do two things at once. I am focused on my daily work here. There was then the opportunity to take the job for just two months and qualify for the World Cup, but I didn’t think it was serious. Because if I’m busy in one place, I have to be essentially focused on that task. Since I was with Guangzhou, it was impossible.<br /><br />[Stojkovic believes that his friend Krstajic will guide Serbia well] We talked about a lot of things and when they saw my contract and the fact that I was committed elsewhere, they tried to find an intermediate solution. But that didn’t suit me. As for Mladen Krstajic, he’s my friend and he played with me in the national team. He is a former player and has experience. But it’s true that as a coach it’s a bit difficult. But it’s the choice of the federation. I think he will do good things<br /><br />We had a lot of problems in the last eight years. We didn’t play in a World Cup or Euro’s between 2010-2018, qualifying for the World Cup was the priority. This team managed to qualify. It was very important for Serbian football, the federation and the people who were waiting for this result. Now we are in a group where Brazil is the favourite. But with Switzerland and Costa Rica, I think we can fight for second place. What am I waiting for? Like everyone in Serbia, a qualification for the round of last 16 at least. It will already be a good result for us. Facing the Swiss and Costa Ricans, it’s playable</p>
