  <p><b>[Folarin Balogun has signed his first professional contract with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> on Wednesday]</b> It feels really good. I’ve been at the club since I was young, so I’m just happy that I’ve been given the opportunity to push on. It’s been a rollercoaster of a journey with a lot of ups and downs, but I’m glad that my hard work has been noticed and it’s starting to pay off. Individually my goal is to finish the season as the top goalscorer in the U-18 Premier League</p>
