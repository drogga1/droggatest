  <p><b>[Pepe, <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> defender, about the capital club’s new assistant coach]</b> I think <a href="fernando-hierro.html">Hierro</a> is the best signing Madrid has done for the 2014/15 season. He knows a lot about the club and that is very important for the players. For me in particular, he is a player I always admired. He is a great person and I’m very happy</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid defender Pepe tried to explain his emotional response to his club’s <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Champions League success]</b> That’s hard to explain. I started crying when <a href="lucas-vazquez.html">Lucas Vazquez</a> calmly scored his kick with extreme confidence. I got emotional and I felt we were not going to lose. It all started when Sergio <b>[Ramos]</b> told us we were going to use the goal in front of our fans for the shoot-out</p>
