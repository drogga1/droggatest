  <p><b>[Former Real Madrid centre-back Pepe says he wants Cristiano Ronaldo to join him in Turkey with Besiktas]</b> If I could choose and it were possible, of course I would like Cristiano to come here. He’s a person for whom I have maximum respect. Off the pitch, Cristiano is an extremely normal person. When something gets out in the media talking about him… I look and I say: ‘This can’t be. It’s a lie’. People talk without knowing the real Cristiano. He’s a normal person with normal habits like us. He likes his relatives. He loves his sons. He stresses the importance of being a father which I think is important. He’s does this perfectly and naturally.<br /><br />When Besiktas came to me with their offer and their project, it grabbed my attention. Many, many people sent me messages on social media. I couldn’t not go. I couldn’t turn my back on all this affection that the people had given me. I said I have to go to Besiktas. It’s impossible not to go to Besiktas!<br /><br />I’ve never experienced an atmosphere like this before. The Turkish people live for football. It’s a passion for them and they show it to their teams with love</p>

  <p><b>[Pepe claims Real Madrid were a ‘graveyard for centre-backs’ prior to his arrival]</b> Porto improve every single player because this is a very demanding club. Porto prepared me really well and this didn’t go unnoticed in Spain, as before I went to Real Madrid the club were known as a graveyard for centre-backs. They had amazing centre-backs that had failed there. I came from a league viewed by many as not as competitive as others, but I played for 10 years and won many trophies.<br /><br />I’ll always say it was football that gave me everything in life - lots of friends, the chance to make my dreams come true. Returning to Porto was also my dream - to come back to the club where I was so happy. This is a team that taught me a lot and made me the player I am today. The first time <b>[I joined]</b> was difficult because I’d left a small island to come to the mainland. I had to adapt very quickly because this was just after Porto had won the Champions League. Yet I identified strongly with the club, the people at the club made me feel very comfortable and provided the best working conditions for me. Now I’m back here with Porto, with a lot of good central defenders. Defenders who, in my opinion, could very well be playing for a club like Real Madrid because they’ve a lot of quality. So much so that Militao was bought by Madrid, right?!<br /><br /><b>[I have already won the Champions League three times]</b> and this season it’s going to be four, God willing! We know we have a very difficult task, against a strong team who play in the style of their coach. But we have to be ourselves, we have to be the same team we have been in this Champions League campaign, a cohesive team that fight for everything, looking for a positive result, looking to score goals - being ourselves. We have to respect Liverpool, who are a great team, but we are going to do our job</p>
