Stephan retired at 28 to become a scout and youth coach with the German giants. But when he was 46 - and Luca just 14 - Stephan tragically died because of a brain tumour. Luca honoured his father’s memory by getting a tattoo of his date of birth on his calf</td>

  <p><b>[In his younger days, coaches would even change his name on the teamsheet so rivals didn’t know it was a ‘Beckenbauer’ they were playing against - and to protect the youngster from the pressure of the name. Today He no longer has to hide that]</b> I don’t feel any pressure at all. He’s an inspiration to me but I really don’t have to achieve what my grandpa’s achieved. I just want to reach my own targets. Of course, my goal is to play in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> myself someday<br /><br /><b>[Luca talks about <a href="franz-beckenbauer.html">Franz Beckenbauer</a>]</b> We talk on a regular basis, but that’s about everything. Not just football. He has not interfered in a big way. Of course we talked about <b>[leaving Schalke for Hannover]</b>, but in the end it was my decision. He said I should just do what I feel best with<br /><br /><b>[Luca talks about his whole family]</b> I grew up with football, everyone in my family played. My younger brother Elias was also in the youth of <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, but today he plays only <b>[for fun]</b>. Every now and then my big brother Dominik played with us, who is now a scout at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>. My mom is crazy about football too</p>
