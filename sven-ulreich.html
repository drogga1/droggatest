  <p><b>[Sven Ulreich has apologised for the error that cost Bayern Munich as they were defeated 4-3 on aggregate by Real Madrid]</b> Words can’t describe how disappointed I am for being knocked out. We desperately wanted to reach the final and we gave our best and then this needless mistake happens to me. I can’t explain it. I’m sorry for my team and for you fans.</p>

  <p><b>[What has happened to former €100m Man Utd target Leon Bailey?]</b> Bailey often hits it over the wall, that’s something we analysed and looked at a lot during the week.</p>

  <p><b>[Sven Ulreich has advised Schalke goalkeeper and reported Bayern Munich transfer target Alexander Nubel to reject a move]</b> At 22 years old, I don’t think he wants to sit behind Manu on the bench. I think if he comes, he wants to play. That’s why in my view it makes no sense, Manuel has a contract and is absolutely undisputed. I also do not think that Alexander Nubel wants to come here as the number two, if he can play at Schalke</p>

I’m not afraid of competition.<br /><br /><b>[he also confirmed that he would be open to securing a move away from <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> in order to start playing week in, week out again]</b> If I had the opportunity to play regularly elsewhere, I would switch and want to take this step</p>
