  <p><b>[Juan Pablo Sorin says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is an alien and deserves to win a trophy with Argentina]</b> Luckily we played together. He is an alien, there is no way <b>[to stop him]</b>. You saw the goal he made against <b>[Athletic]</b> Bilbao in the final of the Copa del Rey almost as a right winger - a monster! I have serious pride in having shared his first times in the national team. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> assumed this reconstruction of the national team from a leading place and not wanting to break anything in there. Then he also understood, as it happens to all of us when we grow up, what is the weight of his voice. I hope we get a result in a major tournament with him. Maybe we deserved it a lot, but his struggle, having left so many things and past so many situations <b>[…]</b> I think that not only Argentines want it but the fans of the world expect him to also win something big with Argentina<br /><br /><b>[Sorin adding that <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s skills and consistency over the past decade has been nothing short of ‘crazy’]</b> It’s like he owns the ball, he has it and he knows that he will do the most difficult thing, that he will be decisive every time he touches it. And when he realised that, he assumed that responsibility according to his personality. Without having to shout it, without going out to make strong statements. Knowing and feeling decisive in whatever shirt is a difficult responsibility. But the most difficult thing is maintaining that level of genius and being the best for so many years - it’s a crazy thing!</p>
