There is nothing better than having two excellent goalkeepers. It was a sensible decision at the time, to get Nubel free of charge. It is a path he is taking - to accept the situation with <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Manuel Neuer</a> and to line up behind <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Manuel Neuer</a>, in his slipstream. <b>[Nubel is to]</b> gradually become number one</p>
