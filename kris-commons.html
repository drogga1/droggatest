<blockquote>
  <p>[Celtic have been accused of producing dull and boring football] For three games on the bounce now - against St Mirren, Rosenborg and Kilmarnock - Celtic have been painful to watch. The football they have played has been so dull and boring. It has been absolute dross - enough to induce a bout of narcolepsy. They aren’t offering the fans any entertainment whatsoever. There is no flair. As a unit, the team looks so rigid and, individually, the players don’t look like they’re enjoying it.<br /><br />Celtic have only scored six goals in their six league games so far - and three of those came against newly promoted Livingston. That is dreadful. Meanwhile, you have Rangers sticking five past St Johnstone in one game - with five different players on the scoresheet. There was some chat a couple of weeks ago about how Rangers had made their worst start to a league campaign in 29 years. Newsflash: Celtic are actually below them in the league table. What we have on our hands is a highly competitive league, with so many good teams capable of taking points off each other on any given day. For the first time in seven years, it looks like we actually have a genuine title race on the cards. That is testament to what Steven Gerrard has done at Rangers<br /><br />The goal drought would really worry me. [Gary] Hooper and [Anthony] Stokes used to score 20-25 goals per season… each! Before that, you had Henrik Larsson, Chris Sutton and John Hartson all doing likewise. This current Celtic team simply aren’t creating enough chances for anyone to get even remotely close to those kind of numbers. When Leigh Griffiths is fit and on form, he is without a shadow of a doubt the best goalscorer Celtic have. But something isn’t right behind the scenes. It all looks far too nicey-nicey. I’m not sure there are enough big personalities in that dressing room who would really have the bottle to have it out with each other and rattle a few cages</p>
