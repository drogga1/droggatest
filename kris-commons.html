  <p>[Steven Gerrard’s start to life at Rangers has been heavily overrated] All the pre-match talk centred on the theory that Rangers had closed the gap on Celtic since the sides last met. That Steven Gerrard’s men were in a really strong position going into the first Old Firm game of the season. But the bottom line is that this is the worst start Rangers have made to a league season since 1989-90. That’s extraordinary. The feel-good factor has certainly improved recently but only because they are now playing in European football until Christmas. Strip that away and it would already be crisis time. I saw Rangers at Aberdeen and Motherwell and they are still a squad who’ve been put together in a very short space of time. They have a better quality of player there. But, on the evidence of yesterday, they are still way off it.<br /><br />Ever since I’ve been up in Glasgow, it’s all about the league. Not only do you need to be competitive. You need to be winning it. It’s the title which the fans want. It’s that which then gives you the means to attract better players and make real inroads in Europe. I know it’s early but they are now sitting seventh in the Premiership. That puts them behind Hibs, St Johnstone and Livingston as well as Hearts, Celtic and Kilmarnock. It’s already getting to crunch time for Gerrard’s players where they’re going into games knowing they’ve got to win. If they slip up again, it’s a long way back. The wool has been pulled over people’s eyes in terms of how improved they are. If Pedro Caixinha had overseen the worst start to a league season in 29 years, they’d be calling for his head.<br /><br />After the 3-3 draw with Motherwell and yesterday’s defeat, Gerrard would have learned a little bit more about his squad. After a gruelling spell, the international break gives him time to work on some things and implement more. His players will need to learn fast, though. Despite their commendable achievements in Europe, they are already at the point where there is no room for error domestically</p>

  <p>[Celtic have been accused of producing dull and boring football] For three games on the bounce now - against St Mirren, Rosenborg and Kilmarnock - Celtic have been painful to watch. The football they have played has been so dull and boring. It has been absolute dross - enough to induce a bout of narcolepsy. They aren’t offering the fans any entertainment whatsoever. There is no flair. As a unit, the team looks so rigid and, individually, the players don’t look like they’re enjoying it.<br /><br />Celtic have only scored six goals in their six league games so far - and three of those came against newly promoted Livingston. That is dreadful. Meanwhile, you have Rangers sticking five past St Johnstone in one game - with five different players on the scoresheet. There was some chat a couple of weeks ago about how Rangers had made their worst start to a league campaign in 29 years. Newsflash: Celtic are actually below them in the league table. What we have on our hands is a highly competitive league, with so many good teams capable of taking points off each other on any given day. For the first time in seven years, it looks like we actually have a genuine title race on the cards. That is testament to what Steven Gerrard has done at Rangers<br /><br />The goal drought would really worry me. [Gary] Hooper and [Anthony] Stokes used to score 20-25 goals per season… each! Before that, you had Henrik Larsson, Chris Sutton and John Hartson all doing likewise. This current Celtic team simply aren’t creating enough chances for anyone to get even remotely close to those kind of numbers. When Leigh Griffiths is fit and on form, he is without a shadow of a doubt the best goalscorer Celtic have. But something isn’t right behind the scenes. It all looks far too nicey-nicey. I’m not sure there are enough big personalities in that dressing room who would really have the bottle to have it out with each other and rattle a few cages</p>
