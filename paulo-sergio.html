  <p><b>[The Tite factor has made Brazil World Cup favourites]</b> Tite brought a great revolution from within the squad itself. He embraced these players, which was important because there were going through a very difficult time. The Selecao were heavily criticised, underperforming despite the great talent in the team. Today, they are a team of huge quality, achieving the results that have once again returned our country to the top.<br /><br />Every time the Selecao arrive at a World Cup in crisis, they go on to succeed. This time Brazil will arrive among the favourites, so we hope it will not be like it was in Germany in 2006, when the expectations disrupted the team. The Selecao must remain focused because the World Cup short and sharp - it requires a unique degree of concentration, so I believe that focus will be the key to delivering Brazil another world title<br /><br /><b>[Versatility is a hallmark of Paulo Sergio’s time in the game]</b> That’s what led me to Germany, being such a versatile player. To be able to play in different positions can make life easier for the player. Today’s football is a game where everyone has to be versatile. At World Cup 2014, the Germany players were all carrying out multiple duties on the pitch. That, perhaps, is something Brazil are slightly lacking right now, but Tite is working to ensure his players can be more multifaceted<br /><br />These are the games where Tite is going to conduct his tests. Now he has to explore his options so that he can define the names that going to make up his list for the World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[Former Brazil international Paulo Sergio has hailed the qualities of Neymar]</b> The future belongs to him. For Neymar the chance to become a big player in the world is there, but we have to wait. He is young and will make his way. In the last four months Brazil have done a lot well. We qualified for the World Cup easily. Tite has done a great job. It´s a pity they lost Neymar. We will have to wait and then see. He is a very important player because in attack he is amazing<br /><br />I don’t think Neymar is a captain, he just has to think about football. We’ve already seen him as a captain and he had some difficulties. He doesn’t think about being the captain, he only thinks about the national team<br /><br />I think Gabriel Jesus isn’t there yet, he is a very young player. For us Brazilians the most important player is Neymar. If Neymar is in good form, he can push the rest of the players to play a great World Cup</p>
