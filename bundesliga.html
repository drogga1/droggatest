Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich will begin the defence of their title with a home game against Hertha Berlin on August 16 as they go in search of a record eighth consecutive crown</p>

  <p><b>[Bundesliga bows to pressure and postpones fixtures until April 2 amid coronavirus concerns]</b> In light of today’s developments regarding the coronavirus and suspected cases in direct connection with the Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga, the Presidium of the <a href="dfl.html">DFL</a> Deutsche Fussball Liga has decided at short notice to postpone the 26th matchday for both leagues.<br /><br />In addition, the committee recommends, as planned, that the general assembly of the professional clubs, which will meet next Monday, continue to suspend play until April 2.<br /><br />One of the reasons for this is that, during the day, there were suspicions of coronavirus infections in the vicinity of several clubs and their teams and that further infections cannot be ruled out. Previously, 2. Bundesliga team Hannover 96 prescribed home quarantine for the entire team on advice from the local health authorities.<br /><br />In the international break between all clubs, taking into account the knowledge currently available - for example with regard to the international match calendar - the course of action should remain unchanged. The goal is still to end the season by summer - from a sporting point of view, but especially because an early end to the season could have additional consequences for some clubs</p>

  <p><b>[Bundesliga decided on Friday afternoon to postpone all of this weekend’s matches and the competition until April 2]</b> In light of today’s developments regarding the coronavirus and suspected cases in direct connection with the Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga, the Presidium of the <a href="dfl.html">DFL</a> Deutsche Fussball Liga has decided at short notice to postpone the 26th matchday for both leagues.

  <p><b>[Bundesliga suspension extended to April 30 due to coronavirus outbreak]</b> The presidium <b>[of the DFL]</b> is aware that all scenarios and options for action also depend on external factors, on the development of which the <a href="dfl.html">DFL</a> and clubs have only limited or no influence at all: among other things, the further spread of the virus and the assessment of the situation by politics. Against this background, the presidium of the General Assembly will recommend a further suspension of game operations in the Bundesliga and 2.Bundesliga until at least April 30<br /><br />In view of the potentially existential situation of some clubs and because of responsibility for an industry with 56,000 direct and indirect employees, we unanimously target the goal of wanting to finish the season by June 30, as far as this is legally permissible and of course health-justifiable. In this regard, the <a href="dfl.html">DFL</a> is currently working intensively on concepts to play games at a given time - due to the situation - even without stadium spectators and with a minimal use of workers in the areas of sport, general organisation and the media. In contrast to amateur and grassroots sports or other leisure events, only the stadium staff would be employed at this place of work</p>

  <p><b>[Bundesliga suspension ratified as task force created to aid continuation of season]</b> A medical task force has been established to create a concept with the aim of medically justifiable continuation of gaming and training operations. In a first step, this will centrally document all Covid-19 cases at the clubs of the Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga. In addition, the commission is developing a procedure with which close, independent testing of players and other staff can be carried out, among other things, immediately before the matchdays. Furthermore, organisational measures in the stadium to avoid transmission (hygiene, disinfection, distance, etc.) as well as special processes in the game and training organisation are defined and uniformly laid down in a guideline. Close coordination with external experts and authorities is sought<br /><br /><b>[DFL will also allow greater leeway with respect to clubs’ potential financial issues in the current climate]</b> This means for the current season that the deduction of nine points is suspended as a sanction for opening insolvency proceedings (Section 11 No. 5 of the licensing regulations). In the event of bankruptcy in the coming season, a penalty would be deducted of only three points. Furthermore, in the upcoming licensing procedure for the 2020-21 season, the clubs’ liquidity situation will not be checked. However, the <a href="dfl.html">DFL</a> prefers to review economic performance during the next season from the end of October to mid-September in order to get a realistic picture of the economic situation of the individual clubs as soon as possible based on the annual financial statements as of June 30, 2020. For the 2021-22 season, the licensing procedure is to be used again in the usual way - as a guarantee of the economic solidity and stability of German professional football</p>
