<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On Hugo Lloris]</b> He’s a leader in the dressing room. He did not speak much when he was young, but when he did, everyone listened, even if he was not the captain here. He was wise, but he could yell when he needed to.<br /><br />The first time I saw Hugo, it was at Cedac de Cimiez. I went to see the match because there was a player I had to watch. He came to us at Under-15 level but was then very quickly moved up to U17.<br /><br />His schooling was a little strange because there was no possibility of completing his baccalaureate through the academy at that time. So he went to the high school that faced the training centre. He trained alone in the evenings as a result. It was difficult because he couldn’t work specifically. He might have been even better otherwise. I would take two poles and I would shoot at him, so we started like that<br /><br />With the U-19s we went for an entire season unbeaten and it was thanks to him. I was afraid that he might not be able to make it as a professional because of his lack of technique. I defended him and said that this guy could become an international. When he was in a match, he was he was invincible. He would take two or three goals a season because of his weaknesses, but he would save his team 10 times a game<br /><br />I came back from Rangers in 2007 and discovered a gentle guy, who got on well with people. He had everything he required to have a great career. Thereafter in Lyon, he worked hard with the ball at his feet, and that allowed him to continue his progression. In England, he has again developed thanks to playing in the Premier League, which has made him become a little more physical<br /><br />His list of titles does not represent his quality. That’s logical because Tottenham are not a club that plays at the highest level each year</p>
