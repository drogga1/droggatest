<blockquote>
  <p><b>[European Leagues strongly opposed to Champions League reforms]</b> Following last week’s Club Advisory Meeting in Madrid with over 240 European clubs, and the meeting between the UEFA Executive Committee and the European Leagues board of directors in Nyon, the European Leagues retain the strong opinion that the presented proposal for reforming the European Club Competitions benefits just a few rich and dominant clubs but damages the leagues and the great majority of clubs playing in the domestic competitions.<br /><br />The European Leagues are working on changes which contribute to the long-term sporting and financial sustainability of both European and domestic club competitions. In this, the Leagues believe that it is imperative for UEFA to start building the changes in the UEFA club competitions project from scratch. In this respect, UEFA must come to an agreement with the European Leagues and the other stakeholders to safeguard the interests of all professional football clubs in Europe. The European Leagues together with the National Associations are responsible for the development of professional football in their own countries and must work together in this respect</p>
