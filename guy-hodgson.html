<blockquote>
  <p>[Dr Guy Hodgson, a sports historian at Liverpool John Moores University and lifelong United fan] Busby became obsessed with building another set of Busby Babes. If it had not been for Munich, would he have bought players like Mike England and Alan Ball? Because if you look at the 1968 European Cup side, eight of them are home-grown players as he wanted to get the same home-grown thing again. Would he have changed his mind-set had he been building on success?<br /><br />Other things might have happened, like would Nobby Stiles have gone with his brother-in-law Johnny Giles to Leeds, because would he have got a game if Duncan Edwards and Eddie Colman had been around? He might never have got to play for United and might have had to go elsewhere for a position.<br /><br />Would United have been so enthusiastic in their search for youth, as they might have missed out on George Best? Wolves were interested in George Best, but United had this passion to go and get these young players and to rebuild the Busby Babes. Would they have had that same urgency and hunger to do it again if they’d won the European Cup and won the championship a few more times?”.<br /><br />In ’58 England went there and didn’t lose a game in the actual group stages, they drew with the USSR, Brazil, the eventual winners, and Austria, who had finished third in 1954. In that England team they would have had Roger Byrne, Duncan Edwards and Tommy Taylor, also Bobby Charlton went to that World Cup but never played. He was dropped because England had played a friendly against Yugoslavia in Belgrade and he had a bad game. And where had United been flying from at Munich? Belgrade, of course. So Bobby Charlton was probably being haunted by ghosts, had a bad game and didn’t play in the World Cup. So you’ve basically taken four players from the England first team. Tommy Taylor had scored 16 goals in 19 appearances! If they had won two of those games with those players in, they’d have been in the easier side of the draw and there’s a fair chance they would have won the World Cup. I’m not convinced they would have won it in ’62 as it was away from Europe, but they would have had a really good chance of winning the World Cup in ’58. So there’s every chance that by ’66 we would have won it twice and gone far a third time. As it was, Brazil became the first team to win outside their own continent in 1958, but they were lucky because England were severely debilitated and so were the Mighty Magyars of Hungary after Honved’s great side had broken up amid the revolution of 1956<br /><br />United would almost certainly have won the European Cup that year, Bobby Charlton thinks they may well have done,” adds Dr Hodgson. “And if you look at the comparative ages of the United squad with Real Madrid at that time I think there’s about a five-year difference, and Real Madrid won in 1958, 1959 and 1960. I think if they hadn’t won it in ’58, United would also have won it in either ’59 or ’60 as they were a young side maturing whereas Real Madrid were slightly over the hill. With that, we would have had a very different perspective of European football and British success because United would have had a couple of European Cups<br /><br />They became the world’s favourite club because everybody felt sorry for them. That helped propel United’s success, but the fact that they got to the FA Cup final in ’58 itself was astonishing. You had Jimmy Murphy doing a fantastic job, taking over from Busby when he was in hospital and getting them to the FA Cup final with reserves and two players they brought in. They had been given special dispensation by the FA to bring in players who had already been cup-tied to come in and play for United. That FA Cup run must have given them real belief going forward because they had managed to do that. But Busby was bold. They signed Denis Law for a world-record fee, which complemented the side. They got David Herd and Pat Crerand. But between winning the league in ’65 and the European Cup in ’68 they signed John Connelly and that’s all. They relied very much on home-grown talent because he was trying to rebuild his Busby Babes. And only five years after Munich they won the FA Cup against Leicester in 1963<br /><br />It’s intriguing to think who might not have been in the ’66 team but for Munich. If Duncan Edwards had been dropped back to the back four, would Bobby Moore have been in the team?” asks Dr Hodgson. “The person who symbolised the ’66 victory might not have been in the side! Alternatively, if Edwards had stayed in midfield, Nobby Stiles probably wouldn’t have been there. Eddie Colman was only 21 when he died, so he would have still been around in ’66 as well. There might have been a significant improvement in that England side. It was still quite a raw side, and Ramsey had still been chopping and changing his team until quite late, looking for that winning formula. I spoke to Jimmy Armfield a couple of times and he described Duncan as a colossus, and he was adamant that he would have been in the ’66 World Cup side. When you think that Bobby Charlton played with players like George Best and against someone like Pele, yet he says Duncan Edwards is the only player that made him feel inferior, he must have been absolutely outstanding</p>
