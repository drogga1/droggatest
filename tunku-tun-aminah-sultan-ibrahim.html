  <p><b>[The Southern Tigers announce the surprise departure of head coach Mario Gomez, just two days before the 2017 kicks off]</b> This decision was derived for the betterment of the club as the philosophy and the direction of the club is paramount to anything else.</p>

  <p><b>[JDT fans need to give Benjamin Mora time]</b> JDT should give time to Benjamin Mora and understand that every change in football takes time. Benjamin Mora took over JDT with completely different foreign players, different players. You don’t have good players like Hariss, you don’t have good players like Martin Lucero, Pereyra Diaz and Luciano Figueroa. I have been with the good players in this club. And it was different.<br /><br />Now not only that they don’t have all these good players but at the same time you have to understand that they also have new local players, so it takes time and I am confident because I am in JDT and I know the system in JDT. JDT will be a stronger team next year and all the years to come. For now, this year is an adjustment period and everybody should support Benjamin Mora because he is a good coach</p>

  <p><b>[JDT president Tunku Tun Aminah Sultan Ibrahim has said that club owner Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim is not appreciated in his role as FAM president]</b> I hope HRH Crown Prince of Johor will not remain as the President of the Football Association of Malaysia <b>[FAM]</b> for too long. It’s better to serve and contribute where you are appreciated and loved.<br /><br />Don’t stay there for too long and it’s better for you to come home rather than staying there where you are not being appreciated. Although JDT are already at a high level, guide them to a higher level and focus on Johor who appreciate and loved you more<br /><br />All the positive things done by HRH Major General Tunku Ismail Ibni Sultan Ibrahim, Crown Prince of Johor, have been forgotten and not appreciated. His Royal Highness’ credibility was judged and debated based on the result of one match. During Malaysian football’s darkest days when over 100 players were involved in corruption, no media mentioned the president. In the past 2-3 years when Malaysia lost 10-0, 6-0, nobody wrote about the president or Dollah Salleh. But today, after Malaysia lost a game to a stronger team, the media wrote HRH Crown Prince of Johor has failed. It is because His Royal Highness does not bribe the media and take care of politicians. Congratulations to Malaysian media</p>
