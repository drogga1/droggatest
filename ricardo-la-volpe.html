<blockquote>
  <p>[After playing the Club World Cup and then the Liga MX final, Club America had its opening fixture postponed] We should have a good group, good locker room, we got to the final, we went to Japan. The team is going forward with a strong mentality, a winning mentality, and we’re going to fight for the championship. I don’t have any doubt.</p>

  <p>[Tigres attack is back, Tijuana finds its groove] Soccer is about forcefulness and you’ve got to convert your chances to score. We didn’t finish off very clear opportunities and they did. They scored two goals on us from set pieces. We’ve got to work on that more.</p>

  <p>[Miguel Herrera outcoached again as America knocked out by Santos Laguna] Perhaps he came out like that because of the need for goals, but maybe after going up 2-0 he should’ve gone to a back four because of the risk Santos had on the wings.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Ricardo La Volpe back where he belongs ahead of Toluca’s crucial clash against former club America] I’ve been coaching for more than 30 years. I’ve already forgotten, even the memories. For a long time, I’ve told my players that they’re not playing against a shirt, nor are they playing against names. I want to teach my players and transmit the message that you play against systems, that the opponent has a system of play and you have to know how to counteract that. I never think about the shirts, whether it’s yellow, green or white. I’m past that stage.<br /><br />The three points are very important. It’s a key match, and we’ve got to get three points. I need the team to be concentrated all 90 minutes and it’s super important if we have the goal to be in the final eight. The three points are key to get into the Liguilla. It’s a very important game</p>
