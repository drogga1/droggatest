<blockquote>
  <p>[Khalid Boulahrouz has revealed why he had the No. 9 shirt during his two-year spell at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. The 37-year-old admits he requested that number when he first arrived in west London] It was my dream to become a striker for a top team, so I thought ‘maybe I can force it this way’. No, I just arrived there and it was all last minute. The competition was already started and it was two days before the game vs Middlesbrough when I signed my contract. One day before the match I was entitled to play. I had to pick a number and the kit man from <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> started with No. 9. And then he continued with 45, 47… So my thought was ‘I’m not gonna play with a number like that’ so I said ‘Okay, give me No. 9’.<br /><br />On matchday, we were in the hotel when he asked me why I chose No. 9. I told him I didn’t want to play with a high number like 47 or 49. ‘You can understand that, right?’ But he responded: ‘But No. 2 is also available’ and I was thinking ‘Oh God, what am I doing?’ I guess that kit man set me up</p>
