  <p><a href="uttama-savanayana.html">Uttama Savanayana</a>, leader of the Palang Pracharath Party (PPP) and Minister of Industry, says the pro-Prayut party is ‘always open’ to anyone interested in joining. The Sam Mitr (Three Allies) group is set to bring its 70 members to join the Palang Pracharath Party, which is seen as a political vehicle to support Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha’s return to power after the general election expected in late February.<br /><br /><a href="thanakorn-wangboonkongchana.html">Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana</a> said Sam Mitr has decided to join Palang Pracharath because the party has offered itself as an alternative for the public. Most importantly, Palang Pracharath has agreed that it will adopt the group’s proposals and integrate them as part of the party’s policy. The proposals include improving welfare benefits for village heads, kamnan, health volunteers, disaster prevention volunteers and the elderly, as well as a project called ‘Cows to Tackle Poverty’, Mr Thanakorn said. The project is reminiscent of the ‘One Million Cows’ scheme initiated by Mr Somsak Thepsuthin when he served as a cabinet minster in the <a href="thaksin-shinawatra.html">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> government. The project was aimed at giving away 1 million cattle to farmers.<br /><br />Mr <a href="uttama-savanayana.html">Uttama Savanayana</a>, Mr Sontirat Sontijirawong, Mr Suvit Maesincee and Mr Kobsak Pootrakool are all members of the government’s economic team led by Deputy Prime Minister <a href="somkid-jatusripitak.html">Somkid Jatusripitak</a>. Mr Uttama brushed aside calls for the four ministers to step down after they assumed executive posts at Palang Pracharath, saying that they will do so when the right time comes. The ministers are facing calls for them to step down as criticism mounts over potential conflicts of interest</p>

  <p>The Election Commission (EC) is ready to defend itself against multiple legal challenges over its performance in the recent poll, as well as face an impeachment process, EC chairman <a href="ittiporn-boonpracong.html">Ittiporn Boonpracong</a> said on Sunday. Mr <a href="ittiporn-boonpracong.html">Ittiporn</a> was referring to a petition for the Office of the Ombudsman to seek a Constitutional Court ruling nullifying the March 24 election, a petition for the National Anti-Corruption Commission to impeach the seven members of the EC and a threat to file a court case against the EC for malfeasance under Section 157 of the Criminal Code<br /><br />Buddhipongse Punnakanta, an executive member of the Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP), said he was confident that after the Election Commission endorses the poll results on May 9, the party would be able to secure the support of the 251, or more, MPs in the House necessary to form a coalition government. ‘It will become clear which parties will join the PPRP in forming a government after May 9,’ he said</p>

  <p>Bhumjaithai Party leader <a href="anutin-charnvirakul.html">Anutin Charnvirakul</a> said earlier on Sunday the party that wishes to be at the centre of the coalition should be the one making the arrangements and invitations<br /><br />… the House of Representatives on Sunday voted in the PPRP MP for Chochoengsao, Suchart Tancharoen, as the first deputy House Speaker. Meanwhile, Bhumjaithai MP for Nakhon Phanom, Supachai Phosu, was chosen as second deputy House Speaker. The appointments of Mr Suchart and Mr Supachart came one day after Chuan Leekpai of the Democrat Party was chosen as House Speaker - a move which is believed to be a part of a deal for the Democrat Party to bring its lawmakers to join the PPRP-led alliance<br /><br />Mr Suchart Tancharoen narrowly beat Yaowaluck Wongpraparat of the Future Forward Party (FFP) by two votes – winning by 248 to 246<br /><br />Mr Supachai Phosu received 256 votes, defeating Prasong Boonpong of the Seree Ruam Thai Party who gained 239 votes</p>
