<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Wolves goalkeeper Jack Ruddy has revealed that Barcelona played a part in preventing him from fulfilling his dreams in La Liga]</b> I trained with local teams and then signed for Real Murcia in the Spanish second tier, but there was a ban in Spain on under-21 foreign players signing unless you have five years’ residency. I couldn’t actually sign a senior contract. I’d been on trial with Villarreal but I couldn’t join them and it all stemmed from Barcelona signing players illegally. Because of that, they put the ban in place and I got caught up in it. It was really disappointing, my dad was on the phone to the Spanish FA all the time trying to get it sorted but there was nothing we could do. I hadn’t been there long enough. I was a year short and could have waited another 12 months and I would have been fine</p>
