<blockquote>
  <p>[Sunderland have confirmed the appointment of Simon Grayson as David Moyes’ successor on a three-year contract] We warmly welcome Simon to Sunderland. From the outset he demonstrated a tremendous enthusiasm for the job and his desire and ambition to make this football club better shone through.<br /><br />Wherever he has managed, he has improved those clubs, which is a clear indication of his ability to build a team on solid foundations and create the right environment for success, and these are certainly attributes that we as a football club want to embrace as we embark on our own re-building process with him at the helm. Finally, in welcoming Simon, I would also like to extend my thanks to the chairman and board of Preston North End. I know they were understandably keen to retain his services and we thank them for their cooperation during the discussion process</p>
