  <p><b>[B Sathianathan has expressed that he wants to see more from his foreign players in the squad]</b> I have to be fair. Zah Rahan is a key player for us this season, but any coach will not be happy when the strikers don’t score. I think we can expect more from foreign players. I will give them chance and see their progress in the next month. Lucas <b>[Cano]</b> scored three goals so far, so I think he is on his way to be reasonably accepted but the rest need to do soul searching and get their act together.<br /><br />I don’t have the time to see my reserve players due to the heavy schedule so most of the time we spend are for traveling. I still rely on the 14-15 players that we have so far, but due to the injuries, I am forced to make changes so hopefully the reserve players can step in and perform better than the others<br /><br />I know they have experienced in AFC Cup before, and they are also second in the table in the Vietnam League. I didn’t get the chance to see them but I saw them in youtube. Coming from Vietnam, they are very fast players, very quick. If they are second in their league, it means they have quality</p>

  <p><b>[Felda United head coach, Bhaskaran R Sathianathan admitted that he is not happy with his side after they failed to keep the possession of the ball and conceded a very late goal]</b> We didn’t defend and hold the ball really well towards the end of the game. I’m not happy with the way we defended. We lost possession in midfield and they got the equaliser. Hanoiwere really desperate. We handled them well only to concede in the injury time<br /><br />I have one week to find the solution before we travel to Philippines and face FC Ceres Negros. We made a mistake, and we have to fix it but overall, I’m not happy with the result because we were so close to winning</p>

  <p><b>[Sathianathan seeking the bonus of a draw against Ceres for his Felda United side in Wednesday’s AFC Cup action]</b> Philippines football are improving on the whole, thanks to teams like Ceres. We have good respect for them especially after they beat Singapore’s Tampines Rovers 5-0. We are glad to be here but not glad to play against a team that is very strong.<br /><br />I took over only less than a month. It’s a very difficult period for the club who has high hopes this season because we’re the runners-up in the league last season and we’re suppose to be a better team than last year but we failed to keep our stars from last season. But no excuses, we’ll give respect to Ceres because of their performance. My colleague from Spain has done a good job with his players. I think a draw would be a good bonus for us because this is our first time in the AFC Cup<br /><br />When we lose the ball we defend. When we get the ball, we attack</p>

  <p><b>[Sathianathan searching for morale-boosting win against Ceres]</b> This is our chance if we can win, we can move up in the table. But more importantly, it’ll give the team greater confidence going forward in the AFC Cup as well as the Super League.<br /><br />Except for Shukor <b>[Adan]</b> who is injured and Luca <b>[Cano]</b> who is suspended, we’ll field a strong team. Our focus is to win because our pride is at stake. When we see JDT close to qualifying, that’s what we want to do also<br /><br />I hope we start scoring. That is our weakness right now. We had chances not only against Ceres but also against Hanoi but we missed those. In these few weeks of rest, we’ve worked on the finishing but what happens in training isn’t similar to what happens in the match</p>

  <p><b>[Idlan produced a wonderful performance against Ceres that has Sathianathan grinning from ear to ear]</b> Three nil looks like a big score but we didn’t play at our best. But the boys kept going and they organised themselves well. After the one goal lead, they relaxed a bit. There’s still a lack of discipline. But the boys have been responding well in training and things look positive. Our main aim is to try to get into the next round. The boys have grown in confidence and I’m confidence that they can do it. They want to do it and so do I.<br /><br />Before I came, he applied leave to go for his umrah. He was away for 10 days. I could not stop him because the previous management made the decision. Just got him back just four or five days training. The way he played today, I’m very happy with his performance. But I’ve known him for a long time and I know he can still be better. He’s not old, he’s in the right age to still get better</p>

  <p><b>[Sathianathan heavily criticised his import players for their poor performance]</b> We can see that our import players have performed very badly. The local players played even better and have more quality compared to them. I have decided to sign three new import players during the next transfer window.</p>

  <p><b>[Sathianathan looks to former Felda striker for inspiration]</b> The lack of sharpness up front in our import strikers has been identified as the root cause of Felda’s failure to challenge this far. The proof is there, we have only scored 16 goals from 13 matches. If fact from that number, our highest scorer Lucas Cano has only scored six goals while Gaston is at a disappointing one goal.<br /><br />Thiago is a striker with proven qualities during his time with Felda and Kedah. I’m confident that he’s the right player to overcome our problems</p>

  <p><b>[Lebanon may have better forwards than current Super League top-scorer Mohammed Ghaddar, warned former Malaysia head coach B Sathianathan]</b> Although Ghaddar, the current league top-scorer has not been selected for the match, it proves that they have many options and are not dependent on only a few players. We know that many of their players are based abroad, so if to us Ghaddar is a good striker here, that means they have even better forwards and we must be absolutely careful.<br /><br />It may be part of the Lebanon head coach’s tactics, as Malaysian players may already be familiar with Ghaddar’s capabilities. But he still called up Mootaz in defence to stop Malaysia’s attack, as he already has experience playing in the country</p>

  <p><b>[Bhaskaran R Sathianathan revealed that the club had made an approach for former Kelantan and Pahang striker Dickson Nwakaeme]</b> He’s too expensive for Felda and we can’t afford it, although he wants to return to playing in Malaysia. We’ve signed Dino Djulbic as Mootaz’ replacement, and tomorrow <b>[Wednesday]</b> we’ll decide on Thiago’s partner. But we need to do further checks on their backgrounds first.<br /><br />I always say it’s top four <b>[in the Super League]</b>. But for Malaysia Cup, I’d love to be in the final. I’ve taken my previous teams to the final four times, so why not? We’ll go as far as possible</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[B Sathianathan is looking at FAM to reach an agreement with all teams regarding the release of players for the U22 squad]</b> If an agreement is to be made or to create a new rule, it must follow the FIFA regulations. If a match is classified as Class A, of course teams will release their players for the national team. But if it involves the Under-22 team, it’s difficult because the match isn’t Class A status and teams have the right not to release players.<br /><br />That <b>[an agreement]</b> is a good suggestion. At the least, all teams will comply after signing the agreement or risked being punished by FAM <b>[Football Association of Malaysia]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Malaysia Cup on Sathianathan’s mind]</b> I want Felda to go as far as we can in the Malaysia Cup. Although our chances of reaching beyond <b>[the group stage]</b> are good, we can’t be overconfident. After making a number of changes, especially the signing of new foreign players, I hope we are now more formidable and are capable of lifting the trophy.</p>

  <p><b>[Felda struck late to earn all 3 points against Pahang]</b> I praise my players for coming back to get the win. They created a lot of goalscoring chances and that is what we need to do every match. If we only played defensively, we can only draw but we don’t want to go that way. My instructions is for the players to do both. Despite the win, this is not the finished article yet for Felda and there are still room for improvement.</p>

  <p><b>[Felda United head coach Bhaskaran R Sathianathan has remarked on the fatigue experienced by his players, in their Super League round 18 3-1 win against Selangor on Wednesday]</b> I have to congratulate my boys for performing very well despite having played five or six matches in fifteen days. Today they played well as a team, but I’m a little disappointed that we allowed Selangor to pull one back and come back into the match.<br /><br />That caused us troubles in the second half, but fortunately we managed to restore our two-goal lead. We however still made a number of mistakes that allowed the opponents to create two, three chances. But in overall I’m happy with the result, as my men have bounced back from their defeat to Perak <b>[last Saturday]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Felda’s B. Sathianathan remains quietly confident that his charge could yet overturn a 3-1 loss in the first leg, to reach the 2017 Malaysia Cup semis]</b> It’s doesn’t make any difference. If PKNP fans want to support, they can come over, it’s only a 2 hours drive. Only thing is that we don’t travel and we train here. And the boys are playing on grass. That’s very important. We have an artificial pitch there and sometimes it doesn’t work to our advantage because I don’t train there.<br /><br />I don’t believe in training on artificial because there will be a lot of injuries. I think they should stop all these artificial grounds. Malaysia has nice weather. I can’t change that because it’s already been built and Jengka is our home. We’ll give it a few more years and hopefully there might be changes there.<br /><br />Very slim <b>[to qualify]</b> but it’s not impossible. They scored 3 and I think we should be able to score as well, if we take our chances well. Last game, they played very well and took their chances. They were very disciplined but we got to be above ourselves. We got to believe in ourselves.<br /><br />It’s going to be difficult but as long as the boys give me 100% and play true to themselves, I’ll be happy no matter what the result. That was one of our off games and this season we had 3 of those and one of it was against PKNP. But credit to PKNP, defensively they played well and they have two good foreigners up front.<br /><br />Shahrel Fikri’s every touch was a goal. If happens like that every time, I should buy him. He’s a good player. But I can’t put a marker on him because I’m looking for goals, I’ve got to gamble</p>

  <p><b>[Felda United staged a remarkable comeback against PKNP FC to knock the Premier League out of the Malaysia Cup competition after an enthralling match]</b> It was a tough match but the players were motivated to do well. We changed the system today and we managed to get four goals. However I was less than happy with the last 10 minutes when we became sloppy. We could have killed the game with 7 - 8 goals. Anyway, I must congratulate the players for giving 100% and go the mentality that impossible is nothing and everything is possible.<br /><br />Yes, experience was a key factor. The opening goal came from a cross from the birthday boy, Shukor. And it was a fantastic cross. We had crossing chances before but other players couldn’t deliver. It was Shukor who showed his experience with the move that got us back into the game. Turns out the old player who showed the young ones how to cross</p>

  <p><b>[Sathia praises team character after 3-2 win against JDT]</b> It was important to get 3 points. We want to be in top 4. The players did their best but we were lucky as well because they had a couple of shots that hit the post. I think today JDT wasn’t at their best. We also had our chances. I want my players to be more focus after leading because we lost a lot of possession. With the quality of players that JDT have, we were also a bit lucky. They could have taken a point today. We have to be very honest, they are the best team and best players. It’s just that we were a bit luckier. Luckier because our players worked hard and displayed a lot of character.<br /><br />Yes, it is possible <b>[to finish high in the league]</b>. Just that we have to focus in our last game against PKNS. They have improved lately, so we have to be careful. Of course this is a morale booster but Kedah will be a different game</p>

  <p><b>[B Sathianathan downplays Felda’s home advantage and recent record ahead of Kedah clash]</b> Of course at the time we were buoyed by our win over PKNP FC <b>[in the Malaysia Cup quarter-finals]</b>, but Kedah were also playing without four of their Malaysia internationals and this affected their gameplay. But this time around, I’m confident they will be able to field their first eleven. And remember, they held us to a 1-1 draw at home earlier in the season. It’s still a 50-50 match.<br /><br />We lost twice <b>[at home this season]</b> against Pulau Pinang and PKNP. We need to be careful as Kedah are a much tougher opponent than the two sides. The core Kedah squad has been retained for the past three, four years and they’ve been playing together for a long time. That’s the edge they have.<br /><br />Our plan is simply to win at home, instead of worrying about the margin and such. But we also have to avoid losing like how we lost against PKNP with a 3-1 scoreline <b>[first leg Malaysia Cup quarter-final]</b>. If that were to happen against Kedah, there’d be no way we’ll get to come back into the match, that’s quaranteed<br /><br />We’ve been preparing for this match as soon as we won the quarter-final tie, but it has been affected somewhat by Stuart’s injury. But everybody else is fit and available, I just need to be careful in today and Saturday’s training so as to not get anyone else injured. However we still need to train, so it’s down to luck, really</p>

  <p><b>[Outspoken coach B. Sathianathan has questioned his own club Felda United’s decision to part ways with their key players before the 2017 season started]</b> The core Kedah squad has been retained for the past three, four years and they’ve been playing together for a long time, including two of their foreign players. They have that stability, which gives them an edge, unlike us who constantly undergo revamping. We were second in the standings last year, yet 11, 12 of the players were dropped, I don’t know whose idea that was. That’s not a healthy way of running things if you want a competitive side. Only teams that have no ambition sack that many players <b>[at the same time]</b>,<br /><br />We should have not lost Christie, Syamim, good players, to Pahang. Look what happened to Felda in the first round. Only when we signed quality players in the mid-season transfer period did we improve; with nine wins, one draw and one defeat.</p>
