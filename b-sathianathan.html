  <p><b>[B Sathianathan has expressed that he wants to see more from his foreign players in the squad]</b> I have to be fair. Zah Rahan is a key player for us this season, but any coach will not be happy when the strikers don’t score. I think we can expect more from foreign players. I will give them chance and see their progress in the next month. Lucas <b>[Cano]</b> scored three goals so far, so I think he is on his way to be reasonably accepted but the rest need to do soul searching and get their act together.<br /><br />I don’t have the time to see my reserve players due to the heavy schedule so most of the time we spend are for traveling. I still rely on the 14-15 players that we have so far, but due to the injuries, I am forced to make changes so hopefully the reserve players can step in and perform better than the others<br /><br />I know they have experienced in AFC Cup before, and they are also second in the table in the Vietnam League. I didn’t get the chance to see them but I saw them in youtube. Coming from Vietnam, they are very fast players, very quick. If they are second in their league, it means they have quality</p>

  <p><b>[Felda United head coach, Bhaskaran R Sathianathan admitted that he is not happy with his side after they failed to keep the possession of the ball and conceded a very late goal]</b> We didn’t defend and hold the ball really well towards the end of the game. I’m not happy with the way we defended. We lost possession in midfield and they got the equaliser. Hanoiwere really desperate. We handled them well only to concede in the injury time<br /><br />I have one week to find the solution before we travel to Philippines and face FC Ceres Negros. We made a mistake, and we have to fix it but overall, I’m not happy with the result because we were so close to winning</p>

  <p><b>[Sathianathan seeking the bonus of a draw against Ceres for his Felda United side in Wednesday’s AFC Cup action]</b> Philippines football are improving on the whole, thanks to teams like Ceres. We have good respect for them especially after they beat Singapore’s Tampines Rovers 5-0. We are glad to be here but not glad to play against a team that is very strong.<br /><br />I took over only less than a month. It’s a very difficult period for the club who has high hopes this season because we’re the runners-up in the league last season and we’re suppose to be a better team than last year but we failed to keep our stars from last season. But no excuses, we’ll give respect to Ceres because of their performance. My colleague from Spain has done a good job with his players. I think a draw would be a good bonus for us because this is our first time in the AFC Cup<br /><br />When we lose the ball we defend. When we get the ball, we attack</p>

  <p><b>[Sathianathan searching for morale-boosting win against Ceres]</b> This is our chance if we can win, we can move up in the table. But more importantly, it’ll give the team greater confidence going forward in the AFC Cup as well as the Super League.<br /><br />Except for Shukor <b>[Adan]</b> who is injured and Luca <b>[Cano]</b> who is suspended, we’ll field a strong team. Our focus is to win because our pride is at stake. When we see JDT close to qualifying, that’s what we want to do also<br /><br />I hope we start scoring. That is our weakness right now. We had chances not only against Ceres but also against Hanoi but we missed those. In these few weeks of rest, we’ve worked on the finishing but what happens in training isn’t similar to what happens in the match</p>

  <p><b>[Idlan produced a wonderful performance against Ceres that has Sathianathan grinning from ear to ear]</b> Three nil looks like a big score but we didn’t play at our best. But the boys kept going and they organised themselves well. After the one goal lead, they relaxed a bit. There’s still a lack of discipline. But the boys have been responding well in training and things look positive. Our main aim is to try to get into the next round. The boys have grown in confidence and I’m confidence that they can do it. They want to do it and so do I.<br /><br />Before I came, he applied leave to go for his umrah. He was away for 10 days. I could not stop him because the previous management made the decision. Just got him back just four or five days training. The way he played today, I’m very happy with his performance. But I’ve known him for a long time and I know he can still be better. He’s not old, he’s in the right age to still get better</p>

  <p><b>[Sathianathan heavily criticised his import players for their poor performance]</b> We can see that our import players have performed very badly. The local players played even better and have more quality compared to them. I have decided to sign three new import players during the next transfer window.</p>
