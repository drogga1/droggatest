  <p>[B Sathianathan has expressed that he wants to see more from his foreign players in the squad] I have to be fair. Zah Rahan is a key player for us this season, but any coach will not be happy when the strikers don’t score. I think we can expect more from foreign players. I will give them chance and see their progress in the next month. Lucas [Cano] scored three goals so far, so I think he is on his way to be reasonably accepted but the rest need to do soul searching and get their act together.<br /><br />I don’t have the time to see my reserve players due to the heavy schedule so most of the time we spend are for traveling. I still rely on the 14-15 players that we have so far, but due to the injuries, I am forced to make changes so hopefully the reserve players can step in and perform better than the others<br /><br />I know they have experienced in AFC Cup before, and they are also second in the table in the Vietnam League. I didn’t get the chance to see them but I saw them in youtube. Coming from Vietnam, they are very fast players, very quick. If they are second in their league, it means they have quality</p>

  <p>[Felda United head coach, Bhaskaran R Sathianathan admitted that he is not happy with his side after they failed to keep the possession of the ball and conceded a very late goal] We didn’t defend and hold the ball really well towards the end of the game. I’m not happy with the way we defended. We lost possession in midfield and they got the equaliser. Hanoiwere really desperate. We handled them well only to concede in the injury time<br /><br />I have one week to find the solution before we travel to Philippines and face FC Ceres Negros. We made a mistake, and we have to fix it but overall, I’m not happy with the result because we were so close to winning</p>
