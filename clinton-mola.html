  <p><b>[Clinton Mola remains grateful to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> despite making a deadline day switch in January to 2. <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> side Stuttgart for €400,000]</b> It was definitely a time for me to really think about my future and life and I only had a short space to do so. It kind of came about in the final two or three days of the transfer window. I just found out that they were interested and they had been watching me for some time. I have a chat with the sporting director Sven Mislintat and we FaceTimed and then I found myself in Germany in the next few days. I am definitely grateful for what <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> did for me. It was a hard decision but I just thought if I was to really excel in my career, then it is best for me to move on. I can maybe come back to England in the future and I am grateful to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> as they matured me as a person, I made great friends there and I am close with the staff as well. When I saw the opportunity to move abroad and to come to Germany I thought why not take it and see where it gets me. They are a big club with a big history. They have a lot of young players in the team and I like the style of play that they play which was definitely appealing. When I was 13 I was using <a href="mario-gomez.html">Mario Gomez</a> on <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> and now I am in a changing room with him. It is a bit crazy. The same for Holder Badstuber, it is crazy. They are big names and big characters. They both helped me settle in very well. This club has a big stadium and a big fan base<br /><br />I don’t know Jadon personally but I have seen him set the bar for young English players. He came over and produced wonders at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> so that definitely was a factor of: ‘Wow! I can come here and do well like him and maybe people will know me on the world stage’. I just have to keep working hard every day in training, then take my opportunity at the weekend. I wasn’t expecting the debut to be so soon. I thought I would have at least a week to settle in but the manager showed the faith to put me in after four days and I thought I did alright. I wasn’t nervous. I just thought this is the time to show what I am about. I am going to be playing at a first-team level so I need to take my opportunity when I get it. My first game was against Bayer Leverkusen in <a href="dfb.html">DFB</a> Pokal. They are a Champions League side and when I came on I wasn’t nervous one bit. I came on and we didn’t win but I thought we did well. <b>[I was against]</b> <a href="kai-havertz.html">Kai Havertz</a> who is a world-class talent and I think he is going to be one of the best players in the world in a few years<br /><br />When I played against him, I knew he was a good player, but I thought I did well against him. The quality, speed and tempo was high but I thought I adapted to it well. It showed me a great level to aim to play at. I was really happy to make my debut. If you asked me if I would do that a couple of months ago, I would call you crazy, but it shows that things can happen so quickly in football which is crazy<br /><br />When I was younger being a footballer was always the dream but I never had the opportunity. I was playing in school and for a local team. I just heard that I would get a trial for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. My first thought was: ‘Play for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>? Are you sure? Have you got the wrong person?’ I went up there and I had a six-week trial. The first session I was nervous like crazy. I didn’t think they were going to call me back. They did and I completed the six weeks and I found myself getting signed for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I didn’t expect to go from Sunday League to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. The step up was crazy. I learned a lot from <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> helped me mature a lot. I was at the full-time programme a year later so I was at school there and I had a house-family away from my parents. That definitely helped me and gave me an idea of what my future might be like so <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> definitely helped me a lot to become more mature. I won four trophies in one season. That was my best memory, 100 per cent, under Jody Morris<br /><br />I have played with Billy for the last few years. When he first came from Scotland I was like: ‘Who is this guy?!’ He was a top player from day one. He deserves everything that is coming to him now. He is a great player. He is simply a baller from what he does on the pitch. Off the pitch, he just worked hard every day, is disciplined and he is a leader. I loved playing with Billy and I love seeing him getting the chances and minutes that he deserves. The players that are playing with the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> team that I played with are guys I know 100% deserve to be there. I am talking about <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a>, <a href="reece-james.html">Reece James</a> and <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Billy Gilmour</a> now. These are players I played with in the last three seasons and they are great players. What <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> and <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a> are doing there is so good for the academy. The guys in the academy deserve it as well. There’s a bright future. I think more and more people will get their chance as well. The players who are playing now definitely have a bright future and they will become great players for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I believe that 100%</p>
