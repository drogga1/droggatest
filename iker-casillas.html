My time at Madrid is in the past, but I would love to return to La Liga<br /><br />The national team is not a stage that has closed. Unlike other team-mates, I haven’t retired from the team. I think it’s different with goalkeepers, but I respect the decisions of the coach who believes it is appropriate to take other team-mates because he thinks they are better. But I have the desire, so why not? For example, Jesus Navas showed he could return to the national team and I’m very happy for him<br /><br />Zidane’s arrival is a reason for enthusiasm and energy for all Madrid fans after everything that was achieved in recent years</p>

When you’ve been the best, one of the best of all time, something we’ve all seen out on the pitch, making that move seems like it should be easy but we’ve seen so many cases in which it hasn’t worked out that way. Zidane always seems to be in control of the situation. He’s also a young coach who’s in touch with his players, he’s happy for them to be the stars. When I see him at press conferences he reminds me of Vicente del Bosque. Vicente was never the kind of coach who wanted the spotlight, he was happy leaving it to the players. When he was our coach at Real Madrid between 2000 and 2004 he was like that and Zidane to me is very similar</p>
