Aston Villa have announced the capture of Brazilian striker Wesley from <a href="club-brugge.html">Club Brugge</a> for what is thought to be a record club fee of £22m.</p>

<p>: 2019 07 03
Aston Villa have completed the club-record signing of striker Wesley Moraes from <a href="club-brugge.html">Club Brugge</a> for a reported £22 million after he was granted a work permit</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Aston Villa striker Wesley says that playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is even sweeter having overcome so many obstacles to get a chance in England’s elite]</b> When my father died, it was difficult because my mum was alone with me and my brothers but she worked and now today I do everything for her. When I finish training, I call my mum because she is everything. My mum did everything to help me play so every day when I come home, I call her.<br /><br />I had my first child when I was 14 years old. It was difficult because it was during this time that I started to try and play football professionally. I had to work in the day and then go to training in the evening. When I play, I have to think about my family, my kids, my mum, everybody<br /><br /><b>[In addition to his rejections the 22-year-old has one leg shorter than the other, but he laughs that off]</b> I am very happy playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, in the biggest competition in the world. Every day I think about the past, what I was thinking when teams were saying no to me, so I’m very happy now that I have this job. I don’t know what to say, I have my legs like this you know and I don’t have any pain or anything like that. I hope to continue like this</p>
