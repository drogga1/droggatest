  <p><b>[Wesley de Oliveira has earned the nickname ‘Gasolina’ during his time in youth football]</b> It came from when I used to play on the futsal courts. I kept running. Then a fan started calling me ‘Gasolina’. It caught on, and even on the field I was being called it. Everyone calls me ‘Gasolina’ today.<br /><br />I look at Dani Alves. He is fast and skilful. Sometimes I watch some of his videos and try to do the same. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not work!</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> striker Wesley says that playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is even sweeter having overcome so many obstacles to get a chance in England’s elite]</b> When my father died, it was difficult because my mum was alone with me and my brothers but she worked and now today I do everything for her. When I finish training, I call my mum because she is everything. My mum did everything to help me play so every day when I come home, I call her.<br /><br />I had my first child when I was 14 years old. It was difficult because it was during this time that I started to try and play football professionally. I had to work in the day and then go to training in the evening. When I play, I have to think about my family, my kids, my mum, everybody<br /><br /><b>[In addition to his rejections the 22-year-old has one leg shorter than the other, but he laughs that off]</b> I am very happy playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, in the biggest competition in the world. Every day I think about the past, what I was thinking when teams were saying no to me, so I’m very happy now that I have this job. I don’t know what to say, I have my legs like this you know and I don’t have any pain or anything like that. I hope to continue like this</p>
