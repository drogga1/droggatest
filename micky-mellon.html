  <p><b>[Tranmere team’s memorable cup runs during the early 2000s, when they reached the FA Cup quarter-finals three times in four years as well as the League Cup final in 2000]</b> It’s about the whole of the football club showing the whole football world that Tranmere is still here.<br /><br />We disappeared off the Football League radar for a while and when you have three years out of the league you can lose generations of fans. You can stop being a big football club. But we have seen in the last few years with trips to Wembley, occasions like this and the promotion battles that Tranmere is still here. It still has a fan base that, when called upon, can sell out in three hours.<br /><br />It has unbelievable potential and it is up to us as a football business to make sure that we keep the momentum going forward. Friday night will help that</p>

  <p><b>[Tranmere Rovers manager Micky Mellon says <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> has no excuses if Tranmere beat <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>]</b> People get confused and think they’ve got to play on a different pitch. We’ll play on the same pitch. What if it’s windy? What if it’s hailstones? Good players can adapt and adjust to anything, that’s what you expect of them. They know what the outcome has got to be and that’s got to be trying to win a game of football and good players will find a way of doing that on any surface<br /><br />For every football manager, I know how tough it is, regardless of where they are and what their situation is. We have different challenges and it’s tough for everybody</p>
