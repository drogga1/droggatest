  <p><b>[New Aberdeen signing Ryan Christie has deleted his Twitter account after a tweet abusing the Dons was found in his timeline]</b> I am delighted to get a player of Ryan’s quality into the club. We want to make a couple of additions in the January window - quality additions - and there is no doubt Ryan has the quality to come in and make an impact with us. Ryan can help us with the challenges that lie ahead during the second half of the season. I would also like to thank Brendan Rodgers and Celtic for assisting in getting the deal done.</p>

  <p><b>[Aberdeen have given Sunderland permission to open negotiations with Derek McInnes as they look to appoint him manager]</b> The club can confirm that early this afternoon Sunderland agreed to meet all the contractual obligations for both Derek McInnes and Tony Docherty and they have, reluctantly, been granted permission to speak with both of them about the vacant managerial position at Sunderland.</p>

  <p><b>[Derek McInnes has rejected Sunderland after holding talks over the vacant manager’s role]</b> have ambitions in the game and while there was interest from elsewhere, and I did talk to Sunderland, I feel there is so much still to be done here at Aberdeen. While we have lost players from last season, they will be replaced by signings of similar quality and our first challenge is to reach the group stages of the Europa League after coming so close in each of the last three seasons. We have improved season on season and that is not something I’m planning on changing.</p>

  <p><b>[Aberdeen vs Celtic]</b> Celtic’s 60-match unbeaten domestic run is a record that deserves huge credit. It’s not an easy thing to do. Of course, they’ve got the best squad but keeping that squad motivated and focused for each and every game isn’t always an easy thing to do. But, you’re not trying to tell me we can’t win a game against them.</p>

  <p><b>[Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes has attempted to put an end to speculation linking him with the vacant post at Glasglow Rangers]</b> I want to reiterate what the chairman . I speak to him every other day and relationships are key to me. He wanted to put something out, he spoke to me about it and I was happy for him to do that.<br /><br />I have never been one who feels the need to react to speculation and I don’t see how I can pick and choose. I’m getting asked all the time about this job or that job. A month ago I was asked about the Scotland job and I answered one question about it so everyone was happy with that. Nobody has really asked me about West Brom.<br /><br />Nobody is asking the Celtic manager if he’s interested in Everton or any other job that has come up every week but there has been this obsession with the Rangers job. If people want to know about the Rangers job I would suggest they go down to Glasgow and ask them about it, don’t be speaking to me or my players.<br /><br />Has it angered me? Not initially because you can’t control the speculation and, in the past, I have usually answered it and we have moved on. But that doesn’t seem to be good enough so I would reinforce everything the chairman has said. I am very happy here, I have a job I’m focused on here. For me it’s done and dusted now.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United have sent James Wilson on loan to Aberdeen]</b> I am absolutely delighted to secure James on a season long loan as he is a player I feel will very quickly become an important member of the squad for us. He is a real quality player, who I think will suit the way we play, and, having spoken to him, I think he sees this move as a real opportunity for him. There were other clubs interested in taking James but he feels this is the right place for him to continue his development. I’d also like to thank Manchester United for the part they played in making the loan happen.</p>

  <p><b>[Aberdeen vs Celtic]</b> It was an awful performance and a total contrast to how we’ve been on late. We’ve shown resilience, kept plenty clean sheets and restricted the opponents but today we were well beaten all over the pitch and two of the goals we conceded were calamitous.</p>

  <p><b>[Aberdeen vs Rangers]</b> I can only apologise to the supporters for the level of performance. Clearly we expect far more of ourselves. We have to make sure we are competitive all of the time, not just in some games</p>

  <p><b>[Aberdeen should provide stern opposition]</b> We had better chances, more pressure on Rangers’ goal than was on our own. Although they had a lot of possession between centre-backs in their own half, we were very good in terms of them not opening us up and having too many chances. We set out to try and be as attacking as we can, we broke well, looked after the ball in certain areas. I thought we were good value to win the game</p>

  <p><b>[Derek McInnes says <a href="james-maddison.html">James Maddison</a> is more than good enough to play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> I always thought James was the best technician of a ball I’ve seen. I haven’t seen someone who manipulates the ball in the way he can and that potential is really being realised now. James has said that coming to Aberdeen has helped be the making of him because he had to grow up a bit, he had to tough things out and he had to learn how to deal with the demands of playing here. He was developing then and the games up here were tough for him. You can’t say that you watched him and thought he would go from playing with us, back to <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a>, on to <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> and then potentially to a club like <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> so quickly. But you see him now, he has developed so much that I think he could play for any of the big clubs in England. That’s how good he is. The improvement in him over the last two seasons especially has been massive and it shows what can be done</p>
