  <p><b>[New Aberdeen signing Ryan Christie has deleted his Twitter account after a tweet abusing the Dons was found in his timeline]</b> I am delighted to get a player of Ryan’s quality into the club. We want to make a couple of additions in the January window - quality additions - and there is no doubt Ryan has the quality to come in and make an impact with us. Ryan can help us with the challenges that lie ahead during the second half of the season. I would also like to thank Brendan Rodgers and Celtic for assisting in getting the deal done.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United have sent James Wilson on loan to Aberdeen]</b> I am absolutely delighted to secure James on a season long loan as he is a player I feel will very quickly become an important member of the squad for us. He is a real quality player, who I think will suit the way we play, and, having spoken to him, I think he sees this move as a real opportunity for him. There were other clubs interested in taking James but he feels this is the right place for him to continue his development. I’d also like to thank Manchester United for the part they played in making the loan happen.</p>

  <p><b>[Aberdeen vs Celtic]</b> It was an awful performance and a total contrast to how we’ve been on late. We’ve shown resilience, kept plenty clean sheets and restricted the opponents but today we were well beaten all over the pitch and two of the goals we conceded were calamitous.</p>

  <p><b>[Aberdeen vs Rangers]</b> It pleases me no end that despite all these differences, advantages they have in terms of size of squad, money they can throw at the squad, we are still in and around them, trying to compete against them.</p>

  <p><b>[Aberdeen vs Rangers]</b> I can only apologise to the supporters for the level of performance. Clearly we expect far more of ourselves. We have to make sure we are competitive all of the time, not just in some games</p>

  <p><b>[Aberdeen should provide stern opposition]</b> We had better chances, more pressure on Rangers’ goal than was on our own. Although they had a lot of possession between centre-backs in their own half, we were very good in terms of them not opening us up and having too many chances. We set out to try and be as attacking as we can, we broke well, looked after the ball in certain areas. I thought we were good value to win the game</p>

  <p><b>[Derek McInnes says <a href="james-maddison.html">James Maddison</a> is more than good enough to play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> I always thought James was the best technician of a ball I’ve seen. I haven’t seen someone who manipulates the ball in the way he can and that potential is really being realised now. James has said that coming to Aberdeen has helped be the making of him because he had to grow up a bit, he had to tough things out and he had to learn how to deal with the demands of playing here. He was developing then and the games up here were tough for him. You can’t say that you watched him and thought he would go from playing with us, back to <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a>, on to <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> and then potentially to a club like <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> so quickly. But you see him now, he has developed so much that I think he could play for any of the big clubs in England. That’s how good he is. The improvement in him over the last two seasons especially has been massive and it shows what can be done</p>
