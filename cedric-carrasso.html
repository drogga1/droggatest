<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Cedric Carrasso claims he was set to join Arsenal during the summer transfer window, only to see the deal fall through]</b> I accepted Sporting’s offer. Everything was OK, but the deal was thrown off. There was a problem with the agents involved. The same thing for Arsenal. Arsene <b>[Wenger]</b> wanted to operate with three good goalkeepers. I was supposed to go there as third choice.<br /><br />At the beginning, I said to myself: ‘third choice to do nothing, that is not being part of a squad, that is not interesting’, but then I told myself: ‘It is still Arsenal!’. But then again there was a problem with agents.<br /><br />I even visited the training ground of Hearts. I found it great in Edinburgh, apart from the salary. I was ready to cut my salary by half. At the beginning, it was very poor financially. Honestly. Like €4,000 a week</p>
