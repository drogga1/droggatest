  <p><b>[Sheffield United Owner Kevin McCabe Joins Central Coast Mariners Boards]</b> It is exciting to have a businessman of Kevin’s calibre, with a proven dedication and commitment to football, to come on board with the Mariners. We look forward to utilising his immense knowledge on the business of football and his experience in property development. We also look forward keenly to his input with the new Centre of Excellence development at Tuggerah, as Kevin has already been heavily involved in building world class centres in several cities around the world<br /><br /><b>[Today’s announcement follows a long-standing reciprocation between the two clubs which has already seen interaction and fact-finding visits between all levels of the clubs, including executive, coaching, playing staff and administration]</b> The Centre of Excellence project is close to commencement and Kevin’s experience in being involved with these types of projects will be invaluable as we continue our quest to make the development the hub of football excellence in this country<br /><br />The Mariners and <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> have worked incredibly hard to get our partnership to the exciting levels it is at today, and we believe Kevin’s influence has significantly helped our club move forward in many areas of its operation and thinking, buoyed by the Sheffield philosophy of thinking globally and acting locally<br /><br />We feel very much part of the ‘Blades Family’, and welcome Kevin with open arms to our board. We look forward to his involvement with great anticipation and know that his passion and involvement will produce many significant positives and mutual benefits in the future<br /><br /><b>[Only last year, McCabe finalised an agreement to buy Ferencvaros, and to purchase and develop the ground around Stadion Albert Florian. The development of a new all-seater stadium with a capacity of 25,000 has already begun]</b> In the UK, we are known as the ‘family club’, and as such we were immediately drawn to the club that has those same views and ideals in Australia - the Mariners. Their commitment to family and community programs are second to none. I am proud to join the board and look forward to being able to assist the club in realising its long-held dreams</p>
