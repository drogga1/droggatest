<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Meet the man who got Monaco’s Radamel Falcao back to his ‘flying’ best]</b> I started working with Falcao in the first half of 2016. He is a very mentally strong person, extremely determined. That’s why he decided to seek my advice. He had a goal, but physically something was missing.<br /><br />You need to focus on three pillars - the body, the mind and the soul. You need to treat a player to have a very strong knee, but also a strong mind. Then he will be able to play football at the same level and without fear. Playing time is very important to regaining your full fitness back. But you need to be ready to play those important minutes. If not, it can create more frustration and fear. You need to closely monitor all of your levels, both physically and mentally<br /><br />Every program and every rehabilitation I do is different and individualised because every person is different. I develop a tailor-made program for every athlete that I work with. That’s why it is something very personal and I cannot detail it. I do not compare my patients, I respect the individuality of each one<br /><br />I think he is flying and scoring a lot of goals. He is back. We can’t forget that he was without playing time for a long, long time. In my opinion, he is better each day in training and in every game. And I think that more and more will come from him</p>
