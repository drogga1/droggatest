<blockquote>
  <p>[How Deontay Wilder took up boxing to look after his daughter] I played football, basketball, baseball, ran track and if I had had time for soccer, I would have done that as well. I always pictured myself as a goalkeeper. In the end, I couldn’t play soccer because it always interfered with basketball but yeah, I always thought about becoming a goalkeeper.<br /><br />I remember being in the doctor’s office: dim lights, her mother was right beside me and [the doctor was] going over instructions, little things about how to take care of a child with spina bifida and different organizations that help. Then, he gave us option B: We could terminate the pregnancy. Instantly, I looked at her and I looked back at him, and I was like, ‘I can’t do that’. I felt like at this point, she’s developed, we know [she’s a girl]. I felt like, ‘Give her life.’ You never know what she can become<br /><br />I was ignorant to the sport. I thought every fighter that stepped into the sport made a lot of money. I didn’t know there was levels. It’s a process to get to that point. On the street, you get your man, you put a good move on him, he falls… Get on and pound. But when I started boxing, even one minute tortured me. I remember sparring, and I was like Bambi. My legs were shaking like Bambi!<br /><br />I love my children to death and that is why I am building for them. Everything I do is for them. My career, it is for them. I am going to make sure that I get everything I deserve. I am going to make sure I get the best of the best, no matter what, because I want to make sure they have the best of the best. That is why no matter who gets in the ring with Deontay Wilder, they will be in for the fight of their lives</p>
