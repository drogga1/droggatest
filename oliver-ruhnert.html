  <p><b>[Schalke’s academy director, Oliver Ruhnert explains only two years ago, Sane earned roughly £95 a week]</b> In Germany, it is called a ‘mini-job’ for the youth players. You can only earn up to 450 euros a month. At Schalke, he was not a national player for Germany in the Under-16 or Under-17 teams so there was no reason for him to be earning more than that. He developed hugely in the Under 19 team and we changed his deal when he turned 18.<br /><br />But trust me, money has not decided this move. It is not important to Leroy. The family are completely normal. They are not very rich, he’s just a normal boy with a special gift<br /><br />He has a brilliant left foot. This sets him apart. He is special because of his age and his speed. If you stop him between 0 and 50 metres, he’s as fast as the others. But if you do it from 0 to 35 metres with the ball at his feet, I don’t think you will find any other player with the same speed and quality. All the spectators in the arena get off their feet and that is exciting and why you pay to watch football.<br /><br />A young <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> is a good comparison. <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a> could play everywhere on the pitch, he was always moving. Leroy is a little more old-fashioned, like <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a> at the beginning. Leroy is on the wing and he stays on the wing, he likes to have the chalk on his boots.<br /><br />He can also play behind the strikers. It’s a question of age. If you want to play at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> at his age, normally the best way to get in would be to play out wide at the start. After a while, he will play in behind. He is so fast that you can’t stop him<br /><br />There was one situation where he was on the bench with the professionals. The day after, he was pencilled in to play for the Under 19 team. After five minutes, our coach was shouting ‘Leroy, what’s going on? Move! Get going!’<br /><br />He was so lazy that day and our coach could see he had the wrong spirit. So after 10 minutes, he was hauled off. Then, we had a very big discussion. We sat in the meeting room of the academy with his coach and his father and there were strong words. He responded extremely well.<br /><br />Eight weeks later, we won the youth championship in the Under 19 age group. We played on a Saturday in Hamburg and two days later, we played a final against Hoffenheim. He was the best player that day, we won 3-1. Leroy was man of the match. Our biggest aim was to show him it is a team sport and not an individual one. That game was eight to 10 weeks after our discussion and we felt very proud and vindicated</p>
