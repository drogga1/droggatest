I try to give my all in every training session in order to show my qualities in our matches. Obviously I still need to adapt to my new life here in Munich, but it’s getting better every day. I like it here.<br /><br />Life here is something completely new to me and I also have to get used to Bayern’s playing style. That’s not something that happens overnight. And that’s before we talk about how cold it is! But at the end of the day the only thing that matters here is the football, a game that’s the same wherever in the world you play it. I’m doing what I love and I’m happy to be doing that here<br /><br /><b>[James added on Ancelotti’s axing]</b> Nobody likes it when these things happen, but unfortunately that’s the way football is. Those of us who live in this world have to realise that and adapt to it. You always have to be aware that things can change very suddenly.

He has improved over his whole career, which has turned him into a fantastic player.<br /><br /><b>[The Colombia international believes he is improving all the time]</b> Yes, I’m playing well at the moment, which is down to getting more minutes on the pitch. This means that things are coming off; when you play you can put your talents to the test, and everything is easier, particularly when you’re playing alongside great players like the ones at Bayern. I’m enjoying myself and just want to help my team win<br /><br />I don’t think there are any easy rivals left in the Champions League. It’s tough whoever you play, particularly in the last 16 because you have to be on the top of your game. Having said that, going back to the Bernabuu would be special</p>

I was always eager, and everyone could see that when I was doing things well, I could make a difference. All the people who were close to me offered great support, such as my ex-wife, mother … they all supported me a lot and I’m eternally grateful to them. For now, I’m only thinking about Bayern. No-one knows what’ll happen in the future. My present is at Bayern, and it depends exclusively on me if I’m going to leave or stay.<br /><br />I knew I was going to leave the club. That last game <b>[against Sevilla]</b> was like me giving my thanks to everyone. It was very tough. When I got home, I told my four-year-old daughter: ‘Come here, I want to talk to you’. I told her: ‘We’re going to live in another city. You’re going to change schools, we’re not going to live in this house anymore,’ and she cried a lot. That was very hard. It broke my heart. I always arrived in the dressing room with a smile and had good vibes with all my team-mates. I think they loved me like I loved them. With the Real Madrid fans, there was a real bond between us and I think they loved me like I loved them too. The fans always told me: ‘James, stay.’ I felt a lot of affection for them. I love the Madrid fans very much because they, like me, always want to win.</p>

  <p><b>[James Rodriguez admits his Bayern Munich side must overcome a goal machine in Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> He’s a goal machine and has proven that time and time again. He is always there when needed, which is clear in his numbers. We hope to have a good day and deliver a top team performance to make sure he does not have his best day. You have to be careful with him, but also with the other Madrid players. Real Madrid are not just about Ronaldo, they also have strong players in other positions. It will not be easy, that’s for sure.<br /><br />That’s Real, they want to win every game and they try that until the very last second. Nobody expected Juve to go 3-0 up, but in the end Real tried until the end and got the reward for their efforts in the penalty kick. If you try to the end, you will be rewarded for it. They always use a different style in the Champions League than they do in La Liga and manage to get the best out of themselves. They know what it takes to fight for this trophy year after year, after all, they have made history in the European Cup and the Champions League. But Bayern don’t have to hide. History has shown that Bayern knows how to tackle games against Real Madrid. I don’t think we should see the two games against Real as revenge for last year, but simply as two more games on the way to the final. The games between these two teams are almost always unique, but we players have to focus on what’s really important: to be able to stand up to a team like Real Madrid, we need to be in top form physically and in our game</p>

  <p><b>[James Rodriguez told why he should cross Madrid divide to join <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a> at Atletico]</b> James is a great player who has had a difficult time, what they say about him, what they speculate is something that is not very positive, but talent is always there. If he goes and he is with a coach who confides in him, who trusts him, he will be able to act normally. He has been around for many years and knows what is at stake. If he appreciates the opportunity he has, or continues on his way, he is still young enough to continue unlocking all the potential he has. I’d like to see him at that club <b>[Atetico]</b>. Apart from what they are as a team, he would be with a demanding and winning coach who could further enhance the characteristics that James has. He has been in Europe for many years and joining Atletico would be important . What he needs is to play, to have confidence again, to quieten so many things that are said about him off the field and dedicate himself only to playing. If you have the support of a coach, of a club that opens doors for you, that gives you the opportunity to play, which is what you need. A player without competition is not the same. If this happens and he takes advantage of that opportunity, it could be very important for him.</p>

A lot of things have been said about me and almost all of them are lies. What most annoys me is that my professionalism has been put in doubt, and I can’t accept that.

  <p><b>[James Rodriguez wanted to join <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> but was denied the opportunity to by <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, the Colombia international’s stepfather Juan Carlos Restrepo has said]</b> James would have preferred to go to Atlético Madrid in case of a transfer. This does not mean that there were no attempts and appreciations from other clubs as well. He feels comfortable in Spain, on a personal level, and was not convinced to change countries. It may be that the friendly summer game played a role. But in the end, Real, who wants to dominate in Spain and the world, still considers the player to be important to his team and decided not to sell him. This was the official position<br /><br />I don’t think James has closed the negotiations with <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, an important club with great prospects. In my opinion, as James’ adoptive father, I think the point was that in order for someone like him to be transferred, you have to agree in many places and in many ways<br /><br />Whatever the club of his future, we hope the pieces of the puzzle will come together as they did not last year. If it’s a big club like <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, great. There must be a solution that satisfies everything on a human level, and on a technical project, and obviously on the economic issue</p>

My manager has a great relationship with the club, and his name is <a href="jorge-mendes.html">Jorge Mendes</a>. Well, we always dream of getting in a big club.

So I got this offer from this club and I haven’t been allowed to leave due to several issues. So basically I’m here this year because of the circumstances, not because I wanted to be, because I knew that I wouldn’t be able to play much. But here I’m learning every day and hopefully in the future I will be able to play more. I know that I have the talent and I believe in my daily work</p>
