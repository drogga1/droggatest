  <p><b>[James Rodriguez told why he should cross Madrid divide to join <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a> at Atletico]</b> James is a great player who has had a difficult time, what they say about him, what they speculate is something that is not very positive, but talent is always there. If he goes and he is with a coach who confides in him, who trusts him, he will be able to act normally. He has been around for many years and knows what is at stake. If he appreciates the opportunity he has, or continues on his way, he is still young enough to continue unlocking all the potential he has. I’d like to see him at that club <b>[Atetico]</b>. Apart from what they are as a team, he would be with a demanding and winning coach who could further enhance the characteristics that James has. He has been in Europe for many years and joining Atletico would be important . What he needs is to play, to have confidence again, to quieten so many things that are said about him off the field and dedicate himself only to playing. If you have the support of a coach, of a club that opens doors for you, that gives you the opportunity to play, which is what you need. A player without competition is not the same. If this happens and he takes advantage of that opportunity, it could be very important for him.</p>

  <p><b>[James Rodriguez also dropped subtle transfer hints by insisting his next move will be to a team that will allow him to show his abilities]</b> It’s always uncomfortable to listen to the many lies that are said about someone, what’s important is the opinion of my family and those who know me. Anyway, it’s something that doesn’t affect me because I know what’s true and I work hard every day to be where I am. Those who surround me are always happy with what I have to offer. A lot of things have been said about me and almost all of them are lies. What most annoys me is that my professionalism has been put in doubt, and I can’t accept that. I am very professional, that’s why I got where I am now. It’s reassuring that the people that are by my side and worked with me know what I’m talking about. I take care of myself like nobody else. I train a lot in my day to day. I always want to improve.<br /><br /><b>[Rodriguez could stay at Real beyond the summer, adding perceived differences with <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> are pure speculation]</b> There never was any problem <b>[with Zidane]</b>. Every manager has a different taste. We have a normal working relationship. In the future, you never know what’s going to happen, but if they let me choose, I would pick a club where I could show my abilities and my conditions.<br /><br /><b>[He also added that any footballer who feels his efforts in training are not being rewarded would also find it difficult and feel underused]</b> In this moment in time I am not in a protagonist role. I am training and working for when I will have to, I will do it well. I am also thinking about the future, and that I will have to perform at my maximum level wherever I will be. I am happy with what I’m doing, my work and my talent cannot stop me from dreaming. I’ll be honest: I always want to play, I am competitive. <br /><br />At Madrid there are players of incredible quality and I know that with my talent and some consistency I could help the team in so many ways. But I understand that <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> has his basis. He won important things with players that he trusts. It’s also complicated when your manager doesn’t give you minutes consistently, it gets tough</p>

  <p><b>[James Rodriguez wanted to join <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> but was denied the opportunity to by <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, the Colombia international’s stepfather Juan Carlos Restrepo has said]</b> James would have preferred to go to Atlético Madrid in case of a transfer. This does not mean that there were no attempts and appreciations from other clubs as well. He feels comfortable in Spain, on a personal level, and was not convinced to change countries. It may be that the friendly summer game played a role. But in the end, Real, who wants to dominate in Spain and the world, still considers the player to be important to his team and decided not to sell him. This was the official position<br /><br />I don’t think James has closed the negotiations with <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, an important club with great prospects. In my opinion, as James’ adoptive father, I think the point was that in order for someone like him to be transferred, you have to agree in many places and in many ways<br /><br />Whatever the club of his future, we hope the pieces of the puzzle will come together as they did not last year. If it’s a big club like <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, great. There must be a solution that satisfies everything on a human level, and on a technical project, and obviously on the economic issue</p>

My manager has a great relationship with the club, and his name is <a href="jorge-mendes.html">Jorge Mendes</a>. Well, we always dream of getting in a big club.

I thought that I had to play for a club that wasn’t so big. From there I went to France, just before the World Cup. My plan was to go to the World Cup, have great participation there, score goals, reach a good level and from there play for a big club. Then the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> thing happened<br /><br /><b>[He admits that he had been hoping to secure a permanent move away from the Blancos on the back of two years in Germany]</b> I stayed this year because … Let me tell you what happened. Last summer I got a really good offer from a club, I don’t want to say the name, but I could go there because I knew that I wouldn’t play much here. I knew it. So I got this offer from this club and I haven’t been allowed to leave due to several issues. So basically I’m here this year because of the circumstances, not because I wanted to be, because I knew that I wouldn’t be able to play much. But here I’m learning every day and hopefully in the future I will be able to play more. I know that I have the talent and I believe in my daily work</p>
