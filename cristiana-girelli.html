  <p><b>[Australia vs Brazil vs Italy: The engrossing three-way fight for Group C supremacy]</b> The media attention we’re getting is invaluable for the growth of women’s football in Italy. We are here trying to win but we are also here to send a strong message to society back home, that there is still so much to do. We are here to be role models to little girls who are starting to play football and who could one day experience games like we’ve just had against Australia and Jamaica.</p>
