<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Germany &amp; Hamburg legend Uwe Seeler turns 75]</b> When I was at Hamburg, I earned only a fraction of what I could have received in Milan. But who knows if I would have been happier? In hindsight, I think I made the right decision. Seeing as I managed to feature in four World Cups, I would have also liked to have taken the title, but I was not lucky enough. Nevertheless, everything was beautiful. I do not regret anything</p>
