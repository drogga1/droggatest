Three or four players are out of contract and others are coming quite close to running their contracts down next year.

They both got 15 goals last season which is not the end of the world. You have to find a different way. As a coach sometimes you can’t say ‘oh we don’t have a striker’ and throw the towel in. If you said to Jose beforehand: ‘Would you take a 0-0?’ he would have taken your arms off. It’s not about that, it’s a London derby! It’s for all of those fans, you need to show more of an attacking intent</p>

They were looking to offload <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>, perhaps because he’d been out on a few loans. I viewed it as a development process, a games programme which was better than the one he was being offered in Under-21 football, I thought it was the best thing for him. And there were a lot of people around the club at the time maybe suggesting that he wasn’t going to be a player of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> quality. Character, mindset, mentality is huge. People talk to me about ability and I always believe if your ability is there but your mindset and your character is <b>[more]</b>, then you’ve got a chance. If it’s the other way around, if your mind and mentality is there and your ability is <b>[higher]</b>, you won’t make it. If you can marry the two up, I think that’s what Harry had to his advantage. Every single day coming to training and wanting to improve himself and I knew he had the capabilities. Physically he was growing, he was getting stronger, he was getting fitter, he was still a boy when I gave him the opportunity to play. So he came in at the right time.</p>
