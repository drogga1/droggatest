  <p><b>[How can England get the best out of Harry Kane?]</b> <b>[Kane]</b> deserves all the praise he’s getting because he’s worked for it but I can tell you for a fact he will be the same person next year, whether he is on £1-a-week or £100,000-a-week. Kane is the best player to come out of the academy technically <b>[since Ledley King]</b>. He scored every week in the youth teams and worked so hard on his finishing. 	I’m delighted the fans have taken the academy lads on. They have always wanted flashy signings but it has such a positive impact when the fans take them to their hearts.</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho has been urged by Tim Sherwood to stop complaining about Manchester United’s transfer policies]</b> Most managers don’t spend the amount of money in a lifetime that he has in the last two seasons. He’s been very fortunate to have been given the funds at one of the biggest clubs in the world, so I can’t understand why any manager, with that backing, is ever disgruntled. I think Jose needs to get in front of the camera in a press conference and send a message to the players saying, ‘This is what we’ve got, I believe in you and we will push Man City a lot closer this season’. As a manager, when you sit in front of the media, you are not only talking to your fans and players, you are also talking to the board and I think he’s got to stop talking to the board now. There’s nothing you can do now, the window is closed, he has to carry on, knuckle down and get the best results for his club. He needs to send out a positive vibe. He’s got <b>[Victor]</b> Lindelof, <b>[Eric]</b> Bailly, <b>[Chris]</b> Smalling or <b>[Phil]</b> Jones, they are all international footballers and they are now thinking that they aren’t really wanted there. The manager tried to sign a centre-back, wasn’t allowed to do it. Now is the time to knuckle down and get on with it and start sending a positive message about the whole club.</p>

  <p><b>[Tim Sherwood says that Jose Mourinho has been picking fights with the wrong people]</b> I think sometimes you can create your own fires. You have enough problems putting them out, but if you’re creating them yourself and then putting them out, and I think at times he picks fights with the wrong people. You can’t pick fights at Manchester United. It’s an institution, that football club, that’s bigger than any individual, so why should you pick a fight with them? What are you trying to do? Turn the fans against the board and take the pressure off yourself? Jose knows it has not been good enough. He’s a winner. He’s a serial winner. He wins everywhere he goes. Sarri said it in his interview. He needs great respect for that. But what’s happened in the past is in the past and he needs to start winning things now. He needs to win the Premier League at a club of Manchester United’s stature</p>

  <p><b>[Mauricio Pochettino has been urged to end rumours linking him with Manchester United]</b> I’m sure he will come out and he’ll toe the line by saying he’s concentrating fully on Tottenham, and that’s it. But that won’t satisfy everyone and the questions will continue. It’s a tough one for him. For me, he’s building something at Tottenham and he’s done brilliantly since he’s been with the club, but he’s half way through the project and I think he needs to continue and stay there. He’s still mid-40s so he’s always got time to go to a big giant. Only he will know.</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham’s chances of finishing in the top four this season could completely disappear if they lose to Arsenal]</b> It’s always a massive game, but this time when you look at where both teams are positioned in the league, it doesn’t get much bigger than this. Realistically did we think they <b>[Tottenham]</b> were title contenders? To be honest, I thought they were with the squad they’ve got, but I had Liverpool and Manchester City above them as favourites so you can’t really complain if they fell out of the top-two. But to finish outside of the top four would be a very disappointing season, so it’s in the balance. It’s in their hands. This is a huge game. Winning the north London derby almost puts everything back on track and they’ve still got to go to man city and Liverpool, so there are so very tough fixtures coming up for Tottenham. I believe they will stay there, but I think they have to win tomorrow to be able to do that.</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham are capable of beating anybody on their day]</b> On their day, we know Tottenham can beat anyone. They are going to need to have their day. Manchester City, for me, are the best team in Europe at the moment. If they are on song and they get everything going their way, they will win the game and the tie and go through to the semi-final. Tottenham have to believe, and I think they will. In their new stadium, they have got three points there in the league and got that out of the way. The fans will be up for it. It’s a massive occasion, one of the biggest games in the recent history of Tottenham. I give them a chance, but it’s an outside chance</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Eriksen would find it ‘very difficult’ to reject a move to Real Madrid]</b> I would love to see Eriksen sign a new contract and commit his future to Tottenham, but I’m not sure that he will. I think we might see Eriksen in a Real Madrid shirt next season. Real Madrid are always just a phone call away from signing most players in the world because when that phone rings, it is very difficult to turn down Real Madrid. I think Real Madrid will be looking for Eriksen to replace (Luka) Modric in the heart of their midfield. Eriksen is good enough to play in any team in the world and he can play in a number of positions too, he’s that good. Modric was a great player when he was at Tottenham, but he has gone on to achieve unbelievable things that he probably wasn’t capable of in the Premier League. You surround Eriksen with world-class players in a non-competitive league where his team has the vast majority of the possession and it is scary to think what he could do with a football. Quality technicians like Eriksen and Modric will always shine and the cream always comes to the top<br /><br /><b>[Sherwood believes that Jack Grealish would be an ideal replacement]</b> I would like to see Tottenham sign Jack Grealish this summer. I think Grealish is worth the £30-40 million that <b>[Ryan]</b> Sessegnon was rumoured to be worth last year. I’ve worked with Jack and I know how good he is and what he is capable of if he were to take a step up and play alongside great players at Tottenham. I think Grealish will be an England international the moment he pulls on a Tottenham shirt. Grealish is good enough to be in the England squad and playing for his country already, but it doesn’t seem to work like that playing in the Championship. If Eriksen were to leave this summer, I think Tottenham should consider looking at Grealish as his replacement. Eriksen is obviously ahead of him in his development so far, but Grealish shares that work ethic and desire to improve that I think he will reach Eriksen’s level<br /><br />I think Tottenham should forget about signing Ryan Sessegnon and probably thank their lucky stars they didn’t spend a fortune on him last summer.</p>

  <p><b>[Mauricio Pochettino is just one game away from guiding Tottenham to the club’s first ever Champions League title]</b> There was a lot of speculation that Pochettino might leave Tottenham for a Manchester United or Real Madrid so the fans are probably relieved to see <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> and Zidane in those seats now. Tottenham will never be able to breathe easy with Pochettino because he will continue to be a target for big clubs who are capable of taking him away. Manchester United decided to go down the <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> route but that’s not a guarantee Pochettino won’t be in their dugout in the near future. If Manchester United decide they’ve made a mistake, Tottenham are back to square one sweating over Pochettino’s future. That’s the stranglehold that a Manchester United can have on you as one of the biggest clubs in the world. If they identify someone as their new manager, they will get who they want.<br /><br />I think Pochettino has done a good job at Tottenham, there can’t be a doubt about that. The Premier League is the bread and butter year in, year out but he knows the pressure is mounting to pick up silverware and get that monkey off his back. Pochettino will be disappointed that he hasn’t yet been able to win a trophy with the squad of players he has at Tottenham. It’s difficult because he is competing against teams with far greater resources</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale is more likely to move to China in the summer than return to the Premier League]</b> I see that Gareth Bale is having a tough time at Real Madrid and Zidane has potentially given the green light for him to leave the club. I don’t think Bale wants to leave and he will be on a big contract so Real Madrid will have to subsidise him. I can’t see Gareth Bale returning to Tottenham because I just don’t think the financials would work. It would be a very romantic return, but it would be a huge fee combined with a massive wage bill not dissimilar to Sanchez joining Manchester United. Where Bale ends up next depends entirely on his motivations. I actually think Gareth Bale is more likely to move to China this summer than the Premier League. If he is looking to maintain his Real Madrid salary and lifestyle, I think Bale will move to China<br /><br />I think it is unlikely we will see Alderweireld in a Tottenham shirt next season. Alderweireld is reaching the stage in his career where he only has one big move left and he is looking for that super pay day. Tottenham will not offer him the pay day he wants but they have reached the latter stages of the Champions League and EFL Cup this season so we will now find out what really motivates him. Alderweireld will not be a Tottenham player if he is motivated by money</p>

  <p><b>[Tim Sherwood says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> failed to show any attacking intent during their defeat at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> were absolutely disgusting. They were so bad. The negative approach. Yes, they have injuries to Son and to Kane, <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> keeps reminding us of that. But they’ve got <a href="steven-bergwijn.html">Bergwijn</a> there who can run in behind, they’ve got <a href="lucas-moura.html">Moura</a> who has pace. If they’ve got anything they’ve got pace. They both got 15 goals last season which is not the end of the world. You have to find a different way. As a coach sometimes you can’t say ‘oh we don’t have a striker’ and throw the towel in. If you said to Jose beforehand: ‘Would you take a 0-0?’ he would have taken your arms off. It’s not about that, it’s a London derby! It’s for all of those fans, you need to show more of an attacking intent</p>

  <p><b>[Former boss Tim Sherwood says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> ace <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> will make a decision on his future very soon]</b> It’s like <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a>. He finishes fourth with <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> (in 1992-93), then second (in 1993-94). <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are all over him. But he decides to stay, because he believes we have the quality to win it, and we did the next season. Harry needs to assess this himself. I would wait to see what they do in the summer. They’ve got a manager who has not gone there to only finish inside the top four. Harry will know very soon if the club are willing to spend that money to give themselves that opportunity of winning the league.</p>

  <p><b>[Tim Sherwood says <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> could end up at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> but is unlikely to leave <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> for <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> rivals <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> I can’t see <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> leaving <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and going to any other club in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Not even <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. That’s just my opinion. I think he’d go to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> - I can see him there, yes, if things don’t turn around at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. He wants to stay at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> for the rest of his career, that’s for sure. But in the end he wants to win stuff.<br /><br />I don’t think <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> would be at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> if I wasn’t there as manager. They were looking to offload <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>, perhaps because he’d been out on a few loans. I viewed it as a development process, a games programme which was better than the one he was being offered in Under-21 football, I thought it was the best thing for him. And there were a lot of people around the club at the time maybe suggesting that he wasn’t going to be a player of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> quality. Character, mindset, mentality is huge. People talk to me about ability and I always believe if your ability is there but your mindset and your character is <b>[more]</b>, then you’ve got a chance. If it’s the other way around, if your mind and mentality is there and your ability is <b>[higher]</b>, you won’t make it. If you can marry the two up, I think that’s what Harry had to his advantage. Every single day coming to training and wanting to improve himself and I knew he had the capabilities. Physically he was growing, he was getting stronger, he was getting fitter, he was still a boy when I gave him the opportunity to play. So he came in at the right time.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> could still sneak back into the Champions League if <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s two-season ban from the competition is held up, but United are currently sitting in the coveted fifth spot]</b> The form going into the break counts for nothing. It’s a fresh season. They’ve had a mini pre-season there. They’ve got nine games to finish in their objective, which is in the Champions League. <b>[Paul]</b> <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> is back as well and that will be a massive plus; <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, <b>[Bruno]</b> Fernandes and <b>[Scott]</b> <a href="scott-mctominay.html">McTominay</a> in that midfield is quite formidable in my opinion. <br /><br />If I’m <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> and I’m looking at the teams below me, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are the major threat.

I hope they stay up; they are a big club and I want to see them in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, but there are a lot of other teams fighting for their lives down there as well. They are so reliant <b>[on <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a>]</b>. I don’t know any team, for a very long time, who are so reliant on one player. <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> is <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> at the moment.
