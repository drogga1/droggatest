  <p><b>[Juventus and Napoli have both enquired about Genoa goalkeeper Mattia Perin]</b> In the last league meeting in Rome, Juventus director Giuseppe Marotta stopped me and said we have to talk about Mattia. I’m waiting for a phone call to sit down at a table. Juventus, among others, must hurry because Napoli want him too and soon the negotiations could start.</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Krzysztof Piatek?]</b> I went for him after I watched a couple of videos of him. I saw him in a couple of clips and the day after I did, I finalised a deal for him, fearing someone else would take him. I paid €4.5m for him but you’ll see how much he’ll be worth in a couple of years</p>

  <p><b>[On Krzysztof Piatek]</b> We are already full of phone calls for him, I’m sure that <b>[a top club]</b> will take him away from us. I will decide the price, but a lot of Italian and top European clubs are interested in our player</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> will allow Cristian Romero to spend the 2019-20 campaign on loan at Genoa despite investing €30 million in securing his services]</b> You all know that there is a negotiation in progress - <b>[Romero]</b> will go to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. The sale of <a href="krzysztof-piatek.html">Piatek</a> and that of Romero will definitely put the club’s accounts in order. The sale of <a href="krzysztof-piatek.html">Piatek</a>, from a corporate point of view, was a very good move. Genoa’s finances are very healthy. We will have no debt to the treasury within this year</p>

  <p><b>[Whether Motta, though, has enough experience to get Genoa out of their present predicament is now the subject of much debate in Italy]</b> <a href="thiago-motta.html">Thiago Motta</a> will sit on the bench without any problems; Roberto Murgita won’t be his ‘tutor’ - but there is still some confusion as to where the new boss will be seated for Saturday’s crucial clash with fellow strugglers Brescia<br /><br />He has clear ideas and great qualities. I’m sure that he will surprise everyone. He has the same grit he had when he was a player. He’s someone who has 13 balls! He knows Genoa well and he knows what has to be done to relaunch this team.<br /><br /><b>[But irrespective of how many balls Motta has, will he really be so bold as to attempt to relaunch Genoa with a 2-7-2 formation?]</b> Everyone can interpret the system the way they want. I have only tried to take away the importance of numbers. I dream so many things, but this isn’t the time to dream</p>
