<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Sky Sports News reporter Rob Dorsett was logged into <a href="dean-smith.html">Dean Smith</a>’s conference]</b> Having not seen <a href="dean-smith.html">Dean Smith</a> for three months, it was strange to see him for the first time in this environment - especially with the virtual <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> background that the club tried to use, to keep their sponsors happy and give it a more ‘normal’ press conference feel<br /><br />After some discussion about the strobing and parts of Smith’s head disappearing into the virtual ether, the decision was taken to go with the actual background in Smith’s office, with an elaborate club-coloured stained-glass window in the background. Smith’s Director of Communications, Tommy Jordan, joined the Zoom call from a service station near Dumfries, as he lives in Scotland, but was on his way to <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> to undergo his second Coronavirus test, in preparation for Wednesday’s game.<br /><br />And so, after a quick change of outfit for Smith into club-sponsored attire, we were ready to go. From here on in, it was quite smooth sailing - Jordan had arranged for each broadcaster to ask questions in turn, and mute their microphones when not speaking, so there was no talking over each other<br /><br />I went first, as is traditional for Sky Sports News, followed by PLP, the BBC and ITV. Smith, always affable and forthcoming - spoke openly and engagingly about Wednesday’s game against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, the different nature of Villa’s preparations for it, and the unusual emotions for him and the players surrounding such a crucial match, in such unusual circumstances</p>
