  <p><b>[Former Celtic boss Ronny Deila says Kieran Tierney has been billed as better than Virgil van Dijk]</b> Kieran would be really, really good at Arsenal - I know it. He needs to improve a little bit technically, still. But at the same time he has everything else already and will learn the rest. I think Kieran has an even better mentality than Virgil. That’s what I saw at that time. Virgil, of course, has gone on to a different level since leaving Celtic, but at the time I worked with them both Kieran was even better. They both had the physical attributes to play at the highest level. Virgil had everything. But Tierney has the same</p>

  <p><b>[Former Celtic boss Ronny Deila named New York City coach on three-year deal]</b> When the opportunity came up to join New York City FC as their new head coach, it was a dream come true for me to manage an amazing club in a great city. I’m ready to see our supporters and hopefully we’ll have a wonderful relationship. I’m going to do everything I can to play good football the City way and I’ll give everything from myself to the club and I’m sure we’re going to achieve fantastic things in the future</p>

  <p><b>[Former Hoops boos Ronny Deila reveals that his transfer advice fell on deaf ears]</b> Did I get in touch with City? Yes. I said you have to take him. They said, ‘okay, tell me the best European game he has played and we will watch it’. I couldn’t tell them what game that was because he hadn’t had any real good European games. He was really dominant in Scotland but he got sent off against Inter away. That was a big test. I think if he had played fantastically in that game, he would have been bought. I think the big clubs think Scottish football is too low level and they don’t want to take a chance on a player for that kind of money. In Europe, then you can show how good you are. I think <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">van Dijk</a> was good, but he didn’t have that one really, really good game in Europe</p>
