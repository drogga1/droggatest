It won’t be easy to keep him at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. We hope he plays one or two seasons longer but we all know very, very big clubs with a lot of money want to have him in their team. He should know <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> is an excellent place for young players to play consistently and to develop on a very, very high level<br /><br />Our aims before the season were very, very high. We announced we wanted to win the league this year. The season so far hasn’t gone that well, but we are not that far away from the top, so we are hoping we can fulfil our aims and take the top of the league<br /><br /><b>[Dortmund’s poor form has put <a href="lucien-favre.html">Lucien Favre</a>’s position in the spotlight, but Heinrich backed the Swiss coach to turn things around]</b> No question about that, Lucien is a fantastic coach. We have a great amount of young players and have to show patience with that and trust in our young players and especially our coach</p>

  <p><b>[Jorg Heinrich recently backed <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> for big things and admitted the club will struggle to hold on to him for the foreseeable future]</b> Jadon can become one of the best players in Europe, or even the world.

  <p><b>[Jorg Heinrich says <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> needs to resist the lure of the likes of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to continue his development at Borussia Dortmund]</b> The club is ambitious to keep its players but it also realises that Jadon might move on in the future. He is the biggest talent in the world right now but it’s important that he stays at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> to continue his development, because here he can play in the Champions League<br /><br /><b>[Heinrich says the minutes he has got at Dortmund]</b> The game time he has received at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> since moving from <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> has helped him to this stage. The squad has played to his strengths as a wide attacker. Right now he is going through a little hurdle with his form because he is getting a lot of games at 19 years old - and he is getting more attention from the opposition</p>

  <p><b>[Borussia Dortmund planning legends game in Sydney]</b> There was many talented kids at the training session - not just from Marconi either. The greatest reward from these events is the positive emotion shown from the kids. You seem them having fun with big smiles on their faces. Not only is the partnership great for finding talents but it’s also important for sharing coaching knowledge</p>

  <p><b>[Jorg Heinrich says that American midfielder <a href="giovanni-reyna.html">Giovanni Reyna</a> is a fantastic talent that could someday be even better than Christian Pulisic]</b> Gio is a fantastic talent. I think we are being a little bit cautious about his development. We don’t want to get him on the pitch regularly until he is definitely ready. He has loads of potential along with plenty of confidence. I think his talent is similar to <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a>, or maybe a little bit better. But we want to keep him grounded because we’ve seen what happens to a lot of the young players</p>
