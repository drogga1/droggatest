How can you get a team to have the ball permanently, so that the opponent is running after it for the whole match? From then on, I started to make sense of what I had felt throughout life, through my career. I started to really watch football. To analyse it.

  <p><b>[Quique Setien has been surprised by the willingness of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s players to accept fresh ideas during his wonderful first week in charge of the club]</b> The week has gone very well, much better than I expected. When you come to a new team there’s always uncertainty about how they’re going to respond. There’s always that stimulus and you can see they’re very keen. I’ve been very surprised by the attitude of the players, how accepting they’ve been of new ideas. I’m happy with everything: the work, the capacity the players have to understand everything you tell them. It has been wonderful. Marvellous<br /><br />There’s no doubt we like players to play orderly systematic football. We like them to get back into position when they lose it. We need a balance, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> needs a structure to attack and also to defend. I hope it won’t be an over-excited <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> but a motivated one that wants to put into practice what we’ve worked on. I think you will notice the changes - I hope so - but please remember it’s not going to happen overnight.<br /><br />If a player is receptive and really wants to learn and improve, you might be surprised what they are capable of doing. Every player has what they have but some outperform themselves. It’s about learning and expanding your abilities and becoming even better still. Sometimes players aren’t playing where they feel or play best, but they must put their all into what’s best for the team</p>

I am not going to lie, this is clear. We have to stress a lot the things that we give high importance to. In theory, this shouldn’t take us long. But in general I already know that lots of people only care about results. Those will only care to win, not how we play. This is like this in today’s football and its fine to me. I believe that the way <b>[you play]</b> should be valued too, how you get to the victory or how you lose.

As I always say and repeat, I always expect the best version of our rivals. <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> is a great team, without doubt, with very good footballers. They will make things difficult for us and it will be truly a match of great level. Our capacity to harm them might be bigger because they are a team with capacity to attack.

Some are already training with the first team and we’re getting a chance to look at them. I’m sure they will help us out when we need them. You could think the team is weaker, but you never know that. Sometimes things can turn out differently. You can guess what might happen but I wouldn’t waste your energy<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he prefers operating with a smaller squad]</b> What hurts me, and always had done, is picking teams and having to leave players out. I like to have fewer players. That way, everyone is plugged into what you’re doing. There is a risk attached to that sometimes but it’s good to have a smaller squad. People have more chance of playing; they’re ready and more motivated. Having 18 real players is better than having 25 or 26 not playing. That can cause more danger than having a smaller squad<br /><br />If I was one of the opponents, I wouldn’t count <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> out. Yes, you can always have a bad day.

He’s a complete player because he gives us a lot of things when we have the ball, but he’s also physical and covers a lot of space. He’s young, he has dynamism, enthusiasm and quality. He’s learning many things we’ve been trying to improve. It’s true that he’s an important loss and he could help us a lot.

It’s true he’s better but he was injured for a while and he hasn’t been at the level of others. He’s much better now and has his chances to play, like everyone else.</p>

  <p><b>[Quique Setien says he has not been told Arthur will be leaving <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>]</b> This that is happening is absolutely abnormal. In principle I still have Arthur. He is important like the rest. He will train and he will travel and has the possibility of playing. I hope all this noise does not affect him and that if he plays, he tries to give the best of himself. Any player who is in such a situation must make it clear the season is not over, win a title and leave a good impression until the last day he is here. I do not take it for granted that he is going to leave. The club has not informed me Arthur is leaving. He will be with us until the last game of the season. If it happens, I will try to convince him to leave a good impression. The most important thing is to be honest until the last day and I am convinced he is<br /><br />Since he has been with me, he has put a lot of interest in doing what we asked him to do. Maybe he lacked a little continuity. It is not easy to change things in a footballer that other coaches told him were very good. When they tell him it is very good to keep the ball and we come and we want to play two touches, it is difficult. Yes, it’s possible he lacked some physicality, but he is on the right track</p>
