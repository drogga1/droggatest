  <p><b>[Pinching herself at Wembley &amp; starting vs the USWNT: Behind Lauren Hemp’s incredible rise]</b> There’s not many other games you want to make your first start for. It was just a massive occasion for me and I just wanted to showcase what I’m about: show that I’m creative, confident running at players, put balls in the box and try to help the team as much as possible. I think I showed that in those games. I’m just grateful for the opportunities I got at the tournament and I really enjoyed it.<br /><br /><b>[Just a few weeks later, she would join Manchester City]</b> I’m not sure where it started from, but I’ve always wanted to win. When you lose, it’s just draining. No-one likes losing. You’d be lying if you said you did. That feeling of winning and winning on the big stages, like when <b>[Man City]</b> played in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup final, the Conti Cup final as well, it’s just an unbelievable feeling and I want more of them when I’m older. I think being where I am is going to help me get moments like those throughout my career<br /><br /><b>[In Manchester, Hemp is surrounded by winners and players who will only help her improve]</b> It was pretty daunting for me. Walking into that changing room for the first time, I was like, ‘Wow, this is really what it is like to be in this position!’<br /><br /><b>[She recalls pinching herself after scoring on her Bristol debut at 16]</b> There are still just mad moments where I sit there and think, ‘Is this really happening?’. I just look around and, ‘Wow!’ How far I’ve come in the last year, and the last few years really <b>[…]</b> it’s all gone quite quickly</p>
