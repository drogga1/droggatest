  <p><b>[Neto speaks in a heartfelt reflection]</b> When I kicked a football again for the first time since the crash, I felt like a child again. I was supposed to die that day. I said my last words out loud. God gave me a second chance, and I will do my best to honour him, and to honour all my friends who are gone</p>

  <p><b>[Fellow countryman Neto says Neymar is an incredible talent]</b> I’ve already shared a dressing room with him. I’m asked about it a lot of times because I’m Brazilian but I don’t think my opinion would change anything. He’s an incredible player. I don’t need to explain his characteristics because the whole world knows about them. If he ever returns to Barcelona, it would be a pleasure to share a room with him.<br /><br /><b>[Neto has been acquired to challenge Marc-Andre ter Stegen for goalkeeping duties]</b> On a personal level, he’s a professional of the highest level. He’s a great goalkeeper and like every spot in the Barca team, it’s well covered. Having teammates of the highest level automatically makes you improve, grow and learn. This first month has been fantastic<br /><br /><b>[He said on his switch to the Liga champions]</b> It’s a dream for any footballer. When you talk about Barcelona, ever player at the highest level wishes to play for a team like this one. It’s very different. It means your hard work has paid off when your club can compete for every trophy available. For me, as someone who likes to always win, to compete at the highest level is the best</p>
