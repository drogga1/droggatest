  <p>[Former Manchester United star Rooney completes DC United move] This is a seminal moment for our fans and organization. Wayne is a global soccer icon and his presence at D.C. United will elevate our product on the pitch and soccer as a whole in our city and in this country. Wayne has thrived when competing at the most elite levels of soccer and we’re thrilled to have his leadership as we enter this new era at Audi Field.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[There were plenty of doubts about DC United’s signing of Wayne Rooney in July] Rooney] said, ‘No, I don’t want it, I want to fit in. What’s the right number for me? You guys let me know. It’s all been that way with him. If you’re going to be part of the team, you have to be part of the team, all in, and do the same things. I don’t want special treatment. I want to be treated the same as the [other] players. I’m part of this team. It’s not rocket science.<br /><br />I said in the dressing room after the game, tonight wasn’t good enough. We’ve won the game, we’re pleased obviously with the three points, at this stage of the season it’s important, but we need to improve. We need to get better and keep building. We should be more confident<br /><br />Maybe my leadership wasn’t enough in a lot of ways, and we needed somebody, earlier, on the field who could take the reins. I think Wayne has really helped in that department, even if it’s just taking a little bit of heat off these guys and a little bit of pressure</p>
