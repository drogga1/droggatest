<blockquote>
  <p>[<a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> doctor Dr. Zafar Iqbal racially abused with his children near <a href="crystal-palace.html">Selhurst Park</a>] Taking my 2 youngest kids to their first ever game at <a href="crystal-palace.html">Selhurst Park</a> and walking a few hundred yards from the stadium a 3 year old shouted to his dad - ‘look daddy there’s some p<em>**</em>’. His dad attempted to scold him. Racism is not just a football problem<br /><br />I didn’t know how to react. I couldn’t tell off the 3 y old kid. Should I have said something to the dad while my 2 young kids were there? Anyway game to prepare for and wonder if the kid and his parents will be in the crowd …<br /><br />[After the game Iqbal posted more messages in which he said he was hurt by his child asking questions about the abuse] The thing that upsets me most is that my 12-year-old daughter came to me to ask if I’d heard it and I didn’t know what to say. Should I have told off the dad? I was just gobsmacked. Again I reiterate that this is not because of football but a society issue. Anyway taking the kids on the pitch<br /><br />[He also echoed <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> star <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> in calling-out “certain” UK media outlets for stoking racial bias, pointing to racism as a societal problem] To make an already unpleasant day worse, I see this. This was nothing to do with @CPFC . This was streets away from the stadium, when I dropped my kids off at a friends, who took them to the game while I worked. This is society and certain media makes this worse @DailyMailUK</p>
