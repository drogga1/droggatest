  <p><b>[Kaveh Solhekol believes Van de Beek would be a perfect fit in the Premier League]</b> If we have a transfer window this year, it would be great to see Van de Beek playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> next season. His <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> contract runs out in two years and they are prepared to sell this summer. Van de Beek is perfectly suited to English football. He can also sit deep and he showcased his talents when he played in England in the Champions League against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> in the past 12 months. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> are the favourites to sign him… and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> have been long-term admirers. Seeing him play alongside <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> would be a dream come true for United fans</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City European ban appeal decision to be announced at 9.30am Monday]</b> <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> will find out at 9.30am on Monday morning if they can play in the Champions League for the next two seasons. <a href="cas.html">The Court of Arbitration for Sport</a> (CAS) will announce its decision after City appealed against a two-year ban imposed by Uefa for serious breaches of its financial fair play rules (FFP). If City’s ban is confirmed, the team who finish fifth in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> - currently <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> - will take their place in the Champions League next season. Whatever happens City will still be able to carry on playing in this season’s competition when it restarts next month. The competition was suspended in March with City well-placed to reach the quarter finals after winning 2-1 at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> in a first leg Round of 16 tie. This is the first time <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> has banned a club from the Champions League for two seasons and CAS has the power to overturn the ban or to reduce it to one season. <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> said last week he was confident the ban would be overturned and repeated his stance in Friday’s press conference. He has already said he will remain as the club’s manager next season even if they are not allowed to play in Europe<br /><br />Missing out on European football would result in a loss of revenue of about £100m a season. Additionally, transfer targets may be reluctant to join a club who are not in Europe and questions would be asked about the futures of some of City’s most valuable players. In February, <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> banned City from Europe for the next two seasons and fined them €30m for ‘serious breaches’ of the FFP rules and for failing to co-operate with the investigation. In an interview with City’s in-house media team, chief executive <a href="ferran-soriano.html">Ferran Soriano</a> said he was ‘disappointed but not surprised’’ by the decision. City were found to have overstated sponsorship revenue and break-even information in accounts submitted to <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> between 2012 and 2016. City’s appeal was heard over three days from 8 June to 10 June via video conference by a panel of three arbitrators - Rui Botica Santos, Ulrich Haas and Andrew McDougall QC<br /><br />City hired a high-profile group of lawyers to represent them at <a href="cas.html">the CAS</a> hearing. Their legal team was led by David Pannick QC of Blackstone Chambers and Paul Harris QC of Monckton Chambers. Lord Pannick successfully represented Gina Miller against the government in September when the Supreme Court decided the Prime Minister <a href="boris-johnson.html">Boris Johnson</a> acted illegally by suspending Parliament.<br /><br /><a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s lawyers included Dr Jan Kleiner, a partner at Bär &amp; Karrer and co-head of the Swiss firm’s sport practice group, and Mark Phillips QC of South Square Chambers. <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> opened an investigation into City following the publication of documents on the Football Leaks website and Der Spiegel in November 2018. The German magazine said City’s owners had tried to get round FFP rules by putting money into the club disguised as sponsorship income. One document appeared to show that Etihad Airways was paying only £8m of a £67m sponsorship agreement.<br /><br />In November last year, CAS rejected an attempt by City to have the case dismissed and the ban overturned on procedural grounds. FFP was introduced by <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> in 2009 to prevent clubs falling into serious financial difficulties by overspending. Clubs are required to operate within their means and meet break-even targets, while dealings have to be transparent. City have been Champions League for nine seasons in a row since they qualified for the competition for the first time in 2011/12. They had previously played in the European Cup in 1968. City were fined £49m by <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> in 2014 for breaking FFP rules. £32m of the fine was suspended. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> said in March last year it was investigating to see if City had broken any of their financial regulations</p>

  <p><b>[It remains to be seen but all clubs’ budgets are likely to have been affected by the coronavirus outbreak]</b> Football is not immune to what’s happening in the world right now. So many major income streams have simply disappeared during the pandemic. In the next transfer window, there will be players who are too big to sell. Every club in the world is trying to make budget cuts and some have players on huge contract no-one else wants to take on. If we do have a transfer window this year, what we are going to see is more loans, more loans with options to buy, more free transfers</p>
