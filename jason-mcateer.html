  <p><b>[Who were <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s ‘Spice Boys’? That is a reputation that McAteer feels was unjustified]</b> The fact is we were a very professional bunch of lads and didn’t deserve the reputation that the nickname gave us. We got it because people saw us as under-achievers who liked to go out. There was a social culture in football at the time. We were doing nothing more than the players at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> or Manchester United</p>

  <p><b>[Jason McAteer claims Losing <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> would be a bigger blow for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> than seeing <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> or <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> ruled out]</b> People have questioned <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s strength in depth and I don’t think it’s quite as strong as <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, but there is cover in key areas. Take one of their star players out of the team and inevitably it has an impact - it would at any club. But Jurgen has been able to tweak things and bring in different players and look where they are.<br /><br />The one player I think is indispensable going forward is <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a>. Forget <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> or <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>, it’s <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> who makes the whole thing tick going forward. I think if <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> lost <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> it would have a bigger impact than losing Mane or <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>. Look at the Super Cup against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> where <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> produced two completely different halves of football, the first without <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> and the second with him. He’s a more important part of the attacking jigsaw than anyone else<br /><br /><b>[McAteer adding on those coming through the system and a home-grown star already established as a key man]</b> Some of the current crop of kids look exceptional. <a href="curtis-jones.html">Curtis Jones</a> is coming through and <a href="harvey-elliott.html">Harvey Elliott</a>, who’s only 16, looks fantastic, Adam Lewis is on the rise and there’s <a href="rhian-brewster.html">Rhian Brewster</a>, plus others. They could all become first-team regulars and they only need to look at <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> for evidence of that.<br /><br />Trent was a centre midfielder who wanted to play centre-half and ended up on the right of defence. Nathaniel Clyne got injured and Trent got thrown in at the deep end and started swimming. <b>[Nathaniel]</b> Clyne couldn’t get back in and Trent has now won the Champions League and is probably England’s regular right-back and playing every game for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. And he’s still only 21. You need that little bit of luck to get in the first team and then show you can handle the pressure and I’m convinced a few of them will be able to do that</p>

Then <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> came along with his 4-3-3 system featuring a hard-working midfield and explosive front three.<br /><br />They needed a magician in that attack who pulls everything together and it is similar to how <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> has played in a <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> team set up around him. <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> is <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. When he’s not in the team you can see how detrimental his absence is. He didn’t play the first half in the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Super Cup but came on at the break and instantly made an impact as they created a lot of chances. The system suits <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a> and <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> but it is <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> who makes it all work - without him, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are a different animal<br /><br />Can they go <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> season unbeaten? I wouldn’t have a punt on it. There are too many games to go and it is still early in the season. The big question is if <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> can get over the line and win the title. They have roughly 15 games through November and December and have to go to Qatar for the Club World Cup. Their squad is just starting to be stretched a little at the moment and we are at the point where <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> needs to start rotating regularly and really utilise his substitutes</p>

  <p><b>[Jason McAteer has tipped Rangers boss <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> to leave his post at Ibrox and take the top job at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in two years]</b> <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> made a clever move going to Rangers to begin his management career - and I wouldn’t be at all surprised if stop two on his journey is <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. I’ve got an inkling that <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a> will be the next <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> manager at the start of the 2021-22 season. I’m confident <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> this season under <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> and then he’ll stick around to try to retain the trophy for another season. And whether he succeeds or fails, my hunch is that he’ll walk away at that point and Stevie will step into his shoes. With Stevie, he would be able to walk into a dressing room full of fabulous players and have an outstanding opportunity to continue Jurgen’s work<br /><br />Of course, he would be given a lot of time by fans because of his reputation and his legacy. He would certainly look at what <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> has achieved at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, where he is doing a magnificent job. I’m sure Frank would tell you he hadn’t expected it to go this well but he always had the cushion of knowing he had time in the bank because of his status among the fans at Stamford Bridge<br /><br /><b>[<a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> has played a key role in <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s starting XI at right-back once again, but McAteer feels he has all the attributes to covert to a midfield role]</b> There are many commentators and ex-pros who believe <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a> has a future in midfield for both <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and England. I don’t doubt that the youngster could star in the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> engine room. <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a> is enjoying a stunning start to the season and is rightly earning praise for some sublime performances.

I remember speaking to Frank when <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> played the Super Cup in Istanbul and you could hear his concerns.

  <p><b>[Jason McAteer says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> aren’t getting bored with winning]</b> We’re not getting bored with winning, but because there are no major flaws, we are asking ‘What could be better? Where can they improve?’ And this season we have ridden our luck a number of times and taken the clock to the 94th minute to get results - <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> springs to mind, <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> as well. We’ve had to come from behind to win. As good as that is for what it says about your mental strength, it can be a concern. You feel that that game is coming where you don’t actually get over the line and we drop two points or even three<br /><br /><b>[McAteer added on the back of a 1-1 Champions League draw with <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> on Wednesday]</b> Clean sheets have been a problem. The foundation of a good performance is a clean sheet and we were fantastic at that last season, limiting teams’ opportunities. Partly this time round we have been conceding sloppy goals and making silly mistakes, which is down to lack of concentration at times. But also <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> these days is full of good managers and coaches who analyse everything and identify any area of weakness. In <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s case it may be a tendency to go for the jugular and to want to mix it with teams instead of sitting back. Some teams have had joy because of that<br /><br />Until the new owners and Jurgen arrived, we wondered about the direction the club was going in. There was instability, different managers, players coming and going, but it has moved forward in a new direction. There are some great people running the club at the moment. They have respected the history and the legacy. It would have been easier for them to have bought a plot of land and built a new super stadium but they realised that the history is there in front of the Kop, where titles have been won. It was sad to see the old main stand go but I have played on the pitch again in legends games and it is still <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> even though that new stand is so massive. That is a job well done because you can lose an identity so easily. The last three-and-a-half years under Jurgen have been brilliant - the style of football, the recruitment and the ambition. But not only are we pushing consistently for titles, some of the games we have seen will stay with us forever</p>

They’ve seen the Japanese star up close and personal in the Champions League and, like me, they’d have been impressed. In the first game between the sides, the 4-3 win, <a href="takumi-minamino.html">Minamino</a> was absolutely integral in Salzburg’s second-half improvement. He played in little holes, was quite clever and was a bundle of energy. He scored, taking his chance really well. He was probably their most impressive player on the pitch that night and in the return, he was a constant thorn in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s side. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is not one of those managers who wants to go and spend 70, 80, 90 million pounds on superstars - he likes players he can work with and make better and I think it would be a really good signing at the price. He would certainly strengthen the squad. I wouldn’t say he’s going to displace any of the front three but if I was looking to throw someone on for half an hour with the energy and the brain he’s got, he’d be perfect</p>

Yet I still sense that there’s going to be a difficult conversation to be had between <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> and <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> over whether the Egyptian goes to this summer’s Olympics. We don’t quite get it because the Olympics to us doesn’t seem like a major tournament. But to other countries it’s absolutely massive and I dare say Egypt are included in that number. Of course, Mo is an absolute god out there so they would absolutely want him to be in Tokyo on their behalf.<br /><br />It would be slightly hypocritical of <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> to give <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> his blessing given the manager’s views on rest and playing too much football, but equally it’s not worth risking a fall-out with a player who every club in the world would want. It’s a sensitive subject and I sense we haven’t heard the last of it - but personally I’d be surprised if he goes to Tokyo</p>

  <p><b>[Jason McAteer says <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> and Alisson are the only two players at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> who are irreplaceable]</b> There are only two players in the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team who are irreplaceable - <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> and Alisson. Take either of those two out of the starting 11 and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are instantly weaker. Take anyone else out, however, and it’s a different story - and even though I am a massive fan of his, that includes <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a>.<br /><br /><a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> has so much cover in all areas that he can afford to lose key men for periods. When he lost <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a> earlier in the season I remember the gasps and there were plenty of people saying he’d lost the most important cog in the midfield, the heartbeat of the team. Well yes, he was a miss - but have a look at the league table. I never doubted that <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> could take on the <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a> role because he’d done it successfully before and he didn’t let anyone down. And since then, of course, Jordan has become an absolutely central part of the team - but not irreplaceable. At least, not in terms of his playing ability<br /><br />Where Jordan is missed - and we saw that against <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> - is in terms of leadership. I thought <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were in second gear during the first half against <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> and <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> would not have allowed that to happen. Henderson doesn’t always have the best of games and people are always quick to point fingers when that happens, but that’s not appreciating his value. When it comes to desire and character that’s when he steps up. And while there are some big characters in that dressing room, no one is bigger than <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[Jason McAteer says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s front three require support]</b> I actually think this is burn out and <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> needs to address it as a matter of urgency. This has been building and no one who watches <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> every week should be surprised. They go off at 100 miles an hour from the first whistle of the season and they’ve been doing this since 2015 under <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>. The rewards have been plentiful and wonderful - they were champions of Europe last season and are soon to be champions of England as well. But there’s a trade-off to be had and you cannot keep going at that pace. At some point this was going to happen. You accept a <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> team will not change in terms of approach and style. But this particular team cannot keep doing it, this front three is on the brink and has to change. And that means that this summer is the time to bring in the likes of <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> and <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a>. The first thing they’ll want is guarantees that they’ll be getting game time in among <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s trio of superstars but if I was <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> I’d be telling them you’ll get more minutes than you think. The solution to the front three is not to break it up immediately but <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>, <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> and <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> can’t go on forever so this summer <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has to be planning for the next stage. And also, they are getting found out. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s front three have got a way of playing and teams are now figuring out how to defend against them.</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> player Jason McAteer says he is concerned that people will congregate at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> to celebrate a Reds title if <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> opts to return in home stadiums and not neutral venues]</b> Just before lockdown, my worry about <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> being so close to mathematically winning the title was that crowds would have built up outside <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, especially if the league had continued in empty stadiums. If <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> had won the league at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> with nobody inside, it’s understandable why some believe many thousands might have shown up outside the ground to celebrate. Everyone’s been waiting for this moment for 30 years, there’s been all the build-up, it was almost confirmed, everyone was on a high and nobody wanted to miss out. There would have been a lot of people out on the streets to celebrate. Even though we’re all more knowledgeable on the virus now, that could still happen. So one way to avoid that problem would be to stage games in neutral venues, I can get behind that. From a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> perspective, if they were to continue their games at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> and win the title there, people will congregate. It would be impossible to police. From a safety point of view, we can’t risk that<br /><br />We’ve all got opinions on how we think things should move forward but ultimately the number one priority has to be the safety of the people. But every way we look at it there are advantages and disadvantages to be had. For me, the best solution is 90-minute matches in a neutral venue, even if it has to be played out in a World Cup-style velocity where everyone plays every three days or so over a five-or-six-week period. If we’re going to finish the season, that is the only way it can be done, as far as I’m concerned<br /><br /><b>[When asked about <a href="gordon-taylor.html">Gordon Taylor</a>’s proposal to reduce 45-minute halves]</b> You might as well say let’s have a 5-a-side competition, 10 minutes each way, and you can have a club legend playing as well. You can’t change the game rules like that, it stains the integrity of the game. We are where we are, but you’ve got to play it out as close to the regulations as is safe, if you play it out at all. I can’t get on board with changing the length of the games, it’s just unfair</p>

Talk of Bayer Leverkusen’s <a href="kai-havertz.html">Kai Havertz</a> arriving at the club therefore seems unlikely. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> broke records to sign Alisson and <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a>, but the rest of the team were not necessarily signed for huge fees. They haven’t gone about their business that way and I don’t see it happening<br /><br />And it is going to be a big year with the Euros at the end of the season, so top players are going to want to play regularly, something that <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is not able to provide for everyone. There has been a lot of talk about <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>’s <a href="thiago-alcantara.html">Thiago Alcantara</a> joining but defensive midfield is an area of strength with <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> and <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a>, so a move for him might not be the way forward.

That’s obviously not Milner’s preferred position and <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> always looks more comfortable when he is playing in front of Robertson. But they don’t need much more and I think it is about getting the right people into the club who are going to fit in with the culture</p>
