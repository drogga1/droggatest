  <p><b>[Collins reveals what Guardiola said to him after Chelsea loanee conceded NINE goals against Man City]</b> He said; ‘tough night?’ I simply said ‘yes’. Then he proceeded to say what an incredible achievement it was for us to get to the semi-final. He said that we were a credit to ourselves and he said the same to the staff. It was nice to have that from him. He could have just enjoyed the goals for himself but no, he had time for us, which was brilliant, when a manager of that stature has respect for us.<br /><br />I was thinking ‘wow’ on the final whistle. That’s the first time in a game situation that I have played against a team who are that good. It just shows the level from here to there. It is incredible, it is really frightening. I really enjoyed it but I was drained at the same time. We deserved to be where we were and beat some top teams along the way to the semis, so I think it has been a great run. For me, personally, I wanted them to show us respect and pick their best players. No disrespect to any of their other players, but that’s what they did.<br /><br />The front three <b>[Sane, Jesus and Mahrez]</b> and midfield three <b>[De Bruyne, Silva and Gundogan]</b> they put out were all amazing players and that’s what we wanted to test ourselves. We are just afraid on the night that we didn’t get anywhere near them. I think if you look at the results this season, the amount of times they have scored five or more goals at home is ridiculous. I know we could maybe have kept the number of goals down on a different night.<br /><br />At the end of the day, you have just got to give them credit. They are an impressive team. It was a tough night but one I still enjoyed. I am proud of the boys for getting there. I think the second leg is all about pride. Having that bit between your teeth, have pride for yourselves, family, the club and our fans. Who knows when Burton will next be in the semi-final of such a competition? No one knows, we just have to do the club proud<br /><br />Compared to last season, when I was in League Two, there’s a lot more quality. I feel like last year, at Forest Green, prepared me for this year. It was a major, major learning curve last season. Forest Green came up from the National League to League Two. It was my first loan as a youngster.<br /><br />For me, it was very tough. I feel like a made a lot of mistakes last year but I feel like I have learned from it and taken it into this year. Now, I feel more comfortable. I feel like I know what I am doing a bit more around men’s players, coaches and the fans.<br /><br />You don’t get any of that in academy football. It is tough when you get fans shouting at you. It shouldn’t matter but it does. People working in football lose out on money, mortgages, it is nothing to mess around with. You notice that as soon as you go out on loan.<br /><br />When I first went into Forest Green, the keeper who was already there at the time was a fan favourite. I came in there and straight away it was backs against the wall. I didn’t start the season well. Ever since then, there was a certain few people who were on my back and it was my first loan.<br /><br />Then, after Christmas, I feel like I just changed it around. I went for it and it seemed to all come together and we survived relegation. The fans got behind me and it was great in the end. I came out of academy football playing 20 games, then I went into men’s football and played 47 games<br /><br />I think at that age, everyone just wants to play football. I don’t think you think too much into it. I didn’t think about becoming a footballer or like I want to play football in this academy or that academy. I just played football because I enjoyed it.<br /><br />That was important, to keep the enjoyment there. I trained with Southampton for three or four weeks. I was just training and happy. I didn’t think about anything else. When Chelsea came in, it was a case of I have to take the opportunity. It was almost like a gut feeling.<br /><br />I am not one of those people who was desperately trying to get into an academy, I got the offer and it is a club of huge stature so why would you turn that down? It worked out alright! Being at Chelsea, my role model was always Petr Cech. You go to a Chelsea game when I joined and you watched Petr Cech. I didn’t look at him as a keeper and try to copy him. I had Petr Cech around and I wanted to learn from him and I am lucky that he is a really nice guy as well<br /><br />Burton went down from the Championship last season, so we have a very, very good squad here. We haven’t quite found the missing piece of the jigsaw, but we are struggling to see out our games. I feel like now we are starting to find it and I hope to find it soon. The league is still the most important and always is. It is nice to be in the semi-final and get there but we want to push for the play-offs in the league</p>
