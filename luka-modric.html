When you lose there is always someone who has to pay. You just have to compare this match with the previous ones. The team’s attitude was different and hopefully we can continue in the same way<br /><br />We played a lot more rapidly and we functioned as a team in the way was always should function. Today we were a team from the start, up front, at the back and in the middle. What we did against Deportivo was to pressure higher up the pitch and win back a lot of balls and when we had possession we were very dangerous</p>

We know that sometimes things go well in football and other times they go badly. Questioning the coach is something that I can’t understand, of course we support him. What has happened in recent matches isn’t a physical issue. We must defend better and cover the gaps more efficiently.<br /><br /><b>[Modric insists the likes of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani will be worried heading into the tie]</b> I think everybody respects Real Madrid, nobody wants to play against us. We hope that this result will help us prepare for that tie better. Fear doesn’t exist in football, especially for Real Madrid. We are the only team to win it twice in a row, why should we be afraid?</p>

  <p><b>[Luka Modric has revealed that one regret from his time at Tottenham still bugs him]</b> My one regret is that I didn’t win a trophy with Tottenham, despite us being a strong team who played good, attractive football. I’m sorry for the way I left. I wish we had parted in a nicer way. I hope fans understand that I followed my dreams. My emotions when I think about the time I spent at Spurs are always really positive. Tottenham is the club that first gave me my opportunity to play in one of the strongest leagues in the world. I had a fantastic relationship with the people at the club, and also the fans. The whole atmosphere in and around the club at that time was brilliant, and our results were mostly very good. We played in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, against Real Madrid, and in a League Cup final too. Do I still follow their results? Yes, when I have time. I always enjoy watching Tottenham’s games and I really like what the club has become over the last few seasons. They play the kind of enjoyable and attacking football that I like to see, and I definitely think Spurs could win the Premier League title in the near future - they’ve got excellent players.<br /><br /><b>[La Liga and Champions League double winners from 2016-17 have endured a humbling fall from grace this term]</b> The results haven’t been what we expected. But this is football. Last season things went well, this season we have played quite well but it wasn’t always enough. I have no doubt that it is a temporary crisis and that we will achieve our goals from here to the end of the season. We are aiming to defend the titles we won last season, and I know it won’t be easy, but I will always trust in our quality</p>

Hopefully he will enjoy <b>[Los Angeles]</b>. I would like him to play football a bit longer, to watch him, to see his magic like he did past years and we’ll see. But I wish him all the best.<br /><br />It’s difficult <b>[to watch the games]</b>. Sometimes I watch the games when they are early in Europe. But you know, it would be very difficult because we have our schedule that is huge. A lot of things, training, and we have to sleep early<br /><br />You never know what can happen. I still have two more years on my contract with Real Madrid. I’m happy. I always said that I would like to finish my career in Madrid if it’s possible. But if not, maybe I can see myself also <b>[in America]</b><br /><br /><b>[On Zlatan Ibrahimovic]</b> Of course, who wouldn’t like to have this kind of player? Zlatan is one of the best players in modern generation and it is a shame that he didn’t pick Croatia.

No matter what happens in the final, this is the greatest success story in Croatian sport, but we all have the desire to be the champions. We are full of confidence, we have character and we have everything a team needs to be world champions<br /><br />Everyone’s asking me about it but I’m not burdened by it. We have to do it, if we don’t make this last step … we have to do it. When we came to the competition, we were fairly modest, without promoting ourselves. The goal was to go through the groups. I felt such belief that I have never felt before, and I don’t think it’s chance that we’ve made it to the final<br /><br />I remember Thuram. I remember how sad I was. Let’s just say that we’re going to correct this. I won’t use any other words, but Croatia should have been in the final</p>

  <p><b>[Luka Modric was critical of England’s pundits for underestimating Croatia at the World Cup]</b> We just said how we felt at the World Cup, we don’t need to go back and talk about it. This is a new game and we don’t need to look back and make more comments about it. It is the same as before, I don’t care. Of course, of course, <b>[we respect England]</b>. We said what we meant and how we felt at the tournament and that’s it. I don’t want to change what we said because that’s how we felt. It doesn’t matter what we say because between players and teams there’s a huge respect. We respect England and they respect us. I didn’t mean the players and coaches, I meant the people around England.<br /><br />That’s maybe more of a question for them to assess if they are improving or not. I see them as a good team, a young team and they have a bright future in front of them. They are in the final four of the Nations League, it is showing that they are in a good way. We lost this on set-pieces. You know, it is a bit painful to lose it in this way because we didn’t want to <b>[lose]</b>. We prepared well for set-pieces, we knew that England is dangerous from set-pieces but in the end they scored two goals. It is painful but apart from the first 20-25 minutes, we were the better team. They could have scored one or two goals at the beginning but then, when they didn’t, we started to dominate the game. We scored that goal in the second half. We needed to score the second one and that would have been the end for them probably. In the end, we didn’t. Then, they scored two goals and won</p>

My personal view is that staying for nine years at Real is significant in terms of how he felt at this fantastic club. Among other things, he won four Ballons d’Or. You can’t achieve this if you are not at peace in the environment. I’ve been here for six-and-a-half years and I can say with certainty that we are a good group, with mature people and quality players, good relationships and an excellent atmosphere. Of course, there are better and worse days, but the core strength of the group can’t be questioned. If it were, we would not win all of these trophies, either team or individual ones.<br /><br />The only thing certain for now is that I’ll be with Madrid until the end of my contract.

  <p><b>[Real Madrid commitment from Ballon d’Or winner]</b> My personal goal and big wish is to finish career in Real Madrid, that would be the ideal scenario. But to achieve that, I have to stay capable of playing at the top, at the highest level. That is not going to be easy.</p>

  <p><b>[Ronaldo to leave without recruiting was a crime]</b> Cristiano scored 50 goals and you can’t find someone who scores so many. Some had to take a step forward and, not scoring 50, but for three players to score at least 15-20 or 10 goals. And we don’t have that. That’s why I think <b>[scoring is]</b> our biggest problem this year</p>

Of course, everyone enjoys their own way and you have to respect their way of being. He is exemplary with his behaviour. I get along very well with him</p>

  <p><b>[The Spanish giants have since added three more Champions Leagues to their collection, but Modric is unsure whether it would have been possible if not for Ramos’s famous goal]</b> It’s difficult to make such judgements. I don’t know. It may be the case that this goal changed the history of European football. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> had already won a lot of trophies, but they hadn’t lifted the Champions League trophy for 12 years. This goal changed something, the mentality changed. From that moment we started to be very strong in Europe and teams were afraid of us again. That shows how important mentality is in football.<br /><br />People had spent 12 years talking about La Decima and it became a mental thing. <b>[Jose]</b> <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> went to three semi-finals and it was hard to overcome this mental barrier.

I was lucky enough to win the Champions League again, which isn’t easy, and I also reached the World Cup final with a country like Croatia, which for us is something that words just can’t describe. I don’t like to talk about myself, but I think that, in the individual sense, I played a very good season and the footballing people have recognised that. It’s no coincidence when so many people vote for you</p>
