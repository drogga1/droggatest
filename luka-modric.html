  <p><b>[Luca Modric says <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> is a change for the better at Real Madrid]</b> I am sorry for Rafa and I would like to thank him for his work, but being honest and seeing today’s game I think that the change has been positive. When you lose there is always someone who has to pay. You just have to compare this match with the previous ones. The team’s attitude was different and hopefully we can continue in the same way<br /><br />We played a lot more rapidly and we functioned as a team in the way was always should function. Today we were a team from the start, up front, at the back and in the middle. What we did against Deportivo was to pressure higher up the pitch and win back a lot of balls and when we had possession we were very dangerous</p>

I’m the type of person who always wants to be the best, so it’s only natural that I dreamed one day I would come this far, and thanks to God here I am now. It’s what I’ve worked so hard for. I pushed myself and believed in myself, even in difficult times. I’ve also made it this far thanks to my team-mates, my family and my friends</p>

Of course, everyone enjoys their own way and you have to respect their way of being. He is exemplary with his behaviour. I get along very well with him</p>

  <p><b>[The Spanish giants have since added three more Champions Leagues to their collection, but Modric is unsure whether it would have been possible if not for Ramos’s famous goal]</b> It’s difficult to make such judgements. I don’t know. It may be the case that this goal changed the history of European football. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> had already won a lot of trophies, but they hadn’t lifted the Champions League trophy for 12 years. This goal changed something, the mentality changed. From that moment we started to be very strong in Europe and teams were afraid of us again. That shows how important mentality is in football.<br /><br />People had spent 12 years talking about La Decima and it became a mental thing. <b>[Jose]</b> <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> went to three semi-finals and it was hard to overcome this mental barrier. When we reached the final and to win it with that goal, it still gives me goosebumps, we showed such strong character and never gave up<br /><br /><b>[Modric broke <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>’s Ballon d’Or stranglehold by winning football’s most prestigious individual accolade in 2018]</b> That was a recognition of my entire career, but a very special year in particular. I was lucky enough to win the Champions League again, which isn’t easy, and I also reached the World Cup final with a country like Croatia, which for us is something that words just can’t describe. I don’t like to talk about myself, but I think that, in the individual sense, I played a very good season and the footballing people have recognised that. It’s no coincidence when so many people vote for you</p>
