<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Tottenham should shelve any plans to move for West Ham striker Andy Carroll and instead seek to cover Harry Kane’s injury-enforced absence with a bid for Roma star Edin Dzeko]</b> I’d like to see Edin Dzeko come in. I think he’s a top player and I don’t think he’s in the team at the moment <b>[at Roma]</b>. Thankfully it’s not my decision but if I was manager of Spurs I wouldn’t be looking to Andy Carroll. I don’t think he’d fit into our way of playing. He might do us a job during this period when we’ve got an absolutely incredible injury list and Son away which compounds it. But I am a bit of a purist and I have a style of play that I like to see and I think Dzeko would fit in better than Andy Carroll.<br /><br />You don’t buy because a player gets injured. That’s part of the game and we’ve got five, six or seven <b>[injuries]</b> so we’d need to replace six or seven top-notch footballers which is impossible to do. I’d imagine we’re looking at players, as we always are, and maybe there will be one or two coming in. Hopefully we might sign a centre-forward in the window now.<br /><br />I love Poch’s attitude though. His attitude is this is an opportunity for someone else to come in and do the business and earn a place. Always in football, that’s how the people behind the first XI have to think. Every time an opportunity arises, they have to grab it with both hands because they want to be there. That’s what Poch is saying to the press about his squad of players and his youngsters. That’s what it is about</p>
