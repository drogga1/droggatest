<blockquote>
  <p><b>[MP Sira Janejaka, a Sam Mitr member, said he would submit a motion to remove Mr Sontirat as party secretary-general at the party’s meeting]</b> We view him as a high risk to the stability of the party and the government. He’s made several mistakes and lacks leadership. Each time I asked to see him, I was turned down and problems were never solved<br /><br /><b>[He added that even now, when PPRP was in crisis, Mr Sontirat continued to refuse to talk to his group]</b> We think Mr Sontirat should resign as party secretary-general or quit from the party. He must also show responsibility by not accepting a ministerial post in the cabinet<br /><br /><b>[Mr Sontirat had earlier been tipped to be the industry minister and was swapped with Mr Suriya in the revised lineup]</b> We had nothing against <b>[the June 11 list]</b> since we were aware how difficult it was to allocate cabinet seats this time. When there were no seats left at the agriculture and transport ministries for PPRP, we accepted the reality and agreed with the conclusion on June 11<br /><br />We believe Mr Suriya is more suitable for the energy portfolio than the industry ministry. As an industrial magnate, he will be subjected to much criticism if he becomes the industry minister. Mr Anucha was also removed from the latest lineup and he later said he would make the sacrifice and would not demand anything. However, he would like to see Mr Suriya where he was earlier</p>
