  <p><b>[<a href="marcos-alonso.html">Marcos Alonso</a>’s idol Vassilios Tsiartas reveals secrets behind <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> wing-back’s incredible goalscoring prowess]</b> <a href="marcos-alonso.html">Marcos Alonso</a>’s dad was by far the best coach I had in my career, a coach who helped me through many things. I scored 18 goals after he arrived and we got promoted to the top league. Marcos senior - every Friday in training when we finished the warm-up - always sent me to go practice free kicks as realistically as possible with a wall and goalkeeper<br /><br />And there were days when Marquitos, which was what we called him, came along. He looked closely at how I was taking those free kicks. Sometimes I let him take a kick, despite the fact that he was a little boy of 10 or 11 years old<br /><br />I remember he was often frustrated because he didn’t have the sufficient power to get the ball to the goal. He was just a kid so I told him not to be disappointed, stressing that what he had to do was to find the right shot, the right sense of the kick, keep practising and in time he would be able to send the ball whenever and however he wanted to send it<br /><br />He followed that and he practised a lot and so we admire him today for scoring with magnificent free kicks. He always had a ball at his feet! Even if he were in a hotel lobby, at the locker rooms, everywhere, he couldn’t stop playing and kicking!<br /><br /><b>[<a href="marcos-alonso.html">Marcos Alonso</a> could have had a hat-trick against <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> after hitting the bar with a Tsiartas-like free kick]</b> A kid who looked like he was going to play football, no doubt. Of course, no one could have foreseen how he would get to this top level that he’s at right now, as he was too young, but he seemed to carry on the family tradition. A child who was constantly asking, beyond free kicks, he wanted to learn, always taking notice, always listening, always trying to get anything he could from anyone who could provide it. And obviously, he did not fail; he is an accomplished footballer, excelling at the very top level</p>
