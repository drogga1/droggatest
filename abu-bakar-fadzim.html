  <p>[Abu Bakar Fadzim extremely proud of his young PKNP team after heroic FA Cup exploits] We are very happy with the penalty win. The players fought all the way today despite playing favourites Kelantan. I’ll like to praise my players for fighting throughout the 120 minutes and that with only two import players after 70th minute. We wanted to increase the speed by bringing on Deevan. It’s their first time playing in such an atmosphere. I hope we can go further in the competition.<br /><br />When we play knock-out, we can’t take it easy. The players like Mugenthirran and Fadhli looks nervous but it paid out at the end. Well done to Asyraaf. He got confident after saving two. It’s his first time saving penalties at this level too<br /><br />I looked at their [Kelantan] videos. We cannot follow their tempo and they have players who can control the game. So I told my players to pressure high to test how they would react and I’m pleased it worked out</p>

  <p>[PKNP FC head coach, Abu Bakar Fadzim questioned the referee’s decision-making in rewarding Kuantan FAI want to question the decision of two penalties, and there were no harsh fouls. It disrupted our plans when the opponent got two penalties. We were also under pressure when we lost Ritus Krjauklis, and they started to aim for their target man but I think this is a good lesson for us.<br /><br />In the end, we worked hard despite losing our key defender and Fikri gave us the win. We started well, gave them a lot of pressure but things turned from comfortable to really difficult for us when they got the penalties. We created history, for a new club like us to make it to the top eight in the FA Cup. We lost Ritus, so we need to see who can replace him. We will accept whoever we get for the next round. We just want to take it stage by stage</p>
