  <p><b>[Abu Bakar Fadzim extremely proud of his young PKNP team after heroic FA Cup exploits]</b> We are very happy with the penalty win. The players fought all the way today despite playing favourites Kelantan. I’ll like to praise my players for fighting throughout the 120 minutes and that with only two import players after 70th minute. We wanted to increase the speed by bringing on Deevan. It’s their first time playing in such an atmosphere. I hope we can go further in the competition.<br /><br />When we play knock-out, we can’t take it easy. The players like Mugenthirran and Fadhli looks nervous but it paid out at the end. Well done to Asyraaf. He got confident after saving two. It’s his first time saving penalties at this level too<br /><br />I looked at their <b>[Kelantan]</b> videos. We cannot follow their tempo and they have players who can control the game. So I told my players to pressure high to test how they would react and I’m pleased it worked out</p>

  <p><b>[PKNP FC head coach, Abu Bakar Fadzim questioned the referee’s decision-making in rewarding Kuantan FAI want to question the decision of two penalties, and there were no harsh fouls. It disrupted our plans when the opponent got two penalties. We were also under pressure when we lost Ritus Krjauklis, and they started to aim for their target man but I think this is a good lesson for us.<br /><br />In the end, we worked hard despite losing our key defender and Fikri gave us the win. We started well, gave them a lot of pressure but things turned from comfortable to really difficult for us when they got the penalties. We created history, for a new club like us to make it to the top eight in the FA Cup. We lost Ritus, so we need to see who can replace him. We will accept whoever we get for the next round. We just want to take it stage by stage</b></p>

  <p><b>[PKNP’s Abu Bakar Fadzim rues loss of key players in crunch FA QF first leg against Kedah]</b> That is true <b>[that this match against Kedah is the toughest match for them thus far in 2017]</b>. Because we lost three players. The senior defenders, Fazli <b>[Zulkifli]</b> suspended for two matches and Ritus <b>[Krjauklis]</b> suspended for one match while Vincent <b>[Weigl]</b> was told to rest for three weeks and has yet to rejoin training.<br /><br />So far in my contact with <b>[Syazwan]</b> Zaipol <b>[who was away with Malaysia U22 at Dubai]</b>, he has no injuries. 90% we’ll depend on the local and the chances are slim. But we’ll try to do the best and gain experience during the match<br /><br />From what we see, Kedah has good movement and they are good at creating space. We cannot play to their momentum. We have to cut off their passes in the middle and force them wide. The players have to know that we cannot allow them the gap to exploit in the middle. Kedah are a team in form and they do not only rely on one or two players. We have to be really aware and be discipline in our game<br /><br />We have never played in front of such a big crowd. We are also worried about the referee, especially given what we’ve seen during Kedah’s game against Perak. This will be a new experience for the players and hopefully the players will learn from it as they’ve never been in this situation before<br /><br />It’s nothing to lose for us and it’ll be good for us to try and catch up to the standard of Kedah. We have to overcome the respect and the fear. We have to be more confident in our decision-making. Then it can be balance and maybe we can surprise them.</p>

  <p><b>[Abu Bakar Fadzim is adamant that his team remains in the hunt]</b> We saw the determination from our players even though we were two imports less today as well as the early injury to Hafiz <b>[Ramdan]</b>. But we weren’t at our best today, Kuala Lumpur were better and in the end, it was an own goal that gave them the win. We still have 3 more matches.Yes, we wil try. We will accept what comes.</p>

  <p><b>[Abu Bakar Fadzim warns his players that their work is not done yet and it’s still all to play for between PKNP and Felda in the Malaysia Cup]</b> I think the win gives the team a big motivation and it was very special. We studied Felda and they are a complete team and it was difficult to see where their weaknesses are. Their players are quality and experienced, playing in the AFC Cup. I just wanted my players to put up a good fight and never did we think that we would win by such margin.<br /><br />We come with a plan and lesson learned from our meeting against Kedah. That time we had only one import and this time we had three. They combined well with the local players and everyone showed very good attitude.<br /><br />We went there looking to ensure that we have something to fight for in the second leg, unlike what happened in the FA Cup against Kedah. We haven’t played in Ipoh for a long time for one reason or another and we wanted to give something to our home fans.<br /><br />Felda had more chances and pressured us very strongly, especially in the second half. It’s only that we converted our chances better. Felda is a solid team but maybe on Friday we had an advantage. The finishing from Shahrel Fikri was magnificent, all one-touch finishes, inside and outside the penalty box.<br /><br />We know this is only the first step, we still need to finish the job<br /><br />We are not there yet. Felda could turn up any time. Maybe they found it hard to get going after such a long break. If they peak in the second leg, that could be trouble for us. We don’t have the quality that they have. What we have is work rate, character and desire. But they are the better team and that’s a fact. They are like a wounded tiger who is raring to bite back. A two goal lead can be wiped out in just a moment. We will need to play better than what we did in the first leg if we want to reach the semi-final. We have to be well organised and wait for the right time to kill them. But if they kill us first, then we might be in trouble</p>

  <p><b>[Malaysia Cup dark horse PKNP were the victims of a spectacular come-from-behind Felda United win in their Malaysia Cup quarter-final tie]</b> After leading, we somehow were surprised by two soft goals in the final 10 minutes <b>[of the first half]</b>. We should have pressed more and played with more discipline if we really wanted to qualify for the semis.<br /><br />For me, the boys have given their best but maybe it just wasn’t meant to be our time. We were too comfortable and over-confident, and wasted our chance to be in the semi-finals. Our young boys must take this as a lesson, and now move on by redirecting our focus on the remaining two games in the Premier League.<br /><br />I can’t deny it will affect us as we had one foot in the door, but I will monitor them in the coming days. We will come back as we have nothing to lose and we’ve proven that by reaching the quarter-final stage, only that we lost to a complete team. We will focus on the remaining two <b>[league]</b> matches</p>
