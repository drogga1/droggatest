  <p><b>[Women’s World Cup winner with USA, Hope Solo became the first goalkeeper to record 100 clean sheets at international level]</b> I simply can’t believe I am the first goalkeeper to reach such a great milestone! There have been many great goalkeepers throughout history, both men and women, but to be the first with 100 shutouts is crazy!</p>

  <p><b>[Hope Solo admits she immediately apologised to <a href="lotta-schelin.html">Lotta Schelin</a> after calling Sweden a bunch of cowards]</b> I wasn’t enraged, I wasn’t emotional, I wasn’t angry. I didn’t mean to come across that the players were cowards or the coach was a coward. I meant that the style of play was not very Olympic-spirited.<br /><br />I think <a href="lotta-schelin.html">Lotta Schelin</a> - No 8, the captain for Sweden, of course - is one of the best players in the world - one of the best attacking players in the world. So it was really difficult to watch her drop back defensively, and I saw her most of the time in the 18-yard box in her defence<br /><br />And I wanted her to attack me, I wanted to play against Lotta. I wanted to try to stop her shots. I love the competitive nature between America and Sweden<br /><br />I said to her, ‘You know, Lotta, I said something. I used the word cowards when talking about you guys, and I didn’t mean that. I’m so sorry’. And she was like, ‘Oh, I know you, don’t worry about it. Don’t worry about it’.<br /><br />And she’s like, ‘Look, the American team has been in the last five championship games in the Olympics’. Five championships! And she’s like, ‘For us to beat a better-skilled team like Brazil and like America, we had to drop back defensively’. And she knew it, but for the most part, we just hugged and we laughed and she accepted my apology. She didn’t even think I needed to apologise.</p>

  <p><b>[Scotland were left devastated when Lee Alexander saved a late Argentina penalty to ensure their place in the last 16, only for the referee to order a retake and the resulting goal sending them out of the competition. Hope Solo tweeted after the latter match]</b> We need to talk about this rule and the way it’s impacting matches. Stepping off your line does not do enough to cut down the angle during a penalty to justify a retake. There’s not enough time during a penalty kick for any goalkeeper to get close enough to shut down the angle.</p>
