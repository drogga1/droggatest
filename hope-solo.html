  <p><b>[Women’s World Cup winner with USA, Hope Solo became the first goalkeeper to record 100 clean sheets at international level]</b> I simply can’t believe I am the first goalkeeper to reach such a great milestone! There have been many great goalkeepers throughout history, both men and women, but to be the first with 100 shutouts is crazy!</p>

  <p><b>[Hope Solo admits she immediately apologised to <a href="lotta-schelin.html">Lotta Schelin</a> after calling Sweden a bunch of cowards]</b> I wasn’t enraged, I wasn’t emotional, I wasn’t angry. I didn’t mean to come across that the players were cowards or the coach was a coward. I meant that the style of play was not very Olympic-spirited.<br /><br />I think <a href="lotta-schelin.html">Lotta Schelin</a> - No 8, the captain for Sweden, of course - is one of the best players in the world - one of the best attacking players in the world. So it was really difficult to watch her drop back defensively, and I saw her most of the time in the 18-yard box in her defence<br /><br />And I wanted her to attack me, I wanted to play against Lotta. I wanted to try to stop her shots. I love the competitive nature between America and Sweden<br /><br />I said to her, ‘You know, Lotta, I said something. I used the word cowards when talking about you guys, and I didn’t mean that. I’m so sorry’. And she was like, ‘Oh, I know you, don’t worry about it. Don’t worry about it’.<br /><br />And she’s like, ‘Look, the American team has been in the last five championship games in the Olympics’. Five championships! And she’s like, ‘For us to beat a better-skilled team like Brazil and like America, we had to drop back defensively’. And she knew it, but for the most part, we just hugged and we laughed and she accepted my apology. She didn’t even think I needed to apologise.</p>

  <p><b>[Hope Solo has levied another charge at the U.S. Soccer as she runs to become the federation’s next president]</b> I didn’t see a dime of <b>[money from the video]</b>. I started to ask questions and told them I didn’t approve the video to go public before the Olympics. I started to get emails back that were complete attorney jargon basically saying ‘Hope, this is above your pay grade’. Basically, shut your mouth and play soccer. That is when I knew I was barking up a tree they didn’t want me to bark up. Pretty soon after that is when <b>[USSF]</b> fired me for - quote unquote - saying the word ‘coward.’.<br /><br />Throughout our negotiations <b>[for the Collective Bargaining Agreement]</b>, players - as well as US senators <b>[Feinstein and Murray]</b> - asked SUM and U.S. Soccer for full financial disclosures from SUM and they absolutely refused to give them to us<br /><br /><b>[Solo specifically called out Kathy Carter, the president of SUM who is considered one of the front-runners for USSF president]</b> You were the one responsible for not divulging the full financials of SUM when we directly asked you for them, as well as representatives of the United States Senate. This relationship <b>[between US Soccer and SUM]</b> impacts all of us. It is so convoluted</p>

  <p><b>[Hope Solo did not win the USA Soccer presidency]</b> I was a player for nearly 20 years and I saw first hand what Carlos Cordeiro’s idea of change is. You cannot as a vice-president claim you are the lone voice of change while all of this happened under your watch.<br /><br />In 2015, as the best goalkeeper in the world, I had to play 23 games, win a World Cup and win the Golden Glove, only to make $40,000 less than Tim Howard, who only had to play eight games and win nothing in his World Cup year.<br /><br /><b>[Cordeiro]</b> was part of a federation that could have been the first to pay its women equally. Instead that honor goes to Norway, while the U.S. women, the most successful team ever, has to force it through the court system. He was part of the same federation that time and time again approved unsafe playing conditions for the women and who still play on turf, while the men play on grass. He was part of a federation that thinks it’s acceptable for a player in the NWSL to make less than $10,000 a year and have to take a second or third job just to fulfill her dream of being a professional athlete. He was part of the same federation that leaves me with no health insurance, no retirement of any kind, after serving my country as the best in the world for 20 years. For 10 years, Carlos Cordeiro was in a position to create change, and he did nothing. He failed me, he failed my teammates and he failed the women of the NWSL<br /><br />The businesswomen among the candidates, Kathy Carter, who proclaims that she is ‘all in’ on the women’s game, never once showed any kind of support for us during our fight for equal pay. As the highest-ranking female soccer executive in America, whose voice could have meant something, Kathy Carter’s voice was silent. She calls for equal pay and transparency, yet when the two United States senators asked Soccer United Marketing under Kathy Carter for a breakdown of revenue for the men’s and women’s national teams, she refused</p>

  <p><b>[Hope Solo has declared her opposition to the United States’ bid for the 2026 World Cup]</b> I can’t say it should be awarded to Morocco but I don’t think it should go to the United States, and that’s hard to say.<br /><br /><b>[Among Solo’s complaints is a lack of promotion and relegation in MLS]</b> That is not helping the sport in America. I want to see promotion-relegation in the NASL and the MLS. Right now it’s true, you have rich ownership groups owning MLS teams and they’re only getting richer and they’re alienating everybody else. A new ownership group can’t just come in and purchase a team even though they have the financial security, even though they have the commitment. It’s controlled by those single individuals at Soccer United Marketing, MLS in particular, <b>[commissioner]</b> Don Garber<br /><br />Hopefully FIFA can stand up and step in and say, ‘If we’re going to reward you, let’s look at everything and point out where you can fix certain things,</p>

  <p><b>[Hope Solo has taken aim at U.S. Soccer - in particular the USWNT - stating that something is broken]</b> Something is broken. Barely more than a dozen female players of color have represented the United States at the highest level since 1991. I recall a conversation with one player who told me she thought a coach had an issue with the color of her skin. She said she could feel it in her bones. Others have since told me similar things. Over most of my 20-year career I hadn’t realized how uncomfortable some teammates were around certain coaches or officials.<br /><br />Most players wanted to represent the U.S., to be at the Olympics or the World Cup, and they’re proud to be on the team. So they kept quiet. But those conversations with teammates who felt things were off, means race is an issue we need to discuss a whole lot more.<br /><br />In my experience, scouts and coaches typically focus on the suburbs of big cities - usually where there is an MLS team - and wait for kids to come to them. That’s a reason you see a majority of white, upper middle-class kids when you look at club teams, youth development academies, and Olympic development programs across America. There are some great kids in those programs but it is not the only way to find talent<br /><br />Imagine if the next LeBron James played soccer. But I don’t think we’re even looking for players in places like Akron, Ohio <b>[James’ birthplace]</b>. That needs to change. One thing that sticks out is how the U.S. Soccer Federation, a non-profit organization, is sitting on more than $100m in surplus funds - money that should be reinvested in the game. That $100m or so surplus should be going to development in inner cities, rural communities, and under-represented communities. We talk about people of color when we speak about diversity but we also need to look at socio-economic diversity. When that gap is closed we will see a more accurate representation of the real America<br /><br />There is some hope. I’ve been lucky to meet incredible people across the country. I call them The Resistance. They want reform in American soccer. They’re men and women who are passionate about the game. They are Hispanic, men and women of color, great coaches, great competitors, and great leaders. They can make a difference in opening up soccer to all communities. My message for young players and their families is this: I want them to know there are a lot of people fighting for them - people who believe soccer should be the world’s game, who want to grow the game, and open it up to everyone. I also want families to know their voice matters. Change is difficult and often takes time; but the more people who stand up and demand better, the quicker we can get there. Silence never changed the world. It takes bold action and the voices of many</p>

It doesn’t matter who is coaching us because we will find a way to win. The United States knows how to find a way to win in spite of who the coach is.<br /><br /><b>[Solo also commented on the criticism received by the USWNT for how they celebrated their goals in their historic 13-0 rout of Thailand in their World Cup opener]</b> The difference between the US and Thailand - who made the Asian Cup semi-finals just last year - is complicated and like the chicken and the egg. Do you open up the World Cup to grow the game? Or do you grow the game and then open up the World Cup? I think you have to first invest in the women’s game before you get to the World Cup but unfortunately that’s not what a lot of the federations around the world have done or do</p>

  <p><b>[Hope Solo became the latest pundit to criticize the team following Tuesday’s 13-0 victory over Thailand]</b> am no stranger to controversy, but let me tell you: I am a proponent of respecting my opponents, and I always have been. Obviously, I’ve made some comments in the past out of poor sportsmanship, but I truly believe that we have to show so much class, especially coming from the number one team in the world…I think it was unnecessary to have planned-out goal celebrations. My favorite goal celebrations are the ones that come naturally, because you really see the passion from the player. What I thought was so classy was after the end of the game, <a href="carli-lloyd.html">Carli Lloyd</a> went up to the Thailand goalkeeper, and she put her arm around her and walked her off the field. That’s the kind of class I want to see from the United States.<br /><br />There’s a time and place for the choreographed celebration, and there’s a time and place for just, the natural, whatever happens after a goal, the natural aspect of sport. And I think that’s what I want to see more of<br /><br /><b>[Despite her comments, Solo says she feels the USWNT are in a good place]</b> I think that they have a lot of momentum right now. They’re playing with so much confidence … I want to see the United States defense get tested. Because ultimately, they haven’t been tested yet – and to win this tournament, it has to be a complete team performance, but we have not seen how our United States defense and goalkeeper will perform under pressure. But ultimately I know that the United States are going to do what they do best, and they’re gonna score goals, and ultimately, they will come out on top in this second game, as well</p>

Stepping off your line does not do enough to cut down the angle during a penalty to justify a retake. There’s not enough time during a penalty kick for any goalkeeper to get close enough to shut down the angle.</p>
