  <p><b>[Norwich player one of two positive tests in Premier League]</b> Norwich City can confirm that one of its players has returned a positive test result following the recent round of Covid-19 testing. In line with <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s protocols, the player will now self-isolate for a period of seven days before being tested again at a later date. The player must return a negative test result before being able to resume training. The club will not name the player in question and asks that his request for privacy and confidentiality are respected at this time<br /><br />We continue to operate within the strict guidelines outlined by <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> to ensure we avoid any risk of infection spreading should anyone else test positive, including practising social distancing so no ‘close contacts’ are created, which has been defined by Government as being within two metres of a confirmed case for 15 minutes or more<br /><br />This means that no other member of the squad or staff should be forced to self-isolate other than the person who returns a positive test result and their household members. The Norwich player in question has confirmed he had no ‘close contacts’ with our team yesterday and our squad has also verified this. Our testing has continued to return only negative results for COVID since one positive reading was confirmed almost two weeks ago</p>
