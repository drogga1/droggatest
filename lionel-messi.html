In view of the above decision, the suspension for four matches imposed on Lionel Messi, which entered into force on March 28 2017, and the fine of £7,800 have been lifted</p>

For instance, a player liked by the fans can have higher compensation to reflect merchandise and ticket sales.<br /><br />For instance, a player such as Lionel Messi receives a weekly wage of €550,000 given that part of it is sponsorship, merchandise sales, image rights, and other incomes outside the scope of wins or performance on the field.<br /><br />Using pattern recognition, Messi’s predicted salary computed based on the performance and wages of the current football players in the major football leagues would have been about 50% less, although according to the method he would still be the world’s highest paid player.</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona star Lionel Messi is set to have a theme park opened in his honour, with the venue currently scheduled to open in 2020 in the Chinese city of Nanjing. David Xirau said]</b> It will be a tribute to football, not a space for self promotion.<br /><br />In China, football is growing at an exponential rate, encouraged by the authorities. Nanjing is a football capital here. It is a China-scale project, very big. It is around 80,000 square metres, most of which will be inside for weather reasons. It will be connected with Shanghai and we expect 4-5 million visitors a year, the vast majority of which will be Chinese tourists. It is expected to be working in 2020. The project will cost €170m as well as urban investments<br /><br />Michael Jordan, who is already retired, is the most valuable sporting brand in China. That is a very important point. This is a tribute to football with Leo’s trademark. With time we will have to update the space.<br /><br />Football does not begin and end with Leo, luckily. In fact, neither Pele, nor Cruyff nor Maradona lost their influence when they retired from football. Leo also has the advantage of his image. Our partner has exclusive right to do this project in China. We are working towards creating other Messi Experiences in other places, we are hoping for updates on that soon.<br /><br />The idea is for visitors to spend the whole day here. The project started as a museum but, as time went on, after seeing our partner and the Nanjing authorities’ ambition, we saw that it needed to be bigger. I don’t have the final price <b>[of the entrance fee]</b>. It will be comparable to the price of Disney Shanghai. It is above 40 dollars, but don’t take my word for it just yet.</p>

There was some fear of missing the World Cup. We let pass a lot of opportunities and we had to decide our future in this game. We had to qualify, now it’s time to enjoy</p>

The national team is living in a changing moment and obviously there’s a big respect for that team all around the world. For what it means, what it earned. But we must be realistic. If you want to be a challenger you must earn it on the pitch and there’s a lot of work to do before we become a challenger. A lot of players have only seven or eight games with the team so we must be patient. We can become a force because there’s enough potential</p>

I was delighted, because I was playing - and what you want is to play, wherever it is. I slowly grew fond of that position. I got used to it quickly actually, because playing on my opposite foot meant I could bring it onto my strong foot when I went inside, and it was easy for me to cut in and have a view of the pitch ahead of me.

The idea was that Madrid’s centre backs would follow me out, and the two fast wingers that we had would go around the back. In fact, one of Henry’s goals was like that. It was a surprise for us and for Madrid. I remember that we had a lot of possession, and we always had an extra man in the middle of the park.<br /><br />I’d never played as a centre forward, but I knew that position because it meant coming through from deep to get forward, without being a static number 9.

For me it’s a huge delight to be part of this award and the first team player to receive it. Of course, I would like to thank my team-mates, my family and the fans who support me. Thanks to them this kind of individual recognition is possible</p>

Time flies. I hope, God willing, that I keep playing for many more years. I’m now 32, though, and will be 33 at the end of the season, so, as I said, everything depends on how I feel physically.

Going to play with the best player in the world, who is still 32 and has three or four years ahead of him… to be Messi’s team-mate can make him even better and help him with the national team. Lautaro and Leo will improve their understanding on the pitch<br /><br /><b>[On the ability that he noted at a young age, with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> snubbed along the way]</b> I will never forget it. It was November 2013 and there were trials. Fabio Radaelli and Alfredo Acosta saw him on one of the teams and called me immediately: ‘Adrian, there’s an extraordinary player, we have to sign him whatever’. I told them our 1997 generation was already full of top talents, that we didn’t have space, but Fabio insisted that we backed this kid, so we signed him. Lautaro came in January 2014 and lived at the academy for two or three years. He was a clever kid, focused and humble. He always knew he wanted to be a professional. He did everything possible to achieve it and never lost sight of his big objective. He rejected an offer when he was with us from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. We told him the most important thing at that stage was to continue with Racing, to make his debut and to spend some time in the Argentine league. Luckily he listened to us and made his debut in October 2015 when he was just 18, coming on for none other than <a href="diego-milito.html">Diego Milito</a>. Now, in Italy, he’s showing everything we believed he would. He surprised us every day, despite being so young, because he was a complete forward and a pure goalscorer</p>

  <p><b>[Lionel Messi admits he could never have imagined the global repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic]</b> I don’t think anyone could have seen something like this coming. Some people warned that worldwide pandemics could happen from time to time, but I really never could have imagined it would unfold like it did, or the enormous impact it’s having on virtually the entire world. Living or working with so much uncertainty is never easy, especially when faced with a situation as unheard-of as this one. We all wonder when we’ll get back to work, when we’ll start training and competing again. For any soccer player, it’s crucial to stay focused when you hit the field<br /><br /><b>[Regarding the return of Spanish football without fans]</b> There is talk of finishing out the Spanish league’s season without spectators, which brings a whole set of challenges. The group preparation is the same as for any other game, but individually each person needs to prepare and visualise playing without fans, because it’s very strange. I had to do it for a home game, and it was downright spooky. But it’s normal that the league would resume this way after everything we’ve been going through. With all that’s happening in the world, it’s perfectly understandable. When we start playing again, it will be like starting from scratch. We’ll have some time to get ready before the league starts up, and we’ll also get back key players on our team who were injured. Technically it will still be the same season, but I think every team and player will feel it’s different. Even though I don’t play two games per week anymore, I try to train every day, and I do the drills they send us. It’s obviously a far cry from training with the team, and the worst part is not having the constant games, but it’s the new normal we have to live with. That’s why we’ll need some time to prepare before competing again.<br /><br />Pushing back the Copa America was a huge disappointment, but of course it was to be expected and was the reasonable thing to do. The Copa was going to be a big occasion for me this year, and I was extremely excited to compete in it again. It hit me hard when I learned it would be postponed, but I completely understood. We can’t dwell on what we’re leaving behind this year. It’s better to look to the future. To getting back to the daily training routine, to seeing team-mates, to playing the first games. I’m sure it will be strange at first, but I’m very eager to start competing again!</p>

  <p><b>[Where Messi favourite Lautaro would fit in at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> He is spectacular, he has incredible talent, you could see he was going to be a great player and now he has exploded and is showing it. He is very strong, he is brilliant in one-on-one situations, he scores goals, he takes on anyone in the area. He holds the ball up, he pivots, he goes looking for the ball. He has so much talent, he is a complete player</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> star Messi thinks coronavirus pandemic will change the game forever]</b> Most of us are left with doubts about what the world is going to be like after everything that has happened. Beyond the confinement and the situation that took us by surprise, many people had a really hard time because this situation affected them in some way, as it happened with all those who lost their family and friends and could not even see them. I think there were a lot of negative things in this crisis, but there can be nothing worse than losing the people you love the most, that creates enormous frustration for me and seems to me the most unfair thing of all. Soccer, like life in general, I think will never be the same<br /><br />The ambitions are the same, win all we can and I think that we’re in good shape to do that, I see the team doing well and it’s hopeful</p>
