  <p>[Chelsea will go into the biggest game of their season with record signing Alvaro Morata out of form, out of the team and suffering a crisis of confidence] I think the striker is the second most pressured position on the pitch after the goalkeeper. I think that the two things that I am constantly working on with strikers are acceptance and patience. Strikers are passionate about scoring, as you’d expect them to be, but sometimes wanting to score gets in the way, so much so that the game becomes out of your control. It is out of your control in general but especially as a striker.<br /><br />If I was a striker and I want to score, but the ball isn’t coming up to me and I am not getting chances to score, it can get quite stressful and the emotions come out. So, you have to be patient and the way to do that is to help a player have clear, concise and controllable objectives. I work with players on those things. Rather than focus on scoring, focus on things that are going to help you to score. The runs, the movement, great body language, keep talking to yourself positively and get shots away when you can.<br /><br />The other one of acceptance is a big one as well, which is if they miss a chance, often as a striker you have defenders trying to stop you. You only get a few chances and sometimes only one chance in a game. When you miss, it can be frustrating, again you really want to score, so they have to be very patient and accepting.<br /><br />If you miss, you just have to carry on, stay in the present moment and take each second and minute as it comes. If I miss, I can’t afford to have an emotional reaction, stay in the game, keep working, keep running, so I think acceptance and patience are really important. Self-talk and body language are very important. Not just to give myself the best chance to score. The reality is that a striker isn’t going to go into a game feeling always 10 out of 10 confident. That’s not the way the game works, that’s not the way we work as human beings.<br /><br />The main message is if we take those two objectives of body language and self-talk, I’d be affirming the idea that it is fine, you are feeling six out of 10 for confident. It is okay to not be 100%, but your job is to stick to your controllable objective. To use your self-talk and body language to give yourself the best possible chance to have a good game. In that way, you might feel six out of 10 but it gives yourself the best possible chance to play an eight out of 10 game.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Ronaldo has been open about the fact that their feuds over the years pushed him to new heights] A sports competitor might utilise the performances of a rival to work towards a set goal. Ronaldo might look at Messi and see him performing very well over the course of the season. That directs his brain towards thinking: ‘OK Messi’s scored goals, I want to score 10 goals, so I have to do A, B, C, D in training to give me the opportunity. Messi has grown up at La Masia and at Barcelona. They had this very unique culture whereby they have the capability of developing a group mentality. It’s very unique. It may well be that Ronaldo has been driven by Messi, but Messi has not been driven by Ronaldo.</p>
