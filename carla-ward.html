  <p><b>[When <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> met, City, reigning champions of the competition, had shown no mercy in their line-up]</b> I’m not going to lie, when I saw the team sheet I did think, ‘oh, here we go’. City are an outstanding side and they’ve got so much quality and on 15 minutes I even looked at my assistant and said, ‘it’s almost enjoyable to watch’, as painful as it is, because you can see us trying to stay in the game. They’re a quality side. We talk about it in the women’s game, that top four compared to even the bottom end of the WSL is a massive gulf, let alone the Championship</p>

  <p><b>[Carla Ward: <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> Women part company with manager]</b> I want to place on record my thanks to everyone at the football club for the opportunity to work at what’s been a very special club. From the moment I walked in, every single department has been so supportive and fully backing of the women’s team and I can’t thank them enough for that, it gave me an opportunity to learn and develop in my role and allowed us to achieve what we have on the pitch. For now a new fresh challenge is needed and I wish everyone at the football club the very best of luck</p>
