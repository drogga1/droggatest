  <p><b>[Lyon manager Bruno Genesio revealed that signing the 22-year-old is the club’s main priority at the moment]</b> Memphis Depay is a player who I have made a priority. The intention is that we capture him as soon as possible. I’m a fan. He is a complete, powerful and fascinating player.</p>

  <p><b>[Lyon boss Bruno Genesio has praised the contribution of Memphis Depay during his side’s 4-2 win over Dijon]</b> With a goal, his performance would have been perfect. We’ve seen him rediscover his athletic capabilities, his capacity to make a difference in one against one situations. He also played well with his team-mates. It was interesting for him and for the team.</p>

  <p><b>[Lyon’s Neymar? Nabil Fekir is even more important than PSG’s brilliant Brazilian]</b> I wouldn’t say it’s a new Nabil Fekir - it’s the one we knew before his injury but with more maturity. He’s made every effort to bounce back. He’s physically well, better in his head and has regained his best level. Since the start of the season, I feel he’s been completely focussed on the team. If I entrusted him to be captain, it’s because he’s been exemplary on the field and with his behaviour.</p>

  <p><b>[World class Memphis Depay back to his best in Lyon]</b> He’s a world-class player. He allows us to unblock certain situations or to secure the points at the end of games. He’s improved since he came to Lyon, notably in his consistency. He’s decisive and it’s what we ask of a player like him.<br /><br />He needed time to restore his confidence after a season wasted at Manchester United. He was put into question, but he’s worked and made sacrifices for the play of the team. And he’s being paid back now</p>

  <p><b>[On Moussa Dembele]</b> He’s the type of player we don’t have in our team. He’s a real No.9. We’ll need him, especially in the Champions League. He gives me more possibilities. He can play alone or with another forward by his side. His desire to come to the club really impressed me. He wanted to join our project after our first discussions with him.</p>

  <p><b>[Lyon vs Manchester City]</b> City are better than us, but we’ve already shown we can post them problems. We need to be at 120% all over the field and be efficient. We have to believe and play to our strengths. If my team is focused like in the first match, with the support of the fans we can do it again, but City are one of the best teams in Europe and favourites to win the final</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona vs Lyon]</b> We must play our game and be free. We know it will be difficult against one of the best teams in the world, but we know we’re capable of doing it because we’ve already done it. We have to show we deserve to be here and we must be inspired by what we did at Manchester City. It’s a different context and there’s an additional step to take up. What Ajax did against Real Madrid gives us strength.</p>

I had a very long conversation this morning with my president, in order to tell him that I will not continue next year.</p>

  <p><b>[Nabil Fekir needs to leave <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> and find a new challenge, his former coach Bruno Genesio has said amid speculation linking the striker to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I think that he <b>[Fekir]</b> was very frustrated with his canceled transfer to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> at the beginning of the season. He made the World Cup, he had some injuries. He certainly did not feel strong enough to take on the role of leader, which he had done the previous season, relaying technical information on the pitch. Nabil is coming to the end of a cycle in <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>. He has experienced a lot of things here. I think that he needs a new challenge, to push his limits, and to be self-critical. Because we know, we always need a personal challenge in a career, and to ask questions of ourselves.</p>

With the ball, to make the best use of it, he takes in information before anyone else to make the right choice. Without the ball, he brings balance to the team. When Nabil Fekir is out of position, he’s there, providing balance, alongside our defensive midfielder Lucas Tousart. He’s interesting because he’s one of those players capable of solving tactical problems with his game intelligence.<br /><br />He’s progressed with regards to the volume of his play, taking the initiative and with his use of the ball. He must, however, take a final step with his finishing; it’s the only element of the game that he’s lacking to become a very great player. He lacks a little focus in that final touch, but he has the technique to find it. He has to score six or eight goals a season</p>
