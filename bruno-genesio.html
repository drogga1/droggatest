  <p><b>[Nabil Fekir needs to leave Lyon and find a new challenge, his former coach Bruno Genesio has said amid speculation linking the striker to Liverpool]</b> I think that he <b>[Fekir]</b> was very frustrated with his canceled transfer to Liverpool at the beginning of the season. He made the World Cup, he had some injuries. He certainly did not feel strong enough to take on the role of leader, which he had done the previous season, relaying technical information on the pitch. Nabil is coming to the end of a cycle in Lyon. He has experienced a lot of things here. I think that he needs a new challenge, to push his limits, and to be self-critical. Because we know, we always need a personal challenge in a career, and to ask questions of ourselves.</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Tanguy Ndombele? Tottenham’s new midfield sensation compared to Chelsea star N’Golo Kante]</b> He’s thoughtful and intelligent. With the ball, to make the best use of it, he takes in information before anyone else to make the right choice. Without the ball, he brings balance to the team. When Nabil Fekir is out of position, he’s there, providing balance, alongside our defensive midfielder Lucas Tousart. He’s interesting because he’s one of those players capable of solving tactical problems with his game intelligence.<br /><br />He’s progressed with regards to the volume of his play, taking the initiative and with his use of the ball. He must, however, take a final step with his finishing; it’s the only element of the game that he’s lacking to become a very great player. He lacks a little focus in that final touch, but he has the technique to find it. He has to score six or eight goals a season</p>

  <p><b>[Less than a year ago, Nabil Fekir was on top of the world, having helped France to victory at Russia 2018. From €70m Liverpool target to unwanted at €30m - how Fekir’s value has plummeted in one year]</b> I think he was very frustrated with his non-transfer to Liverpool at the start of the season. He went to the World Cup, he had some injuries. He certainly did not feel strong enough to play a leading role, which he had done in the previous year, as the playmaker.<br /><br /><b>[Arsenal, meanwhile, are reported to have been in contact with Lyon over the player - but only if Mesut Ozil was to move on, something that looks distinctly improbable]</b> He’s come to the end of a cycle in Lyon. I think he needs to experience a fresh challenge, to push his limits and to be questioned. We always need a personal challenge in our careers</p>
