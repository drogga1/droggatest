<blockquote>
  <p><b>[what inspired the 33-year-old to become an academy manager in conjunction with the Black Cats, and what are the facilities like over there?]</b> I came to Tanzania in July 2015 after a number of years in academy football in England. Several factors inspired the move - namely there was a clear project that I could put my own stamp on. It was an opportunity to work with elite-level youth players from a different background, with professional players, and manage an elite academy in my own image<br /><br />There is also a significant element of coach education and coach mentoring which is a passion of mine. I guess an offer to work in a part of the world that most people don’t get to experience was also a big factor<br /><br />We have a unique facility here that is right in the centre of Dar es Salaam - the country’s biggest city. It is truly a world-class environment that you could find anywhere in Europe. To maximise our location we engage not just with elite academy-level players, but with the wider youth population too<br /><br /><b>[Talking about moving to another country without your family around to support]</b> Yes, I suppose I did <b>[experience a culture shock]</b>, although I also had and still have some good people around me to help with the transition. Missing my family is by far the biggest drawback here so I spend a lot of hours on FaceTime.<br /><br />Work wise one of the greatest challenges here is around age and proof of identity. Players can literally be whatever age they need to be, depending on what’s necessary. We had a guy who must have been at least 22 who we turned away when he turned up for an under-16 trial, only to have him come back the follow day to trial as an under-15<br /><br /><b>[About influencing the future of Tanzanian football]</b> I coach on, but mainly oversee, our under-12 soccer schools, our under-12 Elite Soccer School and our academy teams at under-14 and under-16. For all these we have a comprehensive Long Term Player Development curriculum<br /><br /><b>[Does Power recommend the overall experience of walking a path paved with excitement, uncertainty and numerous obstacles?]</b> It is hard not to recommend new experiences - it has certainly made me a better coach, and also a better communicator. Most kids here do not speak English, so for the sake of the coach translating I need to carefully pick and choose what I say and be clear and concise<br /><br />This is a challenge, but a great learning curve. I cannot really comment on coaches staying at home, because going abroad is simply not an option for some. Sometimes life takes over where risks like that cannot really be taken. The top earning coaches can take those risks, but the vast majority cannot. Moving around based on the job on offer was a decision of mine and my family, so we make it work. I guess if I ever relocated back in Ireland, I would have a CV like nobody else has, which is a plus<br /><br /><b>[Talks about his football credo]</b> My philosophy is to have players train with the ball and where everything we do is related directly to the game. To people outside the football world that may seem very obvious, but you will be amazed with how many sessions I see where players train without the ball, spend most of their time in queues or routinely passing <b>[or]</b> dribbling from one cone to another<br /><br />I aim to put players into positions where they are constantly dealing with the randomness of the game of football and are constantly making decisions. This was the inspiration behind the Deliberate Soccer Practice series that I have had published recently. My views on the game are to dominate the ball through possession, be fluid in the attacking half of the pitch, have players express themselves and ultimately to be able to attack and defend in both boxes - that is where games are won and lost<br /><br />So I guess my one piece of advice to both coaches and players would be to embrace the randomness of the game and prepare players to be able to deal with this - and not just having experience of standing on the training pitch in a queue to complete some pre-described move<br /><br /><b>[Power is open to a move back to his homeland but remains realistic enough to know that anything could happen in the coming months as he plots any upcoming moves]</b> It is so hard to predict next steps in this game. Just prior to leaving England I was about to go full-time in coach education, rather than coaching or managing, so these things change quickly<br /><br />A friend of mine <a href="louis-lancaster.html">Louis Lancaster</a> recently moved to the coach in the Chinese Super League, another into coach education and another is manager of a small nation in Oceania. You could honestly swap those three guys around their jobs and all would do very well - it is often a matter of when and where these offers come from<br /><br /><b>[So who are his role models at a time where flashy, philosophising supremos are ten a penny?]</b> In football today I see a new wave of young, progressive coaches that are moving the game forward - and I am especially <b>[drawn]</b> to those who’s teams look to dominate the ball. Everywhere I have coached I have insisted on this<br /><br /><a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> is the obvious one, but I also love watching and reading about the likes of <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham Hotspur</a>, <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Thomas Tuchel</a> at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> and <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> who’s now at <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>. You could probably add <a href="joachim-low.html">Joachim Löw</a> to that list with the German national team, and also some of the more experienced coaches like <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsène Wenger</a> and Vicente del Bosque<br /><br />Seeing how <a href="stephen-kenny.html">Stephen Kenny</a> has Dundalk playing is also great, and in terms of fluid attacking, watching what Jürgen <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has done at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> lately has been wonderful to see. In my eyes they are revolutionising the game and how it’s played and perceived. I try to watch and absorb as much from these guys, and others, as I can, keeping what I like and parking anything that conflicts</p>
