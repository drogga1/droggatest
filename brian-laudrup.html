  <p><b>[Brian Laudrup on Roberto Baggio]</b> He’s without doubt the most skilful number ten in the modern game, the archetypal playmaker, if you like, who can create chances and score goals</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Brian Laudrup, his ex-Fiorentina teammate on Batigol]</b> <b>[…]</b> I was watching him in training for the first couple of days and he was one of the worst trainers I’d ever seen <b>[…]</b> His technique was lousy, his shots were going wide - but then he scored ten goals in the first five or six games and I realised what a player he was</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On Gianfranco Zola]</b> ‘The magician’ did things with the ball I’ve never seen before or since. Had brilliant technique and incredible balance, almost a carbon copy of <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>, with whom he played at <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>. His free-kicks were extraordinary. A true artist, who could show you things you didn’t know about the game, and the perfect foil for a big, strong striker</p>

<h4 id="2016-02-17-retrieve">2016 02 17 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Quotes on Marcel Desailly]</b> Definitely the hardest player to come up against - it was nearly impossible to get past him because, for a player of his physique, he had incredible balance. It was always good to have him on your team, because he did the work of three men. He was so good that he filled his offensive players with confidence. You knew, with him on the pitch, you’d never get caught on the counter-attack</p>

<h4 id="2016-02-18-retrieve">2016 02 18 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Quotes on Paul Gascoigne]</b> I played with him at Rangers and in his prime he was one of the best players in the world. He glided with the ball in a way that made him virtually untouchable for opponents and he was a match-winner, who had great technique when striking the ball. He was also a great entertainer - on and off the pitch! A tremendous natural talent</p>

<h4 id="2019-11-21-retrieve">2019 11 21 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Why is Celtic vs Rangers called the Old Firm Derby? Rangers legend Brian Laudrup calling the clash terrifying]</b> As soon as you join one of these clubs, from the very first minutes you are told about this game. To play in one was terrifying. It was a bit scary but on the other hand it’s tremendous to be involved in one of the world’s biggest derbies. For these players it’s tremendous. They have read about the derby and heard about it from those who have played in the game but to actually be part of it is completely different. It’s something they will never forget</p>
