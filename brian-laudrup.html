  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="marcel-desailly.html">Marcel Desailly</a>]</b> Definitely the hardest player to come up against - it was nearly impossible to get past him because, for a player of his physique, he had incredible balance. It was always good to have him on your team, because he did the work of three men. He was so good that he filled his offensive players with confidence. You knew, with him on the pitch, you’d never get caught on the counter-attack</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="paul-gascoigne.html">Paul Gascoigne</a>]</b> I played with him at Rangers and in his prime he was one of the best players in the world. He glided with the ball in a way that made him virtually untouchable for opponents and he was a match-winner, who had great technique when striking the ball. He was also a great entertainer - on and off the pitch! A tremendous natural talent</p>

  <p><b>[Brian Laudrup reveals inspiration behind iconic 1998 World Cup celebration]</b> It was not really prepared but, before the game, my son said to me ‘Dad, you’re so boring when you celebrate after the goals. Come out with something’. And I was a little inspired by Roberto Di Matteo. I remembered when watching Chelsea’s games, he scored a goal and he lay down more or less in the same way. I thought he looked like he actually resisted it, because all the other players came and joined him. So, I said ‘OK, if I score against Brazil, I will do something similar’. But I didn’t tell anybody. I kept it to myself. And I scored, it was a pretty nice goal. So, that’s why I did such a strange thing! People still talk about that, and still remember. It was good<br /><br />For any footballer, and especially from our part of the world, playing against Brazil is always something unique. It’s not where football was invented, but if you ask all of the players who they would like to play against in a World Cup, they will say Brazil. Playing in the quarter-finals of the World Cup against Brazil is very particular, it puts a lot of pressure on you until the final whistle of the game, but it also motivates and excites you. That was always absolutely fantastic. A lot of people said before the game that Denmark would lose easily. But we played really well. Sometimes, in our part of the world, people described us, because of our style of play, as the Brazilians of Scandinavia. I don’t know if that’s true. But playing against the real Brazil was absolutely incredible. And that’s one of the memorable games that I played in at such a high level. There is no doubt about that<br /><br />I think we’re in a new era. Because we had the same manager for 16 years, Morten Olsen and, today with Age Hareide, we have a new coach, with different ideas. There is a more direct way of playing, with a lot of pressure on the ball. I’m quietly confident about the World Cup. I think that, if we use the strength that we have, and we avoid injuries, we can get to the next stage. But then, and we all know it, it depends on luck and how we will be on D-Day. Hopefully France, who are favourites will maybe finish first, and Denmark will take second place and get to the next stage. And that would be a good achievement for Denmark</p>

  <p><b>[Why is <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> vs Rangers called the Old Firm Derby? Rangers legend Brian Laudrup calling the clash terrifying]</b> As soon as you join one of these clubs, from the very first minutes you are told about this game. To play in one was terrifying. It was a bit scary but on the other hand it’s tremendous to be involved in one of the world’s biggest derbies. For these players it’s tremendous. They have read about the derby and heard about it from those who have played in the game but to actually be part of it is completely different. It’s something they will never forget</p>
