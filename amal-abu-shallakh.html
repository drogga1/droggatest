<blockquote>
  <p>[UAE Women’s team geared up for first ever AFC Women’s Asian Cup qualifying campaign] We started from scratch.<br /><br />Thanks to the interest and support shown by Sheikh Hazza Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who is the Vice-chairman of the Abu Dhabi Executive Council and Honorary Chairman of the UAE Football Association [FA], we established the Abu Dhabi Sport Club in 2004, so as to give young girls the chance to take part in all kinds of sports, including football, in line with the country’s habits and customs.<br /><br />We took that first step and the FA then approved the sport. The Women’s Football Committee was set up in 2009, and we created a women’s team on a sound basis. We hosted the West Asian Championship twice and came out on top both times, despite the presence of strong teams like Jordan and Islamic Republic of Iran.<br /><br />Now we’re hopeful that the team can qualify for the 2018 AFC Women’s Asian Cup, which would give our development efforts a real shot in the arm. We launched our school leagues - with 16 U-13 and U-15 teams - in 2012. We then built on that success by launching national teams at U-14 and U-16 level. Last but not least, we strengthened our presence right across the UAE by opening 22 training centres</p>
