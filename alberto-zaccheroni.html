You can achieve success in different ways, but <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> wants balance and looks after the defence and the attack, just like Antonio Conte. Maybe there are differences in intensity. Conte has always been a Juventus icon and managed to take Juventus back to their level and this leads to the fans loving him more than <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a>. Juventus fans will love <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> in the future … .<br /><br /><b>[On Simone Inzaghi]</b> Having managed him as a player, he didn’t look so determined. I remember he was very passionate about football. But I didn’t expect him to become a manager. He lacked determination. He had quality as a player although he could have achieved much more. He still had a very decent career, but I didn’t see that determination in him that he could pass on to his players</p>
