  <p>[Boukary Drame insists he still has the hunger to play in Serie A at the age of 33] I’m still waiting for a good challenge. My priority is to play again. I dont’ know what the clubs have today… It’s true that there were problems with the coach in Bergamo, I had little playing time at SPAL, but I played several seasons in Serie A and I couldn’t become a bad player overnight.<br /><br />“I still have the strength and energy to play. But in France, at 33 years old, we tend to say you’re burned. I don’t understand why. It’s not the same mentality here, in Italy. I have played several years at the top level, I have experience. For me, the club has nothing to lose to take me. Without being too pretentious, I think I’ve already shown things. If I played several years in the first division, it is because I have qualities. I’m a little surprised, but I’m not losing hope. Some clubs may have gaps in my position and I stand ready if one of them needs me<br /><br />The coach said, ‘with me, the injured players will have problems’. It went wrong for me when he arived. I regret that the medical staff didn’t help me more. It was not entirely my fault</p>
