  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney would be a great player for MLS]</b> There is interest in Wayne Rooney from our end and I think there is interest from his end too. I hope it can get over the line because he’s a very good player who can help us. He would be a great player for this league.<br /><br />Nothing is done, so I don’t want to get into talk of arrival until he actually arrives. Nothing is ever done in this world and when you’re looking at a deal of this scope and size. We’ll see, but hopefully we can get it done</p>

  <p><b>[Several hours before DC United inaugurated Audi Field on Saturday, manager Ben Olsen took a stroll by himself around the silent stadium]</b> I wanted to look around because I knew once the game happened, I wasn’t going to be able to appreciate the moment. <b>[Thinking]</b> how long of a struggle this club has gone through to get this building. We just never thought it was going to be built<br /><br /><b>[With the introduction of Rooney and two second-half Arriola goals, eventually the stadium awakened]</b> They got there. The energy got there. It took a couple goals to get that building rocking. This is one of the great nights in DC United history, and we’ve had some good ones</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney’s quality shows through in winning debut for DC United]</b> There’s been a lot of talk about where’s Wayne going to play. In my mind he’s a number nine, but he’s a versatile nine. We can use him in a bunch of different roles, whether he drops off as a 10, and service some areas. He can play the eight for you and still play-make out of that position. It’s nice to have versatility and I think he’s going to be just fine in whatever role we use him in.<br /><br />What he will bring is a real tactical sense in what the game needs, and not in a way that benefits him only. He’s going to understand when he needs to stay high in this moment, to now leave space for Lucho <b>[Acosta]</b>, because ultimately Lucho is going to be the one to give him the ball. If someone is playing over the top, he understands when to come low. You see that in a very short amount of time, not only in the trainings, but in the game today. The speed of play here, when guys come over that have been playing at the level they’ve been playing at for a that long, it’s a touch slow. And they exploit it with their brains, they exploit it with their quality. He’s going to be a nice addition</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney was at it again for DC United]</b> There wasn’t any question in our mind whether he was going to serve that ball. It’s exciting to have a player like that over the ball in those moments,” the D.C. boss continued. “I think today was a day where we needed a moment.</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney double helps D.C. United complete climb into playoffs]</b> He’s changed the way we play, and particularly in the offensive half. His influence in the locker room is something people talk about and kind of see, but it’s bigger than that. It’s bigger than what even people are seeing from the outside. So he’s been a great addition.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="landon-donovan.html">Landon Donovan</a> become a coach]</b> When you’re starting out, you’re not always sure who you are as a coach and as a leader. Sometimes you have to jump in to figure that out</p>

  <p><b>[Luciano Acosta has been backed by Wayne Rooney to one day join a top club]</b> As much as a disappointment as <b>[PSG]</b> is for him, he loves the game of soccer. He is going to have to readjust. How long that takes? It shouldn’t take that long. Again, the kid loves to play this game. I think he will be okay. He has got a long career ahead of him and he will get to where he wants - and needs - if he continues on this progression.<br /><br />First and foremost, I am disappointed for him. As much as world soccer is about money, it’s still a human business. The kid was extremely excited when he left, but he is also a smart kid. He will readjust as we all do with disappointment and get back to his job with D.C. United. He knows he has a family here waiting for him</p>

  <p><b>[United manager Ben Olsen doesn’t seem worried about how Wayne Rooney will handle the additional workload in 2019]</b> I’m not too concerned with how the schedule will affect Wayne. We feel as if we have a well thought-out plan physically for him to set him up to succeed.<br /><br /><b>[Wayne Rooney and Luciano Acosta]</b> It’s a very tough duo to prepare for because of the unpredictability of Lucho and Wayne’s intelligence and experience</p>
