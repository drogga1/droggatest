  <p><b>[DC United has announced the signing of midfielder Ian Harkes as a homegrown player]</b> I’ve known Ian nearly his entire life and have watched him develop into one of the nation’s best young talents. He has all the tools to succeed at the next level and I look forward to being a part of his pro career.</p>

  <p><b>[DC United defense entering 2017 with new options]</b> There’s some good problems there as a coach in that you’re going to have a lot of quality pieces over the next two months to fight for playing time. It’s going to be a headache at times because everybody wants to play, but I’d rather have it that way than not have enough options.<br /><br /><b>[Nick DeLeon also could provide depth behind Taylor Kemp at left back]</b> I know it’s been a little bit of a frustrating process probably for Nick, not to really nail down a position at this point in his career. But he’s played a lot of games, and sometimes versatility can hurt you and sometimes it can help you</p>

  <p><b>[Why many talented international players won’t be drafted by MLS teams]</b> The league and NCAA and everybody needs to think a little more about this part because as more TAM <b>[targeted allocation money]</b> comes in, a lot of it is being used on foreigners, so foreign spots are going to become even more crucial to have. Sometimes it’s tough to pull the trigger on a foreign college kid because of that.<br /><br />That’s short-term stuff though. If you think a <b>[foreign draft pick]</b> can make an impact right away, then it’s worth that. If not, maybe you have a USL 2 team and you believe in a year or two they can contribute so they’re worth a spot on that roster. There’s creative ways to deal with it</p>

  <p><b>[On Chris Durkin]</b> Maybe because of Pulisic and some of the other guys really taking it to the next level at a young age that heightens expectations, not only with the media, but also with the players themselves. Everybody’s path is different. I’ve always told this to homegrowns: Not everyone is Andy Najar and jumps on the field and plays. Sometimes it takes more time to get on the field and become a key component on a team. Jalen <b>[Robinson]</b> is a little bit of a slow cooker with us. Every year he gets a little bit more playing time, and becomes more vital to our group. Everyone has their own path, and we’ll see what Chris’ path is.<br /><br /><b>[Durkin just turned 18 last week]</b> I think it was a great year for him, from a development standpoint. And now expectations and everyone is <b>[saying]</b>, ‘What’s next? What’s next?’. What’s next is he comes to preseason, and he competes for a spot and he shows us he’s ready to get on the field, like every other player we have coming in<br /><br />I love his physicality, I love his mentality. He’s aggressive in everything he does. I think at times he needs to refine some of that aggression and wanting to stamp out every play. He’s still a very young player, and still needs to fine-tune his game in a lot of different areas, but I’d rather have it that way, where you have to pull a kid back. He’s a very competitive kid. He wants to be on the field, and the challenge is finding that sweet spot so he’s developing at a very good clip. We’ll have a very good plan to continue that development this year<br /><br />I think our club, and me personally, has shown that I will play academy kids in a lot of ways more than any coach this league’s ever seen. Harkes, Bill, <b>[Conor]</b> Shanosky, Ethan White, Andy. You go down the list. When and if <b>[Durkin]</b> is ready, we’ll get him out there, but you have to keep this in perspective. He’s a great young talent. We see the Richmond games, and World Cup games, and follow him very closely, but we haven’t seen him in our environment a lot last year. So now it’ll be nice to see him over the two months of preseason and kind of see where he’s at and how he stacks up against everybody</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney would be a great player for MLS]</b> There is interest in Wayne Rooney from our end and I think there is interest from his end too. I hope it can get over the line because he’s a very good player who can help us. He would be a great player for this league.<br /><br />Nothing is done, so I don’t want to get into talk of arrival until he actually arrives. Nothing is ever done in this world and when you’re looking at a deal of this scope and size. We’ll see, but hopefully we can get it done</p>

  <p><b>[Several hours before DC United inaugurated Audi Field on Saturday, manager Ben Olsen took a stroll by himself around the silent stadium]</b> I wanted to look around because I knew once the game happened, I wasn’t going to be able to appreciate the moment. <b>[Thinking]</b> how long of a struggle this club has gone through to get this building. We just never thought it was going to be built<br /><br /><b>[With the introduction of Rooney and two second-half Arriola goals, eventually the stadium awakened]</b> They got there. The energy got there. It took a couple goals to get that building rocking. This is one of the great nights in DC United history, and we’ve had some good ones</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney’s quality shows through in winning debut for DC United]</b> There’s been a lot of talk about where’s Wayne going to play. In my mind he’s a number nine, but he’s a versatile nine. We can use him in a bunch of different roles, whether he drops off as a 10, and service some areas. He can play the eight for you and still play-make out of that position. It’s nice to have versatility and I think he’s going to be just fine in whatever role we use him in.<br /><br />What he will bring is a real tactical sense in what the game needs, and not in a way that benefits him only. He’s going to understand when he needs to stay high in this moment, to now leave space for Lucho <b>[Acosta]</b>, because ultimately Lucho is going to be the one to give him the ball. If someone is playing over the top, he understands when to come low. You see that in a very short amount of time, not only in the trainings, but in the game today. The speed of play here, when guys come over that have been playing at the level they’ve been playing at for a that long, it’s a touch slow. And they exploit it with their brains, they exploit it with their quality. He’s going to be a nice addition</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney was at it again for DC United]</b> There wasn’t any question in our mind whether he was going to serve that ball. It’s exciting to have a player like that over the ball in those moments. I think today was a day where we needed a moment.</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney double helps D.C. United complete climb into playoffs]</b> He’s changed the way we play, and particularly in the offensive half. His influence in the locker room is something people talk about and kind of see, but it’s bigger than that. It’s bigger than what even people are seeing from the outside. So he’s been a great addition.</p>

  <p><b>[Luciano Acosta has been backed by Wayne Rooney to one day join a top club]</b> As much as a disappointment as <b>[PSG]</b> is for him, he loves the game of soccer. He is going to have to readjust. How long that takes? It shouldn’t take that long. Again, the kid loves to play this game. I think he will be okay. He has got a long career ahead of him and he will get to where he wants - and needs - if he continues on this progression.<br /><br />First and foremost, I am disappointed for him. As much as world soccer is about money, it’s still a human business. The kid was extremely excited when he left, but he is also a smart kid. He will readjust as we all do with disappointment and get back to his job with D.C. United. He knows he has a family here waiting for him</p>

  <p><b>[United manager Ben Olsen doesn’t seem worried about how Wayne Rooney will handle the additional workload in 2019]</b> I’m not too concerned with how the schedule will affect Wayne. We feel as if we have a well thought-out plan physically for him to set him up to succeed.<br /><br /><b>[Wayne Rooney and Luciano Acosta]</b> It’s a very tough duo to prepare for because of the unpredictability of Lucho and Wayne’s intelligence and experience</p>
