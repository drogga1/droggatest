  <p><b>[Euro 2012 was awarded to Ukraine and Poland in March 2007]</b> This is my dream, and it is also a dream of my countrymen. It is huge to finish my international career at such a tournament in front of my home crowd<br /><br /><b>[As a child he had to be evacuated from the Chernobyl region]</b> It will be a great achievement if my goals and the victories they bring will remind the world of that great catastrophe and its victims<br /><br /><b>[Shevchenko claims he still enjoys playing, and even went back on the intention to retire completely after Ukraine finish their part in Euro 2012]</b> I will continue as long as I have positive emotions</p>

  <p><b>[For Ukraine Striker, Ending Is Also a Beginning]</b> My whole life has been connected with this ball<br /><br />I have several offers. I asked everyone to wait until the end of this tournament so I can decide what to do<br /><br />All my dreams came true. My best characteristic is that I made the most important goals in the most difficult games<br /><br />I’m 35; I don’t have a lot of time left. I’ve prepared very seriously<br /><br /><b>[A month before the disaster at Chernobyl, Shevchenko, then age 9, signed with the youth team at Dynamo Kiev]</b> My first coach came to my house and talked to my parents. I went back and started training seriously at Dynamo<br /><br /><b>[Shevchenko said he believed the British news media was overstating the extent of racism in Ukraine]</b> They talk about Ukraine like we don’t have culture, like we don’t have nothing. Of course, we have a lot of problems, but people are nice. I don’t see this racism<br /><br /><b>[Yanukovich became Ukraine’s president in 2010. Ukrainian politics are again stormy]</b> I’m not taking any side. I took sides long ago. Now, I represent Ukraine to the world. I have my own mission<br /><br /><b>[He said he saw no purpose in a political boycott]</b> If European leaders want to change something, they don’t have to use sports for it<br /><br /><b>[But his main interest remains soccer, Shevchenko said. After his playing career ends, he wants to coach]</b> This is the world I understand, the world I want to stay in</p>

  <p><b>[Andriy Shevchenko has backed AC Milan legends Paolo Maldini and Zvonimir Boban to put the club ‘back where it used to be’ after they were given key backroom roles]</b> Maldini and Boban will guarantee that the club mentality does not change. They will do well. Paolo is growing as a manager. The expectations are high, but I believe that Paolo and ‘Zvone’ will bring Milan back where they used to be.<br /><br /><b>[Marco Giampaolo was appointed head coach in June and Shevchenko has been impressed by the former Sampdoria and Empoli boss]</b> He seems like a guy with strong ideas, like these managers <b>[Maldini and Boban]</b>. Giampaolo is a coach who can achieve great results through play. He gives the impression he is prepared: I believe it was a good choice<br /><br /><b>[The 24-year-old Piatek is set to wear the iconic number nine shirt, following on from such names as Filippo Inzaghi, Marco van Basten and George Weah, and Shevchenko said the Poland international is a worthy successor]</b> The way he entered Milan, the naturalness, the important goals he scored, it was a great impact and now it is right that Kris also takes responsibility for such an important shirt. It’s not just about wearing certain shirts. Milan’s story itself is both beautiful and difficult to wear on the skin. This is demonstrated by the attachment of the fans: in recent times the results have not been the same, yet I have seen that at Milanello for the first day of training there were thousands of people</p>

  <p><b>[Coronavirus crisis reminds Shevchenko of Chernobyl]</b> I’m near London, I live just outside the city. I’ve been locked in for almost 10 days. We live this difficult moment with hope, hope that things will improve. The only solution is to respect the rules laid out by the government, stay at home and give doctors the opportunity to do their job. All the doctors in the world are doing a great job, the nurses, <b>[the]</b> volunteers. Thank you so much for all that you’re doing for us. You’re truly the heroes of our time. I experienced a very similar situation when I was nine years old and the Chernobyl power plant broke out. It was a difficult time. The only solution is to believe in government decisions. We don’t have to do stupid things, especially not leaving the house. We don’t know if we have the virus or not, there are many people who can be infected and carry the virus with them, continuing to pass it on to other people without symptoms. We mustn’t only think about ourselves but also the many other people we can infect</p>
