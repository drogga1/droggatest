  <p>[Selangor have issued a statement confirming that their striker Forkey Doe has been detained by the Malaysian police, allegedly for driving an unregistered car] The Selangor FA is surprised with the news of Forkey Doe’s arrest, but is unaware of any problems with the car in question, as it has been bought by the player himself and not the one provided by us. The status of Forkey Doe as a player at the club now depends on the police’s investigation</p>

  <p>[FAS secretary-general Rosman Ibrahim has slammed the match official assigned to the Perak vs Selangor match on Tuesday; Nafeez Abd Wahab] We’ve submitted an appeal to the FAM this morning and asked them to review the footage from the match. We are not satisfied [with the refereeing], and ask that he not be assigned to officiate our matches in the future. His refereeing is frankly embarrassing to the league, he was not even looking at Andik before sending him off! The referee was running up the pitch, and when the incident happened he immediately flashed the red card.<br /><br />We can’t do much about it [the sending off], although we have appealed the red card our next match is this Saturday. We’ve lodged a complaint against the referee, Andik will be suspended for one match, and he will definitely be unavailable this Saturday</p>
