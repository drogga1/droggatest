<blockquote>
  <p>[Royal Eagles co-owner Sbu Mpisane says the police who are reportedly looking for attacking midfielder Masibusani Zongo should be charged with incompetence] 2013? And they want him now in 2017? Who is that policeman, I need to open a case against him. You can’t be a policeman and be looking for a suspect for so many years. If I were to open a case against you today, you would be arrested by next weekend. How could they be looking for him for so long. Zongo is not a hardened criminal … He played at Platinum Stars and at Chippa [United] but unfortunately he has not played in any of our matches, where were those police?<br /><br />We don’t know where Zongo is. But I want to investigate this issue further. Maybe I should call that policeman and ask why he is looking for him now. That is gross negligent. Everyone knows where Platinum Stars, Chippa and Eagles are based. All they had to do was come to the games and wait for him in the change room and call him aside and arrest him</p>
