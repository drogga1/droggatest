<blockquote>
  <p>[Steven Gerrard has taken a massive gamble with Rangers] What the expectation should be is to get closer to Celtic, I think. Hopefully cup finals and potentially winning a trophy. But, realistically it’ll be winning the league. I think that’s always the case at Rangers, that’s what the fans expect. That’s what they want. Celtic are going for eight [titles] in a row, the panic button’s starting to get pressed and it’s a really difficult situation to be in but he looks like he’s up for the challenge. It’s a gamble on both parts. It’s a gamble for Rangers because he’s got a lack of managerial experience but it’s a gamble for him because he’s starting off in his managerial career chasing a really good Celtic team. It’s a massive gamble, it’s going to be really, really interesting. I think we’re all fascinated to see how it pans out. We all know up here if you’re not winning the league at Rangers then you’re in a very precarious position.<br /><br />They need some experience, they need some sort of know-how to come into the league and both those lads have that. You could look at the squad and say the manager needs to improve in all areas to challenge Celtic but it’s not easy done. Where do you get those players? How do you afford those players? You go to the Championship [in England], you’re getting good players but they’re on big, big money, and money probably above what Rangers are willing to pay now</p>
