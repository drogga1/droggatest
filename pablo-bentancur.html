  <p><b>[Lucas Torreira’s agent Pablo Bentancur has revealed the midfielder could be tempted to reunite with former manager Marco Giampaolo at AC Milan]</b> I know nothing about the Rossoneri’s interest, no one contacted me. I have learned of this possibility through the press. Could a call from Giampaolo be something special for Lucas? Yes, clearly.</p>

  <p><b>[The main source of <a href="lucas-torreira.html">Lucas Torreira</a>’s frustration stems from Emery’s decision to move him away from the defensive midfield position where he excelled in his early months in England and play him in a more advanced role]</b> I must say that change has penalised him sharply. He is no longer at ease and we hope that things can change</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Torreira has seen his future at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> called into question on a regular basis]</b> Lucas had been in a bit of a bad mood over some technical differences, then he recovered. And the injury arrived, fortunately less serious than expected. Today he is completely recovered, I believe he will be a market man (meaning he will be high demand when the transfer window opens). I will have to speak to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. The player would love to return to Italy, but it must be acknowledged that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> treated him very well and behaved great.<br /><br />Uruguay continues to be the best territory in South America for young players. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> has submitted a project to the government for the development of young footballers in Uruguay. Football in general will have to be careful. Before the money came from the TV, today it is not known how and if it will start again</p>
