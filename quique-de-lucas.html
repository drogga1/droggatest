  <p><b>[Quique de Lucas says <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a> is capable of offering the <a href="gianfranco-zola.html">Gianfranco Zola</a> esque X-factor that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are crying out for]</b> They don’t have that star figure we had on the pitch in <a href="gianfranco-zola.html">Zola</a>. That is worrying. They need to find it. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> need to find that X-factor. Maybe it will be <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a>. It’s difficult. No-one has that experience. For me, the one that can make the difference, albeit in a different way, has to be Frank. The fact he was part of the 2002-03 side who did it having only signed myself has to help him. He knows the club, what it means to play for the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> shirt. The young players have to learn that when you put the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> top on. Everyone is going to try to beat you. You have to be right at the top to win games<br /><br />You could tell Frank would be a coach and Jody <b>[Morris]</b> would be his No. 2. They were always together, on and off the pitch. <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a>, too. There was a chemistry between them and you can see it now that they have the job at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. It was just a matter of time. Frank didn’t have the aura as a player he would go on to have. He would struggle sometimes to understand how <b>[Claudio]</b> <a href="claudio-ranieri.html">Ranieri</a> wanted him to play. Sometimes, he would be picked in different positions, like on the right of midfield. He wasn’t the fastest or the kind of player to dribble past two or three people, so it didn’t suit him.</p>
