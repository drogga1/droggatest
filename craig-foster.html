  <p><b>[Southern Expansion’s vision and commitment enticed Craig Foster]</b> This is another opportunity now to influence the game very directly. So I believe, very simply, that the professional game in the next 20 years will be the key driver of our success as a sport.<br /><br />In the second decade, they <b>[MLS]</b> found they needed to make a greater investment. That to get from stage two to three is a significant challenge and that you need tremendous ambition and investment - not just in clubs and players but in infrastructure as well. So that’s at the heart of this bid to take the game forward rather than we’d just like to be a part of the A-League and/or the W-League<br /><br />We believe in 10 years’ time that <b>[a football-specific stadium]</b> will be a fundamental requirement of any new professional football club, so why not do it now?</p>

  <p><b>[Former Socceroos midfielder Craig Foster has claimed Southern Expansion will expand the vision of football in Australia]</b> It’s not just about expanding the number of teams but expanding the vision of the game.<br /><br />So many of the Matildas and the Socceroos, of course, now and historically come from this region. This is one of the greatest talent bases in the country, as yet without their own professional club pathway. That’s what we’re here for. We want to take these kids to the top of the game<br /><br />We need them to be strong for us to be strong. So we’re saying to our associations ‘we’ll support you at state government, local council and federal government level for your funding support. We want you to have major facilities’. We want the best facilities across this region of any region in the country</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Hakeem Al-Araibi? The Australian refugee &amp; ex-Bahrain footballer being held prisoner in Thailand]</b> He’s a human rights defender. He’s a very courageous young man, who, in 2016, stood up to the Bahraini government, stood up to Sheikh Salman, the president of the AFC, and was critical of them and their conduct during that period.</p>

  <p><b>[A question regarding Bahraini refugee Hakeem Al-Araibi has been swiftly shutdown at a Socceroos press conference at the Asian Cup]</b> Hakeem is losing hope. He’s feeling very vulnerable and he’s extremely worried about going back to Bahrain. While FIFA are silent, they are complicit - as is Sheikh Salman - they are complicit in Hakeem Al-Araibi sitting in a cell here.</p>

  <p><b>[Craig Foster calls for AFC president Sheikh Salman to be sacked over Hakeem Al-Araibi detention]</b> This statement betrays every principle of international sport governance. Admission of conflict, morally bankrupt, investigation required in due course. This person can play no further role in sport. Had AFC acted on 27 Nov, injustice of 62 days likely averted #SaveHakeem.<br /><br />Salman will be held to account under FIFA/AFC Art 3 Human Rights provisions.<br /><br />Duty of care to Hakeem has been breached by remaining President despite numerous calls to vacate the office. Hakeem might later explore case in damages against AFC, FIFA #SaveHakeem.</p>

  <p><b>[Craig Foster has declared the plight of Bahraini refugee Hakeem Al-Araibi an absolute emergency]</b> This matter has become an absolute emergency. We want it to be resolved this week - before Friday<br /><br />It was a good outcome and we have got FIFA to escalate the issue and to acknowledge it is now an emergency. FIFA have agreed that the next step is to articulate that all the attention has been on Thailand and Bahrain have been left aside unfairly. I can only thank FIFA for agreeing to meet us.<br /><br />In true Aussie fashion we rocked up on their doorstep and they gave us their time, and for that, we are very grateful. Given the actions of Bahrain this morning, there really is no time to lose and we want it to be resolved this week, before Friday</p>

  <p><b>[Craig Foster praises successful effort to save Hakeem al-Araibi]</b> This is a win for humanity, for the power of the citizen of the world demanding that human rights be protected, a step forward for Thailand, a challenge for Australia and the beginning of a broader fight for the values of sport. If the people of the world decide tomorrow that it will not be so, that we value human life above unjust laws, retribution and royal edicts, who is to stop us after all? We fought for one soul because Hakeem represented everyone who suffers under tyranny, and through him, we hope to build a better world. One person at a time</p>
