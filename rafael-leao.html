  <p><b>[<a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> and Inter to play first ever virtual Milan derby on Pro Evolution Soccer 2020]</b> We can’t physically be on a football pitch right now, so it will be quite fun to represent my team and play against Sebastiano <b>[Esposito]</b> on PES. This is a derby after all and I want to win, but most importantly this is a way to be a little closer to our fans in these difficult times</p>
