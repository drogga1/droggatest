  <p><b>[Man Utd &amp; Real Madrid target Rafael Leao says Ronaldo is the best in the world and the example to follow]</b> I really like Bas Dost, who talks a lot to me in practice and gives me lots of advice. I learn a lot from him about the making of goals. Gelson Martins is also a benchmark for me, he does incredible things with the ball at his feet. But I think the best in the world is Cristiano Ronaldo, who has made a successful career with a lot of hard work and, like me, came through the Sporting academy and is a great example to follow.<br /><br />I know that I have a lot to learn and that my attitude and commitment are fundamental to me achieving my dreams. I’m still young and I am not in a hurry to do so. I am in the right place, I take my work seriously and the coach <b>[Jorge Jesus]</b> and the whole structure of Sporting give me support. My more experienced colleagues also give me a lot of advice, which I try to follow, as do my parents, brothers and cousins. There are a lot of cases where things have not gone well for other youngsters, and I do not want to become another statistic. Just because I’ve already played in the first team does not mean that I know everything. I thank God for the opportunity that Jorge Jesus has given me with the first team, but I cannot forget the other coaches I had during my training, such as Joao Couto, Tiago Fernandes and Luís Martins - all of them were important</p>

  <p><b>[Tiago Fernandes, now a coach at Chaves but a man who was Leao’s mentor]</b> I met him when he was 14 and few people understood his way of playing. He was doing things with the ball that no-one could do. But he still forgot his positioning on the field.</p>

  <p><b>[Rafael Leao has been doing his best to shrug off comparisons to the Paris Saint-Germain wonderkid]</b> Mbappe is Mbappe. He’s an incredible player. He’s 20 and has already proven a good deal. I’m Rafael Leao and I must work and prove myself. And today, I’m with Lille to do that and to progress<br /><br />I’m very happy. It’s important for me, it gives me extra motivation to continue working and to give the best of myself</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> and Inter to play first ever virtual Milan derby on Pro Evolution Soccer 2020]</b> We can’t physically be on a football pitch right now, so it will be quite fun to represent my team and play against Sebastiano <b>[Esposito]</b> on PES. This is a derby after all and I want to win, but most importantly this is a way to be a little closer to our fans in these difficult times</p>
