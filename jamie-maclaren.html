  <p><b>[Two-goal hero Jamie Maclaren was delighted Brisbane Roar found the energy to bounce back against Newcastle Jets after their 6-0 loss last week in the AFC Champions League]</b> All in all, after the week we’ve had, it’s nice to get three points away from home. It’s been a long week. I played 90 minutes as well in the week <b>[in South Korea]</b> and they are managing me but for me it’s just good to get back on track with two goals and three points.<br /><br /><b>[Maclaren lead the way for the visitors with an two goals, though he showed his frustration when he was withdrawn late on]</b> I was disappointed coming off because I thought I could’ve had three</p>

  <p><b>[On Ange Postecoglou]</b> I didn’t even know he was going to be here, so my mentality is to just to go on and score goals whether it’s Champions League or A-League. I’ve hit form at a good time before the finals and I know if I’m given the chance I’ll take it</p>

  <p><b>[Brisbane Roar are out to break records in the 2016-17 A-League finals]</b> If we actually look back, we were quite lucky to go 3-0 up. You could say ‘revenge’ but they’re a good side, let’s not forget that. For us it’s business as usual. We’re hitting our straps at a good time.<br /><br /><b>[Roar would also be the first club from outside the top two to emerge triumphant in the 12-year history of the A-League]</b> That statistic is just motivation for us. These sorts of things are there to be broken</p>

  <p><b>[Jamie Maclaren has yet to decide on his next move after winning the A-League’s Young Player of the Year award on Monday night]</b> Look, I haven’t decided yet. It’s one of those things where you’ve got to sit down and weigh up all the options. I love playing for Brisbane Roar, I’ll make that aware <b>[sic]</b>, but as any player you have ambition and, you know, I don’t know what the future holds but it’s definitely exciting.<br /><br />The second half of the season, I know I finished strong … fitness-wise and I finished strong last year, so I felt like I would finish strong this year. It showed - in the last 13 <b>[ed. 14]</b> games, I scored 13 goals, so I’m proud of that and to win this award for the second year in a row, it’s an amazing feeling</p>

  <p><b>[Socceroos striker Jamie Maclaren has secured a move to Europe, joining German outfit SV Darmstadt]</b> I have been extremely flattered by the amount of interest shown in me from many clubs around the world and after careful consideration I have decided that Darmstadt is a great club for me to take the next step in my career<br /><br />Torsten Frings has been a huge factor in my decision as a highly decorated player for Germany and a very talented coach who has similar ambitions to my own. I am really looking forward to meeting up with my new teammates for pre-season and am very excited by the new challenge that I will face playing in Germany</p>
