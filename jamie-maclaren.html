  <p><b>[Two-goal hero Jamie Maclaren was delighted Brisbane Roar found the energy to bounce back against Newcastle Jets after their 6-0 loss last week in the AFC Champions League]</b> All in all, after the week we’ve had, it’s nice to get three points away from home. It’s been a long week. I played 90 minutes as well in the week <b>[in South Korea]</b> and they are managing me but for me it’s just good to get back on track with two goals and three points.<br /><br /><b>[Maclaren lead the way for the visitors with an two goals, though he showed his frustration when he was withdrawn late on]</b> I was disappointed coming off because I thought I could’ve had three</p>

  <p><b>[On Ange Postecoglou]</b> I didn’t even know he was going to be here, so my mentality is to just to go on and score goals whether it’s Champions League or A-League. I’ve hit form at a good time before the finals and I know if I’m given the chance I’ll take it</p>

  <p><b>[Brisbane Roar are out to break records in the 2016-17 A-League finals]</b> If we actually look back, we were quite lucky to go 3-0 up. You could say ‘revenge’ but they’re a good side, let’s not forget that. For us it’s business as usual. We’re hitting our straps at a good time.<br /><br /><b>[Roar would also be the first club from outside the top two to emerge triumphant in the 12-year history of the A-League]</b> That statistic is just motivation for us. These sorts of things are there to be broken</p>
