  <p><b>[Guillermo Varela says he will discuss his Manchester United future with Jose Mourinho at the end of the season when his loan deal with Eintracht Frankfurt expires]</b> I don’t know so far. The most important thing for me is to get back 100 per cent to play until the end of the season. Then we will sit down together to see what’s best for the club and myself. Then a decision will be made.<br /><br />I talked to Jose Mourinho and we talked about my future and what would be best for me. He was very sincere towards me. He told me my playing time would be little so my decision was that I preferred to go. A player needs to play and this is what I’m looking for and this is what I sought here in Frankfurt<br /><br />I really learnt a lot from the way he trained - the ball was always in the centre of the exercises. The relationship was very good and I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe I expected his character when he is confronted with the press, but that was definitely not the case. He’s always asking how everyone feels, making no difference between Rooney or a player who has just come up. He was always joking and ensuring he had a good connection between everyone and himself</p>
