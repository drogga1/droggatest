  <p><b>[Meet Ben Wilmot, the League Two defender, tracked by Spurs and Liverpool]</b> It is mental. It has all happened so fast. I played a game once in October, that’s where it started off, then in early January I got into the side and everything has flown from there really. It has been a whirlwind few months but I have enjoyed it. I have just said that I want to play as many games as I can. When I got in the team I just made sure I stayed in the team. I was happy regardless of what was going on off the pitch. My main focus is just to make sure I am playing and playing well. If I am playing well, off the pitch things will happen when the time is right. But we will have to see what happens. I don’t know if I have played my last game for the club. I hope not because I want to keep on playing and I enjoy playing as much as I can. There are only a few games left now but I am making sure I am training hard to give the manager a difficult decision to leave me out</p>

  <p><b>[After seeing his ranks depleted, Boothroyd has called upon <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> duo Sam Sturridge and Ben Wilmot]</b> Both Surridge and Wilmot are currently on loan at the Liberty Stadium from <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> and <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> respectively. For striker Surridge, it’s a first England call-up at any level while defender Wilmot was involved in last month’s squad as the Young Lions started their new U21 Euro qualifying campaign with victories over Turkey and Kosovo. The U21s squad will train at St. George’s Park until Thursday when they head to Maribor for Friday’s game with Slovenia. It’s then back to Milton Keynes for their next qualifying game with Austria at stadiummk</p>
