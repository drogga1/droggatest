<blockquote>
  <p>[Villarreal striker Nicola Sansone has rubbished comparisons between himself and Lionel Messi] Come on, let’s be serious. He [Messi] is an alien, don’t compare me with him! As a team, we performed very well before the break, then we lost a bit too much. But I think we’re still on track to make it a good season. I already knew Villarreal and how they play, I was following La Liga as it’s a very entertaining tournament. I was sure Villarreal and La Liga would have fit my skill set and style so it was easy for me to accept, although I was fine at Sassuolo. So far it has been a positive season. I already scored eight goals [in all competitions], my best tally is nine [in one season] so I’m close to my record and I have plenty of games ahead.<br /><br />Serie A is more complicated from a tactical angle. In La Liga we play more expressive and technical football. Tactics are not the priority, sometimes I see unbelievable situations. For an offensive player, Spain is much probably much better for an attacking player, but in my honest opinion the best recipe would be a mix between Serie A and La Liga. I have no regrets [about Bayern]. I simply had no chance. I wanted to make it to the first team, they only offered me an amateur contract, so I preferred to leave. I wished I could have made my career through Bayern, but there were no chances at that time</p>

  <p>[Nicola Sansone favouring the Cristiano Ronaldo’s physicality over Lionel Messi’s trickery] Messi or Ronaldo? Messi impressed me more live, but I prefer CR7 because he also has a physical domination<br /><br />At Villarreal I don’t play many matches, so during the summer I could change teams<br /><br />In January Napoli wanted me on loan, but unfortunately the transfer wasn’t made<br /><br />Bakambu in China? I would go there too because the footballer’s career doesn’t last long</p>
