When we started The Journey experience four years ago we set out as three-year trilogy, but through that process we realised people really do love narratives in sports games so there is a story component in Volta.</p>

  <p><b>[What does Volta mean?]</b> When we hit out on the road every single year one of the top requests is bring back street football. Bringing it back now has a lot to do with the technological innovations we’ve had over the past few years, particularly with the frostbite engine. It’s allowed us to do this in a way that we wouldn’t have been able to do it justice in the past<br /><br /><b>[Why has <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Street been renamed?]</b> We travelled the globe to do our research and look at the street football game to understand the culture of it. <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Street we built many years ago was fantastical, over the top and probably not authentic, we wanted to root (Volta) in authenticity.

  <p><b>[Who are <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> 20’s Champions League commentators?]</b> We want our players to feel like they’re truly front and centre in the Champions League experience. We’re bringing unique atmospheres that look and feel like the real thing: overlay packages, match balls, Champions League badges on kits, the archway you walk through, the branding around the stadium. Authenticity is extremely important when bringing these iconic tournaments to life</p>
