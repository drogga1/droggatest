  <p><b>[What does Volta mean?]</b> When we hit out on the road every single year one of the top requests is bring back street football. Bringing it back now has a lot to do with the technological innovations we’ve had over the past few years, particularly with the frostbite engine. It’s allowed us to do this in a way that we wouldn’t have been able to do it justice in the past<br /><br /><b>[Why has FIFA Street been renamed?]</b> We travelled the globe to do our research and look at the street football game to understand the culture of it. FIFA Street we built many years ago was fantastical, over the top and probably not authentic, we wanted to root (Volta) in authenticity. The FIFA family at EA is quite large and there was a ton of experience from people that did work of FIFA Street. But we weren’t looking back intentionally trying to recreate this experience because we wanted to make something more authentic and more befitting of the culture of street football</p>

  <p><b>[Who are <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> 20’s Champions League commentators?]</b> We want our players to feel like they’re truly front and centre in the Champions League experience. We’re bringing unique atmospheres that look and feel like the real thing: overlay packages, match balls, Champions League badges on kits, the archway you walk through, the branding around the stadium. Authenticity is extremely important when bringing these iconic tournaments to life</p>
