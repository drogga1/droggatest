  <p><b>[Francis Lee says <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> has transformed into a complete striker under <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>]</b> Sergio is simply remarkable. When <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> first came to the Club, he was an out and out goalscorer but now he is an out and out player who scores goals.<br /><br />Sergio has got everything. He is a very good finisher, he is so clinical, he is the right size and build for a striker and he has got pace. I thought he was possibly a bit on the wane when Pep arrived but the manager shook him up and he has got him playing like a world-class striker he is. And if you look at the way he scores his goals they are not all simple. He can also score exceptional goals and he’s an amazing talent. Would I have liked to play alongside Sergio? No, as he would have got all my goals!<br /><br />Seriously, I would have absolutely relished playing with him. I found that if I was playing with great players it was made very easy for me as it was with amazing players like Colin <b>[Bell]</b>, Neil <b>[Young]</b> and Mike <b>[Summerbee]</b>. Sergio is something special too<br /><br />If you look at our performances at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> and <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Villa Park</a> last month, this team is playing as good as any team ever in the UK. After all, who would have thought two or three years ago that if the goalkeeper didn’t pass the ball out it was a bad idea? The way he has changed he has opened everything up. He wants to play from the back to give more space around the rest of the pitch.<br /><br />I think he is definitely the best coach I have ever seen. He has got an amazing talent of one: analysing the opposition and two: the way he trains and keeps his players all competing for places. The manager has 22 players fighting for 11 places and it’s a happy squad. The great thing is if you get people copying what you are doing, then you must be doing something right. They are just a joy to watch and long may it continue</p>
