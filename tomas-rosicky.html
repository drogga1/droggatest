  <p><b>[The Czech Republic international has explained that his 14 month injury nightmare]</b> When you have two operations and are still in constant pain for almost a year, of course I thought I would never play again. It’s been a very difficult time. I had so many scans and saw so many doctors around Europe. But now, at last, I know the knee is all right and I will soon play again. And that is such a good feeling.<br /><br /><b>[The 28-year-old recently suffered a further injury setback]</b> I now have a groin injury. But, after the long-term problems with my knee, which was a very rare injury, I know it will be all right because I was already doing almost everything on the pitch.</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Arsenal star Rosicky announces retirement]</b> After careful consideration I have realised I am no longer able to fully prepare my body for what professional football requires. I would like to thank Sparta for raising me, for being the first step in my career in big clubs, and for allowing me to say goodbye at the place I love the most</p>

  <p><b>[Rosicky also believes that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> could be about to benefit from a fresher <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> now that he has retired from international duty on the back of a World Cup showing over the summer which saw him once again generate unfair criticism]</b> It can be tricky at the start for him, but again we will see his development in the new team. Because I think in the long term it can be positive for him that he will suddenly have a break now and he can rest and train properly, and prepare himself for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I think he will still be a key player for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and, if he is playing well, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> will be playing well. I am looking forward to seeing <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> more and I hope they will grow. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> has a new manager and a completely different style, so the next games will show us more how the team is developing</p>

  <p><b>[Adam Hlozek: Europe’s biggest clubs queuing up to sign Czech teen sensation]</b> I think it’s early for him to go somewhere. Let’s be patient; let him grow up. He is 17 and if he continues to grow, he will not miss out on moving abroad. If something happens, which I don’t expect, it will be too soon for him.</p>
