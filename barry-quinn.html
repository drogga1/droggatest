<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Barry Quinn, a fellow midfielder from Dublin who broke into the first team during the 98-99 campaign having captained Brian Kerr’s Ireland Under-18s en route to winning the European championship, recalls the positive effect <a href="gary-mcallister.html">McAllister</a> had on those around him]</b> You would learn so much just watching what he would do at training, not only on the pitch but how he conducted himself. He looked after his body, he prepared the right way and the reason why he was able to go on for so long is that he had a cleverness to match his ability on the ball<br /><br /><b>[Quinn’s debut for Coventry came away to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. The night before he rang home to tell his parents he had an inkling he would play]</b> My Ma told me she’d light a candle for me going up against Roy Keane<br /><br /><b>[Coventry lost but Quinn was thankful to have <a href="gary-mcallister.html">McAllister</a> by his side]</b> He talked to me through the whole game and gave me information all the time. You knew if you had him beside you, with his quality and class, he could always drive the team forward. He was very influential for me because he would tell me little things in training, positioning tips and passing</p>
