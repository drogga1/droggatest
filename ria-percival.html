  <p><b>[New Zealand record-breaker Ria Percival living her dream at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> It’s really special for me and my career. With everything that is happening at the moment, it’s obviously just something to sit back and think about and reflect on how far I’ve come really. You always dream when you’re a young girl of representing your country and getting that first cap, but to get 150 is just a milestone that I’m honoured to have achieved really<br /><br />When you come from England, it’s a football-mad nation. Then, you go to New Zealand and it’s a totally different shift in sport and what the main focus is. <b>[In]</b> the academy, I went up through the age groups, then going to New Zealand, there wasn’t really that set-up and support at the time. I got chucked in with a boys team, but they said I was too good for them, so they moved me in with a women’s team at the age of 14 or 15. I was playing in the women’s league in New Zealand then. You’re playing in a team full of older players and a lot of them, at the time, were playing for New Zealand<br /><br />My family - grandad, uncles, dad, everyone - support them, so I’ve supported them all my life. To be able to play for a club I’ve supported my whole life <b>[…]</b> when I had the chance, I wasn’t really going to turn it down. With <b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>]</b> being such a big club and a big name in itself, it’s one thing for any player to come here, but they’re trying to build as a club <b>[too]</b>. I think with the experience we’ve had this season in the league and how we’ve been playing, it puts us in a good position moving forward in the next few years to really go further<br /><br />I’m quite critical of myself and the team so I’d say, personally, we could be sitting higher in the league with some of the performances and results we’ve got so far. Overall, we’re sitting in the middle of the table and we’re a team that only got promoted last season. I can’t really say that we’re doing badly</p>
