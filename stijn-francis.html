  <p><b>[Tottenham have been warned that Toby Alderweireld is looking for ‘a better contract or a transfer’ as extension talks rumble on]</b> Toby is always performing well. Even after his injury he recovered. Tottenham’s statistics fell sharply during his absence. If you only look at his figures, Toby is impressive and for his performances, he deserves either a better contract from Tottenham or a transfer. For a transfer, you know that he can only leave Tottenham for seven or eight teams and almost all the other top clubs are interested in Toby. There are not a lot of central defenders of his kind so they are sought after. But those clubs also know that they have to negotiate with <b>[Tottenham chairman]</b> Daniel Levy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Agent of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> star <a href="toby-alderweireld.html">Alderweireld</a> claims pay cuts should allow players to leave for free]</b> A ‘regular’ worker is able to leave his or her employer in exchange for limited compensation or a notice period. Also the employer can terminate the relationship with the worker at any time by respecting a period of notice or paying compensation. If clubs sign a player they take a risk by paying a transfer or signing-on fee and by paying substantial wages. In exchange for this risk, players cannot leave the club before the end of the contract except when all involved parties agree otherwise. Players also know that during the contractual term they can be sure the club will pay their salary. Clubs now asking to reduce player salaries undermine this principle of contractual stability. If clubs insist on a wage reduction, players should be put in the same situation as any regular worker.<br /><br />Clubs reducing their players’ wages should accept that the players can terminate their employment for free and these clubs should no longer be able to ask a transfer fee if the player would like to leave. Clubs should not ask for wage reductions from their players unless it is essential for their survival. If clubs are really afraid that they may not survive, it means that these clubs have not been careful and that they should put the players on furlough. If this is the case, the players should be able to terminate their contract against limited compensation like regular employees. If players nevertheless decide to financially support the clubs through a salary reduction, the reduction should be subject to certain conditions such as no transfer fees being paid until the wage reductions for all involved players have been compensated</p>
