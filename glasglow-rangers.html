  <p><b>[Rangers announced Friday the resignation of manager Mark Warburton]</b> At a meeting with the management team’s representative earlier this week the Club were advised that Mr Warburton, Mr Weir and Mr McParland wished to resign their positions and leave the Club on the condition that Rangers agreed to waive its rights to substantial compensation. Rangers’ agreement to waive compensation would assist the management team to join another club.</p>

  <p><b>[Rangers have dismissed manager Graeme Murty]</b> Graeme Murty has this morning been relieved of his duties as manager of Rangers. Jimmy Nicholl and Jonatan Johansson will take charge of the team for the three remaining matches of the season. Rangers are grateful to Graeme, who did not hesitate when asked last October to become interim manager after the departure of Pedro Caixinha and then, at the turn of the year, when he was offered the role as manager until the end of the season. Graeme has had to contend with difficult and challenging circumstances but conducted himself in a thoroughly professional manner. He will take some time to consider his options, which include returning to his role at the Rangers Academy. Jimmy Nicholl and Jonatan Johansson have already started preparing the team for the match against Kilmarnock on Saturday and they will be in place for the two remaining fixtures, against Aberdeen and Hibernian. The club hopes to be in a position to comment further on the managerial situation in the near future.</p>

  <p><b>[Glasglow Rangers hit with partial stadium ban for sectarian chants]</b> Our supporters have been asked repeatedly by the club to refrain from indulging in this, and other forms of unacceptable behaviour. Sadly, the warnings have fallen on deaf ears and the actions of this minority will cause the club and the majority of good and decent Rangers supporters to pay a heavy penalty. Unfortunately, a significant number of supporters, innocent of any wrongdoing, will be unable to attend next week’s match (against Legia). This is deeply regrettable to all at the club and we hope that the guilty parties, who attracted the attention of <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>, might reflect on the damage their unacceptable behaviour is causing Rangers and their fellow supporters. If any individual supporter is unable to behave in a civilised manner then please stay away from Ibrox and our club. You are harming Rangers and that is something a genuine supporter would never wish to do</p>

  <p><b>[Glasglow Rangers will reject any away ticket allocation for their next European fixture following a partial stadium closure from <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> over sectarian singing]</b> Those fans responsible for this partial closure of Ibrox Stadium need to understand that they are damaging our club. If there is a further incidence at tomorrow night’s match this could lead to a ground closure. The same applies to those who indulged in sectarian singing in Warsaw last week and that is why we have taken the decision to make <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> aware that we will decline tickets for our next away match even though this means that, once again, the many must suffer because of the few.<br /><br />This kind of behaviour has no place at Ibrox, or anywhere else where our many teams appear. Offenders must please stop. You are endangering your club which has recently launched its Everyone Anyone project aimed at welcoming all to Ibrox. Those who wish to sing offensive songs must realise by now that they are insulting Rangers players, staff, and fellow fans. There is nothing clever, bold or even defiant in what this small number of supporters are doing. By supporting Rangers in the correct way the rest of us must strive to protect our great club. One way or another this offensive behaviour must end and it would be much more preferable if we stopped it ourselves, simply by behaving like true Rangers fans</p>

  <p><b>[The release went on to defend <a href="alfredo-morelos.html">Alfredo Morelos</a>, who has been criticised for an apparent throat-cutting gesture following his red card at <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> Park]</b> There can be little doubt Alfredo is singled out for special attention, on and off the field of play. Indeed, some of the things said and written about him leave a lot to be desired and do nothing to suggest Scottish football is the most welcoming of environments. Even Alfredo’s gesture as he left the pitch is now being portrayed in some quarters as something sinister when, in fact, it is a gesture used commonly throughout South America to indicate quite simply that something - in this case, the match - is finished</p>

The injury was sustained more than a week ago and will keep him out of action for the foreseeable future. Niko is being looked after by our medical team led by Dr Mark Waller</p>
