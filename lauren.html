  <p><b>[Lauren speaks about being at <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> as a 13-year-old while <a href="diego-maradona.html">Diego Maradona</a> was with the club]</b> I must have been 13. It wasn’t the best time for the club but having him there was incredible. We’d stay behind to watch him scoring one, two, three, four free-kicks, one after the other. I remember a game where <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> were playing badly, there was a corner and someone threw a ball of tin-foil at him. He controlled it, juggled it and volleyed it back. He completely changed the crowd’s mood: from ‘son of a bitch! to Olé!’ in a fraction of a second</p>

  <p><b>[Former Arsenal defender Lauren doesn’t see a favourite in the Europa League final and thinks that the presence of Eden Hazard in the Chelsea team gives them a great chance of winning the trophy]</b> I see it at 50 per cent, either can win. I give Chelsea a chance because Hazard has been a symbol for that team and he wants to seal the title for Chelsea as the culmination of his career at the club. He can be decisive for Chelsea apart from other tactical factors. Arsenal are in a pretty good moment. Emery knows perfectly what this competition is, he has won it three times and then there is the good form of <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> and <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Alexandre Lacazette</a>. I think they are the best in this competition, they understand each other perfectly and they can also be decisive in the final, so I say it is 50-50.<br /><br /><b>[When asked how the Gunners could deal with Eden Hazard]</b> Being very smart. He is an unpredictable player. I always compare him with Ryan Giggs. They are players who, in addition to being skilled, are intelligent. They combine well with the midfield - at times they look for you in the centre instead of staying on the wing. You have to be very intelligent and be 100 per cent focused because, even if you think you have them controlled, they are incredible footballers. Hazard, <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Lacazette</a>, <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Dennis Bergkamp</a> and <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> are players who see the play fractions of a second before you. You have to be very focused and wait for them not to be at their best because when a player of that quality has his day it is difficult to stop them. They have something different that is innate and when they are inspired, they do it. You have to concentrate for 90 or 120 minutes of the game<br /><br /><b>[Lauren does not see any reason for his old club to be feeling added pressure ahead of the final]</b> I always say the same thing, there is no pressure. As a footballer, I prefer this kind of pressure. To play for titles, that’s not pressure. Pressure is fighting to avoid relegation. You do not know where you are going to be next year, if you are going to be fighting to be relegated to the second division. That is pressure. The fact of playing a final and being able to win a title is not pressure. That pressure is a blessing. I would like to have it every year. I don’t think it will be decisive for <b>[Arsenal]</b> to defend deep and keep <b>[Chelsea]</b> from playing well, just the opposite. I think they will be motivated because they’ll qualify for the Champions League and win a title</p>

  <p><b>[Lauren says There is ‘something very wrong’ with Mesut Ozil at Arsenal]</b> Mesut Ozil will stay at Arsenal next season but he needs to start fulfilling his potential. Whether you are Arsenal, Real Madrid or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, you need your best players to perform on the big stage and Ozil failed to do that on multiple occasions last year. In the biggest games last season, the quarter-final, semi-final and final of the Europa League, Ozil was not relevant, so there is something very wrong there. Mesut Ozil has a lot of potential and no doubt Unai Emery will be working to bring that to the forefront this season.<br /><br /><b>[Ozil is no longer considered to be the key man for Arsenal]</b> It is integral to Arsenal’s success next season to keep hold of <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> and <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Alexandre Lacazette</a>. The club and backroom team will be doing their utmost to keep both players at the club and hoping that they both avoid temptations of European football and stay at Arsenal for the foreseeable future. If you play well at the top level, European clubs will always be looking to sign you, Arsenal need to do whatever they can to keep their star players<br /><br /><b>[One player who has already headed out of the Emirates Stadium is Aaron Ramsey]</b> Losing Aaron Ramsey to Juventus is a big loss for Arsenal. Unai and his backroom team will need to use this transfer window to make a big signing to replace him. Throughout his time at the club, and even when he had announced he was leaving the club, Ramsey was a brilliant player who always played to his best ability. The gap he has left in the club will be felt unless the club bring in someone to replace him quickly</p>

  <p><b>[Former Cameroon international Lauren talks about the problems facing <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> Whatever happens, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will need to start the season without <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> and Mane as they will need a good couple of weeks to rest and recuperate, otherwise their level will drop during the season. Players will be mentally and physically exhausted and will need a few weeks to recuperate before heading into the new Premier League season. If they don’t get the rest, there will be a chance that their Premier League campaign will be impacted by a slow start as the players are just too tired to play - this could be trouble for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as both <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> and Mane will likely be involved in the latter stages of the Africa Cup of Nations.<br /><br />The likes of <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> and Mane have played an unbelievable amount of football over the past two seasons, but tiredness will not be a major factor for <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> and Mane in the Africa Cup of Nations. What they lack in physical ability, they will make up for in their mentality going into the competition. Coming off the back of a Champions League win will compensate for any tiredness and both players will attack this new challenge with a winning mentality which will be interesting to see if Senegal and Egypt play each other. Both players will be confident that they are physically fit and able to win the tournament for their countries<br /><br /><b>[Landing Cup of Nations glory would help to further enhance the respective reputations of <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> and Mane]</b> It’s impossible to pick the best ever African player to grace the Premier League - you cannot choose just one player when Africa has given the Premier League so much talent. You look at players like Kolo Toure, <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a> and countless others and it is impossible to choose between them. You also have to look at people like <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> and Mane and see that they are amazing footballers but there have been so many before them</p>

  <p><b>[Lauren says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have to keep <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> &amp; <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> can still make the difference]</b> He has been outstanding. He is <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s best player at the moment. And he is improving; he is improving every single year. It is very important that they keep him because there are not many players in the market who can score 25 goals a season. It’s a massive thing to keep him and fight for the league in future seasons<br /><br /><b>[Lauren believes the German can still prove his worth]</b> It is always unfair to point the finger at one striker, one midfielder or one defender. When things don’t go well everyone has to push together and find a way to win and get the three points every weekend. <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> is just one player in the whole team. Sure, he is one of the best and has the most quality so gets criticism when the team don’t get results. But I am sure his talent can still make the difference<br /><br />There are many points still to play for until the end of the season. It’s not easy because the position right now is not the best but with the many, many points left there is a possibility of top four for sure. I believe they can make it. Why not?</p>

  <p><b>[Lauren says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s Invincibles were always fighting in training]</b> Of course there was fighting. I love at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> that the journalists didn’t go to the training sessions. In Spain in that time, it has been changed, now they have stopped the journalists going every single day. When I went to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in 2000 I said, ‘This is not possible’. Why? Because in <b>[Spain]</b> the journalists were going every single day to find history, what happened here, who’s fighting with who. In our time if the journalists were to attend training there would be history every single day. How competitive we were - all fighting between ourselves. I had a fight with <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry</a>, <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry</a> with Martin <b>[Keown]</b>, Patrick with Freddie <b>[<a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Ljungberg</a>]</b>. We were all very competitive and we were all fighting because we all had big egos, big personalities but by the time the games arrived, we were fighting for the same goal. You need that, big egos but you have the manager as well that knows how to control the big egos, how to control those players. I prefer to be in a team that you see players face to face, you can talk to him, tell him whatever you want but when the games arrive you will be 100 per cent for the same goal, to achieve what we set out to do at the beginning of the season. This is the most important thing; without that, it is difficult to win things. I don’t want to be in a team that nothing happens, we’re all quiet, if you win no problem, if you lose no problem. You can’t compete like that. In our time we were all competitive, we were all fighting between each other but at the end of the day we were fighting for the same goal and that’s why we managed to win things</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> defender Lauren has revealed he turned down <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> to sign for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because of the human warmth of former manager <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>]</b> My representative came to Madrid, met Juan Onieva <b>[the vice-president]</b> and they didn’t reach an agreement because the economic conditions that Madrid offered didn’t convince us. We got on a flight and went straight to London, because there had been contact with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> before. When we arrived we went straight to <a href="david-dein.html">David Dein</a>’s house. It was <a href="david-dein.html">David Dein</a>, his daughter who spoke Spanish, <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>, me, my representative, and a translator who we had brought with us because my English was non-existent. What really struck me was that I had always negotiated in an office with everyone very serious, wearing suits and ties. This was totally different. <a href="david-dein.html">David Dein</a> opens his home to you. His personality was spectacular, the treatment man to man was fantastic and I left there totally convinced. And <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>, with that human warmth he has, that approachable character of his. During negotiations he didn’t speak too much; he listens to you, watches you, he’s seeing if you have the personality to be able to take on this challenge. At Madrid it was like you had to do what they said: this is the way it is, full stop. My dad is a Madrid fan, I was always a <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> fan and then Madrid as well, but when another club comes along with another attitude however much you might have liked Madrid, you go to the place where they treat you best and where they offer you the best terms. The way that <a href="david-dein.html">Dein</a> and <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> acted struck us. It wasn’t ‘come to the club’, it was ‘come to my house. Come to be with my family, in my home. Come to join us’</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> defender Lauren on ‘incredibly competitive’ <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> training sessions]</b> When there was a game, <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> would say: ‘Who’s the ref?’ Pat Rice, <b>[former equipment manager]</b> Paul Johnson, <b>[assistant coach]</b> Boro Primorac … No one wanted it. <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> was clever - he got out of there, went to the corner, hid and just watched. Pat was the bravest and he’d end up arguing with everyone. There was argument after argument: Freddie <b>[<a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Ljungberg</a>]</b> with this guy, Martin <b>[Keown]</b> with that guy, me with someone else. <b>[Dennis]</b> <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Bergkamp</a> was a genius but he was also incredibly competitive. That’s why we won<br /><br />Why did <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> become <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s all-time top scorer? Talent? Because he was really good and a great athlete? No. Because he wanted to be the best every single day of his life. He never ducked a game, never said: ‘I’ve got a knock.’ The session finished and he’d stay to take shots, practise diagonal runs. On the bus, Henry, me, <a href="edu.html">Edu</a> and <b>[Patrick]</b> Vieira played cards and Henry got angry if he lost. You can laugh but it was like that. If you didn’t give him the ball, if he didn’t score, he would get mad. It was horrific. I’ve had confrontations with Henry and Vieira, Vieira with <a href="martin-keown.html">Martin Keown</a>, <a href="martin-keown.html">Keown</a> with Henry, Henry with <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Ljungberg</a>, everyone. There was one at Riazor against Deportivo when Henry stopped and raised his arms at me. Bloody hell! You should have seen our training sessions. It’s a good job journalists weren’t there; it would have been horrible<br /><br />When <a href="gilberto-silva.html">Gilberto Silva</a> came and saw how we trained …<a href="martin-keown.html">Martin Keown</a> goes in hard and he’s unlucky enough to injure Rami Shaaban. We get to the dressing room and Gilberto says: ‘Bro, is everyone mad here?’ From the next day on, he never once took his shin pads off - and we’re talking <a href="gilberto-silva.html">Gilberto Silva</a>. We were hard, everyone wanted to win. And that showed on the pitch</p>
