  <p><b>[How Wenger made Arsenal invincible]</b> The passion we played with was incredible. Thierry Henry was our best player: so talented and he wanted to win everything, <b>[even]</b> playing cards on the bus. Yet I’d choose Patrick Vieira. You’d see him training and think he wasn’t at his best but in games he was, week after week. Patrick was incredible, exactly what a captain should be. He stood up to everything but with ‘good manners’; aggressive but there was a classiness to it. If I could choose someone to play for Arsenal now, it would be him.<br /><br />Martin <b>[Keown]</b> hated losing. I wasn’t a big talker but when I had to say something, people listened. <b>[Sol]</b> Campbell, the same. And <b>[Jens]</b> Lehmann: don’t get me started. Lehmann could look in the mirror and have an argument. Incredible, strong characters. Ashley Cole wasn’t one to talk much but had that character. So did Freddie <b>[Ljungberg]</b>. Dennis <b>[Bergkamp]</b> was quiet. He seemed cold because he didn’t show emotion but it was there inside him. The same with Kanu. They wanted to win, they had focus too<br /><br />When we finally lost at Old Trafford, they fouled us so much. The referee was horrendous. Everything seemed to be in United’s favour, including a penalty for a Campbell ‘foul’ on <b>[Wayne]</b> Rooney that didn’t exist. It hurt, but that record was incredible. And a lot of it is down to the fact we never thought about it; it never weighed on our minds. The only one noting it down was Wenger. We had good footballers and they all had tremendous character</p>

  <p><b>[Lauren tips Hector Bellerin to become Arsenal’s greatest ever right-back]</b> Bellerin is very, very good. He’s good with the ball at his feet, reads the game, gets beyond defences, crosses well, plays between the lines. And he’s so young - if he stays injury-free he’ll surpass me, Lee Dixon, Pat Rice, everyone who’s played there<br /><br />The squad is better every year; I don’t remember one this strong for a long time. In defence, we’ve signed well with <b>[Shkodran]</b> Mustafi; in attack with Lucas <b>[Perez]</b>, in midfield with <b>[Granit]</b> Xhaka. I look now and it’s not just the XI; players can come on and make an impact. <b>[Alex]</b> Iwobi, Lucas Perez, <b>[who]</b> I like a lot, <b>[Alex]</b> Oxlade-Chamberlain. <b>[Theo]</b> Walcott’s showing more<br /><br />The club have reached the point where they should keep their best players to aspire to more. It’s been a club that sells its best for years <b>[and]</b> there were economic needs, but not any more</p>

  <p><b>[Lauren speaks about being at <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> as a 13-year-old while <a href="diego-maradona.html">Diego Maradona</a> was with the club]</b> I must have been 13. It wasn’t the best time for the club but having him there was incredible. We’d stay behind to watch him scoring one, two, three, four free-kicks, one after the other. I remember a game where <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> were playing badly, there was a corner and someone threw a ball of tin-foil at him. He controlled it, juggled it and volleyed it back. He completely changed the crowd’s mood: from ‘son of a bitch! to Olé!’ in a fraction of a second</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal ‘Invincible’ Lauren gives three reasons why Wenger’s side won’t win title]</b> The first is that he <b>[Wenger]</b> doesn’t have those seven or eight players who are fighting for him. The second factor is that there are so many teams looking to win the league - five or six of them. And the third factor is that - with all my respect - we miss something in the dressing room. We miss something that drives teams to win and challenge for the Premier League - some leadership from inside<br /><br />Nowadays, people are not fighting for the solution, they are not fighting for the flag, fighting for the whole institution. I’m talking about people in general, not just Arsenal. People are more selfish and looking more for individual success, rather than whole club<br /><br />Wenger is the kind of manager who is not looking at individuals. He looks at the team. We all make mistakes, but when he talked about errors, he was looking at the whole side. That was a key issue in our time - if someone had a bad day, we didn’t focus on that player. I don’t know what other managers did, but he always emphasised we had to take care of decision making. As a defender, people talk about how bad the back four might be - but if the whole team defend in the right way, it’s easier for the back four. He wanted us to work together<br /><br />This year, he’s changed that <b>[worrying about opponents]</b>. Now he’s taking more care about the opposition. After 18, 19 years of playing 4-4-2, now he’s playing three at the back. That means he’s worried about what other people are doing</p>

  <p><b>[Lauren pay tribute to departing manager Arsene Wenger]</b> I think Wenger has been the greatest manager in Arsenal’s history. We have seen what he has done for the club and how he has transformed things, with the style of play and the way in which we won the league in the unbeaten season.<br /><br />He has been an amazing coach at that level. As a person, I always like to highlight the way he sees the world. When I joined Arsenal, there were players from everywhere. Within the squad there was a mix of players from Brazil, France, England and all over the world and he made us come together, which was amazing. That tells you what he is like as a person<br /><br />I think that when a manager as intelligent as Wenger makes the decision that now is the time to leave, it means he has been thinking about it for along time. Whether now is the right or wrong time, we don’t know. He’s the only one who knows why he has taken this decision at this moment in time. We have to give him big respect and credit because he has been a great manager and a fantastic coach in so many ways</p>

  <p><b>[Aaron Ramsey has been told by Arsenal legend Lauren that West Ham could be a great fit]</b> West Ham could be a great fit for Ramsey should he leave the Gunners. He’s settled in London so he won’t want to move, but West Ham gives him the chance to get first-team football whilst becoming a leader in the dressing room. Ramsey has been a fantastic player and role model at Arsenal, but it seems like he wants to move on now. There has been mixed messages coming out of the club and he’ll be a great asset wherever he decides to go.<br /><br /><b>[On Unai Emery]</b> Emery won’t be able to create a dynasty at Arsenal if he is compared to Wenger. If the club and fans expect too much from Emery too quick, then they are destined to fail. Arsenal need to start regularly qualifying for the Champions League again before considering competing with the top of the Premier League. If Emery doesn’t make steady progress over the next three or four years, then he will start to receive criticism, but his only priority this year is to get back in the Champions League. This is a new era for Arsenal who haven’t had a change for 22 years, so it’s going to take time<br /><br />I think winning the Europa League and qualifying for the Champions League would be a successful season for Arsenal. It would be unfair for the club or the fans to expect more from Emery in his first season. Emery has the experience of winning European trophies, so I expect Arsenal to be real contenders in this year’s competition</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal legend urges Unai Emery to pursue Anthony Martial and Ousmane Dembele]</b> If Martial doesn’t renew his contract at Man Utd, Arsenal would be crazy not to try and snap him up. He’s a fantastic player and is starting to show what he can really do when given a good run of games. Martial won’t go anywhere without being guaranteed first-team football, which I think he would get at Arsenal.<br /><br /><b>[On Ousmane Dembele]</b> Everything about his style of play matches what Arsenal are looking for. He isn’t getting the playing time at Barcelona, or playing in his strongest position, but Arsenal’s high intensity will allow him to reach his potential. Dembele can play on either side of the pitch, which is a bonus and he’s showed that he can do it against the big teams, coming off the bench to rescue points for Barcelona. I would love to see him at Arsenal</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Arsenal must forget about signing the likes of James Rodriguez or Gelson Martins and make Barcelona midfielder Denis Suarez their top priority in January]</b> I’m not sure that Arsenal should be seriously considering James Rodriguez, even on loan. Rodriguez has got a lot of talent, but the warning signs are there that he hasn’t been able to settle at either Real Madrid or Bayern Munich. He comes with a massive wage bill so Arsenal would have to make sure he was fully on board with the philosophy of the club.<br /><br />Rodriguez has played in the big games for the big clubs so there’s no doubting his talent. If Emery can get the best out of him then he could make a real impact on whether Arsenal qualify for next season’s Champions League. It’s a roll of the dice.<br /><br />Suarez should be Arsenal’s number one target this transfer window. He’s an excellent player and he’s having to fight with so many top players to get first-team football at Barcelona. Arsenal should look to sign him above the likes of Rodriguez, no doubt about it<br /><br /><b>[On Yannick Ferreira Carrasco]</b> Carrasco is a very good player that could offer a real presence going forward for Arsenal. He proved himself at Atletico Madrid and had a good World Cup. He’s got the ability to beat a player and has good feet. If Carrasco seriously wants to come back to European football for the benefit of his career, I would imagine he would need to drop his wage demands and join Arsenal. Carrasco is still young, but if he wants to challenge himself then he can’t afford to stay away from the top leagues for much longer. He won’t be testing himself in the same way in the Chinese League and it could affect his chances of reaching his potential<br /><br />Ramsey’s likely departure has perhaps been something the club could have sorted out earlier. He’s been outstanding for the club and a few long-term injuries stopped him from really fulfilling what he could have achieved for both himself and Arsenal. It’s a blow that he seems set to leave and he’s not going to be easy to replace.<br /><br />Ramsey is one of Arsenal’s best players and should be playing up until the moment he leaves. Arsenal don’t have the luxury of being able to leave someone of Ramsey’s quality on the bench. They are in a battle to finish in the top four and the future of the club is more important that focusing on a player who looks set to be leaving.<br /><br />Ramsey has given 100% every time he’s been on the pitch so there’s no need to drop him. If he was to drop in form or show any lack of professionalism then it’s a different story but looking at how well he played against Chelsea that certainly doesn’t seem to be the case<br /><br />Ozil has to show Emery that he’s willing to fight for his place and get into the first team again. Emery is a fair manager and will only play players that are willing to put their all on to the pitch. For him to be out of the squad or on the bench, Emery perhaps has question marks over how Ozil can fit in a system that is demanding of its players</p>

  <p><b>[When asked how <a href="arsenal-fc.html">the Gunners</a> could deal with <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a>]</b> Being very smart. He is an unpredictable player. I always compare him with <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a>. They are players who, in addition to being skilled, are intelligent. They combine well with the midfield - at times they look for you in the centre instead of staying on the wing. You have to be very intelligent and be 100 per cent focused because, even if you think you have them controlled, they are incredible footballers. <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>, <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Lacazette</a>, <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Dennis Bergkamp</a> and <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> are players who see the play fractions of a second before you. You have to be very focused and wait for them not to be at their best because when a player of that quality has his day it is difficult to stop them. They have something different that is innate and when they are inspired, they do it. You have to concentrate for 90 or 120 minutes of the game<br /><br /><b>[Lauren does not see any reason for his old club to be feeling added pressure ahead of the final]</b> I always say the same thing, there is no pressure. As a footballer, I prefer this kind of pressure. To play for titles, that’s not pressure. Pressure is fighting to avoid relegation. You do not know where you are going to be next year, if you are going to be fighting to be relegated to the second division. That is pressure. The fact of playing a final and being able to win a title is not pressure. That pressure is a blessing. I would like to have it every year. I don’t think it will be decisive for <b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> to defend deep and keep <b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> from playing well, just the opposite. I think they will be motivated because they’ll qualify for the Champions League and win a title</p>

Whether you are <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, you need your best players to perform on the big stage and <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> failed to do that on multiple occasions last year.

The club and backroom team will be doing their utmost to keep both players at the club and hoping that they both avoid temptations of European football and stay at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> for the foreseeable future.

If they don’t get the rest, there will be a chance that their <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> campaign will be impacted by a slow start as the players are just too tired to play - this could be trouble for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as both <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> and Mane will likely be involved in the latter stages of the Africa Cup of Nations.<br /><br />The likes of <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> and Mane have played an unbelievable amount of football over the past two seasons, but tiredness will not be a major factor for <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> and Mane in the Africa Cup of Nations. What they lack in physical ability, they will make up for in their mentality going into the competition.

I prefer to be in a team that you see players face to face, you can talk to him, tell him whatever you want but when the games arrive you will be 100 per cent for the same goal, to achieve what we set out to do at the beginning of the season. This is the most important thing; without that, it is difficult to win things. I don’t want to be in a team that nothing happens, we’re all quiet, if you win no problem, if you lose no problem.

Pat was the bravest and he’d end up arguing with everyone. There was argument after argument: Freddie <b>[<a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Ljungberg</a>]</b> with this guy, Martin <b>[<a href="martin-keown.html">Keown</a>]</b> with that guy, me with someone else. <b>[Dennis]</b> <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Bergkamp</a> was a genius but he was also incredibly competitive. That’s why we won<br /><br />Why did <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> become <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s all-time top scorer? Talent? Because he was really good and a great athlete? No. Because he wanted to be the best every single day of his life. He never ducked a game, never said: ‘I’ve got a knock.’ The session finished and he’d stay to take shots, practise diagonal runs. On the bus, Henry, me, <a href="edu.html">Edu</a> and <b>[Patrick]</b> Vieira played cards and Henry got angry if he lost. You can laugh but it was like that. If you didn’t give him the ball, if he didn’t score, he would get mad. It was horrific. I’ve had confrontations with Henry and Vieira, Vieira with <a href="martin-keown.html">Martin Keown</a>, <a href="martin-keown.html">Keown</a> with Henry, Henry with <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Ljungberg</a>, everyone. There was one at Riazor against Deportivo when Henry stopped and raised his arms at me. Bloody hell! You should have seen our training sessions. It’s a good job journalists weren’t there; it would have been horrible<br /><br />When <a href="gilberto-silva.html">Gilberto Silva</a> came and saw how we trained …<a href="martin-keown.html">Martin Keown</a> goes in hard and he’s unlucky enough to injure Rami Shaaban. We get to the dressing room and Gilberto says: ‘Bro, is everyone mad here?’ From the next day on, he never once took his shin pads off - and we’re talking <a href="gilberto-silva.html">Gilberto Silva</a>. We were hard, everyone wanted to win. And that showed on the pitch</p>
