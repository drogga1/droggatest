  <p><b>[Former Basel coach Heiko Vogel believes <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Granit Xhaka</a> was the best player he saw at Basel, surpassing even <a href="xherdan-shaqiri.html">Xherdan Shaqiri</a> and <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a>]</b> <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Granit Xhaka</a>. You have to know the context. <a href="xherdan-shaqiri.html">Xherdan Shaqiri</a> came up with an incredible amount of hype, was instantly integrated and did a great job. In the first championship year, it was incredibly close. On the last matchday we had an away game at Young Boys, which was for the title. <a href="xherdan-shaqiri.html">Shaqiri</a> played as a left-back against Seydou Doumbia, who had scored over 30 goals this season. Shaq completely contained him and had an outstanding game. So he was mega-impressive, even in the <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> game. The self-understanding he has played there was unbelievable. Experienced players like <b>[Patrice]</b> <a href="patrice-evra.html">Evra</a> bounced off him. He also assisted both goals against United<br /><br /><b>[And despite that track record from <a href="xherdan-shaqiri.html">Shaqiri</a>, which included Swiss League titles in all three of his seasons, <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a> managed to impress Vogel with his leadership from the first moment he saw him]</b> That was the time when Granit became a Under-17 world champion. It was an international break and we had a coupe of friendlies with Basel. Granit entered in the 70th minute. In the 75th he gets the ball, moves a few metres and sends the ball from 25 meters with a cross. I still remember how I sat in the bus afterwards and thought: You’re talking about <a href="xherdan-shaqiri.html">Shaqiri</a>? <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a> is better. That was the beginning of my personal love for him. Granit was incredibly clear at the age of 18 in his actions and his views. He was a natura-born Leader. Also Momo <b>[<a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>]</b> was impressive - in a different way</p>

  <p><b>[Former Basel coach Heiko Vogel says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> has been hailed as a gentle killer]</b> He had everything - the speed, the finish, the left foot - and that wasn’t overlooked. Still, I would be lying if I said had prophesied such a massive global career for him. In fact, I was more sure about others: <a href="toni-kroos.html">Toni Kroos</a> or <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> - I saw them when they were 15 years old. The nice thing is, I met Momo last year and he has not changed at all. That’s outstanding. If you knew him… he is not a world star, he has such a gentle character. It was always clear to me that he is an outstanding player, but whether he had the mentality? I didn’t know that exactly. Momo is a gentle killer<br /><br />Gegge (sporting director Georg Heitz) and I told him: ‘Listen, just train as you like - we’ve already made our decision anyway’. Then he trained on the first day; everyone watched the session and we wondered if he might have a twin brother. The second day was a bit better, but not good. Gegge and I had already been talking him up for the tiniest things, saying stuff like: ‘did you see that pass?’. And then came the third day. It was then that he destroyed everything, he was really unstoppable.<br /><br /><b>[The first two days]</b> he wasn’t nervous. He was confident, but immersed in a new world. He had to acclimate himself in the truest sense of the word. He came to us from hot north Africa. It’s always difficult when you get into an environment where you do not really understand the language. <b>[But]</b> I have rarely seen such a dominant appearance in two-on-five <b>[on that third day]</b>. It was absolutely extraordinary. He was so agile, so explosive. If he had the ball on his left foot, it was a goal. But Momo always had an eye for his team-mates as well. After that performance everyone knew why we wanted to sign him</p>
