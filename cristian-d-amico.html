  <p><b>[Cristian D’Amico says he’s confident <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> will return to the club]</b> I am convinced, like many of my peers, that we can make history as a club if we get the best player in the world in a Newell’s shirt. I think we’re going to get the pleasure of <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> wearing the shirt. Imagine a game with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> in the Coloso <b>[Estadio <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Marcelo Bielsa</a>]</b>, with the press around the world. The sponsors who would come… that would make a difference economically, apart from the sentimental value, and could make a big difference to clean up the debts</p>

  <p><b>[Newell’s Old Boys are dreaming of the day their former youth team prospect Lionel Messi returns to the club]</b> The doors are open, it would be something outstanding that we all dream of. When Leo decides to play a match, a game, a championship or a semester, whenever he wants to play here, we will be open for him. His desire to return is very special for us. It makes us very happy and we hope he can play here in the future. Leo has been at Barcelona for many years, but is still a fan of Newell’s Old Boys. The first ball he had and kicked was here, all his family cheer for Newell’s Old Boys, his father is a fan and he speaks publicly when he says this is his desire. It was a beautiful and moving sensation. We were very happy and excited. He did not forget us. I was lucky to see him playing when he was a kid in our club, on our field. He was at Newell’s until he was 12 years old and then he went to Spain. And really, even when he was a child I already knew that he was distinct, even though he was very small. As a child, Leo already did many of the things he does today. Once in a derby against Rosario Central, he picked up the ball in our box from the goalkeeper, and dribbled six or seven opponents until he got to their penalty area. Then, he finished in an incredible way and the team won 5-0. Leo’s team were champions in all categories and, with all the respect to the other opponents, had no comparison. Leo has been above everyone since that time.<br /><br />I would tell him that the whole country is with him, with the Argentina national team and he will be the captain of this ship and everything that happens with Argentina depends on what he will do. Argentina has great players and a great team, but there is a different player from everyone who is Lionel Messi. He is the best player in the world and carries a lot of responsability. We all believe in him</p>
