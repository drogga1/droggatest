  <p><b>[Andre Schurrle insists <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> will show their superiority to advance to the Champions League quarter-finals despite a last-16 first-leg loss to Benfica]</b> I think we played better, especially in the first half, we had the better opportunities. Especially with the penalty, we should have won. There is a return leg and we will show that we were clearly better then and go through. We were clear through on goal and things didn’t work out. Such days happen</p>

  <p><b>[Fulham’s Germany international Andre Schurrle is disappointed at the upheaval to come this summer, as relegation cuts short his second spell in the Premier League]</b> It is difficult for the family because you sign for two seasons and you want to stay, you want to be comfortable, relax and have everything in place. And now you have to go back again. It’s not easy and not what I expected or wanted but, like I said, football is sometimes unexpected. I think I showed my qualities and the way I can play. Until January I felt very good on the pitch. I had my positions, I knew where to go, and I felt like I could score at any time. But for me it was a difficult season because I wanted to play all the games, get a lot of minutes, to come and be strong and obviously help the team to stay up or have a decent campaign. For me, as well as the team, it was not the best season. In the end we did not play close to the quality that I have, that the team has. I leave here with a lot of frustration and a lot of unfinished business.<br /><br />Until then I was feeling really good and that I could make a bit of a difference, help the team, and that maybe we could turn it around.<br /><br />It was a tough moment for me because the reason why I came here was to help the club, help the fans and the team, but after this I wasn’t able to get back to my normal stage and couldn’t help anymore.<br /><br />I saw all the games <b>[while sidelined]</b> and you always feel that you could do something, you can help, but at the same time you know your health isn’t close to being good enough to compete in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. It was a difficult time.</p>

  <p><b>[Andre Schurrle: Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> forward and World Cup winner retires at 29]</b> The decision has matured in me for a long time. I no longer need the applause. The depths became deeper and the highlights less and less. You always have to play a certain role in order to survive in the business otherwise you will lose your job and will not get a new one. Only performance on the pitch counts. I want to let you know that I’m stepping away from playing professional football<br /><br />On behalf of myself and my family I want to thank everybody who was a part of these phenomenal years! The support and love you shared with me was unbelievable and more I could have ever asked for! Now I’m ready and open for all the beautiful possibilities that are coming towards me</p>
