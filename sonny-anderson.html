  <p>[Sonny Anderson believes Pep Guardiola didn’t learn anything from Louis Van Gaal] I think he [Guardiola] did not learn anything from Van Gaal. Pep already had everything as a player to become the great coach he is. For me, it was Van Gaal who learned from Pep to play the Barcelona game. Van Gaal liked the long passes and Guardiola the short ones, and from these conversations the style we practised during those years was defined. Van Gaal gave certain instructions and then, within the field, Pep directed to the team based on how Barcelona had to do it by style and history. It was Guardiola who taught Van Gaal how the team had to play.<br /><br />I expected it. It’s difficult for players of that level to be in the same team at home. Puyol was always a great defender and from the first day he came to train with us he showed us his character. Xavi Hernandez had a lot of quality and he was already starting. They were able to do very good things and they grew up together since they were little, they knew what they had to do<br /><br />If Barcelona goes to Lyon thinking it will win easily, it will be the opposite. They are a team with quality players who tend to increase their performance against the most powerful teams and I think that they can even beat Barcelona in France. You can have it more expensive but in Lyon Barcelona should be very careful</p>

  <p>[Former Barcelona striker Sonny Anderson says Lionel Messi will be phenomenally difficult to replace] It’s complicated. For me, it was a very difficult time because when I arrived, I cost more money than Ronaldo and the fans expected from me a similar performance. Ronaldo was a unique player and the fans didn’t know much about me because I played in France. After Messi leaves, the player who replaces the No.10 shirt at Barcelona will have an even more difficult time of it than I did. I already said at the time, I did not come to replace Ronaldo because it was a new project and very different, but it did not work out as I expected and [then-coach Louis] Van Gaal’s system was not designed for the striker to score many goals.<br /><br />Messi is 100 per cent capable of winning any game on his own and at any moment he wants, and that is why Valverde takes care of him at Barcelona. He wants him to be at his best. Barcelona will suffer a lot when he is not there, so I see very well that they take care of him. I fully understand that he was not in the starting line against Real Madrid, and that the team has the quality to play some games without Messi. But as a rule Valverde has to try to get the most out of him because he is the only player in the world capable of deciding a game on his own<br /><br />The Lyon game is more difficult than it seems. Already against Manchester City and PSG, they have made good duels this season. It is a team that usually improves when playing against the strongest in Europe. I think with or without Messi, it will be very difficult for them. Lyon can get a good result at home but at Camp Nou it will be very difficult for them to do what Messi does<br /><br />[Anderson believes the current Barca team is far stronger than the one he played for 20 years ago] Many things have changed since then. Before, we only had one pitch to train on, but today they have a fantastic sports city. It has changed for the better, fortunately, although at that time the players had much more tranquility to go for a walk and there was less pressure than now. We didn’t use to go through the Champions League rounds. Sometimes it was difficult to qualify. Now they have won many titles, whereas before they had certain historical urgencies that they no longer have. Today, Barcelona’s best 11 are the best 11 in the world in their posts. We were very good but not the best</p>
