  <p><b>[Matthijs de Ligt and Frenkie de Jong are good enough to play for any club in Europe]</b> Both have quality to play in any club in the world. They are two really young players, with great potential and so much quality.</p>

  <p><b>[Roma and Borussia Dortmund tried to sign David Neres during the summer transfer window]</b> Official offers came <b>[from Roma and Dortmund]</b>, some rumours too. I honestly wasn’t following closely, but I was in doubt about what could happen. My wish was always to remain in Ajax a little longer because I can evolve and win titles. It’s a club that value the players raised in its youth system, as every club should do. Ajax knows to bet in youth potential, and that’s why it creates so many players. It’s a player machine because there’s a bet not only on Dutch players, but there’s also a worldwide search for talent<br /><br />Ajax is going well, it is strong searching its objectives. I believe it will work. This season’s team is stronger, more meshed, we gained mature and experienced players. We have a great team, and we prove it in the UCL, against Bayern Munchen and Benfica. We can face any team</p>

  <p><b>[Sliding doors for new Brazil star David Neres]</b> But then I saw the same number in my WhatsApp messages and I saw who it was. I immediately called back. The name at the top of screen read, ‘Tite’. It’s unbelievable what has happened this week. It’s certainly my best as a football player. If I had gone to China in January <b>[when Ajax received a huge bid from <a href="guangzhou-evergrande.html">Guangzhou Evergrande</a>]</b>, I might not have been called up</p>

  <p><b>[Neres admitted recently that he was too fickle in the first few months]</b> I regretted that I didn’t get picked and often sat on the bench. All those things made me insecure. It wasn’t fun. The most important thing I could do was keep working. I always kept my focus, in case the team needed me. I wanted to be ready<br /><br />I started playing at the highest level again. That is important for my career and to put me in the limelight. It’s also important for my place in the national team and my career in the future</p>

  <p><b>[With 23 domestic goals in the past two campaigns, Neres appears to have outgrown the Eredivisie and could be ready for a dream switch to England]</b> Of course <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> interests me. It’s the best league in the world, and I’ve always wanted to play there. But I leave all that in God’s hands. I still have a contract and at the moment I’m only thinking of the national team, I will see what I’ll do in the future. I don’t know what the other <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> players will do.<br /><br /><b>[The 22-year-old came close to leaving Amsterdam for China when a €40 million offer was made in January]</b> I might not be <b>[part of the national team]</b> otherwise. I’m glad I didn’t go. I didn’t have a very good time back then. I didn’t play every game for <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and it was a good offer that they gave me. I talked to everyone, including my family, about what would be the best. I’m happy with the decision that I made together with <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. We then had a fantastic campaign in the Champions League, with victories over <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. So I think it was the right choice</p>

  <p><b>[David Neres has committed his future to <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> amid a series of reports suggesting he was set to leave the club this summer]</b> I’m having a beer because I have something to celebrate. I have to be back at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> on July 28. My future is with Ajax<br /><br /><b>[Neres was used as a substiture for the Selecao during their home tournament and admitted]</b> It was hard to lose my spot. I did my best, but it was not enough. In the end I’m a part of the team and it’s most important that we win. Therefore I’m still satisfied. It’s great to win this prize with the national team. It’s a dream for me and the other players. Now it’s time to celebrate. We had a nice party in the dressing room. We danced and after that it was time to see my family. It was a good experience for me to be here and play with experienced players. I feel older myself and more experienced. That’s good for my development</p>
