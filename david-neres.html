  <p><b>[David Neres has committed his future to Ajax amid a series of reports suggesting he was set to leave the club this summer]</b> I’m having a beer because I have something to celebrate. I have to be back at Ajax on July 28. My future is with Ajax<br /><br /><b>[Neres was used as a substiture for the Selecao during their home tournament and admitted]</b> It was hard to lose my spot. I did my best, but it was not enough. In the end I’m a part of the team and it’s most important that we win. Therefore I’m still satisfied. It’s great to win this prize with the national team. It’s a dream for me and the other players. Now it’s time to celebrate. We had a nice party in the dressing room. We danced and after that it was time to see my family. It was a good experience for me to be here and play with experienced players. I feel older myself and more experienced. That’s good for my development</p>

It’s the best league in the world, and I’ve always wanted to play there. But I leave all that in God’s hands</p>
