  <p><b>[With 23 domestic goals in the past two campaigns, Neres appears to have outgrown the Eredivisie and could be ready for a dream switch to England]</b> Of course the Premier League interests me. It’s the best league in the world, and I’ve always wanted to play there. But I leave all that in God’s hands. I still have a contract and at the moment I’m only thinking of the national team, I will see what I’ll do in the future. I don’t know what the other Ajax players will do.<br /><br /><b>[The 22-year-old came close to leaving Amsterdam for China when a €40 million offer was made in January]</b> I might not be <b>[part of the national team]</b> otherwise. I’m glad I didn’t go. I didn’t have a very good time back then. I didn’t play every game for Ajax and it was a good offer that they gave me. I talked to everyone, including my family, about what would be the best. I’m happy with the decision that I made together with Ajax. We then had a fantastic campaign in the Champions League, with victories over Real Madrid and Juventus. So I think it was the right choice</p>

  <p><b>[David Neres has committed his future to Ajax amid a series of reports suggesting he was set to leave the club this summer]</b> I’m having a beer because I have something to celebrate. I have to be back at Ajax on July 28. My future is with Ajax<br /><br /><b>[Neres was used as a substiture for the Selecao during their home tournament and admitted]</b> It was hard to lose my spot. I did my best, but it was not enough. In the end I’m a part of the team and it’s most important that we win. Therefore I’m still satisfied. It’s great to win this prize with the national team. It’s a dream for me and the other players. Now it’s time to celebrate. We had a nice party in the dressing room. We danced and after that it was time to see my family. It was a good experience for me to be here and play with experienced players. I feel older myself and more experienced. That’s good for my development</p>
