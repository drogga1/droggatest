  <p><b>[The match was always going to be a significant one for David, who after being born in New York, spent the first six years of his life in Haiti before moving to Canada]</b> Definitely, it’s a special game. It’s not every day you get to play against the country where you lived when you were younger. But I still need to go there with the mindset that I have to do a job for my country and play for my country and try to do my best<br /><br /><b>[Off the pitch, David also appears to have ice running through his veins, showing no signs of worry ahead of Canada’s crunch quarter-final match]</b> I’m feeling good because, you know, I love playing football and that’s what I’m doing. So for me it’s not about pressure - it’s more about enjoying the moment.<br /><br /><b>[From playing park football in Canada to the cusp of playing in the Europa League, David admits his move to Genk has had a lot to do with his brilliant form on the international stage]</b> Before that I was still playing in Ottawa for just a local club. So, of course, that was a massive step for my career. I had to grow up faster and learn things on my own. I just had to adapt quicker and learn the game. Because over there, they don’t wait for you to get better. You just have to get better on your own. And I think that really helped me develop as a player and get to where I am today</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> target Jonathan David has revealed he hopes to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> one day]</b> I don’t really focus on that or think much about it. Right now I’m playing almost every minute of every game and that has really helped me get to the level that I need to be. I just need to take a good step where I can make sure I am getting enough time on the pitch to keep developing. I don’t want to go somewhere and just stay on the bench so it’s about taking the right step. I want to become one of the best strikers in the world. That’s my goal. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is the best in the world and most competitive so obviously that is somewhere I would love to play in the future<br /><br /><b>[The 20-year-old also spoke highly of current club Gent, who allowed him to miss a selection of matches in December to return home following the death of his mother, Rose]</b> It meant a lot to me. It was a difficult situation and I needed the support of people around me. The club knew the best thing for me was to be around my family so they let me take the time that I needed and obviously I’m very grateful for that.<br /><br /><b>[David was born in New York but rejected the chance to play for the USMNT]</b> Canada has given me a good life and made me the man I am today. I’m grateful for that and now it is really about giving back to the country which gave to me. That’s why for me it was a no-brainer picking Canada and really trying to do something special with the group we have now and put the country where it needs to be. For all of us the target is the World Cup in 2022, which I think we have a great chance of qualifying for. It would be amazing to play on home soil in 2026 but we know that is in the future</p>

  <p><b>[Gent star Jonathan David says he is ready to move to a bigger club and has his sights set on the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>]</b> I never knew big clubs would be interested in me so early. It’s overwhelming, but I think I can make the next step. It’s time for me to move and go somewhere where I can keep developing and get to the potential that I have. The league that would suit me the most right now is the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. It’s similar to the Belgian league in terms of the tempo and the physicality, but obviously the quality is higher in Germany and there is more competition<br /><br />I didn’t want to go to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, because I wanted to test myself in Europe. I had trials at Salzburg and Stuttgart which didn’t work out. My agent then said there is another club in Belgium <b>[Gent]</b> and I had two trials with them and it went well so I joined. What was good for my development is for the first six months I just trained with the team. That allowed me to adapt to the city and the playing style and helped me adapt to the league. The level and intensity was much higher than what I had experienced before<br /><br />I only did six months with the second team and then right away I was doing pre-season with the first team, and now I’m getting better, scoring goals and everything is going good. For me it has been exceptional. I didn’t think everything would go so fast, but I’m pretty happy it did</p>
