<blockquote>
  <p><a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> reminded me of my school geography teacher when I first encountered him at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s London Colney training ground back in September 1996. I half expected him to have leather patches on the elbows of his jacket. Of course he didn’t, but that was the image given out by this studious-looking man<br /><br />I’ve got to admit I hadn’t even heard of Arsene when he was appointed to take over from Bruce Rioch 10 years ago this week. I’d tried to do a bit of research on him, but there wasn’t much information available. What first struck me about him was how calm and softly spoken he was - the complete opposite of <a href="george-graham.html">George Graham</a>, who had a sergeant-major approach to management<br /><br />And Arsene had all the players into his office to go over their contracts. He couldn’t believe what <a href="nigel-winterburn.html">Nigel Winterburn</a> and me were on. Traditionally full-backs were the worst-paid players in a football team - and we were no exception. But Arsene looked at what we were getting paid and said ‘that’s not right’ and we were given immediate wage rises<br /><br />In my book, there’s nobody better at preparing a player for a match than <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>. If one of his players doesn’t go out and play well on a Saturday, he can’t blame it on preparation<br /><br />Arsene’s first signings were Gilles Grimandi, <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a>, <a href="emmanuel-petit.html">Emmanuel Petit</a> and <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Nicolas Anelka</a>. None of us had really heard of any of them, but they came in and were absolutely fantastic, on and off the pitch. Arsene’s signings from day one until now have generally been excellent - he’s made very few mistakes in the transfer market<br /><br />When he arrived at the club I was 32 and the rest of the ‘famous back four’ of <a href="tony-adams.html">Tony Adams</a>, <a href="martin-keown.html">Martin Keown</a> and <a href="nigel-winterburn.html">Nigel Winterburn</a> were over 30 as well. Yet we were all pretty open to Arsene’s new ideas. We were at an age when you begin to get a few niggles and start thinking that retirement isn’t too far away. Arsene told us he could extend our careers if we followed his advice, so we listened. I played six years under him before I retired, so his methods can’t be too bad<br /><br />Arsene also encouraged us to be free in the way we played football and to do what came naturally on the pitch. It was liberating and the style of football we played changed dramatically<br /><br /><a href="george-graham.html">George Graham</a> had taught me the art of defending, both as an individual and as part of a unit, and I’ve got a lot to thank him for. He laid the foundations for me to become the player I eventually turned into, but Arsene released the shackles. I was allowed to venture forward more and told not to worry about making mistakes<br /><br />In truth, I think Arsene realised the back four was a little bit better than he had initially thought. Indeed in the end he probably kept us on a bit too long, because after we left - all at around the same time - there was a dip defensively<br /><br />Arsene has undoubtedly been one of the biggest influences on the modern-day Premiership. His 10 years at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have flown by, and there haven’t been too many bad times. It was an absolute pleasure to play under him and I’m sure the players who are currently in the squad would agree. To work at that training ground every day and play at the Emirates on a Saturday, all under the guidance of professor <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>, where better is there to ply your trade?</p>

So that’s a big area of pitch to replace somebody<br /><br />You can put a body in there and I think that’s been a problem at centre-back as is well-documented, with <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a> going in there who’s a brilliant footballer but he’s not got that sixth sense of somebody just nicking in-behind him off his shoulder<br /><br />The amount of times you go ‘they’re in position’ but somehow someone gets in, the little ones around the corner are difficult to deal with, especially around the box.<br /><br />I think <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Laporte</a>, his absence, has caused a real problem with that area of the pitch. And then taking <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a> out of <b>[midfield]</b> to put him elsewhere, there’s a kind of domino effect in the team. With the ball I don’t think they’re that different, they’re still brilliantly exciting to watch. But I think defensively that one area is affected a lot of the team and that’s probably why</p>

Can we change something?’. But there’s no leaders in that team, there’s no <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a> to go ‘boss can we change the system or something?’. Unai is banging the drum about how he wants to play and the players can’t do it</p>

He is at a crossroads. The buck stops with the manager. If the players can’t do what he wants, it is a problem. Do they understand what he wants them to do - and are they good enough to do it?

Does he just look at balance sheets? Is he integral to the fabric of the club about how they play, what they play, what they produce, what the academy’s like? I don’t know those answers. So if he came out and said ‘Right, this is what we want to do with this football club’ - but we don’t hear from him, we don’t hear what the strategy long term is.<br /><br />If he’s just developing a cash cow in order to have something to be able to get money out and have his thing there, because he’s obviously now in complete control of the club from the top, then that’s it. If he comes out and says ‘No actually, we want a project, we want to bring <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a> in, we want to go <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> orientated, old school, he knows the club, and we want to build the academy and build this amazing football club’ then go down that road.

  <p><b>[Lee Dixon says <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Freddie Ljungberg</a> will be fully awake at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> now]</b> I don’t think the atmosphere is a reflection of Freddie, I think that’s aimed at the players and what they have watched. If he’s under any illusions about the size of the job he’s got as caretaker, let alone if he went on to become the manager, then he’s fully awake now. That performance was abject, was sloppy. They had a 20-minute spell where they thought they were going to get back in the game, it was all bubbling away, but the level of complacency at times, what that does is just allow Brighton to pass the ball easily. They could not believe their luck playing on a pitch like this playing against a top-quality club, not necessarily side. Coming here, there was always pressure to be on top of your game, but Brighton didn’t have to be that good. They were good but they didn’t have to be, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> let them play far too much<br /><br />What is really upsetting, and it has been all season, is it’s fine if you make a mistake but if you make a mistake one week, then go out and do it again the next week, it’s different. There are players out there doing exactly the same now as they did at the end of last season. As a coach, Emery couldn’t fix it. Freddie has got a massive job now to look at that and ask how they had so much space in midfield. He said he watched the game against <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> twice and now I’m saying to Freddie, I’m putting him under pressure, he needs to go and work that out on the training pitch. I’m sure he is trying but the players have got to take responsibility. Just be compact and organised</p>

  <p><b>[Lee Dixon says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> should be challenging for one and two in the Premier League]</b> He’s not going to go in and get in the top four in the first six months – that is not going to happen. It is a long-term project; there is no doubt about that. But, ultimately, any coach that comes in, they will all tell you it’s all about players; the game has always been about players and it will always be about players, because they are the ones who put the plans into action. So is the squad good enough? You would look at it after last night and say ‘yes’. But moving forward … forget top four and top six, this team – my <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> Football Club – has to be challenging for one and two; be second pushing for first. That is the level they need to get back to, but it is a massive mountain to climb from where we are right now<br /><br />I don’t want to go overboard on his progress three games in, but there are definitely signs.

I’ve been the most critical of <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> over the years. My game was built on hard work and the teams I played in were built on hard work. Even the 1998 double side and the 2002 side, they worked their socks off regardless of how good and fast flowing they were.<br /><br />It was demanded of them by everyone, everyone single one of them. I think <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> said it was contagious. The body language you put on the pitch and the way people look at it. The body language of them closing down. They were all at it and they all went at the right time - and he was part of that. The benefit he got was that the players around him were willing to do some of his work. Stats can be false now and then when it says he ran this and he ran that. But what type of runs are they? How much is jogging? How much of it is fast sprinting? He is a player who is so talented so he doesn’t have to be sprinting, he just moves into space.<br /><br /><a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is similar. He will just walk and then you get him the ball. But if you have a structure in place to find them, that has been so evident in the last few games as he has been doing his flicks. He has been doing his flicks before but it is just the ball is coming to him much more. He is in a decent position and he has a structure behind, so that if it doesn’t come off he has protection behind him</p>

Just sit back down for a bit and carry on churning the results out<br /><br />I’m pleased that he’s bucked up and he’s playing well, but you can’t say to the crowd ‘When he gets it, don’t say anything, don’t feel nervous’. The crowd feel what they feel. You’re a professional footballer playing at the top of your game for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>.

But you can’t be sheltered from that, that’s part of being a footballer. If you can’t handle it and it gets to you, no disrespect, go and play lower down the leagues.

This is <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, we’re here to do one thing and that’s win trophies<br /><br />My advice to him would be put your hair back how it was, take your sunglasses off, go and hide behind your captain and churn out 25 performances</p>

He said that was the making of him</p>

  <p><b>[Matteo Guendouzi needs a Patrick Vieira-type figure alongside him at Arsenal]</b> I completely agree with leaving him out. It wouldn’t have happened in my day – well, it might have happened once but it wouldn’t have happened again. Somebody needs to have a word with him and I’m sure <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> has done – he wouldn’t have just left him out at Southampton and not said anything. There will have been a conversation and then it is about the ability of that player to take that message on board and see what he does with them. You don’t just do what the coach says, you listen and use your football intelligence to work out the good bits, the bad bits and what will get you to the next level. The next level for him is not being sat at home and watching the game on TV, it is about being in the team every week<br /><br /><b>[on Guenzous’s outburst]</b> It is not the first time we have seen a bit of petulance from him. He is a talented boy but, unfortunately for him, he has got his chance in a team that has not really got a lot of leaders on the pitch. If you picked <a href="matteo-guendouzi.html">Guendouzi</a> out of the team now and stuck him next to <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a>, he would be a totally different player because he would be led around the pitch and told where to go. He almost needs to be coached both tactically and behavioural-wise from within the team group and I don’t know if that is going to happen. That is the problem he has got, he needs someone to grab hold of him and give him a little socially-distanced hug – sit down with him and talk to him, analyse his game with him.</p>
