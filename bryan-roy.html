  <p><b>[Bryan Roy says Van de Beek perfectly suited to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>]</b> Donny would be perfectly suited to the <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> midfield and Italian football in general. He is another of those lads from the golden generation that I know so well, as both he and <a href="matthijs-de-ligt.html">Matthijs de Ligt</a> were in my squad. Physically, <a href="donny-van-de-beek.html">van de Beek</a> has always been devastating, as even from a young age he knew how to attack and defend. He was very shy, but strong on the field. He is a total player and specialises in pushing forward from midfield. I’d like to see him exchanging passes with <a href="miralem-pjanic.html">Miralem Pjanic</a> or defending alongside Rodrigo Bentancur, and in general I think he is suited to <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>’s style. If he were to leave <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>, considering his characteristics, I think he’d do very well in Italy. I should know, as I too was very happy in Serie A<br /><br /><b>[on De Ligt]</b> I knew his talent would overcome the criticism. I played in Italy, so I know how different it is from the Dutch game. In fact, I was surprised that De Ligt was able to adapt so quickly. Maybe it’s because he is learning the language faster, and he struck up a friendship with Stefan de Vrij at Inter. It’s a bit like I was with Aaron Winter at <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a>, we were always in contact and helped each other settle in<br /><br /><b>[Roy added on the exit talk which has built around De Ligt of late]</b> He made the best decision he possibly could, which was joining <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. I’ve known Matthijs since he was 15 years old. I think these are just rumours and he’ll be with the <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a> for many years to come. He still needs to win three or four <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> titles and the Champions League with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>!</p>
