  <p>[Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi would both struggle to score 50 goals in a Serie A season] Since he has been in Italy, he has had a big impact just on the image of Serie A alone. Serie A is more valuable with him in it. I think for many years, Serie A has been underrated. In Italy, it is difficult to score. If Messi or Ronaldo come to Italy, it is almost impossible to score 50 goals like they do in Spain because it is more defensive. I think now though more people will watch Serie A and see how strong the league is. I think his arrival is so positive for Serie A. I think it is going to be sold out [for Juventus]. There are going to be so many people and it will be crowded outside the stadium. It gives a lot to a city like that to see a big player come here. He is maybe one of the best players of all time and it will give a lot to the people. We look forward to it<br /><br />I have faced him in the Euros in France, in the first game, so it will be the same as that. There are no tactics to stop him, we just hope he has a bad day, but he has so few bad days. We will just try our best<br /><br />To be honest, after two and a half years in Udinese, I needed to move. Udinese wants to play with a lot of young players. The director of the club came to me and said if I want I could change teams because I would not get the playing time I would want. They said that to me and Danilo, the captain and we are the same age. Why Frosinone? Well, they were just so interested, you know. They have the ambition to try and be in Serie A. I have been there with Verona. I have had some difficult seasons and I know what it is like to fight for your life. I like the project. The president is a really good person, when I met the director and president I thought they were good with their ambitions. They want to do things the right way and I came here to be a key player. I came here to give my best to stay in Serie A. For my own ambitions, I want to play all the games and to get the team to stay in Serie A. That was the project and I thought, why not?<br /><br />[He admits that he is a little bit disappointed about the country’s showing in the World Cup] I think it was a little bit disappointing to be honest because we had a really good game against Argentina. We got a great point, but in the second game against Nigeria, we weren’t on our day to be honest. Maybe if we got a draw in that game it would be different. Then against Croatia, we had so many chances to score. They had already won the group, which made it easier, maybe. We had created so many chances in that game. We were fighting at 1-1, then they got this 2-1 goal which just killed us. Our aim was to go through the group and be second in the group. It was a little bit of a failure but we need to stay proud of our achievement. I think a small country of just 300,000 people like Iceland to go to a World Cup is just incredible. When I was younger, I didn’t even imagine I would go to a World Cup. I played in the first and the third games. I remember them both like yesterday. The tension was so high and the atmosphere was unbelievable. Even talking about it, gives me the feeling in my stomach. Just these two games alone live with me forever. I enjoy going to the national team, I have a lot of friends. I am still playing at the highest level and we have a new coach. If he picks me, which I think he will, I will continue. As long as I keep enjoying it this much, I will go to. Why would you stop? After a few years you could regret quitting to early. I will enjoy it while I can. I think that we can still do it. We showed that we can do it. We have the right mentality to keep going. There will be more players coming in. With respect to how few we are, we have produced a lot of players. Now, I think we will aim to go to the Euros and I think we can do it. We have almost the same team. There are not too many players who are too old to play. I even think we can improve with this team. Our aim is to go to this tournament.</p>

  <p>[Emil Hallfredsson championed Jorginho at Verona] He wanted to be better. You can see that in football, in his head he is like one or two steps in front of everybody. You can’t say he is really fast or has a special shot. He just has this picture in his mind. He has this map. He is like Pirlo a little bit, he is two steps ahead. I had a good relationship with our coach and I kept saying to him all the time that Jorginho needs to play. The way he plays the ball, he has this great personality on the pitch. He took this great step to go to Napoli to play this really good football. Since he went to Napoli, he has grown so, so much as a player. It is so great to see. I can’t say that I knew the whole time that he could play for Chelsea but I knew he was going to be a good player for sure and it is nice to watch him grow. I enjoyed it when I played against him with Napoli for the first time. I just said to him, ‘don’t do too much or I will fuck you up!’ No, I joke</p>
