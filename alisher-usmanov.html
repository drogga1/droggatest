  <p><b>[Alisher Usmanov has urged Arsenal to seek continuity when seeking a successor to Arsene Wenger]</b> Some continuity is needed. This includes the need to prepare a successor for Wenger, but in a very respectful way. I can suggest that Wenger himself can prepare a successor<br /><br />I do not think that the coach alone is to be blamed for what is happening<br /><br />I personally, unfortunately, am fully isolated from decision-making in the club. All the responsibility for the fate of the club rests with the main shareholder</p>

  <p><b>[Alisher Usmanov has admitted that he could sell his stake in Arsenal if the right offer were to appear]</b> In recent days there has been speculation relating to a possible offer for my 30% stake in Arsenal. As part of that I can understand the anxiety that these rumours are causing to the fans as reflected by the Arsenal Supporters Trust.<br /><br />In light of this, I would like to be clear that I am not holding any talks with Mr Kroenke about a sale. My interest in Arsenal from the beginning was long term and my intention has always been to buy additional shares should they become available. This I did with the purchase of the stake of my business partner Farhad Moshiri with which I increased my shareholding from 15% to 30%, and also with my proposed offer for the stake of the majority shareholder which valued the club at some £2bn. That offer remains valid today<br /><br />I have always been and will continue to be an ardent supporter of Arsenal and I see my 30% stake as an important aspect in protecting the best interests of the fans in the club.<br /><br />It has been well documented that I have no say in the running of the club, that my views differ from those of the majority shareholder and that I would take a different approach to delivering footballing success.<br /><br />I would like to assure supporters that I am open to various future scenarios: a constructive partnership with the majority shareholder, the purchase of his stake either alone or in a consortium, or if a party appears who shares my and undoubtedly the majority of fans’ vision for the club, I could consider the question of selling my stake</p>

  <p><b>[Quizzed on potential investment at Goodison Park]</b> We are friends with Farhad Moshiri.

  <p><b>[When asked if he would invest in the Merseyside outfit]</b> Yes, with great pleasure, if <b>[Moshiri]</b> asks. I am thinking about my investment in this club. I cannot reject <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I will not leave them as a fan. But if I join <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, then I will wear an <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> shirt, because I am a professional<br /><br /><b>[His holding company USM already sponsor the club’s Finch Farm training ground and have done so since 2017]</b> It’s not obligatory for me to participate myself. I could sponsor them. I could be a shareholder. They’re going to build a new stadium. Why not the USM Arena?<br /><br /><b>[Usmanov further noted that he felt <a href="josh-kroenke.html">Kroenke</a> made a mistake in buying him out at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Emirates Stadium</a>, adding that he felt they would have attained greater success working together as joint owners]</b> If we had worked together, we would definitely have achieved so much more. But the time will come for more success and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s fans will come back to the stadium</p>
