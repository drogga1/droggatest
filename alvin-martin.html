  <p><b>[Marko Arnautovic has been urged to ignore talk of interest from the likes of Chelsea]</b> I hope he’ll see the light. Looking back on my career, one of the biggest things I’ve taken into my 50s and 60s is that I played for the right club. I was connected with that club and I’m still connected with that club and its fan base. There’s a value in that.<br /><br />When a player gets that, it’s a very special thing. The fans adore him, the manager wants to build a team around him. One player who sums up the situation is Paolo Di Canio. I think they’re very similar. He’s a leader, he’s got charisma, he’s a personality that the fans adore. Di Canio walks back into West Ham and he is given such a welcome. That’s a big thing for a player and it’s something you should think about. He <b>[Arnautovic]</b> is someone who loves being loved. He loves being the main man and that’s what he is at West Ham</p>

  <p><b>[Declan Rice can follow Rio Ferdinand’s lead by attracting interest from bigger clubs]</b> Declan looks a high calibre player. This doesn’t please me to say this but I think now the bigger clubs in the division will be looking at him and thinking ‘he will fit in to our team’ - a team that’s looking to win the title. That’s the sort of player I think he’s got the potential to be. He might not be there yet but I think it would be foolish for one of the top clubs not to look at him now and seriously think about taking him.<br /><br />I used to look at Rio Ferdinand at West Ham and think ‘I can’t believe Manchester United or Arsenal didn’t come in and get him <b>[until after he signed for Leeds]</b>’. Because if you come and get him two or three years down the line then you’re going to have to pay a lot more money for him. He’s going to cost a lot more now that he’s just signed a long-term contract so West Ham are in a really great position.<br /><br />Declan, I believe, is someone who is destined to play for England if his heart’s in it. He’s good enough to play in that midfield area</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> legend Alvin Martin talks about his 33-year-old son David’s debut in goal for the club, a 1-0 shock win at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> When he came up the stairs and he knew he’d done it, it was an incredible feeling as a parent. I’ve played at the highest level and the highs that you get are unbelievable, but they are way down the pecking order when something like that happens with your child. You’ve seen them progress, you’ve seen them go through ups and downs</p>
