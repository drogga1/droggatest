  <p>[Rodrigo Bentancur has hailed Cristiano Ronaldo for his winning mentality] When I heard about the signing, we all had the uncertainty of whether he was going to join us, if he was going to share in the dressing room - that’s how it was. We were intrigued about his personality and we have seen a very simple guy. He has dinner with the group, stays with us in the rooms… he even loves the ‘mate’ that I brought from Uruguay! He always stays chatting with us after dinner. It is amazing. It impresses us all how he trains. He never likes to lose and that is what has led him to win so much and be what he is. Before knowing him, he generated some talk. Now he has shown us his simplicity outside the pitch. It is a pleasure to have him as a team-mate.<br /><br />Cris does not like to lose, he wants to win and score. Maybe, sometimes, we win 4-0 and he does not score - he goes mad at that. But it’s because of his ambition. His winning mentality is what has led him to be among the two best in the world. He is a winner and he shows it in every game<br /><br />[Bentancur is pleased with how the 2018-19 campaign has panned out] For me it is a very good season, beyond what happened in the Champions League against Ajax. Removing that, the season was impressive. We lost very few games and won the eighth Scudetto [in a row]. In Italy, we give the Scudetto a lot of importance. It is even more difficult than the Champions League. In Europe, matches are very even and fast against unexpected rivals. It is true that losing to Ajax was a big disappointment but there will be another chance</p>

  <p>[Rodrigo Bentancur has signed a new contract with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> that ties him to the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> champions until 2024] Rodrigo Bentancur has officially extended his <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> stay by penning a contract, which will tie him to the club until 2024. After only making his <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a> bow two years ago, Bentancur has shown in that time that he can be a dependable, intelligent and an agile midfielder, who demonstrates his class each time he steps onto the pitch. Arriving from <a href="boca-juniors.html">Boca Juniors</a> before the start of the 2017/18 season, fans were already curious to see what impact he would bring to the team, and he duly answered with a large of number of mature displays.<br /><br />Although we talk about his maturity, we must remember that Rodrigo is still just 21 years of age, despite having already gone on to be crowned a league champion on four different occasions (two with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and two with Boca Juniors), winning seven trophies overall in his club career. Young and talented are two recurrent terms if we talk about him, and he was among the list of <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a> who scored this season, with <a href="moise-kean.html">Moise Kean</a> the only player younger than him in the team to find the back of the net</p>
