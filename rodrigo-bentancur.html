Rodrigo Bentancur has signed a new contract to keep him at Juventus until 2024</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Rodrigo Bentancur has signed a new contract with Juventus that ties him to the Serie A champions until 2024] Rodrigo Bentancur has officially extended his Juventus stay by penning a contract, which will tie him to the club until 2024. After only making his Bianconeri bow two years ago, Bentancur has shown in that time that he can be a dependable, intelligent and an agile midfielder, who demonstrates his class each time he steps onto the pitch. Arriving from Boca Juniors before the start of the 2017/18 season, fans were already curious to see what impact he would bring to the team, and he duly answered with a large of number of mature displays.<br /><br />Although we talk about his maturity, we must remember that Rodrigo is still just 21 years of age, despite having already gone on to be crowned a league champion on four different occasions (two with Juventus and two with Boca Juniors), winning seven trophies overall in his club career. Young and talented are two recurrent terms if we talk about him, and he was among the list of Bianconeri who scored this season, with Moise Kean the only player younger than him in the team to find the back of the net</p>
