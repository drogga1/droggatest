  <p><b>[Chris Smalling has recounted how a young Marcus Rashford burst onto the first-team scene back in 2016, recalling his impact in a training match]</b> Obviously, it was under Van Gaal when I first came across him. Going through that week, a few of the strikers had got injured and then, as Louis was very confident in the youngsters, he got the youth team to come over and we played a game against them. I remember, one time, the ball got played in behind and I can’t remember who was playing at left-back for us but I just saw Rashy zoom down to get the ball. At that moment, everyone took notice of him. It was only a matter of a week or a couple of weeks after that when he made his debut and obviously hit the ground running. It was that first sprint down the wing, I think, when a lot of us were asking: ‘Who is this kid?’<br /><br /><b>[Smalling recalls that Will Keane, another young striker who had been on United’s books, would likely to have played ahead of the England international had he not picked up an injury]</b> He was playing wide, well he was in that session, but they said he was a striker and he was filling in for whomever in that position. Will Keane was waiting for his chance as well, and picked up an injury, so that opened the door for Rashy. It was obviously that pace that first alerted us but I know now, as I’ve been playing with him for so long, that he’s got everything. He is a special talent. I think he almost took it all in his stride. You could tell he was a confident kid. You need to be at this club, I think, and to be a No.9 as well. You could tell he wasn’t fazed, coming up to the first team and being really thrown in, as you could see he was a special talent. The manager at the time knew that and put him straight in.<br /><br />He didn’t play much for the Reserves as he skipped that stage. But we saw a lot of the youth-team games because of the fact they’re on MUTV. Quite often, when we’re training inside, and getting stretched, it will be on the screen so we do keep up to date with the youth-team games. At that time, we had quite a few young players. Not as young as Rashy but a lot of them knew him already and that helps coming into the environment so it’s not totally daunting getting to know 25 players. The fact a lot of other players had come through the Academy as well definitely helped him.</p>

I’m looking forward to joining up with my teammates<br /><br /><b>[Speaking on Twitter]</b> Manchester – the club, the people, the city, has always held a special place in my heart but I still have as much desire to play regular first-team football as I did when I joined the club over nine years ago. <a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> is a fantastic club, with a lot of history and I’m relishing the new challenge they have offered me.

It happened very quickly. I am very focused on the next game, getting up to speed with training and learning the manager’s methods. And then hopefully I’ll have a very good season.

It has been great to have won it previously, but it would be even greater to win it here in Italy</p>

  <p><b>[Defender Chris Smalling says racism is unacceptable and should not be stood for, in his first press conference since joining the <a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> from Manchester United]</b> I think racism is unacceptable and should not be stood for. It is not an issue just in Italy, it is around the world. There needs to be a change, there will be generational changes and younger people will have a different perspective. But it does happen, not just in Italy but around the world, and it is very sad and unacceptable that it still happens in these modern times<br /><br />There is a lot of responsibility on the defence as a whole <b>[in Italy]</b> and the centre-backs too, but that is something I enjoy. I like to push up high, play high up the pitch, and the manager wants us to be high. I am a defender that likes to defend on the front foot so I think this is the perfect type of football for me and hopefully it allows me to show my real qualities. I think <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> has always been a goal of mine to play in one day, because as a defender if you get the chance to experience <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> you want to do it.

  <p><b>[Smalling happy to have avoided taking the easy way out at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> and retains England ambition]</b> The easy decision was to stay. I had spoken to the manager before Harry came and I knew I was behind him and Vic <b>[Lindelof]</b> but in previous seasons I had started behind <b>[two first-choice centre-backs]</b> and after four or five games I had worked myself into the team. I love a challenge and when a new centre-back comes in it makes you raise your game. You have to show more, you have to be more consistent. If I had stayed I would have taken on that challenge and I would have been very confident that I would have played the number of games that I was worthy of. Equally I have a challenge here at <a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a>. Going back <b>[at the end of the season]</b> I will have an added element that some of the centre-backs won’t have<br /><br /><b>[Smalling added on his discussions with United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer]</b> He said I would get games. I am used to playing when I am fit. Although that might have been slightly different this season, I would have had the cup games and then in the league, depending on injuries. Would it have been the 40-50 games that I am used to if fit? It might have been the 20-30. Still a good number of games but I want to play<br /><br /><b>[While looking to remain a regular at club level, the international door with England appears to have closed for Smalling]</b> I am disappointed. I was used to going to England. I was playing regularly for United up to when I left. The aspiration is always there. Ultimately it is down to the manager’s choice. What was said was maybe unfair at times and managers <b>[who have picked me]</b> at United are some of the world-class ones. Some of the things that maybe he <b>[Southgate]</b> mentioned … I feel even the managers who have been brought in at United have certain ways of playing and some of them are quite similar to <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a>. I guess football is a game of opinions. I am definitely not going to agree with him and he might not agree with some of the things that I would say back. Ultimately I would never close that door and hopefully work my way in at some point. It is looking slim under Gareth but never say never</p>

But I am enjoying my new chapter, and hopefully I can keep affecting performances on the pitch and we can have a successful season. But right now I’m really enjoying being in Italy<br /><br />I’m starting to pick up things the manager is saying in Italian, and even with the players I’m lucky as quite a few of them speak English. I’m definitely picking up a lot of football phrases and a lot of basic phrases that are helping me interact with the team on and off the pitch. I am feeling very settled; my family is over here and the dogs are over here, so everyone is settled. When my family are happy and I am happy it shows on the pitch.<br /><br />Overall I can’t ask for much more in terms of my stay, which has been short so far, and at the minute my focus is on making sure this team has a settled season. The manager’s targets are not just about getting back in the Champions League – it is about winning something. That is where my full focus is, and come the end of the season when we’ve won something and achieved something we can see where it goes. Right now it is all about focus on the pitch</p>

New country, new experience. But considering the way I’ve settled in, the love that I have felt, especially from the fans but everyone in Rome, it will be an interesting decision to make.

I like new things maybe out of my comfort zone and show people that anything is possible<br /><br />I can understand everyone’s position if they’ve not got that full clarity. Everybody wants to be as informed as possible. Fortunately, here at Roma, I feel like they have that clarity. They’ve kept us in the loop. We had regular meetings with the CEO <b>[Guido Fienga]</b>, talking about different measures, and keeping us up to date. That’s been very useful to know their discussions with the league and the doctors and they are relaying that straight back to us. That’s why I feel like a lot of players here are comfortable about coming back, knowing the different measures. It’s all been listed, but if some players at some clubs who don’t have that all in place yet then I can understand them being a bit fearful until that’s put in place. I’d want the same as well</p>
