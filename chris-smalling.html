  <p><b>[Chris Smalling believes his continued successes with Manchester United are proof enough]</b> All I can do is play the games and at the minute I’m playing every game and performing in big games so I’ll just keep doing my job. Of course you want to be playing in the summer. All you can do is let your football do the talking. I think I’ve been a mainstay in the set-up for quite a while now and I just want to finish the season as strongly as I can and see what happens. I think it takes big characters to last so long at United. They’re always being linked to every player who has played the game, but the manager has faith in you and all the managers have faith in me and now I just want to finish the season as strongly as I can and enjoy it. At the minute there’s no conversations <b>[with Southgate]</b> and I’m going to keep playing my games.<br /><br />Yeah, I love my battles against H. I don’t think he’s scored too many against me so long may that continue. It’s nice testing yourself against the best because certainly this year he’s been one of the best<br /><br />Yeah, I think considering how we were looking at it a few months ago, it was looking like that’s as much as we could have hoped for. At the moment we’re achieving those things. Obviously City won the league, and we had to make sure to give ourselves the best possible chance of winning a trophy and we feel we have done that. I think it’s just about consistency. I think we have shown more consistency this year. Obviously City have shown ultimate consistency but I think we’re building there and I think it’s been a case, especially in the last few months, of playing some very big games. We knew these months were big games for us and I think we have won near enough all the big ones so I think we’re going to build up a lot of confidence going into next year.</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Smalling intends to be part of Manchester United’s future]</b> It does feel like I’ve been here quite a few years but it doesn’t feel that many. It’s crazy, if you sit down and think about where it all started and certain games and how the process has gone, it’s pretty crazy. I’m just relishing living in this moment and, hopefully, I can look back and be very satisfied <b>[in years to come]</b>. Hopefully, there’s lots more to come, but it’s nice to have a contribution and to be here for quite a while, helping the team and the managers that have come. I just try to do my best and try to be a part of the team. That’s something I’ve really felt at this club.<br /><br />I think it <b>[the start of the season]</b> does come round very quickly. But that’s Manchester United. We’re often the most talked about, and why not let us set the tone for the season and hopefully just get that win and set a marker?</p>

It’s about putting that hard work in, then standing up and showing some character. We need to come out fighting.<br /><br />To be honest, I’d rather have had the game on Saturday because you just want to bounce back after a defeat. It’s a long weekend but, at the same time, we’ve had a long time to prepare for the game and we’ve tried to take advantage of those days. This is a good game for us to have. When you lose a game, the next one is more important than ever. The fact that it’s a big game at Old Trafford, that’s when the big players rise to the occasion. We’re determined to be ready</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Smalling honoured to join legends in Man Utd 300 club]</b> It’s hard to sit back and just go through your whole career, because everything’s always moving so fast. But the odd milestone is always a nice moment, and when you look at the previous players to have hit those kind of milestones, it’s nice to be in that company. There are some big names <b>[to have played 300 games]</b>. Just to be able to be at a club like Manchester United for so long… when I first joined, you never know how it’s going to turn out. It makes me very proud that a club like Manchester United have wanted me to be here as long as I have been<br /><br />The sheer size of the club… it’s a club that’s always used to winning trophies and being successful, and is probably the most talked about club in the world. To be able to play your part is an amazing feeling. You see ex-players like Rio <b>[Ferdinand]</b> talking in Twitter videos, and often he’s coming to our games if he’s doing his punditry, and you can tell that this club is definitely still his club. That’s how I think I’m always going to feel, because this club has been such a big part of my career, and I hope it is for as long as it’s possible<br /><br /><b>[Asked to pick a favourite moment]</b> Maybe my first title <b>[2010-11 season]</b>. Joining a club of such big stature and trying to make my mark was very daunting, but it was something I enjoyed. I played a lot more games (33) in that first season than I could even have thought of. To be able to play my part in my first trophy - I can remember lifting it in the middle of the pitch and I had all my family there. That just really got me hungry for more</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Smalling says Manchester United’s last-gasp win over Bournemouth has given the side confidence]</b> I think that it would galvanise us. We know we’re going into a very tough week now but we can come out with some good results and it can be seen as a good month. It is an especially tough month now and potentially after the international break when we have a lot of home games it’s all about making sure we get results and move up that table despite the tough games. We can take the second half to Turin and I think we will be more on the front foot and you will see a better performance in the first half. We need to take the second-half performance that we had against them at home and we need to do that from the off and we’ll give them a good game and get chances<br /><br />In the last few years I think we have been known for shutting up shop and not conceding many goals so this season has been very unusual to what I have experienced. We need to work on that because normally we don’t concede many and we win the game. It starts at the back, and as a team collectively, and we will be working on it every day. Yes, we’re showing that attitude, never giving in. No matter how bad the first half was, the second half we all believed we could go and win. It’s a great feeling and it’s bringing us closer together. As games are getting tougher and tougher - I think they’re closer than ever - it is often coming down to fine margins. Who can give that added burst in the last five minutes? We’re going to win a lot of points that way, and a lot of other teams are going to gain or lose points that wa<br /><br />We as players have to stand tall and the spotlight will be on us because we are supposed to be in the top four. We are doing everything we can to get there. To be at a club like this, and last as long as I have, you need to have that courage and belief in your ability, because you’re not going to have good days every week and the bad days are often highlighted when you’re at a big club, but I believe in myself. As players you need to have thick skin and we need to have belief that you will have bad days but it’s about making sure you have more good days than bad</p>

We were going through a tough patch <b>[under Mourinho]</b>. Confidence had dipped.

Especially in the last five or six weeks from the teams we have come up against, whether it is Chelsea, Tottenham or PSG, all sorts, we know that we can go to teams and we can hurt teams. That belief could not be any higher at the moment.<br /><br /><b>[Asked to describe the mood inside the United camp under <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>]</b> There is just a smile on everyone’s faces. I think you can see with Ole that he is always smiling - be it at the training ground, at games or in post-match interviews. You can see that joy and happiness that he has. We feed off that. There are players who are injured, others who have stepped up, and everyone has got that belief, whoever steps in, that we can keep that high level that we have managed under Ole<br /><br /><b>[The 29-year-old England international said of his experiences under a new coaching regime]</b> It was very unfortunate <b>[at the start]</b>. Before Ole had come in I was used to playing every week and then I obviously had a broken toe, so I had to have a couple of months out, so I was chomping at the bit to get my boots back on and play under Ole.

  <p><b>[Chris Smalling has called on Manchester United to ensure that their season is not wasted]</b> Before Ole took over, it <b>[finishing in the top four]</b> was something we wanted, but it was so far off. The fact that we’ve worked so hard over these months and to be within touching distance - now is where the real hard work starts and where the real pressure is. Ultimately those first few months, we were so far off that we had nothing to lose. Whereas now, we’ve really climbed that table and closed that points gap, so we just need to carry it on and make sure that these last few months weren’t wasted. Not just this season, in previous seasons, we go through different blips and certain people can write off Man United. But we’ve shown that togetherness and that fighting spirit, especially since Ole’s come in. I think we’re ready to go for the last few weeks of the season to make sure this second-half of the season was a success and it’s not just a good middle..<br /><br />If you look at our results since he came in, we’d probably be at the top of the table.

  <p><b>[Chris Smalling claims to be relishing the prospect of facing Lionel Messi in the Champions League quarter-finals]</b> We were warming up on the bikes in the gym <b>[when the draw was made]</b>. Normally we do 10 minutes on the bike and then we do some gym activation, but I think we stayed on the bikes for maybe 20 minutes just because we saw the draw was on the TV. We were all excited. As soon as it came out, we were all happy. We cheered and then we got on with training. But at least we knew who was in front of us. When the draw was made, you think, ‘I want to play against teams like this’. I was injured or just coming back from being injured for the first game <b>[of the last 16 against PSG]</b>, so it was nice to be able to test yourself against the best, and I think PSG are one of the best teams in the world. Mbappe is probably one of the most in-form strikers in the world as well. I love to challenge myself against the best and that’s the good thing about this club: you’re always playing against the best because you’re getting a lot further in competitions.<br /><br />I’ve not played against him competitively, personally, but in friendlies and pre-season we have. That’s someone else who I’m looking forward to playing against and hopefully minimising as many chances as possible, because we know what a world-class player he is. But it’s not just him; I think they’re a world-class team. We need to make sure that whatever game-plan we have - just like PSG - that we stick to it and everything falls into line. We know that we can give any team a right go<br /><br />All our draws this season - be it FA Cup or Champions League - we don’t have the easy draws, and we thrive off playing big teams like that. After the PSG game, we know that we can go away to the big teams and get results. We’re just looking forward to it. Let’s take it on</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Smalling has highlighted the main area he feels <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> need to improve for the 2019-20 season]</b> think consistency. Obviously since Ole has come in, our consistency has definitely gone up but I think we know there’s a lot to work on. With Ole and the coaching staff, we’ll have a full pre-season working on a lot of things. Hopefully come pre-season, we can show what we’re really made of through the whole course of the season and be a lot more consistent because ultimately if you want to be top of that league you need that consistency in every game. You can’t have two or three games where you let your level drop.<br /><br /><b>[He added when asked for a message to the club’s fans]</b> I think my message would be to keep supporting us. It never goes unnoticed. When we’re winning or losing, when we’re doing warm-ups or even when I’m walking down the street, there are United fans talking to me. I think that’s something we all love. You can definitely bet on it that we’re going to be giving everything in pre-season and making sure that next season is one to remember for all the right reasons<br /><br /><b>[United and their fan base may have had little to shout about in 2018-19]</b> Yes, very much so. I think we know we had, sort of, two halves to our season last season, so to be able to hit the ground running from August and to have a whole sustained season - I think that’s what we’re most looking forward to and showing what we can do over the course of all those games<br /><br /><b>[Smalling forms part of that group, with the England international saying of the games he looks for first]</b> Derbies, because quite often I’ll have a lot of mates already asking me for tickets. So yes, the <b>[Manchester]</b> derbies, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> <b>[games]</b> as well and also <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> because when I was at Fulham, they were a club that I never liked to see winning. So those are the three fixtures that I look out for</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Smalling says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are aware of the potential they have at their disposal in the likes of <a href="tahith-chong.html">Tahith Chong</a> and <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a>]</b> It’s very much an exciting time for them and you want to see them flourish and help them. I’m sure a good number will come on tour and it’s really a time for them to bond with us, and show the manager what they are all about. Ole <b>[Gunnar <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>]</b> will definitely give some of them a chance as they’ve been training with us for a long time. It is all well and good coming over training with us most of the week, though, but it’s a massive experience getting to know each other off the pitch and building relationships. That’s often the next stage that cements them and makes them feel more confident when they’re on the pitch. Once you know someone, you speak a lot more and demand more. Until you really know someone, it’s hard to demand something from them.<br /><br /><b>[Smalling believes the next generation of Red Devils superstars are in the best possible place for their ongoing development]</b> They can be involved in the squad but then go back to the reserves and it’s about that evolution. Having a manager like Ole, who is experienced within the club, means United hit the nail on the head with that. Quite often, there can be a clamour from us as fans as well as players, to say ‘this kid is great, let’s just throw him in’ and everyone is clamouring to do that. But the manager knows the right time to bring them in and take them out. Ultimately, they have got long careers ahead of them and you don’t want them to burn out too early or be exposed too soon. The beauty here is we’ve got the best coaches to manage it properly as this club has done year after year</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Smalling has recounted how a young <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> burst onto the first-team scene back in 2016, recalling his impact in a training match]</b> Obviously, it was under Van Gaal when I first came across him. Going through that week, a few of the strikers had got injured and then, as Louis was very confident in the youngsters, he got the youth team to come over and we played a game against them. I remember, one time, the ball got played in behind and I can’t remember who was playing at left-back for us but I just saw Rashy zoom down to get the ball. At that moment, everyone took notice of him. It was only a matter of a week or a couple of weeks after that when he made his debut and obviously hit the ground running. It was that first sprint down the wing, I think, when a lot of us were asking: ‘Who is this kid?’<br /><br /><b>[Smalling recalls that Will Keane, another young striker who had been on United’s books, would likely to have played ahead of the England international had he not picked up an injury]</b> He was playing wide, well he was in that session, but they said he was a striker and he was filling in for whomever in that position. Will Keane was waiting for his chance as well, and picked up an injury, so that opened the door for Rashy. It was obviously that pace that first alerted us but I know now, as I’ve been playing with him for so long, that he’s got everything. He is a special talent. I think he almost took it all in his stride. You could tell he was a confident kid. You need to be at this club, I think, and to be a No.9 as well. You could tell he wasn’t fazed, coming up to the first team and being really thrown in, as you could see he was a special talent. The manager at the time knew that and put him straight in.<br /><br />He didn’t play much for the Reserves as he skipped that stage. But we saw a lot of the youth-team games because of the fact they’re on MUTV. Quite often, when we’re training inside, and getting stretched, it will be on the screen so we do keep up to date with the youth-team games. At that time, we had quite a few young players. Not as young as Rashy but a lot of them knew him already and that helps coming into the environment so it’s not totally daunting getting to know 25 players. The fact a lot of other players had come through the Academy as well definitely helped him.</p>

  <p><b>[Defender Chris Smalling says racism is unacceptable and should not be stood for, in his first press conference since joining the <a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> I think racism is unacceptable and should not be stood for. It is not an issue just in Italy, it is around the world. There needs to be a change, there will be generational changes and younger people will have a different perspective. But it does happen, not just in Italy but around the world, and it is very sad and unacceptable that it still happens in these modern times<br /><br />There is a lot of responsibility on the defence as a whole <b>[in Italy]</b> and the centre-backs too, but that is something I enjoy.

  <p><b>[Smalling happy to have avoided taking the easy way out at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> and retains England ambition]</b> The easy decision was to stay. I had spoken to the manager before Harry came and I knew I was behind him and Vic <b>[<a href="victor-lindelof.html">Lindelof</a>]</b> but in previous seasons I had started behind <b>[two first-choice centre-backs]</b> and after four or five games I had worked myself into the team. I love a challenge and when a new centre-back comes in it makes you raise your game. You have to show more, you have to be more consistent.

Still a good number of games but I want to play<br /><br /><b>[While looking to remain a regular at club level, the international door with England appears to have closed for Smalling]</b> I am disappointed. I was used to going to England. I was playing regularly for United up to when I left. The aspiration is always there. Ultimately it is down to the manager’s choice. What was said was maybe unfair at times and managers <b>[who have picked me]</b> at United are some of the world-class ones. Some of the things that maybe he <b>[<a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a>]</b> mentioned … I feel even the managers who have been brought in at United have certain ways of playing and some of them are quite similar to <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a>. I guess football is a game of opinions. I am definitely not going to agree with him and he might not agree with some of the things that I would say back. Ultimately I would never close that door and hopefully work my way in at some point. It is looking slim under Gareth but never say never</p>
