  <p><b>[Gremio forward Luan reacts after lifting the Copa Libertadores and booking a spot at the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Club World Cup UAE 2017]</b> We are going to end the world in the celebrations. We had our share of critics but we kept our heads and got our reward. This group is fantastic and deserves this</p>

  <p><b>[Luan has spoken out over claims he could sign for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in the January transfer window]</b> If I knew, I wouldn’t hide. I always said that I would leave it to Gremio and to my agent, and if they had something concrete, they should talk to me. No one has come to me, so there is nothing. It has to be good for me, it has to be good for Gremio. I will not rush to want to leave soon, just like in the middle of last year<br /><br />For the moment that we were through, I decided to stay. It was my decision alone. Now it’s the start of the season and I want to regain my form and rhythm to play. What I know is that I want to play the next game as soon as possible here at Gremio</p>
