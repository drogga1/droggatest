  <p><b>[Liverpool do not have a transfer deal in place for highly-rated Gremio forward Luan]</b> Luan is a player who said he would have proposals but so far none have come, except for one about three years ago when he was on a different level. We have no approach, no official proposal <b>[from Liverpool]</b>. We have absolutely no concrete proposal.</p>

  <p><b>[Luan’s agent, Jair Peixoto, has also sought to play down talk of an imminent move to Liverpool for his client]</b> We do talk to Liverpool, as we talk to other clubs as well, but there is no proposal.</p>

  <p><b>[Luan had a late start, not even making his professional debut until he was 21. He has grown accustomed to being overlooked. His former mentor, Alex Sandro Rocha Pinheiro said]</b> At 15-years-old, I took him to the Rio Preto Esporte Clube. For a whole year, he never played. So, after 12 months of training sessions, he went back to Futsal. From the age of 16 to 18, Luan played only futsal.</p>

  <p><b>[Luan lit up the competition and attracted the attention of a couple of scouts from down south, eventually rebuffing Internacional to agree a six-month deal with Gremio in Porto Alegre]</b> It was like a switch had been flicked in my head. From that moment, I just went for it. It was the chance of a lifetime.</p>

  <p><b>[Gremio forward Luan says he could hardly imagine a better scenario than the opportunity to make his international debut on home soil]</b> I’m so happy to be have this opportunity here in the Selecao. And very happy to be playing at home, right? I really think it couldn’t be any better, being here in my city, where I live, representing the national team. It’s a special moment for me.<br /><br />I played in the friendly in January. I was really happy to be able to play in that and now it’s great to be involved in the qualifiers. If I can help, I will try to do my best so that we can achieve victories this week</p>

  <p><b>[Luan said back in August as he reaffirmed his commitment to his first club, at least for the time being]</b> First I dreamed of making it as a player. When that dream comes true, you want to play in Europe. But I only want to be here at Gremio, with another dream to make happen, receiving a call-up for the national team. I want to make the most of my time here.</p>

  <p><b>[Gremio forward Luan reacts after lifting the Copa Libertadores and booking a spot at the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Club World Cup UAE 2017]</b> We are going to end the world in the celebrations.

  <p><b>[Luan can help Gremio deny Real Madrid another Club World Cup]</b> It’s the game of my life. It’s going to be difficult but we have our chances to beat Real Madrid. I played futsal until I was 19. But I adapted quickly to 11-a-side football. The best thing about futsal was that I always scored. Now, it’s more difficult, but I love having more space to run into and dribble<br /><br />My dad died when I was five. It was difficult. My mother was maid and she worked a lot. So, my mother is everything for me. Of all of the messages I received ahead of the final, hers was the one I loved the most. She always advised me to be myself and to follow my heart</p>

  <p><b>[Luan considers Cristiano Ronaldo to be world’s best]</b> I’m not in a hurry to move to Europe. The ideal moment is yet to come.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on comments from Gremio coach Renato in which the ex-Brazil international stated that he considers himself to have been better than Ronaldo]</b> I didn’t see Renato play! Well, Cristiano is an amazing player, not only inside the pitch, but also off it. He’s a role model, an example. He is the best in the world. I’m excited to play against him in the final. It’s the game of my life. It’s going to be difficult, but we have a chance of beating Real Madrid<br /><br />My idols were Ronaldo Nazario and Ronaldinho</p>

  <p><b>[Luan has spoken out over claims he could sign for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in the January transfer window]</b> If I knew, I wouldn’t hide. I always said that I would leave it to Gremio and to my agent, and if they had something concrete, they should talk to me. No one has come to me, so there is nothing. It has to be good for me, it has to be good for Gremio. I will not rush to want to leave soon, just like in the middle of last year<br /><br />For the moment that we were through, I decided to stay. It was my decision alone. Now it’s the start of the season and I want to regain my form and rhythm to play. What I know is that I want to play the next game as soon as possible here at Gremio</p>
