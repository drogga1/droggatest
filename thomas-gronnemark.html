  <p><b>[The world record ‘throw-in specialist’ looking to help Klopp’s Liverpool towards the title]</b> I know it is totally the weirdest job in football.<br /><br />Some weeks we do two or three sessions, some weeks none at all. I also analyse their throw-ins from every game and feed back to them, whether I am there or not.<br /><br />That’s about 12 minutes per game taken up by throw-ins and situations arising from them. On average, they lose the ball more than half the time from under-pressure throw-ins, when their team-mates are closely marked. If I was a defender I would not want to be on the end of one of Gomez’s throw-ins<br /><br />If Liverpool score a goal or two from long throws that would be perfect for me. But even more so if it comes as a result of a fast throw or clever throw. I’m a former sprinter and love the fast, fluent game. <b>[So]</b> I coach how to get the ball back very quickly after it goes out, how to keep possession, how to make the counter attack super-fast<br /><br />In general against Liverpool. I would not want to put the ball out for a throw-in!</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool defender Joe Gomez has one of the best throw-ins in the world]</b> I’m very proud that he <b>[Gomez]</b> assisted an important goal with a throw-in during the Nations League game between England and Croatia. His throw-ins belong to the best in the world. When I started working at Liverpool some media had laugh about me but after the England game everybody praises me. Even journalists from the U.S. and Argentine wanted to talk to me. <b>[Robertson]</b> started with throw-ins of only 19-20 meters which is quite short for a fullback. It’s very dangerous to throw that short as a fullback because there is always pressure for the teammate who gets the ball. But he improved a lot and is able to throw about 27 metres now, which is a great improvement. He is very smart and has much more options now. I’m very proud of him.<br /><br />I was in the car and when Klopp first called me I’ve missed it. After hearing Jurgen on my voicemail, I was shocked. He invited me to a meeting in Melwood. After the meeting, he was thrilled and wanted to work with me. Since June, I work as a coach for Liverpool and I am living my dream. I love the work with Klopp and the team. It’s fantastic. Jurgen is a great leader and the whole team is very helpful. The working atmosphere is awesome<br /><br />It’s great to hear that someone like Jurgen is praising me during press conferences. Before I was joining his staff, he thought the Liverpool throw-ins were good but after meeting me he was convinced that he has to hire me. This season we can keep more than 75 per cent of the balls after throw-ins. Last season the quota was at about 50 per cent. A great improvement</p>
