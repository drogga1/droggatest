<blockquote>
  <p>[Liverpool defender Joe Gomez has one of the best throw-ins in the world] I’m very proud that he [Gomez] assisted an important goal with a throw-in during the Nations League game between England and Croatia. His throw-ins belong to the best in the world. When I started working at Liverpool some media had laugh about me but after the England game everybody praises me. Even journalists from the U.S. and Argentine wanted to talk to me. [Robertson] started with throw-ins of only 19-20 meters which is quite short for a fullback. It’s very dangerous to throw that short as a fullback because there is always pressure for the teammate who gets the ball. But he improved a lot and is able to throw about 27 metres now, which is a great improvement. He is very smart and has much more options now. I’m very proud of him.<br /><br />I was in the car and when Klopp first called me I’ve missed it. After hearing Jurgen on my voicemail, I was shocked. He invited me to a meeting in Melwood. After the meeting, he was thrilled and wanted to work with me. Since June, I work as a coach for Liverpool and I am living my dream. I love the work with Klopp and the team. It’s fantastic. Jurgen is a great leader and the whole team is very helpful. The working atmosphere is awesome<br /><br />It’s great to hear that someone like Jurgen is praising me during press conferences. Before I was joining his staff, he thought the Liverpool throw-ins were good but after meeting me he was convinced that he has to hire me. This season we can keep more than 75 per cent of the balls after throw-ins. Last season the quota was at about 50 per cent. A great improvement</p>
