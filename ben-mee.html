  <p><b>[Ben Mee has said Burnley will not make life easy for Manchester City]</b> We try to make it difficult for whoever comes here and it will be difficult for the two big teams coming to our place <b>[City and Arsenal]</b>. We’re looking forward to it. Especially against the top teams, you have to give something different. You can’t go out, play nice football and let them play nice football against you. You can’t expect us to roll over and say: ‘here you go, have the three points’. We’re going to work hard, make it uncomfortable for them as possible and we’ll certainly do that against City. It’ll be good to compete against these teams coming up. Man City, the best team in the league, they’re going for it with Liverpool at the minute and these are the games where you compete and see where you’re at as a professional.<br /><br />We battered Chelsea in the second half. But we reacted really well and it’s been one of the best halves of the season I’ve been involved in.<br /><br />I’ve got a lot of friends still at City. Sadly Bernard Halford passed away recently and he was a really good bloke, top man at the club and there’s still some there. There will be plenty of family there</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> defender Ben Mee condemned a banner flown above the club’s match with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> on Monday]</b> It was a tough night. We can talk about football but there is something I would like to speak about first and that is the plane and banner flying over the stadium. I am ashamed and embarrassed that a small number of our fans have decided to fly that around the stadium. It is not what we are about. They have missed what we are trying to achieve. These people need to come into the 21st century and educate themselves. They don’t represent what we are about, the club is about, the players are about and the majority of fans are about<br /><br />I’ve heard it is a small number that have arranged this and I hope it doesn’t happen again. I don’t want to associate it with my cub. I don’t want to see this in the game. It is not right. We totally condemn it. These people can learn and be taught what Black Lives Matter is trying to achieve. The players have pulled together and this is what we want, what the majority of fans want - equality in society and in football, everything, be it race, religion, gender, LGBTQ community. The players have pulled together and we want to make a stand against this for all minorities<br /><br /><b>[<a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> went on to lose the match 5-0, with <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> stealing the show]</b> It made a big impact on our players. We, as a group of players, condemn it. We’re ashamed, we’re embarrassed. It completely misses the point of what we’re trying to achieve as a football community.<br /><br />As a group of players we’re really ashamed. It’s a minority of our supporters and I know I speak for the main part of our supporters - we absolutely distance ourselves from any sort of thing like that. It’s a real shame to see and it definitely had a massive effect on us to see that in the sky. We were embarrassed, we were disappointed, upset. It misses the whole point of what we’re trying to do as a group of players throughout <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, throughout society and the whole Black Lives Matter movement and community<br /><br />Embarrassing. The fact that they’ve tried to associate it with our club - it doesn’t belong anywhere near our club. We definitely want to move as far away from it as possible. Fans like that don’t deserve to be around football</p>
