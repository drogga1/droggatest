<blockquote>
  <p><b>[The day <a href="mark-hughes.html">Mark Hughes</a> managed <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> despite having been sacked and replaced by <a href="roberto-mancini.html">Roberto Mancini</a>. Conditioning coach Ivan Carminati had experience working in England with <a href="sven-goran-eriksson.html">Sven-Goran Eriksson</a> but still found the first six months as part of Mancini’s backroom team difficult as <a href="brian-kidd.html">Brian Kidd</a> proved an invaluable link between the players and the new staff]</b> I know that <b>[Hughes]</b> was popular but we knew that the owner wanted to change. We know that this can happen in football, you have to be ready and at that time we were there it was around the 20th of December more or less and we started work and started to understand the English football, the English mentality.<br /><br />As a new situation it was very easy but we tried to mix our experience with the English mentality. On the staff we had <a href="brian-kidd.html">Brian Kidd</a>. He was vital because he was working there, he knew better than us the English mentality, the mentality of the players. Slowly, slowly we improved and at the end we achieved the target of winning the Premier League<br /><br /><b>[For Carminati, now at <a href="zenit-st-petersburg.html">Zenit</a>, the success more than made up for a shaky start and the veteran coach still watches every City match despite having left six years ago]</b> It was a big, happy experience. It was something that I always take in my mind, in my heart. Of course to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is something that is unusual but also the way we won it was incredible. We passed from hell to paradise in five minutes, it was something that can maybe happen once in a lifetime.<br /><br />United were in Sunderland waiting for the last minutes so it’s something that every time I have the occasion to see on TV it makes me happy because I know what happened at the end.</p>
