<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Ex-Tottenham midfielder Nayim has claimed that any side featuring Lionel Messi will always be favourites]</b> Any team that has Leo is slightly more the favourite than the rest but in the end, he can not do it all by himself, it can happen that there are games that tie him very well and other teammates have to appear. Without a doubt, but there are other important teams that can win, Barcelona seems to have the Champions League as their main goal and until now I have seen how they are competing in Europe quite well.<br /><br /><b>[Spurs still have a chance of a positive result]</b> It depends on how Barcelona comes in. If it goes as Tottenham should, it will be very difficult for them even though they are capable of winning, they are a very solid team with very dangerous players. When Leo Messi is inspired, it is very difficult to stop his team, but if they do not come out with the necessary tension, Tottenham will increase their chances<br /><br /><b>[On Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen]</b> Undoubtedly, we are talking about two very good players, especially on the offensive level, they are guys who know how to create opportunities from nothing and finish very well, they have shot from a distance and we will have to be very aware of them</p>
