  <p><b>[Sutton United goalkeeper Wayne Shaw has brushed off a debate over whether he broke betting rules to eat a pie in the middle of his side’s FA Cup sixth round clash with Arsenal]</b> A few of the lads said to me earlier on: ‘What is going on with the 8-1 about eating a pie? I said: ‘I don’t know, I’ve eaten nothing all day, so I might give it a go later on. As I say what is that, Sun Bets had us at 8-1 to eat a pie. I thought I would give them a bit of banter and let’s do it. All the subs were on and we were 2-0 down.<br /><br />I think there were a few people <b>[who placed a bet]</b>. Obviously we <b>[Sutton United]</b> are not allowed to bet. I think a few of the mates and a few of the fans. It was just a bit of banter for them. It is something to make the occasion as well and you can look back and say it was part of it and we got our ticket money back</p>

  <p><b>[Sutton United goalkeeper Wayne Shaw is out of contract at Sutton at the end of this season and was was asked by host Piers Morgan if he would consider a switch to the Emirates]</b> We have a big problem with our defence at the moment. We could do with a big unit in goal like you. Are you ready for a transfer? Can I facilitate it? Most of our players get about £40,000 a day for doing, what I see as, very little. What would it take to prize you and your pies out of Sutton to Arsenal?.</p>

  <p><b>[The Gambling Commission in the UK is investigating Sutton United goalkeeper Wayne Shaw after he ate a pie during his side’s FA Cup tie against Arsenal. Richard Watson said]</b> Integrity in sport is not a joke and we have opened an investigation to establish exactly what happened. As part of that we’ll be looking into any irregularity in the betting market and establishing whether the operator has met its licence requirement to conduct its business with integrity.</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Sutton United goalkeeper Wayne Shaw was forced to resign from his post as assistant manager at the Northern League side on Tuesday. Chief pie buyer Tessa Callaghan said]</b> We’re always looking for the best talent to taste our pies and make sure they hit the back of the net. Wayne’s performance last night sets him apart as one of the country’s most famous pie connoisseurs. We were really impressed by his commitment to pie eating, and we understand that a good pie is the best way to warm up for any occasion, even if it is the biggest night of your football career.</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Wayne Shaw?]</b> I left for an apprenticeship at Reading and then joined Basingstoke before going on loan to Bashley. One day they had a goalkeeping dilemma and the manager said I had to buy a pair of gloves. We beat Salisbury 1-0 and I’ve been in goal ever since.<br /><br /><b>[one incident in 2013 saw him sacked by Sutton United after vaulting advertising hoardings to headbutt a particularly offensive fan]</b> I had a bad day at work. Usually it’s good fun and banter but sometimes it gets too personal.</p>
