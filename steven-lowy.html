<blockquote>
  <p>[Football Federation Australia has reiterated its commitment to constitutional reform] The day at FIFA was a further reminder of the goodwill and respect that exists between FIFA and FFA. It was important to illustrate the growth and development of the game in Australia and in particular to outline football’s opportunities and challenges in the uniquely competitive environment of Australian sport. We came away confident that we will be able to move quickly to put in place some changes to our structure that will set the game up for further success in the years ahead.</p>

  <p>[Frustrated A-League club owners could be offered more control of the competition when they meet with Football Federation Australia] We need to attract more capital and expertise to our clubs and game. FFA believes part of the answer lies in the way the leagues are structured. We will begin this conversation with the club chairmen tomorrow. This will be an important consideration as FFA moves ahead with plans to expand the number of A-League clubs.<br /><br />FFA remains committed to its role as a strong, independent custodian of football in Australia, promoting growth and development of the sport from the grassroots to professional level and national teams for women and men. But we also recognise that we need to adapt as the game evolves in Australia</p>

  <p>[Who is Socceroos coach Bert Van Marwijk?] This is a great result for Australian football. Bert Van Marwijk is world class. He took the Netherlands to the World Cup Final in 2010, he led the Saudi Arabian team to qualify directly for this year’s Finals and most importantly, he knows a lot about our team and how they play because he studied them closely as an opposition manager in the same group. These experiences make him a compelling choice.</p>
