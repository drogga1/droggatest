Dubbed 'The Emperor' by Inter Milan fans, Adriano was the most exciting Brazilian to emerge on the scene since, well, Ronaldo.

  <p><b>[Adriano Hits Back At <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a> Coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo]</b> I was disappointed <b>[with how Luxemburgo handled the situation]</b>. Vanderlei has always praised me, saying that I was a player he would always want in his squad. Now, I get here and hear him talking about these things. Maybe it’s a misunderstanding, maybe he has his problem. I understand everybody, I’m not here to judge anyone, that’s not who I am. I want to help, be a part of the squad and his work. I’m waiting, but there’s a limit</p>

They scored six goals, which is not easy, although people may say Schalke are not at the same level as Madrid. We also played very well against <b>[Manchester]</b> City <b>[in the Champions League]</b> when people doubted us. So, we have to be united and carry on doing what we know, which is playing football, and hopefully things will continue to go well. Of course I’m looking forward to it. But the first thing I have to do is play well for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and then, of course, think about the World Cup with my country</p>

  <p><b>[Adriano says his weight will not be a problem at Miami United]</b> I am very well. Obviously, I will still have to work hard to get back to being the Adriano I was before. But I only need a slight physical improvement to be on the pitch. Before, I was out of weight when I returned. Now, I don’t think this will be a problem. I still don’t have date for when I will play, we are going to have a meeting to set that, but I believe that next week I will be ready to go to the field. I missed everything; the fans, the joy, the happiness of scoring a goal. But now I’m getting a good opportunity to return. I want to show my potential and be a champion win the Miami United shirt</p>
