  <p><b>[Marta writes to her 14-year-old self]</b> All you know is growing up and playing with the boys in town. But, only when they let you. Because they always had that stupid plan. You can play, they’d say, but only on a team with the players from the neighborhood who weren’t that good. Not that it mattered. ‘I’ll play with whoever,’ you tell them every time. And it didn’t matter. Because even when you were with the boys who couldn’t play very well, your team still won. You dribble fast, you play in a short space and you think fast. And you show them. Every. Single. Time. You show them: You’re a girl, and you can play football</p>

  <p><b>[Brazil were held to a 1-1 draw by Switzerland in their World Cup opener]</b> Within minutes of our opening game against Switzerland, we could see that this would be a difficult game. The Swiss started aggressively and showed straight away how they were going to handle Brazil’s biggest star: Neymar. They marked him very tightly throughout the game and made it very difficult for him. You could see that he was getting frustrated with the attention that was given to him, gesturing to the officials to give him more protection. The end result, however, was that he did not have his best game and Brazil’s forward play struggled because of it.<br /><br />The referee did not help either. Switzerland’s equaliser was very controversial and replays clearly showed a push on the Brazil centre-back Miranda by the goalscorer Steven Zuber. To make matters worse, Brazil should have had a penalty in the second half when Gabriel Jesus was fouled inside the box. In both those occasions the referee and the video assistant referee <b>[VAR]</b> did not act and review the passage of play and I can’t help myself but to ask: why is there a video referee if he or she is not used when there are controversial, match deciding incidents? Also, why, like a review in tennis, is the affected team not able to ask for the decision to be reviewed.</p>

  <p><b>[Marta talks about what it takes to stay at the top]</b> I don’t train harder than other players, but I will say this: every day that I go to training, I want to be the best there. I want to shoot the best, I want to run the fastest, I want to head the ball the best, I want to be the first to every ball. I want other people to look at me and think ‘why does she still have such a desire after all that time in football and after winning so many things?’ Because I know that by projecting this attitude and searching this out, that I will find something new to learn every day</p>

  <p><b>[Marta insists <a href="ada-hegerberg.html">Ada Hegerberg</a> cannot change the world alone]</b> This was the way she found to protest but in my opinion this must be made collectively. If I’m alone I can’t change the world, I need all of you, mainly my fellow players so that things can evolve. When I talk about gender equality, I think that all women that can talk about it, they are allowed to talk also. What I mean is that Ada is paying a price of not playing for her country but this fight of hers is a fight of all of us. She doesn’t have to carry this responsibility alone. It was a very strong attitude. For me to do this, I’d need to have my fellow players support as it has already happened here in the U.S., with female athletes together to fight for things to get better in many ways. That’s it.</p>

  <p><b>[Marta is dreaming of reaching the Women’s World Cup final]</b> We can’t focus just on one or two teams anymore. All athletes are more prepared. Difficult to talk only about USA and Australia. Other teams also have a very high level, but no doubt that it will be very challenging to play against USA and Australia if we face them.<br /><br /><b>[Asked about <a href="ffa.html">the Matildas</a>, Orlando Pride forward Marta - who plays alongside Australia internationals <a href="alanna-kennedy.html">Alanna Kennedy</a> and Emily van Egmond at club level in the National Women’s Soccer League - said]</b> They are so strong. But this is a World Cup and everything can happen. It will be all decided in details. Australia can go very far but they are in Brazil’s group and we won’t make their lives easy, you can be sure. They can reach the final but I hope they won’t and that Brazil can do it<br /><br /><b>[the 33-year-old said as she discussed her 15 World Cup goals]</b> I’m very excited to go to the World Cup. This is one more reason to be with all my energy to try to score more goals, this motivates me a lot<br /><br />I feel proud to be a reference in what I do, that you can reach children, who have you as an example. When I’m at the pitch I think about all this and try to make my best. My motivation comes from my daily life and then God gives you this gift. My life has always been moved by faith and persistence, and the results came. I share all these awards with my fellow players and with my rivals also, because they make me a better player</p>
