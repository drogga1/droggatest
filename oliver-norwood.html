  <p><b>[Oliver Norwood, who has been skippering <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> with Billy Sharp on the bench, is increasingly confident that he and his team-mates can alter the perception of how a promoted side should look - and play]</b> As the season goes on, we might get more credit from pundits when they realise we don’t kick people off the pitch. That was evident against Bournemouth away (a 1-1 draw at Dean Court on the opening weekend) and against Crystal Palace (a 1-0 win at Bramall Lane on matchday two), when we were the better side by a long way. As the weeks go by, I think people will realise that we are a team that plays a unique brand of attacking football. I think some teams will find it challenging to play against us. There are not many teams that have outside centre-backs overlapping the wing-backs. Midfield players get into the box. Our No.10 drops in and we have our striker running in behind.<br /><br />Last season, it was certainly difficult to stop. We play against each other with <b>[this system]</b> in training and we work on it every single day. We want to make teams worry about us. Against Palace, we knew <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> would be a big threat on the break, so we didn’t just go gung ho. We don’t just hope for the best. There’s a madness to it, but there’s also a system. It takes a lot of hours on the training ground, hard work and attention to detail. We didn’t get caught on the counter-attack last season. This is the way we want to play. We want to stick to our beliefs and what has worked for us. We are going to have difficult days. We understand that. We are not going to come in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and say we want to win it. We aren’t stupid. We won’t go to the Etihad and turn <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> over, but we also won’t roll over and allow people’s expectations to dictate what we do. We can’t abandon the way we play as quickly as that. That’s what brought us success; we are successful in playing a unique system<br /><br /><b>[Like new recruit Ravel Morrison, Norwood failed to make the grade at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. He has never let his frustration get the better of him, though. Indeed, Norwood was part of two previously promoted squads, Brighton and Fulham, but is only now getting his taste of the big time]</b> The Fulham one was the toughest one, the Brighton one I accepted. I felt really part of the group at Fulham. I thought I played a big role in getting them promoted. So, your head drops. I have nothing against Fulham but I wanted to prove them wrong. It is part of football. They thought they would go onto bigger and better things. It didn’t work out that way. Now I am with <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, so it was a blessing in disguise. From the first day I arrived, it has been perfect for me. The manager had been trying to get me for several seasons and he said I was perfect for the way he wants to play. I established myself in the team and now I get to play <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> football with <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>. There is no better feeling than that. The team spirit at the club is massive. The gaffer and captain Billy Sharp drive that. Both grew up as <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> fans. You know what is expected of you. We have a squad mainly made up of British and Irish players. We are all on the same page, we have been through the academy system in England. We have had setbacks and knocks, so we are determined to prove ourselves as <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players. It has taken some of us longer than others to get there. We don’t want to let this opportunity pass us by<br /><br /><b>[Henderson was allowed to return to Bramall Lane, much to Norwood’s delight]</b> He is a top talent, a top English talent. He is destined for big things. He is unfortunate as many believe <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a> to be the best goalkeeper in the world. But I think he can be at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> for many years. I think he is that good. He came up with massive moments for us. He has not had much to do for us yet this season but I am sure he will. When that moment comes, I am sure he will come up with the goods. I firmly believe he will be <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>’s No.1.<br /><br /><b>[It will be a massive examination of the efficacy of their system, particularly as the hosts will be able to call upon the services of <b>[N’Golo Kante]</b>(n-golo-kante.html), a man renowned for ruining the best-laid game plans with his incessant pressing]</b> I enjoy watching <a href="n-golo-kante.html">Kante</a>, to be honest. He does everything. His work-rate off the ball is great but he also has quality on the ball. He has won the World Cup and <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>. I wouldn’t mind swapping trophy cabinets with him! He is a wonderful footballer. But <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have an unbelievable amount of talent in the squad overall. They are elite players. It will be difficult, a tough afternoon, but we go there looking to cause an upset</p>

  <p><b>[Oliver Norwood says <a href="dean-henderson.html">Dean Henderson</a> is destined to inherit <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s No.1 spot from David de Gea]</b> Definitely, he’s proven himself this season, he’s up there with most clean sheets in the league so he’s obviously doing something right. I’ve read a few things from different people and I do agree that there would be a lot more pressure on him going and playing as <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s No.1 rather than <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>’s - the scrutiny he would be under being England’s No.1 as well. I’m sure <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Hendo</a> can handle that. He’s sure of himself, he’s very confident. I’m delighted he’s staying until the end of the season to help us, I have no doubt over the next <b>[eight]</b> games he will pick up some points for us. Next season is next season, we are not looking that far ahead<br /><br />Paul I’ve known for a long time, a World Cup winner, a <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> winner - he’s done everything in the game. The amount of stick he gets is incredible at times<br /><br /><b>[Asked directly if <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> is misunderstood]</b> I think so, yeah. He’s actually a really nice down-to-earth lad, he was when I knew him. When we were in the youth team he was always singing and dancing then, so it’s nothing to do with the hype <b>[surrounding]</b> him now</p>
