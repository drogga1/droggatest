  <p><b>[He walked forward to take his penalty in the 1996 Champions League final shootout with Ajax]</b> The eves of these memorable encounters are beautiful because a player knows well that he will be able to write a piece of history for his club. Then, when I saw the ball going past the goalkeeper, <b>[Edwin]</b> Van der Sar, to his right, and into the net, I entered into Juventus legend… I’m very proud of that<br /><br />Finals are always very particular games, subject to a number of factors. There are often anomalies or unpredictable elements that mark or condition the course of the match. I am sure, though, that we will see a great game. At the end of the day, we’re going to have the two best teams in the tournament, both with stellar squads and great players, playing with immense motivation. Real Madrid are the reigning champions and the Club World Cup champions but Juve are not a lesser team. In fact, Juve are a real team, strong, determined and hungry for victory. They have shown for some time that they are a lethal outfit, skilful in terms of exposing every type of weakness in their opponents and this will be a point in their favour<br /><br />Allegri’s Juventus are doing incredible things in defence, but they also have great goalscorers in attack. Real, meanwhile, often concede but they have a really impressive forward line. This will be one of the themes of the game, observing the Spanish attack against the impenetrable Juve backline. I’m also curious to see the battle between the two sets of full-backs, both of which are of great quality. It’s too easy to say that Cristiano Ronaldo will be the protagonist as I think that Karim Benzema and Luka Modric could be decisive and if Bale plays, he will be lifted by the fact that he’s playing at home in Wales. As for Juve, I think that Dan Alves and the inside attack can create great counter-attacks. I also expect a lot from the trio of Mario Mandzukic, Paulo Dybala and Gonzalo Higuain<br /><br />I’ve remained very attached to Italy, a wonderful country where I always gladly return, one that helped me grow and become a complete footballer. I have a lot of affection for all of the Italian teams for whom I played: Sampdoria, Juventus, Lazio and Inter, but that penalty in Rome against Ajax gave me something more. I’ve always remained a part of Juve and it will be like this for the rest of my life. It gave me a Bianconero heart, I feel Juventino and I hope that Juve can lift the Champions League trophy on Saturday. This really can be their year</p>
