  <p><b>[Danny Rose admits he has discussed interest shown in his services from afar with Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino]</b> I have a relationship with my manager where I can go to speak to him, and I have been to him about those reports. We spoke about a lot of things. I am not playing football just for the fun of it. I want to win things. I have seen what’s been around in the last couple of months. I am over the moon considering what people’s opinions of me were three or four years ago. When I am 34 or 35, I want to look back and see that I have won something. That is the next step for this team, and to do it we have to keep everyone for as long as possible. The best piece of advice the manager has given me was something he gave me a couple of weeks ago: Just enjoy your football, which is what I am going to do. I am not going to be distracted by anything else. But it’s nice to change people’s opinions of you and it shows I am doing something right.<br /><br /><b>[Rose only penned a new five-year contract with Spurs back in September 2016]</b> I don’t think we’re vulnerable to that, because of the age of the players. For example, Harry Kane’s mindset is not like that at all. He is already a club legend and he wants to break records and win things here. So for the foreseeable future I don’t think Spurs have to worry about players wanting to leave to achieve success elsewhere</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham defender Danny Rose has conceded he would consider leaving the club if the right offer was made]</b> At my age, and having missed six months with injury, I have been thinking about this quite a lot. I am reaching my peak and have probably only got one big contract left in me. Time is running out and I do want to win trophies. I don’t want to play football for 15 years and not have one trophy or one medal. Sorry, that’s not what I am about. I wouldn’t be happy with that. I want to win something. I will say this too - I will play up north. I don’t know exactly when, but I will get back up north and play some football somewhere.<br /><br />I moved away from home <b>[from Leeds to Spurs]</b> at 16. Yes I’ve got team-mates who have moved away from families in South Korea and Argentina, but I have been away for over ten years now and I don’t get to see my mum that often. I am going to make it my priority before I retire to play football up there.<br /><br />My short-term focus is to get back to playing like last year and if I do that the long-term will take care of itself. I’m not saying I want out, but if something came to me that was concrete, I’d have no qualms about voicing my opinions to anyone at the club. One thing is for sure - I know my worth and I will make sure I get what I am worth. I am not playing as well as I have done not to get paid what I think I am worth. In any walk of life, if you think you are worth a certain amount, why settle for less? I am not that person.<br /><br />If I get to levels I reached last season - and this goes out to everybody - I will make sure I get what I am worth. I don’t know how much longer I might have at this level. I’m not going to be stupid enough not to try and get the most out of it - medals, trophies and salary. Anyone who thinks this is primarily for money, that is not the case. But I know what I am worth. As with everyone else in my team, in my opinion, I am worth more than I am getting. I am not speaking on behalf of other players, but that is my view.</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Rose has slammed Tottenham’s lack of summer signings and fears they could fall behind their Premier League rivals in 2017-18]</b> I am not saying buy ten players, I’d love to see two or three - and not players you have to Google and say, ‘Who’s that?’ I mean well-known players. Under Harry Redknapp we signed Rafa van der Vaart. It was like, ‘Wow, how did he do that?’ I mean signings like that are what we need - that’s just my opinion. There are three weeks to go until the window shuts and you look at Man City and think, ‘If the window shut now they would be happy with the business they have done’.<br /><br />Man United, more or less, are there - although I hear <b>[Jose]</b> Mourinho may want one or two more players - but I am sure he’d be happy with his squad. As a Tottenham player I’d love to see more signings. It would lift me seeing a top player come through the door.<br /><br />I’ve seen a couple of players previously saying, ‘We don’t need a top signing or signings’. But I am sorry, I am not singing off the same hymn-sheet on that one. I think we do need one or two top signings to strengthen the squad. I’m just not buying the idea that we don’t need anyone. I know it was only pre-season but I watched the game against Man City and I was just in awe of City. They only had Kyle Walker, Danilo and the goalkeeper Ederson out of the players they’ve just bought. Speaking to some lads when they got back, they’re saying: ‘City are taking off £200 million and then they are bringing on <b>[Sergio]</b> Aguero, <b>[Yaya]</b> Toure and <b>[Leroy]</b>Sane’. That just speaks volumes to me. Anyone who says we don’t need any ­signings, I’m not buying into that<br /><br />As a starting XI we have one of the best in the league, without a shadow of a doubt, but after that . . .We played Chelsea in the Cup semi - <b>[Diego]</b> Costa, <b>[Eden]</b> Hazard and <b>[Gary]</b> Cahill didn’t play. After 60 minutes, <b>[Antonio]</b> Conte has brought on <b>[Cesc]</b> Fabregas, Hazard and Costa and they’ve changed the match<br /><br />I thought to myself, ‘Could we ever afford to play against a top team and afford to have Harry Kane, Dele Alli and a top centre-back not playing?’. No disrespect to anyone but I don’t think we could do that and Chelsea did that to us. They’re still in the game, they bring on Costa, Hazard and Fabregas and they won. I definitely feel we need to bolster the squad. Under Harry <b>[Redknapp]</b>, there were two Premier League-class players for every position. We are finishing even higher under Mauricio but we don’t have that depth now<br /><br />The standard of training when there’s that much quality is amazing. I have competition for my place but why shouldn’t everyone have competition for their places? Top-class competition where, if you have two average games, you might lose your place. I have that and I don’t see why anyone else shouldn’t. I want world-class players to come through the front door to make you fight for your place</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham Hotspur left-back Danny Rose believes Mauricio Pochettino is the right manager to help Ross Barkley fulfil his potential]</b> Mauricio is a world-class manager and I can only voice my opinion. But hearing Ross might be available, well, I have played with and against Ross and bringing him through the door, in itself, would be a huge boost. I’m a huge fan. In terms of physical stature, right and left foot and trying to get him off the ball - he’s like Mousa Dembele. If Ross wants to push on to the next level, Mauricio Pochettino is the best manager to do that - just look how many players he has got into the England squad</p>

But we’ve done alright there in the past couple of seasons and that should give us some confidence at the weekend.<br /><br />We were the first ones to beat City last season, we disrupted Chelsea’s unbeaten run. It’s a challenge we all look forward to. It’s a challenge the manager looks forward to. In these games, he knows he’s going to get 100% from everyone. There’s going to be a lot of eyes watching us this weekend. We haven’t done so well away from home against the top teams this season so we hope to go there with some confidence and keep pushing on after three wins that we’ve had over the last week.</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Rose reveals battle with depression]</b> It’s no secret that I’ve been through a testing time at Tottenham this season, which led to me seeing a psychologist, and I was diagnosed with depression, which nobody knows about, and I had to get away from Tottenham. I’m lucky that England gave me that opportunity to get away, refresh my mind and I’ll always be grateful to them. I was on medication for a few months - again, nobody knows about that apart from my agent - but I’m off the medication now, I’m good now and looking forward to how far we can go in Russia.<br /><br /><b>[According to Rose, his troubles began at the start of 2017, when a knee injury went without adequate treatment and left him unable to play]</b> It all stemmed from my injury in January last year, when I was advised I didn’t need an operation. I don’t know how many tablets I took to try and get fit for Tottenham, how many injections trying to get fit for Tottenham. I had cortisone/PRP <b>[platelet rich plasma]</b> injections trying to be fit for my club, and I had to have an op four months down the line - after all that football I missed, when the team was flying and I was playing well, I was playing really well, the team were playing really well. Seeing the lads beat Arsenal comfortably, seeing them beat Man United comfortably - it was hard. I’m not saying I’ve had worse treatment than anyone else. That’s football. But it was difficult. That was the start of it.<br /><br />Nobody knows this, either, but my uncle hung himself in the middle of my rehab, and that triggered it <b>[depression]</b> as well. It was really hard, and being referred to a doctor and psychologist <b>[by the Spurs doctor]</b> helped me massively to cope. I’ve been through a lot, and England has been my salvation. One million per cent</p>

The manager has spoken to us all a couple of weeks ago and said everybody starts from zero. We all have to start again trying to impress him and that’s great. We all go again. I’m good. I’m not listening to the speculation about my future.<br /><br />Me and the manager have had a conversation over the phone, as well as two one-hour meetings over the last couple of weeks. We’re both aware of the situation. Monday was massive for me that, even though there is speculation, he still trusts and believes in me to put me into such a massive game, a game where he didn’t need to change anything. For me, over the last four or five years we’ve worked together, that is probably the biggest thing he has done for me. I was so shocked in the meeting before we arrived. I thought there was going to be a change, but never did I think that it was going to be me coming in.</p>

It’s not that much longer now, so hopefully over the next couple of months we’re going to be in there and we all sympathise with the fans. We just have to stick together now.

It’s no coincidence every day you read Real Madrid want him or United want him. It’s exactly what he deserves. What he has done here in the last four or five years has been amazing. Not only for myself but the club. He has transformed how others think of us outside the club and he has transformed how we think of ourselves and how we approach big games. It’s no secret all the teams have spent a lot more than what we have. The belief he gives everybody is just amazing.<br /><br />The manager did not made any signings in the summer and he is probably not going to make any signings in January. Well, I’ve not heard anything, so I am guessing that will be the case. So for him to do what he has done and what he is doing now speaks volumes of him. Like I said, it’s no coincidence big teams are being linked with him. We hope he stays for a really long time</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham defender Danny Rose says his side were delighted to silence Arsenal after their win over Unai Emery’s side on Wednesday]</b> We were fully relishing the opportunity. Our only motivation was remembering the nonsense that Arsenal posted after the game a few weeks ago. That was our motivation. Players that have only played 10 games for Arsenal were getting ahead of themselves. We used that in a positive way. It’s karma. They fully deserve what they got. We had the motivation of getting to the semi-final, so we’re over the moon. But the cherry on top was silencing them after remembering how they celebrated like they had won the league. We’ve put that result right. We’ll see where they are come the end of the season and we’ll see where we are.<br /><br /><b>[Captaining the side again]</b> was a very proud moment, especially because we won. If I look back at where I was a year ago, I wasn’t playing too often. Now I have played three games in a week, we drew with Barcelona and won a difficult game against Burnley. And we won another difficult game last night, which was very special. After the World Cup, I called the manager and we spoke. We spoke for an hour before the first game at Newcastle and we spoke for an hour after that. The one main thing that stuck out from what he said to me was: ‘Danny - stop wasting time’. So yeah, I’m not wasting any more time. I’ve got my head down again and I’m doing okay at the minute. I’m trying to get back to where I was a couple of years ago. He meant, ‘Be fully focused’. On the pitch. And if you’re not fully focused then you’re free to leave the club. So I told him that I am fully focused. And I’m going to be here to fight and help the club progress. And I hope that I am showing that in my performances and in training as well</p>

At the minute how I programme myself I just think to myself: ‘I’ve got five or six more years left in football and I just can’t wait to see the back of it.’ Seeing how things are done in the game at the minute. It’s just … whatever, isn’t it? I just want to get out of it. That is how I feel. I feel I have four, five or six more years left and I just want to enjoy football as much as I can. There is so much politics and whatever in football. And I just can’t wait to see the back of it, to be honest<br /><br />Obviously it is a bit sad. But when countries only get fined what I’d probably spend on a night out in London what do you expect? When the punishment is not as harsh what do you expect? You see my manager get banned for two games for just being confrontation against Mike Dean at Burnley. But yet a country can only get fined a little bit of money for being racist. It’s just a bit of a farce at the minute. So that’s where we are at in football and until there’s a harsh punishment there’s not must else we can expect<br /><br />I was fine. I prepared myself for it, we won and now we just wait for whatever punishment if any punishment happens. I played in Serbia <b>[in 2012]</b> and it happened there. So I thought it would be a possibility that it might happen again and it did. I looked up straight away in the first half and I know the exact time it happened in the first half. It didn’t affect my game. I’m a big boy now and I know that three points are obviously not the most important thing when you’re going through something like that but I just wanted the team to get three points so that we could move on and get out of Montenegro as quickly as possible</p>

We saw it at the weekend in the Championship, and it looks like it’s something that’s creeping back in. I had some great support throughout the week, and I hope that once the season’s finished people can sit down and discuss how to eradicate these unfortunate things that are happening now in football. It’s a shame, really. But I’ve had some great support and would like to thank everyone who’s shown me that support.<br /><br />Last week when we played Palace, the atmosphere was brilliant. And when Hugo saved the penalty, my ears were buzzing because of how loud it was. The plan is to get the stadium back to being a fortress. If you remember the last season at the old White Hart Lane, we were unbeaten. That’s the plan now. To make it a fortress again, and make sure teams know that when they come here they’re going to be in for a game. Thank you to the fans for making the first two games at the new stadium very memorable</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Rose considers it to be vital that Christian Eriksen is retained by Tottenham]</b> It’s obviously vital <b>[that he stays]</b>. If you look over the five years that the manager’s been here, Christian has played the most games and that says a lot. When Christian doesn’t play, there are questions that we don’t look the same. He links everything up for us. The lads in the changing room trust the people upstairs to hopefully get him to sign.<br /><br />We have every possible foundation at the club - the training ground, the stadium now, the fan-base, the players. But it’s not just the foundations that attract players and make players want to stay. It’s out of the players’ control. We just have to trust that the people upstairs are going to do whatever they see fit to help us make that next step. We know that our manager is a winner. He demands the best from us and he wants to win something as well. So while everybody is on the same page, we can just look forward to next season and see what it brings</p>

If it’s going to be my last game for Tottenham against Liverpool I’m hoping to go out with a bang and lift the trophy and see what happens. It’s a Champions League final so individual situations have to take a back seat. We have to put the club first and we are going to do that. We do realise the chance to make history.<br /><br />The gaffer mentioned before the game, that’s the attitude you have to have. To be fair to him, he was really calm <b>[at half-time]</b>. He tweaked one or two things, and he just said that the next goal is crucial; if we get that, then it’s game on. And that’s pretty much it. I was expecting him to be a lot more angry but he was very calm. He just changed a couple of things and left us to it. Before the game he said the attitude <b>[required]</b> is what Liverpool showed. We all watched it in the hotel. He’s made us a promise, which I don’t want to say until after the final. He wants us to go and win. The manager, he never says anything after the game; obviously, he was very emotional but he’s very proud of us<br /><br />If we defend how we did against Ajax, we’re not going to win. We have to cut out the sloppy mistakes that we’ve made and hopefully play like we did in both second halves against Ajax<br /><br /><b>[Tottenham’s players and coaching staff were overcome with emotion following Lucas Moura’s injury-time winner]</b> It was like a family celebration. We all know the difficulties that we’ve faced this season. It was like a huge relief that we’ve made it to a Champions League final, the biggest occasion in club competition and it was just a relief and a joy. It was special. If we go back to the Barcelona game, everybody wrote us off. Everybody wrote us off last week after the Ajax game, and we find ourselves in the final so we just have to keep going, keep believing, keep playing well. We’re going to have a few players back from injury which is a huge bonus and we’ve literally got to see where it takes us.</p>

You know the British like to have a drink, it was just something that he couldn’t get his head around<br /><br />He wasn’t willing to compromise on that, either. Even after we beat <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> in the Champions League semi-final and it was obviously the biggest night of our careers. On the flight home we weren’t allowed a drink. It was ‘no you’re training tomorrow, you’re up at 9’. It’s just one of those things. British managers do different things. Foreign managers, sometimes it’ll take them time to adapt or for the players to adapt to them. It’s something that is just one of those things in football<br /><br />In the changing room and we went back out to the fans, for that hour I felt on top of the world. Then we got back on the plane and we were trying to have a drink and he wasn’t having it. He was like ‘No, we’ve got a game on Saturday’. The night was over.<br /><br />I do fully respect what he’s done but at the same time with that Champions League semi-final we’d been together since we were 22 or 23, so for me that’s all I’d known for the past five or six years, you’d play and then get one day off if you’re lucky and that’s it, you’re grafting for the rest of the week.<br /><br />So now I’m at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>, you’re getting two or three days off a week if you win, so I’m thinking what’s going on here then? It’s a shock to the system. We’d only get one day off if we were lucky under Poch. Even in international breaks, he’d see the ones who would go away as having a holiday because training isn’t as hard with your national team. So if you weren’t in the national team you were getting beasted in training. You’d only get Saturday or Sunday off and then you’d get somewhere like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> where they’re getting seven to 10 days off. We’ve been programmed a certain way in the last five or six years and going to <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> it’s different. I’ve missed playing for a British manager and I’m getting used to it again</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Rose says <a href="andy-robertson.html">Andy Robertson</a> is a freak of nature &amp; Europe’s best left-back]</b> <a href="andy-robertson.html">Andy Robertson</a> looks like a freak of nature. I watch him play football and in every game he gives the same commitment. His consistency levels are extremely high. He is just brilliant. We played Hull four or five years ago at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">White Hart Lane</a> and Robertson was playing for Hull, as was <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a>. I wouldn’t have noticed Robertson at that time, if I’m being honest, but he then moved to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and he has been the best left-back for them. He’s been the best left-back in England and, maybe, Europe for the past two years. For me, now, he is the one I’m looking to catch, without a doubt. He is the best<br /><br />I tried to watch the <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> games in the Champions League when they were on the television. <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> said at that time that Kieran was one of the best in Europe. As soon as Brendan said that then I took an interest in him. I feel very sorry for him this season as he’s had a bit of bad luck with injury. I do rate the two of them very highly but Robertson is the best</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Rose says <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> had hoped to take <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> I remember we played Hull at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">White Hart Lane</a> <b>[in December 2016]</b> and we won 3-0. Mauricio was manager and the gaffer was all over Harry. I think they <b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> were in for him. Once Poch took a liking to him I started to notice him straight away after that. It’s been a great journey for him. Training with him for England, you couldn’t get the ball off him. He’s so good. He fully deserves to be <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> captain<br /><br />With Harry, we all hope his goals and his performances will merit a trophy one way or another during his career, but <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> means the world to him. We know that and when you see him disappointed, it’s just one of those things that when you’re on Harry’s team in training you win. It’s not a coincidence. You just don’t want to be on a losing side when you’re on Harry’s side, even in training. He’s got that aura that you want to do the best you can.</p>
