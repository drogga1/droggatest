  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> defender Danny Rose has revealed that a club wanted to check that he was ‘not crazy’ during transfer talks held in the wake of his mental health admission in 2018]</b> It was because of what I’d said and what I’d been through. I was embarrassed, as whatever I’ve been through I like to think it doesn’t affect me doing my job. I still know I’ll always give 100 per cent.<br /><br />In the end they didn’t put a bid in. But to think that people assume I might be crazy is embarrassing and I’m still angry about it to this day. If that opportunity came around again I’d definitely say no now</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Rose admits that he never expected to reach a Champions League final with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> Since I’ve been at the club, being in a Champions League final has never ever entered my thought process. I wanted so much to win the Carabao Cup, <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup, <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. We’ve got to one final in the Carabao and two (FA Cup) semis, we’ve huffed and puffed in the league and ultimately never come close. To think that we’re 90 minutes away from maybe lifting the Champions League, I never thought that could happen at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, it shows you anything can happen in football.<br /><br />Now I understand what he means. It wasn’t that I didn’t believe him, I just didn’t understand. Now I definitely understand, it shows that’s why he’s the manager and I’m the player<br /><br /><b>[Danny Rose has been vocal in the past about his frustrations regarding the lack of new signings]</b> Obviously we don’t know the full ins and outs and why the club hasn’t signed anybody. You can either take it that the manager has got full confidence in what he’s worked with in the last two years, that he believes in you and doesn’t want to bring in anyone to challenge for your position, or you can take it that nobody wants to join <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, the club hasn’t been able to provide the funds to buy anyone. The whole squad has taken it as the manager believes in us, despite what’s in the media and what I may have said in the past, that the manager needs to sign somebody. The manager believes in his way, we’re all behind his way and looks what it’s brought us, it’s brought us to a Champions League final, another year of Champions League football next season, a lot of credit should go towards the manager. We’ve all done ever so well<br /><br />The message that the manager is trying to get across to us is that he wants us to be relaxed, obviously not to treat it like any other game because it’s not like any other game but he doesn’t want us to overthink certain things overall. He wants us to go out and express like we did against <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and City and we know he’s fully confident in us. You can’t switch that on in three weeks, it’s part of his philosophy as a manager, he always wants you to treat every game the same, he expects you to train the same. We’ve trained exactly as we would do for a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> game, we’ve not done more or less. We’ve had three weeks, he wanted us to work on things each week. It’s difficult for a manager not having a game for three weeks, you don’t know how hard to work the team, <b>[but]</b> they’ve done it really well, it’s a tricky balance to try and keep but he’s done it really well<br /><br /><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> have not won a European trophy since the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Cup in 1984]</b> I’ve been here a long time to think that we could become legends after one 90 minutes is amazing. That’s got to be our motivation as well. No-one expected us to be here at start of competition, no-one expected us to be here <b>[at]</b> the quarters or the semis. We want to win for ourselves, the manager, the club and especially the fans. We want to win, we want to show the world that the project the manager started five years ago is coming, it’s on its way. We’ve got the stadium now, the training ground, we hope this is the first of many steps as long as the manager is here</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Rose says he is uncertain of his future at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> I don’t know what the future holds now. I’m looking forward to a break. If I’m back at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> next season, great, if I’m not - great. I’ll just have to wait and see. It’s not about regular first-team football. I know my age and I know how the club’s run in terms of if you get to a certain age they might look to ship you on. It has been no secret that my name has been mentioned quite a few times in terms of players moving on and I’ll be just sitting tight over the next few weeks and just seeing what happens. Either way I’m prepared for whatever happens. Last season I didn’t play as much as I wanted. This season I’ve played quite a bit, it’s been really good.<br /><br />As a whole I’m proud of what I’ve done individually and I’m over the moon about what the club has achieved as well. There have been some difficulties - no signings, playing at Wembley and I think the club and players have shown great character. We are in a good position for next season now and we will be raring to go because the final in Madrid was an unbelievable experience and it’s one I’d love to experience again<br /><br /><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> were beaten 2-0 at the <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Wanda Metropolitano</a> by <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> Obviously it hurts. You are reminded of the defeat every day so it’s disappointing but on a bigger picture, it has been a very good season for the club. We are playing Champions League football next season and we just came up short last weekend. Now the season’s finally finished we can reflect on that and hopefully go one further next year and lift that trophy</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Rose is determined to put a summer of transfer speculation behind him]</b> It wasn’t tough, it is what it is. Not everything that was publicised in the summer was entirely true and I think in the future I will have my say on everything that happened but I don’t want to focus on negativity at the minute. I guess I should be happy with maybe being up for sale and having started the first four games for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and the first England game of the campaign. I can’t lie I am very happy, but I just want to say that everything that was written in the summer wasn’t entirely true<br /><br />I don’t need to prove myself to anybody. I have a manager at club level who knows me. You look at last season, I played in the quarter-final of the Champions League, I played semi-finals of the Champions League, I played in the final. So I’ve got a manager there who believes in me. Then if you look at international I’ve got a manager that whenever I’ve been available for selection I’ve been chosen. He fully believes in me and I’m very grateful. I’m lucky to have managers at club level and international level who believe in me. I don’t feel I’ve got anything to prove to anybody and I feel as if I’ve done enough over the years to prove my worth</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Rose says any speculation surrounding his <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> future in January will come to nothing as he intends to run down his contract]</b> It’s pretty obvious what happened <b>[before the season]</b>. People upstairs at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> were trying to do what they were trying to do. I’ve said I’ve got 18 months left on my contract and I’m not going anywhere until my contract has finished. In January, you’re probably going to hear something <b>[about a move]</b>.

Eventually, United. Even under Poch, he had a different culture to the British. It wasn’t that he didn’t understand it. You know the British like to have a drink, it was just something that he couldn’t get his head around<br /><br />He wasn’t willing to compromise on that, either. Even after we beat <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> in the Champions League semi-final and it was obviously the biggest night of our careers. On the flight home we weren’t allowed a drink. It was ‘no you’re training tomorrow, you’re up at 9’. It’s just one of those things. British managers do different things. Foreign managers, sometimes it’ll take them time to adapt or for the players to adapt to them. It’s something that is just one of those things in football<br /><br />In the changing room and we went back out to the fans, for that hour I felt on top of the world. Then we got back on the plane and we were trying to have a drink and he wasn’t having it. He was like ‘No, we’ve got a game on Saturday’. The night was over.<br /><br />I do fully respect what he’s done but at the same time with that Champions League semi-final we’d been together since we were 22 or 23, so for me that’s all I’d known for the past five or six years, you’d play and then get one day off if you’re lucky and that’s it, you’re grafting for the rest of the week.<br /><br />So now I’m at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>, you’re getting two or three days off a week if you win, so I’m thinking what’s going on here then? It’s a shock to the system. We’d only get one day off if we were lucky under Poch. Even in international breaks, he’d see the ones who would go away as having a holiday because training isn’t as hard with your national team. So if you weren’t in the national team you were getting beasted in training. You’d only get Saturday or Sunday off and then you’d get somewhere like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> where they’re getting seven to 10 days off. We’ve been programmed a certain way in the last five or six years and going to <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> it’s different. I’ve missed playing for a British manager and I’m getting used to it again</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Rose says <a href="andy-robertson.html">Andy Robertson</a> is a freak of nature &amp; Europe’s best left-back]</b> <a href="andy-robertson.html">Andy Robertson</a> looks like a freak of nature. I watch him play football and in every game he gives the same commitment. His consistency levels are extremely high. He is just brilliant. We played Hull four or five years ago at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">White Hart Lane</a> and Robertson was playing for Hull, as was <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a>. I wouldn’t have noticed Robertson at that time, if I’m being honest, but he then moved to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and he has been the best left-back for them. He’s been the best left-back in England and, maybe, Europe for the past two years. For me, now, he is the one I’m looking to catch, without a doubt. He is the best<br /><br />I tried to watch the <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> games in the Champions League when they were on the television. <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> said at that time that Kieran was one of the best in Europe. As soon as Brendan said that then I took an interest in him. I feel very sorry for him this season as he’s had a bit of bad luck with injury. I do rate the two of them very highly but Robertson is the best</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Rose says <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> had hoped to take <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> I remember we played Hull at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">White Hart Lane</a> <b>[in December 2016]</b> and we won 3-0. Mauricio was manager and the gaffer was all over Harry. I think they <b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> were in for him. Once Poch took a liking to him I started to notice him straight away after that. It’s been a great journey for him. Training with him for England, you couldn’t get the ball off him. He’s so good. He fully deserves to be <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> captain<br /><br />With Harry, we all hope his goals and his performances will merit a trophy one way or another during his career, but <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> means the world to him. We know that and when you see him disappointed, it’s just one of those things that when you’re on Harry’s team in training you win. It’s not a coincidence. You just don’t want to be on a losing side when you’re on Harry’s side, even in training. He’s got that aura that you want to do the best you can.</p>
