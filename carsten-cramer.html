  <p><b>[Football clubs, like every brand, distinguish themselves by telling a story]</b> The best thing that can happen to us is a sold out Signal Iduna Park. And it must be boiling. That is <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>. That is our unique selling point. That is what makes us so attractive abroad and at home. That’s where we come from. That’s our home, that’s where are our roots are<br /><br /><b>[Dortmund reached cup finals, but have not challenged Bayern in the league since 2012, unable to cope with high-profile exits to their biggest rivals for the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> crown]</b> A club like <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> must be able to take this. We must not define ourselves over a superstar, but over what characterises us as a club. Also, not to be hit by a major depression should players leave us<br /><br />We neither have the resources nor does our brand shine as bright as that of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. We are from <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. And our history with its starting conditions, away from the big European metropolitan areas, is what people also like<br /><br />What we also stand for in a global perspective, what makes us interesting also for other clubs is the way we develop young players. It fascinates others why players like <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Pulisic</a>, like <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> or <b>[former La Masia midfielder]</b> Sergio Gomez believe they can make a big step here at Dortmund</p>

  <p><b>[Dortmund managing director Carsten Cramer on <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a>’s performance]</b> <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> is an absolute superstar. He is not just a talented player. He is already in the first XI at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> at such a young age. He is a guy who makes a difference. There are very few footballers who really make a difference. It will be a challenge for us to keep him playing for us, but we will try. We have some good arguments on the strengths of our club. He will definitely stay here this season, and then, we will see</p>

  <p><b>[Borussia Dortmund’s Amazon documentary]</b> Aljoscha Pause has once again demonstrated his incredible filmmaking talent and has succeeded not only in discreetly producing a fascinating insight into the everyday goings on at a football club, but also in showing <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a> how it really is. Authentic in its raw emotions, sometimes over the moon with joy, sometimes bitterly disappointed, but always ready to bounce back from one moment to the next<br /><br />I know I speak on behalf of my teammates when I say that it was exciting to be observed over a long-term period like this. Aljoscha Pause and his team very quickly felt like part of our squad as we celebrated victories and processed defeats together. Although ultimately we just missed out on our dream of winning the German championship, I’m still very much looking forward to the finished documentary</p>
