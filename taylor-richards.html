<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Meet Taylor Richards: The Man City youngster with Paul Pogba as his mentor]</b> Qualification is still on. It’s a tough task but never say never. We are all going to work hard after the international break and get back into training and keep pushing on<br /><br />Paul’s like my big brother up here. He always helps me. He gives me advice on what to do and if I have a rubbish game then he tells me. He has <b>[been to watch me and]</b> tells me if I need to run more but that’s just Paul. I feel like when I’m with him he gives me inspiration to go to the top and to be the best player I can be because I don’t want to leave anything behind. I just want to be at the top and he shows it’s there for you if you want to get it. When he was at Juventus he came down and I met him and since then we’ve always been close. Sometimes I go over to his house for dinner<br /><br /><b>[Richards admits he had been lazy]</b> It was a slow start to be honest – not playing and not being the Taylor I was before. It was my first real injury. It was quite hard to take but with other people doing well you feel like you could push on yourself a bit. But it happens in the game. My family was there for me and my teammates and now I’m here on the pitch and I’m just trying to push on. Now I just don’t want to leave anything on the pitch. I run until I feel like I can’t run anymore and that’s what I’ve added to my game. Last time I wasn’t really running but now I feel like I work much harder than I did before. To be honest I was a bit lazy. Now I feel like, since the injury, it wasn’t a good place where I was. Now I just don’t want to leave anything on the pitch, I want to go for it</p>
