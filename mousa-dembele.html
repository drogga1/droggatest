  <p><b>[Mousa Dembele insists Tottenham have turned in better performances at Wembley than their impressive 3-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund]</b> We’ve played some good games at Wembley. We didn’t always get the result we wanted but I think in the past we played some good games and the result was sometimes not what we wanted but it was always very promising for me. Like today, I think we’ve played better in the past but today we won.<br /><br />I play with him every day, I train with him. I can’t think of another striker I’d rather play with, to be honest</p>

  <p><b>[Mousa Dembele has cast doubt over his Tottenham future]</b> We have not really talked about an extension of my contract. At the beginning of the season, I said: ‘I had physical problems, I want to see at the end of the season how I feel.’ That’s what the club and I decided by mutual agreement. If we talk about a new contract in the middle of the season, it will cost energy. Imagine that a player feels not appreciated after a disappointing proposal, it can disrupt his game. At this moment, I am very happy at Tottenham. I do not lie when I say that I do not think about a big transfer. I want to play a World Cup and afterwards we will see. Really, I’m not aware of the interest of other clubs. And, besides, I told my agent to wait for the summer to tell me about any offers. For now, I’m only focusing on Tottenham. Maybe this is my last season. Or maybe I’ll sign a new deal. We’ll see</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> outcast Mousa Dembele backed by ex-Spurs team-mate <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> to thrill Asian audience]</b> I know him. He is a very good guy. I think he will do very well here. It is a league where he will fit in. In China, they really want players who can create something from nothing. If you are a stable player who just goes sideways it isn’t really what they want because you can only have three <b>[overseas players]</b> on the pitch. <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> is a player who can beat three people and shoot. For him it will be easy</p>
