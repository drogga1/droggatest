  <p><b>[Ugo Ehiogu: Former England defender dies after suffering cardiac arrest]</b> Ugo was one of our heroes at Cardiff when the club won its only ever major trophy. Ugo and <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> were the rock on which <a href="steve-mcclaren.html">Steve McClaren</a> brought the club its best period in its history</p>

  <p><b>[Middlesbrough have parted company with boss Tony Pulis following their failure to win promotion to the Premier League]</b> Over the past 18 months Tony has been proactive, not only in the ambition to win football matches and promotion to the Premier League, but also in addressing our financial position in order to comply and respect the Championship Fair Play criteria. He has ensured that the club is stable and strong for the future. He leaves us in excellent condition. I’d like to thank Tony for his hard work and commitment over the past 18 months. He has been a joy to work with and a complete gentleman.<br /><br />Tony’s backing of our Academy has seen many youngsters make their first team debuts. I am sure that Dael Fry, Lewis Wing, Marcus Tavernier, and Nathan Wood will be grateful for the faith he has shown in them. I’m sorry to see Tony leave but our friendship and my gratitude will remain. Tony and his family will always be welcome at Middlesbrough Football Club</p>
