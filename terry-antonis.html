<blockquote>
  <p>[After a tough 18 months in Greece, Terry Antonis has declared he’s in a good place with Western Sydney Wanderers] I’m in a good place at the moment. When I first got there, I saw a team that was really determined and they wanted to go places and that was perfect for me.<br /><br />[The injury] set me back a fair bit. I went to a new club and I was unlucky, you know, I got injured and I was six weeks out and then had to get myself ready. But I got myself fit and I was playing and then I was unlucky again. I was playing under one coach, something happened and another coach came in and it was a bit difficult for me to be playing again<br /><br />We haven’t had our one stadium where we’ve played out of, so we’re used to playing at different stadiums and I think for us, we have the mentality that we don’t care where we’re going to play, we just want to show the other teams what we have</p>
