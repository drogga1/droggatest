  <p><b>[Former Manchester City star Elano says he has only one concern for Gabriel Jesus at his old club]</b> I was with Gabriel at Neymar and Robinho’s <b>[charity]</b> game at Pacaembu <b>[in December]</b>. I was worried to ask where he was going to live, and he said he would be in the centre of Manchester. I’m sure he will not succeed - he will not be able to live downtown, in an apartment. In England there are a lot of villages<br /><br />What caught my attention was the fact he had the patience to understand the right moment at Palmeiras. He was playing as a lone forward or the central striker. It has given him great maturity, so he could get to where he is now. He is a kid who is on the rise, and has already gone down well in England</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester City favourite Elano has been blown away by the style of play Pep Guardiola has implemented at the club]</b> I love football, I am passionate about the tactical side, about the way that Pep gets his teams to play, it is an amazing achievement. You’re looking for movement all the time, you see how that movement is synchronised, you see that every player knows what to do and the ball arrives perfectly and that’s something you don’t see without playing.<br /><br /><b>[On Fernandinho]</b> I played with Fernandinho at Shakhtar and I always said he was a player for Europe, he fits the modern game, strong, dynamic and he can pass and score<br /><br />City are world class now and the fans deserve it as they are very special. I came at a transitional phase but we made the fans happy and believed we could win titles like the Premier League. I was happy to play my part and to be here was a joy</p>

  <p><b>[Elano says Prior to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s interest in the attacker, <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> giants <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were keen on landing the talented Brazilian]</b> There was a period when there was very strong interest from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> for him to leave when he was still at base. The values ​​were very low, but they wanted to have a go. Real’s offer afterwards was around €30m more! I had a conversation with the staff and said the boy was worth the bet<br /><br /><b>[Though still so young, Elano believes <a href="rodrygo.html">Rodrygo</a> was always capable of stepping up for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and is adamant there’s a lot more to come from a player that’s relatively quiet off the pitch]</b> Despite his young age, he has a maturity. I strongly believe in his football. He still has room to grow. His personality is pretty quiet, but things are changing. He plays in the main Brazilian team and in <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. Everything in his life will increase. He will have to take some care</p>
