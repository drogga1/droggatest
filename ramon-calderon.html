  <p><b>[Ramón Calderón, the former <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> president, pays tribute to Cruyff]</b> He <b>[Cruyff]</b> can be seen as a revolutionary, a dreamer, a visionary, and an innovator who changed the idea of a game in which strength was the primary consideration to another one based, and focused, on ability and technique, giving birth to what has been called ‘tiki-taka’. He used to say that football should be played with the brain. (…) He would always talk about football in the same way he did when he was playing and coaching-with plenty of passion and excitement. A legend has gone but he has left an important legacy</p>

  <p><b>[Ramon Calderon says Neymar is not right for Real Madrid]</b> Neymar is a top player but I don’t see him - his behaviour in the last games he has played - as being the best reference for coming to Real Madrid. Pogba? Maybe. He is one of the players that <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> has said he really likes. It would be a problem of money. Our president has decided to invest a ridiculous amount of money in the new stadium because we already have a fantastic stadium.<br /><br /><b>[Calderon added on a proven performer who has been linked with a return to the Premier League at either <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> or <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> It’s a pity what is happening with Gareth Bale. I like him. He came here with the great handicap that we paid for him more money than we did for <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. It’s not fair but fans think that he will be scoring more goals than <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, playing better, helping the team much more than <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>. That’s impossible. They have perceived some lack of commitment. He doesn’t speak Spanish so he couldn’t communicate. Maybe that’s the best destination for him, a loan to a British club, and try to recover the confidence and try to again be the player that he has been for the last 10 years</p>

  <p><b>[Ramon Calderon says Chelsea will not part with Eden Hazard easily]</b> It seems he is coming and it’s really good news for Real Madrid if he finally signs for our club. I think now it’s a matter of money. The player has said clearly that he wants to leave, he wants a new challenge and I think it’s not fair not to allow a player after seven years and with one year left on his contract, not to let him go. Of course Chelsea are not easy negotiators. I know that well because in 2007 I had a long negotiation with Peter Kenyon and Roman Abramovich about Arjen Robben.<br /><br />He wasn’t playing for Chelsea but despite that they said the price was 35 million, which at the time was a lot of money - now it’s peanuts. Finally we paid that. We tried many times to reduce that amount and waited until the last minute, but finally we paid that. I’m sure in this case it will be the same, they will be trying to get as much money as they can. That’s what you have to do when you are the owner or the president of a club and a player says that he wants to leave. You say, ‘Ok you want that so let’s try to negotiate the money’.<br /><br /><b>[Calderon added on the qualities that Hazard, at 28 years of age, would bring to the Santiago Bernabeu]</b> He is a very, very good player. He’s a top player. He can play either as a winger or a midfielder, as an attacking midfielder, he can use both feet, he can switch flanks if needed. <a href="vinicius-junior.html">Vinicius</a>, the Brazilian, is playing on the left, so maybe he can play on the other side. Also he can be a false nine, he has good dribbling, excellent passing, he scores goals. He is a very good player. One of those players that any side would like to have with them. If he comes, I think everyone will be very pleased</p>

  <p><b>[Ramon Calderon says Real Madrid granting Gareth Bale a loan move this summer would be the best thing for everyone]</b> His situation here is very difficult. It is clear <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> has discarded him in his mind. He showed that last season by not having him in the starting line-up. It is very disappointing for a player like him. Also the problem is the transfer fee. Real Madrid want to get a lot of money for him but I find that difficult. Maybe the best thing for everyone would be a loan. The player could recover his confidence on the field and Real Madrid could see his value rise. He wasn’t successful here for many reasons - injuries, also the handicap of the money. When he came we paid more than we did for <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. People thought he should be better than <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> but that is very difficult.<br /><br /><b>[The challenge of countering the loss of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> has been passed from Gareth Bale to Eden Hazard]</b> <b>[Hazard’s]</b> a fantastic player but <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is unique. I’ve never seen or found a player like him. Hazard is very talented and skilful, he’s proven that in the strongest championship in the world, which is the Premier League. He can play on both flanks, is a good dribbler with excellent passing. He can play in many positions - attacking midfielder, winger, even a false nine - so it is a fantastic opportunity</p>

  <p><b>[Ramon Calderon claims Gareth Bale hasn’t lived up to Real Madrid’s expectation]</b> It’s a problem. I feel sorry for the player, but the truth is he hasn’t lived up to the expectation when he came. After six years, his situation is very difficult. <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> has discarded him in his mind, clearly, and he proved that in the last two months when he took over the club and Bale sat on the bench. For me, the best option would be a loan, but we’ve heard what Bale’s agent has said, it’s easier to see him winning Ascot than leaving on loan. So it’s a difficult situation for him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>: 2019 06 25
Former club president Ramon Calderon said Gareth Bale had ‘not lived up to expectation’ which followed his move to the Spanish capital in 2013, and the 29-year-old has been largely sidelined since <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>’s return to the dugout in March.</p>

  <p><b>[Former club president Ramon Calderon says Real Madrid boss <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> wanted to keep <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and sell Gareth Bale during his first spell in charge]</b> It’s unsustainable, for sure. For everyone, for the player, for the coach and the club. <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> discounted him when he left the club at the beginning of last season - he wanted to keep <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and sell Bale. The president didn’t follow that advice, so <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> left the club. When he came back two months ago he was promised Bale won’t be there in the future. Maybe his comments weren’t really appropriate but what he has shown is he’s fed up with the situation and the best thing to do is find a solution<br /><br /><b>[On whether Madrid have handled the situation appropriately]</b> When these things happen you have to act quickly. I know one year ago we received an offer of around €100 million and we didn’t accept it because the president thought that being his star, the one he signed, he should be here and perhaps the manager didn’t know how to take advantage of his qualities. Maybe it’s true, but when you have a coach that says he doesn’t want to keep a player you have to look for a solution<br /><br />No top player, and he’s one of them for sure, wants to be on the bench. He would like to be playing, it doesn’t matter where but I suppose at a big club, but no offers have come - that is another problem. They are talking about Chinese clubs but they have the problem with paying the transfer fee, with their new rules, they have to pay the same money to the federation. That will double the amount for the transfer fee. I think in this case the best solution would be a loan, but nobody is willing to do that</p>

  <p><b>[Ramon Calderon says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> really wanted the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> job but it wasn’t meant to be]</b> You only have to look at what he’s won in his career: domestic titles, Champions Leagues - he’s a proven winner which would be one of the main reasons why <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a> appointed him as manager. I know <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are in bad form right now but he’s going to a very good team, who have great supporters. I reckon Jose really wanted the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> job but it wasn’t meant to be. Perhaps he was waiting for something to happen when the team was struggling under <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> earlier this season but finally he has this opportunity now at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>.<br /><br />I think it was very close (Mourinho going back to Real Madrid) because <a href="florentino-perez.html">Florentino Perez</a> really likes him. He respects him a lot and I don’t think there’s any other coach who had the same level of respect <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> had. Perez backed him when he was here when things weren’t going well. If <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> hadn’t succeeded I think <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> would’ve been re-appointed as manager of Madrid, but maybe he was fed up of waiting for that chance and finally decided to return to management with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>.<br /><br />A coach like <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> cannot go to just any club. His CV means he’s worthy of managing a big club where he has the opportunity of winning titles or at least mounting a strong challenge to fight for them. It was a wise decision for Jose to wait until the right opportunity came. I suppose he will do things the right way at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> but it depends on the situation because <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a> is very controversial. When things are going well he’s a nice person, but when things change he can be very difficult to work with.<br /><br />At <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> we experienced that with the <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> and <a href="luka-modric.html">Luka Modric</a> deals. With <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> it was difficult because he didn’t want to sell him and for a long time he was trying to increase the price, so when <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> really wanted the move Levy had no other option but to sell him. I like him as a person but I know that he’s very controversial, so it will be interesting to see how it works with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> and Levy</p>
