  <p><b>[Ramón Calderón, the former <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> president, pays tribute to <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>]</b> He <b>[<a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>]</b> can be seen as a revolutionary, a dreamer, a visionary, and an innovator who changed the idea of a game in which strength was the primary consideration to another one based, and focused, on ability and technique, giving birth to what has been called ‘tiki-taka’. He used to say that football should be played with the brain. (…) He would always talk about football in the same way he did when he was playing and coaching-with plenty of passion and excitement. A legend has gone but he has left an important legacy</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea warned £100m Eden Hazard transfer could happen]</b> Chelsea aren’t a selling club, so it wouldn’t be easy, but as always it would depend on the wishes of the player. If he wants to leave, he will leave - that’s always the point. Chelsea will ask for a lot of money, I think that’s what the situation will be at the end of the season. Chelsea knows quite well how much has been paid in the market over the last few years, with Ronaldo, Bale and Pogba - £100million is now the bar. That bar has been set by those transfers, so I think that’s how much a club like Chelsea would be asking for and the economy at Real Madrid is healthy - I don’t think that wouldn’t be a problem for them. But it’s all about the player. The player must say, ‘I want to leave and go to Real Madrid’, and that will be the moment they start negotiating.</p>

  <p><b>[Ramon Calderon has claimed that Real Madrid have no need to make signings in the summer transfer market]</b> I think we have a team which is very, very strong. I don’t think we need any players. I wouldn’t sign anyone. I think the substitutes have been playing very well. In some matches, only two starters played in the line-up alongside the substitute players and still they played well. I don’t think there is a need to sign anyone<br /><br />The challenge will be for Real Madrid to be the first team to win it two years in a row. The match will be difficult. Juventus are a very strong team and are not just a typical Italian team with a strong defence. Their goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon is one of the best in the world, so the result is unpredictable<br /><br />They have three very good forwards in Paulo Dybala, who has played really well. Also Gonzalo Higuain, a player I signed for Real Madrid, and Mario Mandzukic. Higuain was a fantastic player and hence, we signed him at the age of 19. Nobody thought that he would be so good back then. He helped us win two La Liga titles in a row. It was a pity to sell him. We thought he, alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Arjen Robben would have been the three forwards but I’m very happy that he is successful in Italy<br /><br /><b>[On Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> He will always be one of the favourites to win the Ballon d’Or. He has proven to be a fantastic player. He is scoring lot of goals and is now playing inside the box. I think it has been a wise decision from Zidane, who decided to put him in the box. Let’s hope that he can help us win another title. I hope he will finish his career in Spain. It was difficult for me to sign him in 2008 with Manchester United not letting him go. We had an agreement to buy him the next season for £80 million. I could say I was the one who signed Ronaldo for Real Madrid<br /><br />The TV rights allow the English clubs to make a huge amount of money, almost four times the money made in La Liga. So they are not selling clubs. If someone wants to buy a player from them, they will have to pay a lot of money. First, it was Cristiano for £80m and then was Gareth Bale for £100m and now Paul Pogba</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid are a perfect squad and have no need to oversee comings or goings during the transfer window]</b> All the lines are very balanced. I think the midfield has been perfect to assist the forwards and despite Bale’s injury, Isco played quite well. I don’t think we need any signings. I am sure we will because it’s always like that. But I think now the team is perfect. If someone comes another one, that’s already in the team, will have to leave. That’s a pity.<br /><br /><b>[On Zinedine Zidane]</b> A year and a half ago he was coaching the second division B team in the third tier here in Spain - he has been very humble, he wasn’t bossy, but showed his authority when needed. He used the substitutes well at the right moments, when he wanted the first team players to rest, which is very important in a great club. It is important to make every player happy, despite not all of them of course can play, and when Bale was injured he changed the 4-3-3 system to the 4-4-2 in which Cristiano Ronaldo has been very comfortable. In short I think he has been nearly perfect in the way he has managed this team and that’s why he’s got two Champions League titles in a row. It’s never happened before so I think he deserves it for the way he has done everything</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich will be powerless to prevent Robert Lewandowski from joining Real Madrid]</b> There is no doubt that Real wants him. Everyone would want Lewandowski in their team. If Robert wants to leave, Bayern does not have a chance. In my opinion, it makes no sense to keep someone bent and broken.<br /><br />Of course, he wants Robert to stay. But I’ve heard that so often during my time as president. With Cristiano Ronaldo, Manchester United and Sir Alex Ferguson always said there was no chance. It was the same with David Beckham. But, in the end, the player will always decide on his future<br /><br />When I bought Cristiano for 94 million euros, everyone said that would be completely crazy. Meanwhile, there is no limit. After the last transfers, it will be difficult to get a top player for under 150 million euros. Robert also belongs to this category</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale needs to be aware that no side can guarantee him games]</b> I know that <b>[Zinedine]</b> Zidane likes him very much and fans love him, but he has had injury problems since the beginning of the season that have been why he hasn’t played regularly. When he joined the team he did amazingly, like he did in the last final. I don’t think it’s a matter of tactical strategy or lack of confidence from the coach. It’s understandable he’s not happy - he hasn’t been playing regularly in the last matches. And now the ball is in his court. I don’t know what he’s thinking, but I’m sure he’ll be talking to the coach and the President. But no one can assure a player that he is going to play all the matches. That is a problem for a player like him.<br /><br />He’s an amazing player and he has proven that many times. He was the best player in England in the Premier League. The goal he scored <b>[in the final]</b> is difficult to do for a player not as talented or gifted as he is. But, who is going to guarantee him to play? That is impossible. Of course, if the injuries come back again … you have to be fit to play in a big club, and players if they are more fit than you are will be playing</p>

  <p><b>[Under-fire Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho is obsessed with tarnishing his reputation]</b> Undeniably his track record speaks for itself, it’s the one of a winner and a very successful coach. And because of that he could have had the football world at his feet, in my opinion. But it appears he’s obsessed with staining it with so many controversies and problems. And then he blames the world for everything when he loses. It’s a pity. His track record is very, very difficult to get and it’s something he is now staining continuously.<br /><br />I remember the great Alfredo Di Stefano <b>[the Real Madrid legend, former player and coach]</b>, he used to tell me that a great coach could never complain about referees, injuries, bad luck or any other circumstance - that was reserves for the mediocres. That was very self-explanatory about what a great coach must do. It’s clear that Mourinho is having many problems, even I’m sure among his followers. Maybe they don’t understand what he’s doing or what he’s saying. And on top of that - the results.<br /><br />When you win, everything can be acceptable. But when you’re losing, and when you’re coaching a team so great as United, then fans can be disappointed and at the start of the season with only three points out of nine - that can be a problem. I don’t know what the owners think about that, but of course they must be worried</p>

  <p><b>[Eden Hazard has been tipped to leave the slavery of Chelsea]</b> There’s no point to having a player who wants to go, slavery was abolished a long time ago. It depends what Chelsea wants to do, then it’s just a question of money between Chelsea and Madrid.<br /><br />If a player insists on doing on what he is publicly saying it will be difficult for Chelsea to keep him and for Real Madrid it will be fantastic news<br /><br />I see Hazard as a player after Cristiano Ronaldo and <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi’s time. He is the player that will receive from them the inheritance of being the best player in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid were always facing an impossible task to replace Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> The main problem beyond any doubt has been <b>[Ronaldo’s]</b> exit. It’s impossible to replace a player like this: 50 goals a season, more than 500 goals in the nine years he was here and also a lack of planning. Last two years we’ve been suffering from that. Last year, we finished 15 points behind Barcelona and we were knocked out of the cup by a lower-level team. It’s true that we managed to win the Champions League with difficult knockout matches against Juventus and Bayern Munich but, in those, Cristiano was the key play for winning them, so not having him is real trouble.<br /><br />We have to consider that the World Cup has taken its toll, mainly with players like <b>[Luka]</b> Modric and <b>[Raphael]</b> Varane. They played all the matches until the final and we’ve seen that in other teams like in Barcelona with <b>[Ivan]</b> Rakitic. The main problem with Real Madrid is that to win is an obligation not an aspiration. When the problems come, always the crisis appears. But, we’ve been in a situation like this before and we’ve come out<br /><br />Many names have been said and I think it’s only rumours. It’s clear that this president likes Mourinho. When he was here, he backed him in any problems he had but he said just yesterday that he is happy with Manchester United. But, he has a contract with them, so we cannot talk about that until he leaves Man United, if he does<br /><br />Unfortunately, I think <b>[Lopetegui]</b> has been condemned. A few weeks ago the president thinks he is not the man to run the club. He’s been in touch with many coaches but it’s not by chance that Zidane left and five important coaches rejected that bench. It’s because this president <b>[Florentino Perez]</b> interferes very much with what is happening on the ground with the line-ups and the signings. That, for coaches, is always a problem. I think they have been in touch with Conte but he is sorting out his situation with Chelsea. <b>[Santiago]</b> Solari is the coach of the second team at Real Madrid… I don’t know. We have to wait until Lopetegui is not with the club to look for another one</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho is ‘a problem’ but don’t rule out Real Madrid return]</b> I think <b>[Mourinho]</b> has been the main problem when he’s been in other clubs. When he was here, he was blaming everyone for the defeats. I think that is a grave mistake. It is a problem always. Also it makes a confrontation with the players and it’s been happening with Man United with <b>[Paul]</b> Pogba, with <b>[Eric]</b> Bailly. It was the same here, with Cristiano <b>[Ronaldo]</b>, with Iker Casillas, with Sergio Ramos and I think that’s a problem, he’s always blowing his own trumpet and that for a coach, I think is a big mistake. And, we have the example of <b>[Zinedine]</b> Zidane. He did completely the opposite. Backstage, he has been more with the team and that’s the way in my point of view to train a great team of great players. You cannot be the protagonist.<br /><br />Everyone knows here it’s on the president’s whim. I think he is the only coach that he respects. The current president doesn’t really trust much in coaches, but in Mourinho’s case he really, really backed him many times in difficult moments. When <b>[Julen]</b> Lopetegui left, I said I’m sure Mourinho will be here and I don’t rule out him being with Real in the near future<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether the 55-year-old should take a sabbatical]</b> It’s difficult to know how he is behaving. I remember, for us the greatest in our history is Alfredo de Stefano. He used to tell me, a great team, a great coach can never complain about referees, injuries, bad luck, the behaviour of some players. That’s something that belongs to the mediocre and I think in that he’s doing it. His record is incredible, difficult to match for any other coach, but his behaviour, I think he’s doing that so many times and that’s a warning for any team that’s going to hire him</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo left Real Madrid because he was unhappy with the club’s links to Neymar]</b> Cristiano asked for a raise after winning the Champions League and Florentino denied it. Cristiano also got angry because he heard that Madrid would be willing to pay a lot of money for Neymar. Florentino told him that if he brought in a cheque for 100 million euros he would let him go and that’s how it was.<br /><br />Florentino did not accept that Cristiano was a signing of mine. I don’t deny that he has been a great president for Madrid, but he does not accept well the inheritances that he receives. The same thing happened to him with <b>[Iker]</b> Casillas, Raul, <b>[Arjen]</b> Robben and <b>[Wesley]</b> Sneijder<br /><br /><b>[Calderon claims Zidane could have been kept on had his demands been met by the Blancos board]</b> Now, as coach, he’s <b>[Solari]</b> doing what he can. He’s not the one to blame for this bad situation we’re in. He’s struggling with what he’s been given. He took the team, after another coach was fired, after Zidane left because he clearly knew what was going to happen. It is clear that Zidane asked Florentino Perez for something that was not granted. One of the demands was that Cristiano never leave</p>

  <p><b>[There is a huge chance of Jose Mourinho returning to Real Madrid to replace Santiago Solari as coach]</b> I think the next coach will be Mourinho in my opinion. He is the only coach the president respects, he backed him here all the time. If he is not here next season it’s because the Portuguese <b>[Mourinho]</b> would say no. I have heard some comments from him on Bein Sports last weekend saying: ‘Of course, if Real Madrid calls me I would be very happy very proud to come back again’. It’s 90 per cent in my opinion, that’s my opinion of course, 90 per cent possibility of having Mourinho again here.<br /><br /><b>[On Gareth Bale]</b> It’s not easy with the salary, the money that we paid for him, I don’t know. It’s not easy. If finally he decides to leave I suppose he will have to get a deal with a team. I heard the agent say he will stay and that no way he will leave. I think that is something said in a moment of excitement. In the end if the player is like that, not playing, having problems with the fans, with the team-mates, they will have to look for a solution, maybe a transfer. I am sure there are many teams that would love to have him, maybe in England</p>

They are talking of the possibility of Zidane or Mourinho - they are completely different coaches with completely different ideas of football. It is an erratic and whimsical president who has brought us to this situation. There is the option of bringing in Mourinho now, but to me there is no point. At this moment of the season anything you do is going to be wrong, I suppose that they will wait until the end of the season but this is very long time, three months, to suffer all the critics and the anger of the fans</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale has been careless at Real Madrid]</b> They were very inappropriate comments from my point of view. Real Madrid fans are very respectful with their own players and also with rivals, but they are also very demanding and inflexible with some things, like a lack of commitment. I heard his agent say Gareth Bale loves Real Madrid, and I don’t doubt it, but he must show it. He has been doing some things that people don’t like. We saw how he shrugged off his team-mates after scoring a goal when they went to embrace him and celebrate, he has left the stadium in a few matches before they have finished and he’s been here for six years and still doesn’t speak the language. So a few things have been perceived by the fans as an indifference or careless attitude towards the club.<br /><br />He doesn’t speak a single word of our language after six years, that’s clearly a lack of commitment from my point of view, and from the point of view of the fans. I’m sure that he’s trying to do things in the right way but it’s also clear that, with the injuries and for other reasons, he hasn’t delivered with the expectation when he came here. He hasn’t been that leader Real Madrid and the fans were expecting. Fans are very demanding with any player - they were the same with Alfredo Di Stefano, the greatest of all time at Real Madrid, and with Zidane, they were booing him for months after he came to Real Madrid because his performances were not the right ones. So he <b>[Barnett]</b> must not complain about that, he has perhaps to push Gareth to behave in another way.</p>

But the players, and Sergio Ramos, told him and they did it publicly as well, that you have to take into account which managers have won the Champions League with Real Madrid: <b>[Vicente]</b> Del Bosque, <b>[Carlo]</b> Ancelotti and Zidane. It’s nothing to do with the style of play of Mourinho. <b>[Zidane’s]</b> first idea was to come in June but finally he’s accepted to come now for the rest of the season and for three more years.

It seems it is impossible for him to be here because of the coach and the relationship with the fans. They think he is not committed and that is a problem. The best thing for him is to move. He should take the opportunity if there is one.<br /><br />Maybe he will go on loan. It is a problem when the coach and player do not get along, you have to look at every option to find a solution. The problem is the salary, it is a high salary. He has not been lucky at Madrid since the beginning. Fans thought for the money he would be better than Cristiano and that was really impossible. It is a divorce that is difficult to solve. They will find a loan or a transfer for perhaps a low amount of money</p>

It is very disappointing for a player like him. Also the problem is the transfer fee. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> want to get a lot of money for him but I find that difficult. Maybe the best thing for everyone would be a loan. The player could recover his confidence on the field and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> could see his value rise. He wasn’t successful here for many reasons - injuries, also the handicap of the money. When he came we paid more than we did for <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. People thought he should be better than <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> but that is very difficult.<br /><br /><b>[The challenge of countering the loss of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> has been passed from <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> to <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a>]</b> <b>[Hazard’s]</b> a fantastic player but <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is unique. I’ve never seen or found a player like him. <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a> is very talented and skilful, he’s proven that in the strongest championship in the world, which is <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. He can play on both flanks, is a good dribbler with excellent passing. He can play in many positions - attacking midfielder, winger, even a false nine - so it is a fantastic opportunity</p>

  <p><b>[Ramon Calderon claims <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> hasn’t lived up to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s expectation]</b> It’s a problem. I feel sorry for the player, but the truth is he hasn’t lived up to the expectation when he came. After six years, his situation is very difficult. <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> has discarded him in his mind, clearly, and he proved that in the last two months when he took over the club and <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> sat on the bench. For me, the best option would be a loan, but we’ve heard what <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>’s agent has said, it’s easier to see him winning Ascot than leaving on loan. So it’s a difficult situation for him.</p>

  <dd>Former club president Ramon Calderon said <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> had ‘not lived up to expectation’ which followed his move to the Spanish capital in 2013, and the 29-year-old has been largely sidelined since <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>’s return to the dugout in March.</dd>

  <p><b>[Former club president Ramon Calderon says <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> boss <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> wanted to keep <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and sell <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> during his first spell in charge]</b> It’s unsustainable, for sure. For everyone, for the player, for the coach and the club. <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> discounted him when he left the club at the beginning of last season - he wanted to keep <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and sell <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>. The president didn’t follow that advice, so <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> left the club. When he came back two months ago he was promised <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> won’t be there in the future. Maybe his comments weren’t really appropriate but what he has shown is he’s fed up with the situation and the best thing to do is find a solution<br /><br /><b>[On whether Madrid have handled the situation appropriately]</b> When these things happen you have to act quickly. I know one year ago we received an offer of around €100 million and we didn’t accept it because the president thought that being his star, the one he signed, he should be here and perhaps the manager didn’t know how to take advantage of his qualities. Maybe it’s true, but when you have a coach that says he doesn’t want to keep a player you have to look for a solution<br /><br />No top player, and he’s one of them for sure, wants to be on the bench. He would like to be playing, it doesn’t matter where but I suppose at a big club, but no offers have come - that is another problem. They are talking about Chinese clubs but they have the problem with paying the transfer fee, with their new rules, they have to pay the same money to the federation. That will double the amount for the transfer fee. I think in this case the best solution would be a loan, but nobody is willing to do that</p>

  <p><b>[Ramon Calderon says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> really wanted the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> job but it wasn’t meant to be]</b> You only have to look at what he’s won in his career: domestic titles, Champions Leagues - he’s a proven winner which would be one of the main reasons why <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a> appointed him as manager. I know <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are in bad form right now but he’s going to a very good team, who have great supporters. I reckon Jose really wanted the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> job but it wasn’t meant to be. Perhaps he was waiting for something to happen when the team was struggling under <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> earlier this season but finally he has this opportunity now at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>.<br /><br />I think it was very close (Mourinho going back to Real Madrid) because <a href="florentino-perez.html">Florentino Perez</a> really likes him. He respects him a lot and I don’t think there’s any other coach who had the same level of respect <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> had. Perez backed him when he was here when things weren’t going well. If <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> hadn’t succeeded I think <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> would’ve been re-appointed as manager of Madrid, but maybe he was fed up of waiting for that chance and finally decided to return to management with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>.<br /><br />A coach like <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> cannot go to just any club. His CV means he’s worthy of managing a big club where he has the opportunity of winning titles or at least mounting a strong challenge to fight for them. It was a wise decision for Jose to wait until the right opportunity came. I suppose he will do things the right way at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> but it depends on the situation because <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a> is very controversial. When things are going well he’s a nice person, but when things change he can be very difficult to work with.<br /><br />At <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> we experienced that with the <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> and <a href="luka-modric.html">Luka Modric</a> deals. With <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> it was difficult because he didn’t want to sell him and for a long time he was trying to increase the price, so when <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> really wanted the move Levy had no other option but to sell him. I like him as a person but I know that he’s very controversial, so it will be interesting to see how it works with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> and Levy</p>
