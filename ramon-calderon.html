  <p><b>[Ramón Calderón, the former <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> president, pays tribute to Cruyff]</b> He <b>[Cruyff]</b> can be seen as a revolutionary, a dreamer, a visionary, and an innovator who changed the idea of a game in which strength was the primary consideration to another one based, and focused, on ability and technique, giving birth to what has been called ‘tiki-taka’. He used to say that football should be played with the brain. (…) He would always talk about football in the same way he did when he was playing and coaching-with plenty of passion and excitement. A legend has gone but he has left an important legacy</p>

  <p><b>[Former club president Ramon Calderon says Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane wanted to keep Cristiano Ronaldo and sell Gareth Bale during his first spell in charge]</b> It’s unsustainable, for sure. For everyone, for the player, for the coach and the club. Zidane discounted him when he left the club at the beginning of last season - he wanted to keep Cristiano Ronaldo and sell Bale. The president didn’t follow that advice, so Zidane left the club. When he came back two months ago he was promised Bale won’t be there in the future. Maybe his comments weren’t really appropriate but what he has shown is he’s fed up with the situation and the best thing to do is find a solution<br /><br /><b>[On whether Madrid have handled the situation appropriately]</b> When these things happen you have to act quickly. I know one year ago we received an offer of around €100 million and we didn’t accept it because the president thought that being his star, the one he signed, he should be here and perhaps the manager didn’t know how to take advantage of his qualities. Maybe it’s true, but when you have a coach that says he doesn’t want to keep a player you have to look for a solution<br /><br />No top player, and he’s one of them for sure, wants to be on the bench. He would like to be playing, it doesn’t matter where but I suppose at a big club, but no offers have come - that is another problem. They are talking about Chinese clubs but they have the problem with paying the transfer fee, with their new rules, they have to pay the same money to the federation. That will double the amount for the transfer fee. I think in this case the best solution would be a loan, but nobody is willing to do that</p>

He doesn’t speak any Spanish so that’s a problem in terms of communicating with the fans and the press. He’s also very fragile and has bad luck with injuries. The fact is he arrived at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> with a higher transfer fee than <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>.

Could he join <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>? Why not? It depends on what <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> thinks of him but I’m sure the fans at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have very good memories of him there. For <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> to go back to where he really belongs would be ideal for everyone because going to China would be a pity</p>

  <p><b>[Ramon Calderon says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> really wanted the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> job but it wasn’t meant to be]</b> You only have to look at what he’s won in his career: domestic titles, Champions Leagues - he’s a proven winner which would be one of the main reasons why <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a> appointed him as manager. I know <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are in bad form right now but he’s going to a very good team, who have great supporters. I reckon Jose really wanted the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> job but it wasn’t meant to be. Perhaps he was waiting for something to happen when the team was struggling under <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> earlier this season but finally he has this opportunity now at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>.<br /><br />I think it was very close (Mourinho going back to Real Madrid) because <a href="florentino-perez.html">Florentino Perez</a> really likes him. He respects him a lot and I don’t think there’s any other coach who had the same level of respect <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> had. Perez backed him when he was here when things weren’t going well. If <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> hadn’t succeeded I think <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> would’ve been re-appointed as manager of Madrid, but maybe he was fed up of waiting for that chance and finally decided to return to management with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>.<br /><br />A coach like <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> cannot go to just any club. His CV means he’s worthy of managing a big club where he has the opportunity of winning titles or at least mounting a strong challenge to fight for them. It was a wise decision for Jose to wait until the right opportunity came. I suppose he will do things the right way at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> but it depends on the situation because <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a> is very controversial. When things are going well he’s a nice person, but when things change he can be very difficult to work with.<br /><br />At <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> we experienced that with the <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> and <a href="luka-modric.html">Luka Modric</a> deals. With <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> it was difficult because he didn’t want to sell him and for a long time he was trying to increase the price, so when <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> really wanted the move Levy had no other option but to sell him. I like him as a person but I know that he’s very controversial, so it will be interesting to see how it works with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> and Levy</p>
