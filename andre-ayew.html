  <p><b>[Andre Ayew believes his successful career can be traced to advice and influence from his father, Abedi ‘Pele’ Ayew]</b> When you are lucky to have a dad like that, you try to learn from him and take his advice. He was a great player - three times Africa’s best - and won the Champions League as well as all the other trophies that existed. I ask him for advice because he is somebody who knows football very well. However, when I was younger, he never pushed me to play. When we were younger, he didn’t really want us to play football. He wanted us to focus on school and education and to make sure we had respect for people when we were growing up. Those were his priorities</p>

  <p><b>[Ghana deputy captain and West Ham United star Andre Ayew has different opinion on timing of the Africa Cup of Nations to end of the European calendar]</b> I think it is a great tournament. We really love and no one will ever say no but it is true that the period is not easy for African players. You leave your club, you can go back with injuries, lose your position, the club can bring other players, and players lose out deals. It is difficult but it is ours. It is not an easy corner but that is where we have to be strong as African players.</p>

  <p><b>[New Swansea City acquisition Andre Ayew has set his sights on helping the club win their relegation fight]</b> I am very happy to be back. Things have changed at the club, but the faces are still the same and I am happy to see everyone. Now I need to do the job. What’s important is that we keep the club up. The club have shown a lot of trust in me and a lot of determination to bring me in. Now I need to give back to them on the field. My goal and my challenge is to do everything possible to help the club stay up - the same as it is for all the players and the staff. That’s what I am here for and I will do everything I can to make sure it happens.<br /><br /><b>[Swansea dangerously sit second from bottom on the league table ahead of matchday 26]</b> The season is going to be long and there will be a lot of tough games. It’s not going to be easy - everyone wants to stay up and when you look at the table, 20th place to ninth or 10th is very, very tight. But when you know the players who are here you know the quality they have. Sometimes in football you can have some bad results, but I think we have the quality of players to play in the Premier League. We want to stay at this level and we need to do everything possible to make sure we don’t let the city down and we don’t let the fans down<br /><br />I had a great moment at the club last time. I had a great feeling with my team-mates and a great relationship with the fans. I had a few others to look at, but when the opportunity to come back to Swansea came up, I wanted to take it. I felt the fans wanted me back, the chairman wanted me back and the gaffer wanted me, so I am really pleased</p>

  <p><b>[Andre Ayew not interested in January transfer away from <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> City]</b> I’m not thinking at all about that. I’m here, I’m 100% here just thinking about the next game, that’s Luton. That’s speculation, that’s what people are going to say. I’m just focusing on what’s ahead of me and I’m happy here so that’s not something I think about<br /><br /><b>[Ayew stressed that he could have moved during the last summer transfer window, but decided to stay in South Wales]</b> I think I can do it at any level. That’s not my question. I think I can play at any level, that’s not the problem. I’m happy here. If I’m here it’s because I decided to be here. It was my decision. I’m just happy, playing my football, enjoying with the lads. We want to do something great so we need to keep working and later we will see <b>[what happens]</b>.</p>

We really need the fans because it will be a hard game for everyone. We have the quality and players to deliver and make people happy</p>

  <p><b>[Andre Ayew have penned an emotional tribute to late Pape Diouf. The Senegalese, who was a former president of Olympique <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a>, passed away aged 68 on Tuesday due to complications from the coronavirus]</b> I have no words to express the pain I feel at the news of this terrible news, so many memories come to my mind. You were a grandfather, a father but above all my mentor and even much more than that, you were my legal tutor when I arrived in France at the age of 14 years. You welcomed me, you took care of me, you supported and accompanied me in the pursuit of my dream of becoming a professional footballer. At each step you were present, I still remember when I came back to your office and you asked me for explanations about my grades at school that you did not find satisfactory. You never made me privileged, you taught me that to get something in life you have to fight and give yourself the means. I cannot thank you enough for all that you have done for me, my father, my brother and all my family. As I write this message, so many images come to my mind that I will not be able to describe them in a few lines. You are known as a journalist, agent, president, the first black man to be president of a first division football club in Europe, but for me you represented much more than that and it is difficult for me today to tell that, until we meet again. You have been, you are and you will remain a great gentleman, a very great gentleman. May your soul rest in peace. RIP Pape Diouf</p>
