  <p><b>[Chelsea wonderkid Callum Hudson-Odoi could be Sarri’s secret weapon]</b> The fact the manager is giving me the opportunity to play is really boosting my confidence so I just want to keep getting on the ball, pressing and working hard. The more games I play, hopefully the more I will be able to impress him as well. Getting the opportunities is obviously a good thing so I just need to keep going. I’ve definitely liked working under Maurizio. The way he plays suits the way I play because I like to get on the ball a lot, go forward and keep attacking, I either stay in the pockets or stay wide. With the way the team are playing, being on the left wing is very good because you get to drive at the defenders one against one or cut inside and combine. You just play with a free mind and play how you can play, but also off the ball we press to try and win the ball high up the pitch, so we defend from the halfway line and obviously attack from there. I like playing under him.</p>

  <p><b>[Hot property Hudson-Odoi shows Sarri what he’s been missing]</b> We got early goals which gave us the confidence that we needed, we are back to normal. I couldn’t believe I got the opportunity to start. Every time I got the ball I wanted to do my stuff. I couldn’t believe it when I scored, to see the crowd jumping was a dream. I will keep striving to play for my club. Hopefully more opportunities will come. I am always eager to play but it is the coach’s decision. I will celebrate tonight with my family.</p>

  <p><b>[Hudson-Odoi ecstatic after first goal for Chelsea]</b> I couldn’t believe it. I got the opportunity to start today and I thought to myself, ‘Do you know what? Today could be the day’. Every time I got the ball I just wanted to do what I do normally, keep it simple at times but do my stuff, and as soon as I got the goal I couldn’t believe it. I thought it was a dream. As soon as I saw the crowd jumping I realised it was actually a goal and I’d actually scored the first goal for my club. For the assist, that just tops off the night for all of us. We worked hard and we deserved all of the goals that we got.<br /><br />I think it was definitely what we needed. It boosted our confidence and we got the goals early. Last week was a little setback, so we came back on the pitch straightaway and started working hard. We got the goals and the clean sheet which proved that we’re back to our normal selves and that it was just a little setback. I think we did what we could, worked hard and got the points<br /><br />Every opportunity I get I’ll keep striving and keep working hard, especially in training because that proves everything. The 90 minutes today boosted my confidence really. Hopefully more opportunities will come. I’m always eager to play but it’s always the coach’s decision as well so I’ve just got to keep working hard in training and keep proving myself and working hard and hopefully I keep getting the opportunities to play. I think I’ll celebrate it with all of my family really. They’ve always been there from the start and helped me all the way so I’ll definitely celebrate with them and have a good time and get back at it tomorrow</p>

We are strong enough to beat any team <b>[in this competition]</b><br /><br />Hopefully I did well and made an impact</p>

  <p><b>[When asked who the most likely managers are in Sarri’s squad]</b> I’d say Azpi and David Luiz. He <b>[Luiz]</b> gives a lot of good advice. He knows what to do, and will probably go on to manage as well. He likes to help everybody, the manager, assistant, the players, letting them know how he feels or how the training or games are going.</p>

  <p><b>[Callum Hudson-Odoi is seeking to emulate the success of Chelsea team-mates Eden Hazard, Willian and Pedro]</b> Everyone in the dressing room was very humble and genuine <b>[when I came in]</b>. There was nobody who was bigger than anybody else, no egos. They brought me into the system and made me feel welcome and to not be scared or nervous, just myself. I look up to everyone, but I especially look forward to training with Hazard, Willian and Pedro, especially because that’s where I play. I just keep working hard to try to emulate what they do and, hopefully, I can be where they are one day.<br /><br />I’ve been there throughout my whole life. Putting on the shirt for the first time, being a home-grown player, at such a young age, making my debut was an amazing feeling. Just seeing my shirt in the dressing room, it made me feel like a part of the club. It was a dream come true. <b>[Once I was on the pitch]</b> I just wanted to get on the ball as much as possible and show what I’m capable of. I think now I’ve done that, I’m just delighted and pleased for myself. <b>[When I scored my first goal for the club, against Vidi in the Europa League]</b> I just couldn’t believe it to be fair. As soon as I saw the crowd screaming and jumping I didn’t think it was a goal. I thought that I’d done something wrong and then when everyone started coming round me I realised … I’d actually done it … I’d actually scored my first goal for my club. It was a proud moment for me and my family</p>

Today has been a very long day for me because I had to travel to Bristol first for the U21s and then getting told that I have to come over here to St. George’s Park, it’s been a crazy experience but I’m delighted to get the call and it’s a nice feeling to be here as well. I thought the manager <b>[Aidy Boothroyd]</b> was joking. I was shocked and then when I heard that I actually had to go over, I couldn’t believe it. I was delighted. It’s a dream come true. Now I’ve got to work hard, enjoy every moment and keep working to just hopefully make an impact when I get the opportunity. Everybody here is very humble and they’re very nice. They make sure you’re comfortable. No one has an ego here so hopefully I’ll get to know more of the boys here.</p>

  <p><b>[England debutant Callum Hudson-Odoi has lauded the influence of his friend Jadon Sancho on his career]</b> We have known each other since we were very young. We used to play against each other and we were always close friends, even when we played against each other. No matter whether it was Chelsea against Watford, where we used to play against each other. We have always talked to each other off the pitch, called each other, speak to each other, see how the other one is doing and he has had a great season. Since I have been here with England, he has helped me from day one, always made me feel comfortable and confident. Having a friend like that is amazing, just to bring you into the team and help yourself and be yourself. It is amazing. From <b>[a]</b> young <b>[age]</b>, I have been the same. We have both been playing as we did on the street, that’s just how we play. We have been playing as we did in the park and cages. We have that raw mentality just to go at defenders. Be confident, be yourself, don’t be shy in front of anyone. That’s great that we have the confidence and ability to do that and you never know <b>[what can happen]</b><br /><br />I am not impatient in that way. I am always keen to play the game and love playing football, but at times you have got to remain patient and wait for your time to come. Hopefully, many more will come<br /><br /><b>[Southgate told him to play as he does for Chelsea]</b> He told me to go on the pitch and express yourself. To be how you are at your club, just do what you normally do. When I was about to come on I thought, ‘There is no point in being nervous or shy, just do what you normally do’. Be confident and that’s what I came on and tried to do. I am delighted to have made my debut. I want to thank everybody who helped me to get where I am today. To get the call to come onto the pitch was absolutely crazy and I am absolutely delighted<br /><br />I saw an opportunity to get at the defender, it was really open and I was in a one-versus-one situation. I thought to myself, ‘go forward’. I got the shot off, it rebounded off the defender and went in so I am delighted for that. It is about the team’s performance today, it was a great performance and that’s why we got the 5-0 victory<br /><br />Going up to Bristol for the Under-21s, that’s initially where I was supposed to be. I was intending to stay there and be with them. When I got the call up to the first team, I just couldn’t believe it. I thought, ‘wow, is this serious?’. I am very happy to get the opportunity to come here and work with all the staff and these players. They are great players as well, I am enjoying every moment. I always had the same mentality whatever the age group is. Whether it is U-18s, U-21s, first team or whatever it is, I still have the same mentality. I am not going to change because I have had one game for the first team or anything like that. I will go over there, be humble and be the same way. I will work hard as always. If I go over there, I will be the same way as I have been and I will be confident and be myself</p>

  <p><b>[Hudson-Odoi demands UEFA takes action after England stars suffer racist abuse in Montenegro win]</b> I don’t think discrimination should be anywhere. We’re equal, we have to play a fair game and enjoy the moment but when you’re hearing stuff like that from the fans it’s not right, it’s unacceptable. Hopefully UEFA deal with it properly because when I went over there, me and Rosie heard it, they were saying ‘ooh-ah’, monkey stuff. We have to just keep our heads, keep a strong mentality. Hopefully Rosie is okay as well. We’ll have a chat and discuss what happened but he’s got a strong mentality, he’s a strong guy. Hopefully UEFA deal with it<br /><br />It’s not right at all. I was enjoying the game and to hear stuff like that is never right. As I said, you’ve got to have a strong mentality and we’re still delighted for the win so we’ll just take the win and go back home<br /><br />Raheem has always helped, no matter what. He’s been talking to me about it, trying to say: ‘Listen, don’t worry about it, it’s football. People do it, obviously it’s not right in the game but you’ve got to stay strong’. I’ve spoken to him and Rosie about it at the same time and they were like: ‘Listen, in football, you’re always going to get stuff like that. People are going to be rude or say stuff you don’t want to hear and it’s part of football, so sometimes you’ve got to block it out of your head and just keep going with the game’. But at the same time, that should never happen in football. Everyone should be enjoying the game and, as I said, it’s unacceptable</p>

I am always watching and learning from stuff that he does in training and games, so watching someone like that he’s like a superb role model and idol to look up .<br /><br />I think today’s three points were crucial. A couple of other teams dropped points and we needed to get the win, and we did it in the right manner I think. Our mentality was strong, we had to work hard during the game, and we had to stay patient and compact. We had to just keep getting the ball, keep moving it and thankfully we got the two goals</p>

I say to myself, keep going, keep working hard and hopefully more opportunities will come. I am delighted to get the goals.

I have scored many solo runs, maybe not exactly like that, but I am delighted to get a goal like that. Hopefully many more like that will come and I will get opportunities to score. I will hopefully go back to Saturday with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and get another three points<br /><br />I thought to myself as soon as I come back that I just need to get up to speed and get my fitness back. I think once that happens gradually my dribbling and everything will come back to what it was. Now I am feeling a bit more confident of getting on the ball and doing my stuff. As the games go on I will get fitter, get more opportunities to dribble at players and I already feel better now. I wouldn’t say it is my pre-season, I think it is back to normal.

If the manager says we stay on the pitch, we stay on the pitch, try to cope with it as players and we make the decision all as a team. If we think it is right and we can focus and carry on playing, then we do that. If not and the manager says something different, then we do what the manager says. It is all up to the manager and the captain. It is a captain decision but also a team decision. So we all have a say in what’s happening. It is disgusting to hear or see players getting discriminated against. It is not right. I say to myself, whenever that happens you have got to stick together as a team, which the boys did.<br /><br />I am really proud to see the boys stick together.

He wants me to play for him. They were encouraging signs for me that you want to hear from a manager, that he believes in you and he has faith in you, that you can become a good player and achieve a lot of stuff at the club.<br /><br />I was excited. It was exciting times that a new manager was coming in and also you know that he will play at least some of the youth boys as well. So it’s good to know that you are going to play with some of the players from before. I said from the start that I made the right decision to stay at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.
