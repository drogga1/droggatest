It is good for me because it is encouraging, you see players that you have watched or played with throughout the whole time and they are getting opportunities to play and you have that same hunger and desire, you want to play as well. It gives me the confidence and boost of ‘if I am doing well, working hard in training, I will get the opportunity to play as well<br /><br /><b>[Hudson-Odoi added on the difference between <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> and <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> behind the scenes]</b> The only thing <b>[that has changed]</b> is that we’ve got a more positive vibe in the changing room and on the pitch.

I think the camp now is just more happy, more positive<br /><br /><b>[Hudson-Odoi claims he has built up his confidence while taking in a spell on the sidelines]</b> I feel good, I feel healthy and really fit. The recovery was a long time but it made me feel much stronger, it has made me mentally stronger and has built my confidence more and more.

  <p><b>[Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi admits he feared for his career after rupturing his Achilles last season]</b> I wondered if I would be able to play again; that was my first thought. I knew I’d done something really serious, so I was really concerned, but my family kept me confident that I’d be back to how I was. There were days when I would go into training and I would be sad or disappointed because I could see the boys outside training and you just want to be out there with them. So, I had the dark days but, at the same time, I had positive days as well.<br /><br />When <b>[the injury]</b> came, it was more anger for me because everything was going as I wanted it to go. I was playing games, I’d got called to the national team, everything was going perfectly. There were big games coming up. But I knew when I came back I’d be stronger than I was before. I was out for three to four months and it was crazy to even get the injury in the first place. It’s something I had to deal with mentally because I’d never experienced an injury like that before. I’m really delighted with the way I’ve come back. I didn’t expect to get this many assists and to contribute with a goal as well. Hopefully, I’ll keep improving and adding goals to my game<br /><br /><b>[Hudson-Odoi rejected the advances of <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> in January to sign a new contract at Chelsea]</b> The club have done so much for me and I’m so thankful for that. The decision that I made was a very good one for me and my family. We all thought that it was the right club to be at. I’ve been here all my life, so there’s no need to change yet. My mum and dad are happy where they are and I’m happy where I am</p>

No one is a perfect player, I think that every day when I go onto a pitch, I want to try my best, work hard and keep improving. I say to myself, keep going, keep working hard and hopefully more opportunities will come. I am delighted to get the goals. It is goals that I always try to get as well as assists - any contributions to the team. I am happy with the finishes and I will hopefully build on it and get many more. I have scored many solo runs, maybe not exactly like that, but I am delighted to get a goal like that. Hopefully many more like that will come and I will get opportunities to score. I will hopefully go back to Saturday with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and get another three points<br /><br />I thought to myself as soon as I come back that I just need to get up to speed and get my fitness back. I think once that happens gradually my dribbling and everything will come back to what it was. Now I am feeling a bit more confident of getting on the ball and doing my stuff. As the games go on I will get fitter, get more opportunities to dribble at players and I already feel better now. I wouldn’t say it is my pre-season, I think it is back to normal. I think when I was training, it was like my pre-season getting back to fitness. Now, I am back in the mix, training and playing. Now everything is back to normal so I need to keep working hard and hopefully get fitter<br /><br /><b>[Hudson-Odoi is proud of how his compatriots reacted to monkey chants and Nazi salutes]</b> <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> is the manager; we always have to stick by him. He makes the decision, of course. As players, we speak to the manager and captain to ask them what’s right and what’s wrong. If the manager says we stay on the pitch, we stay on the pitch, try to cope with it as players and we make the decision all as a team. If we think it is right and we can focus and carry on playing, then we do that. If not and the manager says something different, then we do what the manager says. It is all up to the manager and the captain. It is a captain decision but also a team decision. So we all have a say in what’s happening. It is disgusting to hear or see players getting discriminated against. It is not right. I say to myself, whenever that happens you have got to stick together as a team, which the boys did.<br /><br />I am really proud to see the boys stick together. In those situations where they say they would walk off the pitch it is right because no player should be treated differently. We are all equal. It is an equal game so we have all got to stay strong. Stay the same and the boys dealt with it well. Hopefully, everything will be sorted properly by <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>. Everything that happened was obviously not right but we have to stick together as a team and move on from it</p>

He wants me to play for him. They were encouraging signs for me that you want to hear from a manager, that he believes in you and he has faith in you, that you can become a good player and achieve a lot of stuff at the club.<br /><br />I was excited. It was exciting times that a new manager was coming in and also you know that he will play at least some of the youth boys as well. So it’s good to know that you are going to play with some of the players from before. I said from the start that I made the right decision to stay at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.

  <p><b>[Chelsea winger Hudson-Odoi relieved to end three-month goal drought]</b> I have been a bit agitated. Thinking to myself that I have had chances and I need to convert more of them, be more clinical in front of goal, so in this game, I thought to myself, hit it low and hard. Recently I have been thinking ‘be patient, the goal will come if you be yourself, be calm, everything will go your way’. I am really happy that I got the goal and I am looking to build on it and keep going. But it is not just about the goal, it is about helping the team, working hard, keeping the ball, and overall I am happy with how everything went<br /><br />I was walking back and the <b>[Nottingham Forest]</b> player came along and trod on my Achilles. It was a bit of pain but I’m alright now. Obviously there are still times where I think to myself ‘if I get kicked on it like today what could happen’. And there are times where I think to myself if I do a certain movement it will go again. But now as days at training go by, I think if you’re confident and do your strengthening work in the gym, it will still be strong and nothing should happen to it again. I’ve been doing work every day with the conditioning coaches to ensure it’s strong enough and nothing else happens to it. I think I’m close to the point I was before</p>

The England thing, the Champions League debut, and a change of manager has taught me a lot. So I would say ‘experienced’ is the word. I’m much more mature now, it’s made me wiser. It makes me think everything has happened for a reason - so I should be grateful and give thanks to God. There are times when I sit back and think to myself what a crazy 12 months it has been.

It has been very warming and a good feeling to know you have got your team-mates behind you, backing you and making sure you are feeling well and encouraging you</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea winger Hudson-Odoi feeling ‘perfect’ after Covid-19 recovery]</b> I am feeling perfect. I had the virus, which has cleared now. I fully feel good, I feel fit, so I am feeling back to myself so it is all good. I had it <b>[the illness]</b> three weeks ago now I think, on a Monday when I felt a bit hot and I was thinking, ‘this is a bit unusual, why do I feel this hot?’ The next day I was feeling back to normal. I thought it was just a minor temperature thing, but obviously it wasn’t. I said to myself this wasn’t actually that bad, the symptoms, and I said to myself, ‘I feel good, I feel better’. Everything is happening so fast and I did not know this virus would be such a major thing and so big in the world and affect so many people. Everyone has to be careful and judge things how they go and hopefully the virus will go soon and everyone will be back to normal.<br /><br />For me it is an opportunity to show again and keep pushing myself to the max to hopefully have an opportunity to go to the Euros. The Euros is a massive thing and I have big belief in myself and hopefully I will be able to get into the team. I just want to make sure that I keep pushing myself every game and every minute, making sure that I keep trying to score goals and make assists and keep trying to help the team as much as possible to get what we want, which is a trophy at the end of the day</p>

  <p><b>[Hudson-Odoi eager to link up with England team-mate at Stamford Bridge]</b> Me and <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> are mad close, we talk every other day, always seeing how each other are and how we’re doing. We make sure that we’re both doing well, obviously he’s doing amazing and having a great season. We’re always making sure each other is good. Obviously he’s a great player, I love playing with him - he’s a great player to play with. For England as well we’ve played all the way through the ages so the link-up has always been there. I played against him sometimes in the Youth Cup games or we would play with each other for England, the link-up has always been there and we’ve always loved playing with each other. The way we play with each other we just know where each other is on the pitch every time and we just love to play with each other. I don’t know <b>[if he’ll come]</b>.

  <p><b>[Callum Hudson-Odoi says he knew <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> would make a good manager]</b> I always thought to myself that he would be a good manager because of the way he used to lead on the pitch when he was playing. You could tell that he demanded a lot from the players he was playing with. It’s an amazing feeling to know that an ex-player, an ex-legend, has come back to the club and has the opportunity to work for the club, and we’re working under him. Every day we want to learn and keep improving. Obviously, he knows all about becoming a top player so you want to learn under him and maybe one day become a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> legend yourself!<br /><br /><a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a> has a great bond with the Academy, he knows all the players and all the staff over there. I think he knows when they’re ready to come up and when they’re ready to train and be involved. He’s helped bring all the players up and he’s made everybody aware that if you’re doing well and working hard in training then you’ll get the opportunity to play. It gives you a special feeling to work extra hard because you want to be playing in games, you want to be playing in any match possible. You just have the feeling that if Jody’s there, he’s going to try and push the young players to come up</p>
