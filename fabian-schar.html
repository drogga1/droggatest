  <p><b>[Newcastle United signing Fabian Schar has affirmed that he is ready for the challenge of starring in the Premier League]</b> The Premier League is the best league in the world, you have so many good players and many good teams. Almost everybody can beat everybody so that is what I am looking forward to. With the great stadiums and all the fans, it’s going to be fantastic next season. I’m really happy to be here. England is the best league in the world. I need some training and some more pre-season because the season is coming quick, and I have to be ready in maybe just two weeks. I’m really looking forward to it. I have had maybe two or three training sessions with team-mates, and one game, so I need some time but what I have seen is that we have a good team and quality in the squad.</p>

  <p><b>[Fabian Schar hopes that Newcastle can build on their momentum]</b> We knew before how massive the two home games would be, especially playing against two teams more or less in the same position in the table. We wanted to get the points and we have shown in the last few weeks that we can perform. I am happy about that. Hopefully we can keep working like this and we have another game this week, so we are looking for more points.<br /><br />Actually, when you hit a ball, you can feel if it’s a good one or not. You never know. Sometimes if the ball is too far to the right it hits the post and goes out, but you know if you have hit it and the luck is with you. It was a special goal for me<br /><br /><b>[On Miguel Almiron]</b> We have seen since his first day he has some qualities and he can be a very important player for us. We have some pace in front, not only him. He has only been here for two or three weeks and he knows what runs he has to do already; he is an intelligent player and, with his pace, he can do a lot of things</p>

  <p><b>[Switzerland defender Fabian Schar has said he remembers nothing from a sickening clash of heads in Saturday’s game against Georgia]</b> It looks awful, I can’t remember anything. I was out for a few seconds. My skull is still humming. And I’ve got a neck-ache and a bruise on my forehead. But it was worth it.</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle United defender Fabian Schar has revealed he is pleased by his performances in his first Premier League season]</b> I had a quite hard start, like the whole team. I think the whole team struggled a lot the first 10 games, but then we started getting points and doing a good job over the whole season. I think, for me and the team, the second part was quite good and we can be proud of the end. For me, it was also a quite good season when I look now. I enjoy playing in the Premier League, especially for this club and these amazing fans. I look forward for the next year.<br /><br /><b>[A 4-0 win away at Fulham on the final day of their Premier League]</b> It was the perfect end, I think, for us. To get one position above at the end, and to give the fans something, was the perfect game for us. It was a quite good day for us<br /><br />It’s great for us, for the whole team, to get this support every game. At home games or away, they’re always there, and they give us some really good support. That’s what we need</p>
