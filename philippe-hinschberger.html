  <p><b>[On Ismaila Sarr]</b> He’s a player capable of extraordinary breaks. On that goal, he underlined that he can take advantage of his placement to gain possession in a good area and make his speed count.<br /><br />He’s developed over the eight months he’s been here<br /><br /><b>[Before he departed, he had won three penalties but had never scored a goal. Now he has four to his credit - three of which have been absolute crackers]</b> When we see goals like that. He’s going to turn heads, maybe not all over the planet, but at least in France</p>

  <p><b>[Why Lyon face an almost impossible task at Barcelona]</b> They can do it. There are some very talented players at Lyon, Fekir was not there in the first leg. Barcelona will logically dominate, but when they want to this Lyon team are capable of great things, they have a real chance, they will have to be solid at the back, but it’s a team that can score anywhere, anytime and against anyone. In the meantime, the magic will have to work, just like what happened for FC Metz 35 years ago. A resounding feat.<br /><br />It was unlikely, we can play the game 10 times and we would be eliminated 10 times. We had a coach, Marcel Husson, who was a great man. Then we had a great team with Bocande, Kurbos, Jean-Paul Bernad, Jean-Philippe Rohr, Bracigliano and so on, we had prepared ourselves even if we had never imagined we would qualify<br /><br />We were very upset, they took us for ‘fools’, as they said, and we wanted to show that we were better than that</p>
