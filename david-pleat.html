  <p><b>[on <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>]</b> At <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> he has definitely come deeper, he has joined in more, he has proved he has good feet - I am talking now about passing ability not goalscoring ability - so he can come deep and link with other players. Because he runs at people from a deeper position he looks quicker, shall we say, than he really is, which might sound strange but the defenders are on their heels when Harry picks the ball up and he goes at them. This is something he has learned, picked up from coaches, and he has done it very well. That is another thing about <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>. He is a two-footed player and how many strikers are two-footed players? He can get goals from the left or right side. He is first class</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>]</b> I have known <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> for a very long time. His feet are firmly on the ground. He is a very sensible boy, a modest, humble boy. He had injury problems, he had a loan at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> where they had about seven forwards vying for three places and he had a loan at <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> where <a href="chris-hughton.html">Chris Hughton</a>, who was manager at the time, says it didn’t quite go for him. But in previous loans at Millwall and Orient, I went to watch him. He was very good at Millwall but he played a very different game. He played purely as a front man with his back to goal, as an old-fashioned traditional centre-forward and they were playing off him</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a>]</b> <a href="alan-shearer.html">Shearer</a>’s ability in the air was feared by a lot of center-backs. He was very good at pulling away to the back post, and very clever at anticipating in the six-yard box and getting across people; he had spring, and for someone his size, he did so well</p>

  <p><b>[Dele Alli was almost passed up by Tottenham, David Pleat has revealed]</b> I had seen a lot of Dele Alli and I was convinced. I had spoken to <b>[Spurs technical director Franco]</b> Baldini, I spoke to all sort of people about him, I was pushing, pushing, pushing. It wasn’t clever. He’d played about 75, 80 games regularly in men’s football for a team called MK Dons, nice people, just down the road. I saw a lot of him and I was convinced, given the opportunity, that he would do well.<br /><br />So, just before the deadline on, I think it was the January, I was going to a game at Luton and it was Daniel Levy <b>[on the phone]</b> and Daniel said to me, ‘This boy Alli, we hear he’s going to have a medical or he’s going to talk to Villa and to Newcastle. What do you think?’ I said, ‘Mr Chairman, it’s a no brainer!’ and he said to me, ‘Yes, but they want £5m for him’. I said, ‘Chairman, it’s a no brainer. I would take him at £5m, you can’t lose on him. If we are sympathetic, if we encourage him, I’ve got every hope for this particular boy,’ and of course he took my advice.</p>
