  <p><b>[Tottenham director of football David Pleat on <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>’s £50,000-a-week deal with Manchester United]</b> To many of us, the game has taken a massive blow and this day will be a milestone for football. Probably only when a club’s bankers call them and say enough is enough will the game in England come to its senses</p>

  <p><b>[David Pleat on Rafa’s rotation policy during the Liverpool-Besiktas game]</b> Of course, <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> is one of only a few <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> players who never get left out by Rafa. And even he doesn’t always get picked</p>

  <p><b>[on Harry Kane]</b> At <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> he has definitely come deeper, he has joined in more, he has proved he has good feet - I am talking now about passing ability not goalscoring ability - so he can come deep and link with other players. Because he runs at people from a deeper position he looks quicker, shall we say, than he really is, which might sound strange but the defenders are on their heels when Harry picks the ball up and he goes at them. This is something he has learned, picked up from coaches, and he has done it very well. That is another thing about <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>. He is a two-footed player and how many strikers are two-footed players? He can get goals from the left or right side. He is first class</p>

  <p><b>[on Harry Kane]</b> I have known <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> for a very long time. His feet are firmly on the ground. He is a very sensible boy, a modest, humble boy. He had injury problems, he had a loan at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> where they had about seven forwards vying for three places and he had a loan at <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> where <a href="chris-hughton.html">Chris Hughton</a>, who was manager at the time, says it didn’t quite go for him. But in previous loans at Millwall and Orient, I went to watch him. He was very good at Millwall but he played a very different game. He played purely as a front man with his back to goal, as an old-fashioned traditional centre-forward and they were playing off him</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[on Alan Shearer]</b> <a href="alan-shearer.html">Shearer</a>’s ability in the air was feared by a lot of center-backs. He was very good at pulling away to the back post, and very clever at anticipating in the six-yard box and getting across people; he had spring, and for someone his size, he did so well</p>
