  <p><b>[Former <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> goalkeeper <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> Alomerovic has praised the motivational prowess of <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> manager who was in charge of <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a> as the shot-stopper threatened to make inroads in the first team]</b> He is an exceptional trainer and person who can give you incredible self-confidence. From time to time, he would shout and could reprimand you. He is extremely good at saying the right things at the right time - and with that he grabs the players. I can still remember my first friendly game in a training camp. I came on at half-time. He didn’t tell me to do this or that, just: ‘You are so good, you have a lot of strengths. Go out and show them to people. Then I went to the box and thought: ‘I’m the coolest!’<br /><br />He immediately made it absolutely clear that he wanted a new goalkeeper. That was <a href="roman-burki.html">Roman Burki</a>, so it was obvious that two goalkeepers would be leaving. Roman Weidenfeller, Mitch Langerak and I still had a contract. That’s why sports director <a href="michael-zorc.html">Michael Zorc</a> came up to me and said: ‘We respect your contract, but if an inquiry should come, we would not put any obstacles in your way’. At that time, I was one of the best goalkeepers in the 3rd league, so the move to Kaiserslautern was actually logical.</p>
