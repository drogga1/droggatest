<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Amr Zaki talks about would he fast or not for the entire month in England]</b> When I was in England I was eager to fast all the time and keep praying and also reading Quran in my spare time. I fasted on every day and I don’t think it affected my performance - actually I think I got stronger. I have played many matches on days which I have fasted<br /><br />The manager <a href="steve-bruce.html">Steve Bruce</a> said to me that he understands my fast but he can’t let me play while I’m fasting. He told me that I have to choose. I chose fasting but then I played several matches without telling him that I’m fasting and I also kept playing well without problems<br /><br /><b>[His decision to lie to his manager and play on an empty stomach was vindicated in one particular match in December 2008]</b> I was fasting when we beat <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> 2-1. I scored a goal and everyone seemed to be pleased with my performance</p>
