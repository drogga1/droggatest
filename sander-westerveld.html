<blockquote>
  <p>[Alisson has been billed as the perfect goalkeeper] I think he is the perfect goalkeeper. We used to have perfect goalkeepers with the likes of [Manuel] Neuer. If you look at styles of goalkeepers, Neuer has everything. He is a good footballer, he has good reaction, he commands his area - and Alisson is the same. He is great on one-v-ones, he is great at his reflexes on the line. He comes and takes crosses, he’s amazing with his feet and the most important thing is he makes important saves at important moments. So, even if he makes a mistake, we still win 3-1. He never makes a mistake and we lose 1-0. Again, you need a little bit of luck as a goalkeeper but I think he is probably one of the top goalkeepers we have in the world at the moment. In fact, not probably, he is one of the best top two goalkeepers in the world I would say<br /><br />[On the Anfield collective] I think we have got a good balance in this team now. We have got a good goalkeeper, we have got a good striker, a good midfield and a good defence so the balance is there. We have got a good squad and we can really challenge. Manchester City are an amazing team but sometimes you need a little bit of luck. You make your own luck as well, but I think we can do it this season</p>
