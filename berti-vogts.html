  <p><b>[Berti Vogts on Gareth Bale]</b> I know him and I’m very surprised about his transfer fee. <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> is not an absolute world-class player. I don’tthink he will make it at Real Madrid</p>

  <p><b>[Former Germany manager Berti Vogts has questioned ​Philippe Coutinho’s move to Bayern Munich]</b> At first glance, the loan from Coutinho is a great signing for the Bundesliga. But I want to ask a question: Why is a 27-year-old leaving a world club like FC Barcelona? Because he has given up the hope to prevail there. Maybe he’s not a world star, but a player who - probably in the new season - would be a substitute for FC Barcelona<br /><br /><b>[Vogts also questioned the wisdom of the move for France U20 midfielder Michael Cuisance, who reportedly was looking for a guarantee of playing time with his previous club Borussia Monchengladbach]</b> I have not been able to form a conclusive judgment on Cuisance. His great talent is evident, but that’s not all in football. On the other hand, his behavior bothers me. According to (Monchengladbach) sports director Max Eberl, he internally demanded a guarantee of a regular place, as if there could be something like this for 20-year-olds at an ambitious Bundesliga club. And then he moves to Bayern Munich, where his chances of action are likely to be even lower<br /><br />In a nutshell, there are doubts in Bayern’s two transfers, but the quality that already exists makes them title favourites</p>
