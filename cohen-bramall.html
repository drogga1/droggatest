<blockquote>
  <p>[Arsenal risk losing some of their best young talent if they are not given the opportunity to prove themselves at senior level] Yes, 100 per cent. If they don’t get the chance to show how good they are they will go abroad. There are a lot of clubs in the Bundesliga who want English talent and they will jump ship and go and try it over there.<br /><br />I feel sorry for Eddie Nketiah because Danny Welbeck was injured for a lot of the season and Ed should have been given more chances. But with the media and the fans, there is a lot of pressure on youngsters because as soon as they don’t have the best game, people are on to them. It’s hard to take in. But with Ed, the boss should have given him more chances. The first team were in a difficult position last year, though, obviously trying to get Champions League and the fact it was Unai’s first season made it hard for youngsters to get in<br /><br />Freddie Ljungberg has coached us for a whole season, he knows who is ready, who isn’t and who is ready to go out on loan. I think a lot more youngsters will get an opportunity now with Freddie there, especially in the cup games and the Europa League<br /><br />[Carl Jenkinson did get some minutes, as did Stephan Lichtsteiner, but Jordi Osei-Tutu never got a look in] Jordi not getting a chance last season didn’t make sense to any of us. We were gutted for Jordi because we were expecting him to be with the first team a lot more and we didn’t really understand why he wasn’t. He deserves his chance. I think Ainsley has done a good job there but I feel sorry for him because he’s not a right-back, he’s a midfield player and he can be a scary player there. He deserves a chance in midfield and Jordi deserves a chance at right-back. If that doesn’t happen then I think Jordi will have a successful loan because he is that good. He’s one of the best right-backs I’ve seen</p>
