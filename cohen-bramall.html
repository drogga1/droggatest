  <p><b>[Cohen Bramall has revealed his disappointment at having to leave <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> When <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> left it changed the whole thing for me. I’m gutted that he left. When Unai came in I was hoping to train across with the first-team but I didn’t really get that opportunity. A lot of staff went, Neil Banfield, the boss obviously and other people round the club. A lot of people went and that made a big impact. But that’s life and it happens.<br /><br />I didn’t have a conversation with Unai at all. That’s the thing. I didn’t have a conversation with him once. It was probably difficult for him because I’m guessing he was told I didn’t have the best of loans at <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a>, so he just binned me off. And when I did get told to go over there and train, it was at the last minute. That’s the thing that upset me a bit because I didn’t get the chance to show Unai what I could do, like I did with Arsene. The last three months I worked really hard to see if anything would change, but nothing did. So I knew it was coming. I already accepted it when Arsene went<br /><br /><b>[Bramall stayed with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> last season, but again endured a frustrating time of things]</b> Obviously the last two-and-a-half years have been amazing. It’s been great working with world-class players and so many good lads. It feels like it has gone too fast. But I feel good. I feel positive and like a pressure has come off my shoulders. When you sign at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <b>[Manchester]</b> United - top teams - there is constant social media pressure, things like that. My dream was to start for the first-team in a competitive game and I didn’t get to do that. That was the pressure, to get there and achieve that, but I couldn’t do it. That’s the most annoying thing. I think if I’d played that competitive game, that pressure would have just gone. But when I was in and around the first-team, I just felt like I was putting pressure on myself, unnecessary pressure<br /><br /><b>[The Crewe-born youngster will forever be grateful to the Frenchman for bringing him to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> I’ll never forget working with him. I had a lot of one on one conversations with him. It was just inspiring to listen to him. Arsene coaching me most days after I signed in 2017 and in pre-season was just amazing. I’m so grateful to have had the opportunity to have worked with not just a good coach, but such a good human being. I was at <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a> when I saw on Sky that he was leaving and I didn’t believe it. Then I saw it on Twitter and I asked someone at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> if it was true and it was.<br /><br />Straight away I knew that things were going to be difficult for me after that. When Arsene was there and I was with the first-team, I didn’t feel a lot of pressure and didn’t put unnecessary pressure on myself. I felt really comfortable and that I was fitting in nicely. But as soon as that got announced my heart sank a little bit because I knew full well it would be a problem<br /><br /><b>[There is a sense of regret that <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> never really gave him an opportunity to try and impress]</b> I don’t have frustrations towards him or anyone really. Like I said, I wasn’t expecting to go in last summer and say ‘look Unai, I’m ready’. I knew I wasn’t going to get the opportunity that I had when I first signed and that I wasn’t going to work with the first-team as much as I did. I feel gutted that I didn’t get the opportunity, but you live and you learn</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> risk losing some of their best young talent if they are not given the opportunity to prove themselves at senior level]</b> Yes, 100 per cent. If they don’t get the chance to show how good they are they will go abroad. There are a lot of clubs in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> who want English talent and they will jump ship and go and try it over there.<br /><br />I feel sorry for <a href="eddie-nketiah.html">Eddie Nketiah</a> because <a href="danny-welbeck.html">Danny Welbeck</a> was injured for a lot of the season and Ed should have been given more chances. But with the media and the fans, there is a lot of pressure on youngsters because as soon as they don’t have the best game, people are on to them. It’s hard to take in. But with Ed, the boss should have given him more chances. The first team were in a difficult position last year, though, obviously trying to get Champions League and the fact it was Unai’s first season made it hard for youngsters to get in<br /><br /><a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Freddie Ljungberg</a> has coached us for a whole season, he knows who is ready, who isn’t and who is ready to go out on loan. I think a lot more youngsters will get an opportunity now with Freddie there, especially in the cup games and the Europa League<br /><br /><b>[Carl Jenkinson did get some minutes, as did <a href="stephan-lichtsteiner.html">Stephan Lichtsteiner</a>, but <a href="jordi-osei-tutu.html">Jordi Osei-Tutu</a> never got a look in]</b> Jordi not getting a chance last season didn’t make sense to any of us. We were gutted for Jordi because we were expecting him to be with the first team a lot more and we didn’t really understand why he wasn’t. He deserves his chance. I think Ainsley has done a good job there but I feel sorry for him because he’s not a right-back, he’s a midfield player and he can be a scary player there. He deserves a chance in midfield and Jordi deserves a chance at right-back. If that doesn’t happen then I think Jordi will have a successful loan because he is that good. He’s one of the best right-backs I’ve seen</p>
