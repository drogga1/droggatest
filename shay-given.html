  <p><b>[on Roy Keane]</b> He’d break up play and keep things ticking over. Great energy, and another great leader, always commanding. People respected him, and he’d give you a rollocking if you weren’t doing your job properly, but it was always to help the team. He could play a bit, too</p>

  <p><b>[On Dennis Bergkamp]</b> His touch, his skill and his awareness were a level above other players, something you can’t teach. I was in goal when he scored an incredible goal against <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>, by knocking it round Nikos Dabizas. We just stood there looking at each other, amazed. He’s probably the only player who could have pulled it off</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea midfielder <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> left his new team-mates at <a href="derby-county.html">Derby County</a> stunned upon his arrival at the Championship club in 2018]</b> The first training with us left the players thinking: ‘Wow, who is this guy?!. xxxWe knew about him as a young prospect at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> who had done well in Holland <b>[on loan at Vitesse]</b>, but it is not until he is actually on the training ground that you really see what kind of player he is. He was some player for us. His finishing, power, pace and work rate was great. He is just desperate to be the best he can be. Of course, he has played so many games this season for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and he was one of our best players at Derby. Even at Derby, they thought what a player he is going to be from the first training session and he went on from there<br /><br />Frank came into Derby and really hit the ground running. You could tell he was going to do well from the day he arrived. Now he has had <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in a transitional period, but all the players he has brought through have been fantastic. People forget that he dealt with a transfer ban and <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> - one of the best players in the world - leaving in the summer. To do the job Frank has done at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> has been brilliant. You hope he is there for many years. It is great for a young coach such as Frank to be given an opportunity like that and hopefully he can keep improving and get even better as well. He is a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> legend as a player and he wants to be a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> legend as a manager. His will to work and dedication is unbelievable. Hopefully he gets the right backing so he will be a big success<br /><br />We are really like a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> club in the Championship. We need to, as staff and players, to try and get Derby into <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Before it was shut down, we were on a very good run actually. In the Championship, if you can go into a run in the last few months of the season then you have a chance of making the play-offs. We felt we had a chance of doing that. <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> has been fantastic since he joined the club both on and off the pitch. What a fantastic captain and leader. He is still a brilliant player, and it is an honour to be with him in the same team. For the younger players at Derby, it is really good to learn from someone like him because it is remarkable what he has done in his career. Every day he is the last one on the training ground doing free-kicks and finishing drills. He is always working and improving. That just sets the bar for everyone else<br /><br />It is like going into a game of football with no goalkeeping gloves and boots. CareGiven has been set up to try to get PPE to the frontline because these people are putting themselves in danger to help us. We talk about heroes on the football pitch but those working on the frontline a real heroes. Being called a hero from what you do on the football pitch can be over the top even if you play well. The real heroes are on the frontline as doctors, nurses and other specialists. You take it for granted sometimes that the NHS is there but these people are here to save our lives. They do it and that’s their job. I make saves in a goal and they save people’s live. They are heroes in my eyes. They deserve to work with the right equipment</p>

  <p><b>[Shay Given says <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> players called Silva Merlin the Wizard]</b> The players used to call him ‘Merlin the wizard’. What a brilliant player! What a career he has had! And he is a fantastic guy off the pitch. He is a perfect professional but he likes a laugh. We have had great foreign imports in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but he has to be up there amongst the best because he has been brilliant. Because of trophies he has won for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and Spain, he will go down as one of the greats, for sure. He is never flustered in possession and he always seems to have time on the ball. When you are watching the TV, you are thinking, ‘Why is no one getting close and tackling him?’ But he just has that natural ability of finding space and picking the right pass before anyone can get near him. That’s intelligence; a football brain. It’s something you are born with. He has worked extremely hard as well but I just think he is such a naturally gifted player<br /><br />I think David had to change his game for Pep, and <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> too. Pep is very demanding in terms of what you must do when you don’t have the ball, so maybe that’s why David and <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> had to adapt more. Maybe, previously, they were more about doing their business on the ball but, under Pep, they have had to chase and graft. But David tracks back to the edge of his box, makes interceptions and that shows he is a team player. He will do what the manager wants<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> had an unbelievable season. They were brilliant and it was a year where <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s points total (97) would have won the league nine times out of 10. But the run City went on was unbelievable and they won every single game towards the end of the season. There was no blip there. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> can count themselves unlucky last year. But City have had a dip this season and it was caused by a combination of Kompany going in the summer and a massive injury to their most important defender, <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Aymeric Laporte</a>. That’s a massive hole in any team, even the champions. They are fantastic going forward but you need a solid base to build from. I thought they should have tried to replace Kompany in the summer or even try to keep him for another year, but he decided to go back to Belgium. I felt someone needed to come in to strengthen that department as <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Laporte</a> was a massive part of last season’s success as well. I haven’t seen a problem going forward this year but I have seen them conceding too many goals<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> having <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> at the back, and them being so solid, only highlights City’s issues more. Van Dijk and Alisson have been a big part of changing <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to an exciting goalscoring team to a less vulnerable team. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> saw where they could tighten up and you can see the difference now<br /><br />Brazilians weren’t renowned for their goalkeepers in the past but now you have Alisson and <a href="ederson.html">Ederson</a>, who are up there with the best goalkeepers in the world. <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a> is still among the top keepers for me. <a href="ben-foster.html">Ben Foster</a> at <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> is older but he can keep his level and desire to stay at the top of his game. I have enjoyed watching <a href="dean-henderson.html">Dean Henderson</a> at Sheffield United; he has done brilliantly. But when you are coaching goalkeepers, you should always encourage them to learn from the best. You can coach them on the training pitch all day but it is important that they watch other top goalkeepers. So, right now, you invariably get them to look at the two Brazilians at the top of the Premier League<br /><br />A lot of people would look at Pep as the top dog. Pep puts a lot of demand on players and he is the mastermind in my eyes. But, of course, there’s also <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>. He’s top of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> now and he is very charismatic, so, from a player’s perspective, you would want to play for him. <b>[Marcelo]</b> <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Bielsa</a> in the Championship is excellent too, so, as a coach, you look at all these different managers and you try and learn from them. If you are a manager, you have to bring your own personality to the table. That’s what Pep and <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> both do. They both place massive demands on their teams but have different ways of getting the best out of people. That’s the biggest thing in the game: man-management; getting the players to follow you</p>

  <p><b>[Shay Given says <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>? <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Koulibaly</a>? <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> could emulate <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> with right signings]</b> It will take a few years. But with the right building blocks, the right recruitment and the right people in charge, then there will definitely be clubs looking over their shoulders. It’s possibly harder now compared to City with the financial fair play. I think they’ve tightened up since <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> have come in. But <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> have a decent team. If they add four, five, six really good players to that they could be in the top six or seven. Then if they add another six or seven players, they can get up there eventually. <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> already have the stadium. The city would be buzzing and the fans would be queuing out the gate to get in. Once you get one or two big names in the door, then there’s a few more thinking, ‘If he’s joining, I want to go as well’. It’s exciting hearing about some of the players maybe coming to the club. <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> got a mention the other day, <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Kalidou Koulibaly</a> too.</p>
