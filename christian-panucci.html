  <p><b>[Former Real Madrid defender Christian Panucci hopes that new coach Santiago Solari will achieve as much as Zinedine Zidane]</b> Zidane won three Champions Leagues! When you do that, you must be good. I hope Solari has that, and that he wins as much as Zizou. When a young coach does things right it is good for everybody. It is easier to train Real Madrid than Roma or Albania. He has a great chance to do a good job. He won four games and was given a contract until 2021. He has to take a chance, because it is a great opportunity. We have already seen what Zizou did with a really good squad. It is always easier in that case than if you have average players.<br /><br /><b>[a 3-0 defeat at the hands of Eibar]</b> I am in total agreement. When you lose against Eibar you are the one who has to react. This is the easiest game for a coach. You are coming off a defeat, so it is easy, with the pride that Madrid and Roma have. The coach does not have to say anything until the game, just pick his team and that’s it. He does not need to say anything else to the players<br /><br />That is a tough one to answer! Madrid is Madrid, I carry them in my heart with great pride. I have a lot of friends there. What I won with Real Madrid, the ‘seventh’ <b>[Champions League title]</b>, how the fans treated me. I played eight years at Roma and that is something special too. In any case I see the game differently now: I look at tactics, movement in order to learn something. It is a great game, because both go into it wounded. Madrid lost 3-0 against Eibar, and that hurts a lot. And Roma lost to Udinese. Tuesday is not about coaches, it is about players. They have to give the best of themselves</p>
