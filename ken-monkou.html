<blockquote>
  <p>[Diego Costa was Chelsea’s Didier Drogba or Zlatan Ibrahimovic] In any team you need a figurehead - a player who leads you in battle and creates problems for the ­opposition, and Costa was that player for Chelsea. He was Chelsea’s Didier Drogba or Zlatan Ibrahimovic - a player with a presence, charisma and aura around him on the pitch. Costa, Drogba and Ibra are players that set themselves apart ­because of their stature. And if you have someone like that in your team you are already one up against the opposition. Of course Chelsea have Eden Hazard, Willian, N’Golo Kante and Pedro, who are all top ­quality players. But in someone like Diego Costa you have a player who is an unknown quantity. Simply by being in the team his sheer presence will be a ­problem for opponents. When he played, Costa deflected attention away from team-mates like Hazard and Willian. He often occupied two or three players because you simply couldn’t take the risk of leaving him alone. Having someone like that leading the attack is a huge boost for the rest of the players and since he left to go back to Atletico Madrid, Chelsea haven’t had that kind of figurehead - and they have missed him. Alvaro Morata has come in and I do like him as a player. He’s got plenty of qualities, especially in the air where he is very strong. But Morata doesn’t have that same air of menace this season that Costa gave Chelsea… they haven’t carried the same threat without him.<br /><br />[Monkou added on a revolving door policy was has seen the Blues have 10 managers in the last decade] Maybe this time Chelsea will have to go back to the drawing board and look again at what they are trying to achieve and what they want. Changing the manager regularly usually creates instability and ­uncertainty but in Chelsea’s case they have been successful doing it winning three League titles, the Champions League, Europa League, three FA Cups and a League Cup in the last 10 years</p>
