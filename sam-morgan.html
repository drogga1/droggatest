<blockquote>
  <p>PAUL POGBA was seen hobbling around on crutches and with his foot in a cast ahead of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s clash against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. The £89million midfielder did not recover from a foot injury in time for the <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> fixture. And he needed a crutch to help him get round with his right foot heavily bandaged<br /><br /><a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> has gone on a social media blitz to assure fans he is doing all he can to return as quickly as possible. The 26-year-old posted a video of himself working out on an exercise bike while in Dubai. And he took to Instagram to picture himself working hard with a medicine ball with the simple message ‘almost there’. It was a clear attempt to indicate to the United fanbase that he is still fully committed to the cause amid speculation once again over his future.<br /><br /><a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> had been given permission from <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> to continue his rehabilitation work from an injury which had troubled him for a while. The United boss revealed <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> had been carrying the injury during the matches against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and Rochdale, so he was cleared to enjoy a break in the sunshine - where he bumped into <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>. The Real manager has refused to reveal what they were talking about, insisting it was a private conversation, but it has only served to once again increase rumours the United star could be looking for a move to the Bernabeu<br /><br /><a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>’s arrival on crutches came at roughly the same time a plane flew over <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> with a banner demanding <a href="edward-woodward.html">Ed Woodward</a> leave the club. And before that supporters marched to <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> from the Tollgate pub in Manchester with a banner saying: ‘Glazers Out. <a href="edward-woodward.html">Woodward</a> Out. Over £1b stolen from MUFC’</p>
