  <p><b>[Arjen Robben talks with Fox Sports about his summer move to the German club from Spanish giants <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> in 2009]</b> It was a bit of a weird summer with the return of <a href="florentino-perez.html">Florentino Perez</a> as president.

I had possibly my best pre-season ever, but I still did not get a chance, so I had to make a decision. There was contact with Bayern, but it was a difficult decision, the most difficult one of my career. Bayern were not among the European elite at that moment – like we are now – and it was a step back for me. I went for it in the end, because the club did everything within their power to sign me.

  <p><b>[Arjen Robben announces his retirement from international football]</b> The man of glass has lasted the longest. I’ve been thinking about it for a long time. I have already considered it for a while, but then I went on. I wanted to finish this qualification. I’m 33 years old now. I’m playing at a top club in Europe and I want to concentrate on it now. It’s also a good time to hand over the baton. I still feel very good and want to be at the top as long as possible. I am very proud and honoured at my six tournaments. The most beautiful moments for me were the World Cups of 2010 and 2014, in which we were really a close team and a close group. But there are many beautiful moments, fourteen years is a long time</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich &amp; Netherlands legend Arjen Robben announces retirement]</b> I have been thinking a lot over the past few weeks. As everyone knows, I took the time to make an informed decision about my future after my last Bayern Munich match. And I decided to put an end to my career as a professional football player. It is without doubt the hardest decision I have had to make in my career. A decision where heart and mind collided. The love for the game and the conviction that you can still handle the whole world, as opposed to the reality that not everything runs the way you want and you are no longer the 16-year-old boy who had no idea what an injury meant. At the moment I am fit and healthy and as a fan of many other sports I would like to keep it that way for the future. I will therefore stop definitively, but it is good that way</p>

  <p><b>[Only one more campaign in Real Madrid would follow for Robben however with the arrival of Ronaldo among others leaving the Dutchman on the outer]</b> It was not just Ronaldo. Perez returned as the club’s president. He then bought Ronaldo but also Kaka, Benzema and Xabi Alonso. Real spent so much money and we were told that they needed to make a bit of money back on outgoing transfers<br /><br /><b>[Humbly bowing to the star power that surrounded him, Robben happily moved to Bayern. In the 2012 Champions League final against Chelsea, the winger infamously had an extra-time penalty saved with his former team ultimately triumphing in a shootout. Back in the decider the following year, Robben returned with a vengeance and after setting up the opener, scored an 89th-minute winner as Bayern beat bitter rivals Borussia Dortmund 2-1]</b> For a moment I could not believe what was happening in our own stadium. I was shocked<br /><br /><b>[Incidentally, playing for his native Netherlands remains one of his crowning achievements, despite the fact he never lifted a trophy with the Oranje]</b> It might be a cliche, but there really is no better thing than playing for your own country. In the end, I decided to quit in 2017 after 96 international caps. I got to play six big tournaments and was the captain during my last years with the team. All together, it’s an unforgettable time that I’ll always cherish<br /><br /><b>[As one of the more intelligent footballers that have graced the pitch over the past two decades, Robben’s confirmation that he was hanging up his boots had a rather poetic feel to it]</b> It’s July again. The time for a soccer player to be preparing for the next season. Not me. I’ve used the last couple of weeks to think things through. As everybody knows I took some time after my last match for Bayern Munich to make up my mind for the future. And now I have decided to end my career as a professional player. This has been without a doubt the hardest decision I have had to make in my career. A decision in which ‘heart’ and ‘head’ bumped into each other. The love for the game and the conviction that you can still take over the world versus the reality that it doesn’t always go like you want it to and that you’re no longer a 16-year-old boy who doesn’t know what it’s like to be injured</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich legend Arjen Robben considers Pep Guardiola to sit above the likes of Jose Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti when it comes to the best coach he has worked with]</b> ‘s difficult, of course. But if you ask me who was the best, I say Pep Guardiola. I enjoyed it most with him. Football-wise, he is simply brilliant. When Pep came, I was already 30 years old. You’re just trying to stay constant and not get any worse. But under him I got better again. I suddenly played in different positions where I never thought that I would play. He was the best<br /><br />I got a very nice call from Brazzo <b>[Hasan Salihamidzic]</b>, he told me Coutinho wanted the 10. I replied that I only want the best for the club and if the 10 is good for him, that’s great and they have to do it. Coutinho is a world-class player, he will certainly help the club. A super transfer. He will need some time, but with his skills he will go for it<br /><br /><b>[He is looking forward to enjoy a relaxing break after escaping the demands of professional football]</b> The decision to stop was very, very difficult for me. But in the end, I think it’s the right one. I want to rest and spend more time with the family. It’s also good to have nothing to do with football if you’ve lived as a professional for so long. After a while we’ll have a look. I started as a pro at the age of 16, and your life is football for 24 hours a day. The family had to join in and now it’s time to repay them. We took full advantage of the holiday. Now the children go back to school and then everyday life starts again</p>

I do not rate the chances <b>[of returning]</b> very highly<br /><br /><b>[He said of retiring]</b> It’s without a doubt the hardest decision I’ve ever made in my career<br /><br /><b>[On announcing his decision in July]</b> At the moment I am fit and healthy and as a fan of many other sports I want to keep it that way for the future.

With this virus, it is a very strange time for everyone and when football returns, then now! But maybe it always stays a bit in there. I’m just an athlete.<br /><br />I missed a lot of games, I was just busy. I’ve never been able to plan anything privately. When you’re retired, nobody is waiting for you but you need something that is worth getting up for. In my case, that is my children</p>

He focused on attack and total ball control. Of course, I particularly liked that. We were on the same wavelength. He made sure that I became more complete. For me, Pep is the best coach in the world. The three years with him in Munich were extremely instructive.<br /><br />Back then, my only wish was to win the Champions League and Bayern was not one of the top clubs in Europe. But I took the risk and it was worth it. It was really not an easy decision for me at the time. But going to Bayern was the best of my career in retrospect</p>

  <p><b>[Arjen Robben has hinted he could make a return to football but has ruled out playing for <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> again]</b> I have to disappoint you. My comeback at Bayern is a hundred percent impossible<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he could start playing again]</b> You never know. I don’t want to say yes or no now. For me and my family, the move to Holland is due at the end of the month. We’ll see everything else. In any case, I will always stay connected to Bayern<br /><br />I train two to three times a week with head of fitness Dr. Holger Broich and I would like to continue doing so. We do runs, sprints and also work with the ball. I really enjoy it and I want to stay fit. I am very grateful to the club for giving me the opportunity to do this training. In the past few months, however, I have always been seen at Bayern’s training centre<br /><br />My fitness levels are very good. Staying fit after retirement is very important to me. I also wanted to run a marathon this year, which unfortunately did not work due to the coronavirus crisis. As far as I can tell, I haven’t put on weight yet. So everything is fine with me. I feel very good at the moment. I also notice clearly that pressure has dropped from me. There are days when I train very intensively in my free time. If it starts to hurt in the body, I give myself a break and only train again when I am free of pain. This is definitely a difference from my playing career. He and all the other talents at Bayern should never be satisfied with themselves. Joshua has to want to improve every day, set a new goal every day and never be fed up. It is also important that he reflects on his performance again and again. The fact that he was always in the squad recently shows that <a href="hansi-flick.html">Hansi Flick</a> is satisfied with his development, but it will be very important that he plays regularly. I wish Joshua only the very best for the future</p>

  <p><b>[Arjen Robben has announced a stunning return to professional football with his first club, Groningen]</b> I was 12 years old when I started playing in Groningen’s youth academy, I made my home debut against Feyenoord when I was 16. After two years I made a transfer to <a href="psv.html">PSV Eindhoven</a>. After a wonderful adventure of 18 years we’re coming home! Back to Groningen. We’re coming home during this difficult time of crisis, one that also hits FC Groningen. It’s great to see how everyone is supporting the club, I’ve supported the club as well and it made me think about what else I could do for our club. These past weeks I’ve had many conversations with club staff and maybe more than anything I’ve listened to the call of our supporters: Arjen, follow your heart!<br /><br />I want to make my comeback as a football player, a player of FC Groningen. It started to itch and now it’s my mission. I’m working on a comeback as a player, at FC. I don’t know yet whether or not this will work, but I do know it will not depend on my commitment or motivation. It is my dream to wear the kit of FC Groningen again. It will be a tough physical challenge but I’m going for it! I am going to work hard and when everything feels right, I will join the team for the first training session of the new season. I hope to see everyone as soon as possible because my dream is to play in an FC Groningen jersey. We’re not there yet, but one can dream!</p>

I haven’t set any goals, it could be over in a month or it could last two years<br /><br /><b>[On his wife’s support for the decision to come out of retirement]</b> It made the decision a lot easier knowing I had the support of my family. Retiring was the toughest decision of my career, maybe a little forced upon me with all the injuries. We decided to stay a year in Munich to enjoy the city and get used to the idea of not playing football. I didn’t watch much for about six months and really enjoyed doing other things. Eventually the sports lover in you starts to nag and I had been training to run the Rotterdam Marathon before the coronavirus crisis</p>
