  <p><b>[Arjen Robben announces his retirement from international football]</b> The man of glass has lasted the longest. I’ve been thinking about it for a long time. I have already considered it for a while, but then I went on. I wanted to finish this qualification. I’m 33 years old now. I’m playing at a top club in Europe and I want to concentrate on it now. It’s also a good time to hand over the baton. I still feel very good and want to be at the top as long as possible. I am very proud and honoured at my six tournaments. The most beautiful moments for me were the World Cups of 2010 and 2014, in which we were really a close team and a close group. But there are many beautiful moments, fourteen years is a long time</p>

And then I and the club have to decide if and how it goes on.<br /><br />That’s exactly the topic of discussion in my home, at the kitchen table. When I talk to my family or to my friends. It is now a point where I have to make decisions. A few years ago, that was usually relatively clear, but the end is approaching and there are so many things to consider - this is not easy, but it is exciting. There are many possibilities open. Some things I’ve already checked off in my head, but they will stay with me<br /><br />From time to time I train the team of my son, that’s a lot of fun. But to say that one day I want to be a head coach at the highest level, I find that difficult. I see every day what stress there is, what kind of pressure. I have been playing for 18 years and the pressure on coaches has got bigger all the time. That raises the question: Do I really need that? I really do not know if I feel like it</p>

  <p><b>[Arjen Robben has revealed that he would have joined Manchester United over Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea in 2004 had Sir Alex Ferguson asked him to]</b> I had a very good conversation with <b>[Ferguson]</b> over dinner in Manchester and we spoke about football and life. I also went and had a good look around the training ground and everything was good. But after I went back to PSV nothing happened. There was no real contact and the deal didn’t happen. PSV were also negotiating with Chelsea at that time, so maybe they offered PSV more money? I don’t really know. I spoke to Chelsea and I liked their plans. We had one meeting and everything was done pretty quickly. Had Manchester United offered me a deal straight after I met them, I would have signed there, but it didn’t happen and I’ve got no regrets..<br /><br /><b>[On Jose Maurinho]</b> He was really demanding and intense, but at that age I think it was good for me and my football development. I am a student and someone who wants to improve and work hard, so I think our personalities were a good fit. Mourinho was a good man-manager and he gave me a lot of confidence. For a manager, it’s difficult if a player is injured because you can’t count on him, so I could understand it a little bit. But it’s worse for a player - you want to be enjoying your football. Jose is a winner and wants strong players. I felt so much confidence from him when I was fit, but injuries created a bit of a struggle</p>

  <p><b>[Arjen Robben didn’t think he’d be with Bayern Munich for a decade]</b> No, I don’t think so - but then again, yes. I’m always a realist, and I know the world of football is fast-moving. It could have been different.<br /><br />After my debut as a pro for Groningen I was at Eindhoven for two years. It was a big step for me in the Netherlands: to leave home at the age of 18. I went abroad when I was 20, three years at Chelsea, a big club. Then two years at Madrid. Then Bayern approached me and I made the decision. I was skeptical at the beginning, I didn’t know whether it was the right decision. I can now say: it was the best decision in my career<br /><br />We’re on a good path but of course there’s room for improvement. We haven’t been working with the full squad for a long time, a big part only joined at the Tegernsee Lake. There’s room for improvement, now we need match practice. But we’re still ready for the Bundesliga restart<br /><br /><b>[When asked what he’d like the headline to be at the end of the season]</b> It was a superb season from Bayern. They won everything there was to win. The played outstanding football, beating everyone</p>

  <p><b>[Ajren Robben says that he is enjoying his time with Bayern Munich]</b> I’m 34 now, and I just try to enjoy every moment. Sometimes it hits you how lucky you are to be able to play here, at a full Allianz Arena. You just have to enjoy it. I don’t know how long it’ll last, but I don’t feel like I’m 34 right now. I feel very, very fit. Hopefully it’ll stay that way for a long time. Then I can enjoy playing. I always try to do that. Then you can be successful.<br /><br />It’s the Champions League, it’s a totally different ball game. We have to keep going our way, but there’s always room for improvement. We played well in the first half against Leverkusen and also worked hard off the ball. In the second half, we eased off a bit. We have to watch out for misplaced passes; teams like Benfica can be very dangerous in the transition. We have a lot of quality and creativity going forward. We have to work hard defensively, only then will be be successful</p>

  <p><b>[Hungry Robben wants Bayern to learn from mistakes]</b> I don’t know whether this could be my last chance to win the Champions League; time will tell. Either way, it is another chance to win it. Our goal is obviously to go as far as possible. But we are only just about to start the group stages. We want to take things one step at a time and ensure we progress to the knockout stages.<br /><br />You always have to learn from what went wrong in the past. You have to analyse where you can improve. Games in the latter stages of the Champions League get decided by small details. Sometimes you have to point the finger at yourself, but sometimes things happen that are outside your own influence sphere. But you always have to take things that happen on board and learn from them<br /><br />It’s great for Dutch football to have two teams in the mix again. There are some positive developments again, with the national team, but also with PSV and Ajax and that is great to see. Dutch football has struggled a bit in recent years, in European club football, but also the national team. Things are now looking good again, though. We should not get carried away, but I am happy to see that things are on the rise again. I enjoy watching a team like Ajax, they played some nice football to qualify. The same goes for PSV, so that pleases me<br /><br />It’s not like we are already talking about specific players. We play so many games and are not thinking about Ajax yet. We had a Bundesliga match at the weekend and then Benfica next. But when the game against Ajax is coming up, I am sure my team-mates will be asking about De Jong and De Ligt and I can then give a positive update</p>

We do not have to change much<br /><br />I think it’s a good thing the way the table is looking right now. It’s what everyone wanted. A few years ago it was said that everything was so boring with Bayern, but I’m not worried. Just because you’re winning doesn’t mean everything is going well. By the same token, it doesn’t mean some things aren’t going to plan when you’re not. I’m sure it’s all in the small details. We need to play with passion, move the ball better, bring back the surprise element and start dominating the opposition again</p>

You have to know what they are planning with you. If Van Gaal and Van Bommel had not been here, I do not know if I would have come here. It was important that they were here. Maybe it sounds like Bayern would not have been for me otherwise, but that’s football. For me, the right people were here at the right time and that’s why I made that decision. It was also good for the club, I think. I also said that was the most important decision of my career.<br /><br /><b>[On Pep Guardiola]</b> He was a super tactical tactician and I really enjoyed working with him. To be challenged and how he thinks about football, what he demands from his players. But without saying, one must always be careful that others were not good there. Not at all. But he is outstanding, he is really so good and as I said, you will be challenged. I also played on other positions under him, not just right winger. I used to play as the number nine, but also ten behind the striker or even as a midfielder. Once even as a right-back in a five-string</p>

It would be different if someone said it wasn’t going well any-more and I had to stop. I think it’s better this way. It’s good. It’s a bit strange. We’re already talking about saying goodbye but the team has plenty of ambition and I do as well.

I also got some offers. The money on show is so crazy that you at least have to consider it. They are offering maybe four, five or six times the amounts you get at a big club.

The whole package has to be right, not just in a footballing sense but also for my family. The easiest thing to do would be to stop. That is also an option for me, but I’m not sure whether I will do that</p>
