  <p><b>[Arjen Robben says politics at Real Madrid, and not just <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>’s arrival, forced him to suffer a ‘difficult’ exit from the club]</b> It became difficult for me because of the change of president at Real. I actually felt very comfortable there and played very well, but when politics come into play and you do not get a real chance, you have to make a decision whether you want to keep fighting or to go and continue your career elsewhere.

You will never know what would have happened if everyone had been fit. Back then we were so strong that there was certainly more possible. I am really sorry that it did not work. Some say Pep was not successful in Munich because he did not win the Champions League. I do not represent this opinion. Under Pep we played wonderful football and were three times in the Champions League semi-final. I know that coaches are also judged on titles, but I’m someone who looks outside the box. Football is not always fair<br /><br /><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> have got no further than the last four in Europe since <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> departed in 2016]</b> No. If you play permanently at such a high level, you are spoiled.

And I decided to put an end to my career as a professional football player. It is without doubt the hardest decision I have had to make in my career. A decision where heart and mind collided.

All together, it’s an unforgettable time that I’ll always cherish<br /><br /><b>[As one of the more intelligent footballers that have graced the pitch over the past two decades, Robben’s confirmation that he was hanging up his boots had a rather poetic feel to it]</b> It’s July again.

As everybody knows I took some time after my last match for <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> to make up my mind for the future.

But in the end, I think it’s the right one. I want to rest and spend more time with the family. It’s also good to have nothing to do with football if you’ve lived as a professional for so long. After a while we’ll have a look. I started as a pro at the age of 16, and your life is football for 24 hours a day. The family had to join in and now it’s time to repay them.
