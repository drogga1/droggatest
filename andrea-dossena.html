Also, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have no economic problems and therefore the deal would be within the reach of the English club<br /><br />I don’t think there’s anyone better, there won’t be another partnership like it. I think at 28 he’s a great age, he’s got good pace, he’s strong, he’s a leader. I think he walks straight into <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s line up and he makes them harder to beat, he makes them a physical presence. You wouldn’t want to play against Van Dijk or <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Koulibaly</a> - how on earth as a striker do you even think about getting any joy out of those two?</p>
