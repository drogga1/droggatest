  <p><b>[<a href="jonathan-wilson.html">Jonathan Wilson</a>, in <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Johan Cruyff</a>’s legacy? The whole of modern football]</b> <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> the player was gloriously impudent, a slight and graceful genius who proved that brain could outmanoeuvre brawn. Watching his Netherlands dart and thrust their way around Uruguay or Argentina in 1974, or seeing his <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> outwit <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> in the European Cup final in 1973, was to see a devastating puppet-master toying with lumbering opponents. <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> the coach, <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> the manager, was able to retain that sense of the joy of the game, the importance of beauty and, what’s harder, to convey that sense to his players. There has never been such a great player who was also such a great manager. In that he stands utterly unique<br /><br />There may have been better players in the history of the game, though I doubt you can count them on more than one hand. And there may have been better managers, too, if only because his coaching career only lasted 10 and a half years (during which he won 14 trophies, not a bad return). But it’s tough to argue that any man has exerted a greater influence – on the pitch and on the bench – on the game as we know it today.<br /><br />You can separate <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a>’s history into BCE (Before <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> Era) and CE (Cruyff Era). And, yes, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a> are still, nearly 20 years after he coached his final game for the club, still very much in the <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> Era</p>
