  <p><b>[Jurgen Klinsmann’s son Jonathan earns Hertha contract]</b> This morning, <a href="michael-preetz.html">Michael Preetz</a> asked me to have a chat with him after breakfast. He told me a decision had been taken regarding my contract with Hertha. It was an unbelievably emotional moment for me, because this club has so much history in my family. I’m looking forward to getting to know the club more, the city of Berlin and taking on new challenges in Germany</p>

  <p><b>[Jonathan Klinsmann makes penalty save in pro debut with Hertha Berlin]</b> It was definitely crazy. I don’t know how else to describe it. First starting XI, Europa League, the whole thing. It was just crazy. At the time, I was just nervous. A couple of days before the game and you start thinking and overthinking. I didn’t know what to think<br /><br />I just told myself, most of these guys go left so if I go and I have a feeling, just go 100 per cent to that corner and it worked. Getting my first game, it’s a whole different atmosphere if you’re a goalkeeper. I have a lot of close relationships with the guys in the second team and then to get this win and you saw they were grateful for the save and happy for you and the team, it was great to see</p>
