  <p><b>[Tan Sri Annuar Musa revealed his decision to withdraw from the contest, citing the need for harmony among the FAM executive committee <b>[exco]</b> of the coming term]</b> What good will it do if a house is built but the work is not finished? When the winners’ authority is questioned and the losers mocked. If that happens there will not be harmony in Malaysia’s footballing fraternity. Improvement cannot take place, instead it will be a step back, from bad to worse. Therefore I’ve contemplated carefully and decided to let the other <b>[presidential]</b> candidate, the Crown Prince of Johor <b>[Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim]</b> to win unopposed and be announced as the new FAM president.<br /><br />The commitment and determination shown by TMJ can be an important asset to FAM. The support and consent of His Royal Highness the Sultan of Johor is also a tribute to Malaysian football. Thus TMJ should be given the best possible opportunity to improve Malaysian football and to fulfill all his promises. I too on 16th November <b>[2016]</b> had sent an SMS to TMJ suggesting that he takes over the presidency. At that time I promised to make efforts so that he would run unopposed. Today I fulfill that promise<br /><br />I will now focus my attention towards the Kelantan team, especially to help the team improve its grassroots football program in order to produce more young talents, which have always been the foundation for the development of the Red Warriors. In addition, my main task is to repay the trust of the people of my area <b>[the Ketereh parliamentary seat in Kelantan]</b>, as well as my role as the national information chief of UMNO, in preparation for the 14th general election, God willing</p>

  <p><b>[The consultant of Kelantan, Tan Sri Annuar Musa has slammed Football Malaysia Limited &amp; Liability Partnership over its threat to deduct points as punishment]</b> I hope in this new era of FMLLP, it would be wiser in managing the league. They must understand that the teams that join the league give life to FAM, but the teams themselves are in a lot of problem. Teams have to find sponsor money from government agencies, spending at least RM15 million to RM20 million in order to win a prize money amounting to less than RM2 million! Points deduction is more of a threat and punishment, and it is not helping at all<br /><br />We have become a source to make life easier for FAM and FMLLP so it is better for us not to join the league at all if they keep punishing us instead of solving the issues and finding the real cause. Nobody wants to stay in debt or fail to pay the salaries. There is a big factor here which sooner or later other teams in the league will suffer as well if we don’t solve it</p>

  <p><b>[Kelantan are close to signing another foreign player, after having signed Lebanon international Abou Bakr Al-Mel one week earlier]</b> Abou Bakr will be partnered with L’Imam Seydi whereby Seydi will take up the position left by <b>[Mohammed]</b> Ghaddar, while Abou Bakr will play in his preferred role; attacking midfielder/backup striker.<br /><br />With Danso <b>[defender Mamadou Danso]</b>, Gomis <b>[midfielder Morgaro Gomis]</b>, Bakr and Seydi, Alfredo will produce a more formidable Red Warriors, god willing</p>

  <p><b>[Kelantan advisor Tan Sri Annuar Musa has issued a vindictive response towards several parties’ negative reactions to Kelantan’s signing of new foreign players]</b> I would like to warn those who claim to be professionals but display no professionalism whatsoever. They choose to write on social media without any sense of responsibility and without checking the facts and regulations. They need to shut up if talking is the only thing they are good at.<br /><br />The change of players does not necessarily incur extra cost, especially if the team have deals with the agents regarding the players’ performance and fitness level. The change of players in order to improve performance is part of the effort the team’s cashflow. It is done with consideration to a detailed cost-benefit analysis. Shut up if you’ve never run a professional team and have never been in the position of responsibility to raise money to pay footballers. Stop pretending to be professionals if wage-earners is all you are.<br /><br />To ex-players who are on Facebook/Twitter all the time, we have tolerated your uncalled-for behaviour long enough. The act of issuing inaccurate statements regarding the team is a breach of contract. If you do not respect that term, the team deserve the right to not show any sympathy to you</p>

  <p><b>[Tan Sri Annuar Musa has criticised certain team officials for neglecting their duties, with regards to player movement in the current transfer window]</b> Alessandro Celin’s departure has long been planned by KAFA, and he has been notified since April. His agent Mr. Gibby has also been told to find his replacement with the same budget.<br /><br />Zahasmi too has acknowledged the change. The candidate for the replacement had to be kept a secret until May 25 2017, our Super League match against Pulau Pinang. If anyone thought that I made the decisions on my own, then they are gravely mistaken. The discussions have been conducted together with several KAFA officials and the agents involved. The same goes with the matter of the head coach, it was Zahasmi’s request. We kept it to ourselves, asked him to proceed and handed the matter to him. Even before Ghaddar’s departure <b>[to JDT]</b>, KAFA’s top management, agents and sponsors have discussed the plans for his absence. We have long worked quietly on the plans. Only those who have ‘fallen asleep’ were left behind and grumbled. And not everything we do must be shared with the media.<br /><br />Only a few are working tirelessly for the Red Warriors. Many are only looking to take advantage while shirking their responsibilities, and have their own <b>[hidden]</b> agenda. I have let them be for a long time as football in Kelantan would have not grown if they were to be depended upon. They celebrate when the Red Warriors and KAFA are in problem as that is their chance to scheme. If Kelantan succeed they have to hold their tongue and pretend to be happy. What they are waiting for is the next crisis so they can sow their seeds, and their real target is me!</p>

  <p><b>[FMLLP has claimed that Kelantan have not discussed any payment plans with it and the relevant parties, in order to justify its mid-season signings]</b> After going through the teams’ appeals, FMLLP then lifted T-Team and Perlis’ transfer embargoes and reduced the deductions from six points to three, while ATM’s case is still being reviewed.<br /><br />On the matter of KAFA <b>[Kelantan FA]</b> which is facing financial issues, they should have been in touch with FMLLP to clarify the matter, after which FMLLP will definitely assist and assess their case. However, KAFA has not shown any effort to resolve the matter. KAFA should also discuss the matter of a payment plan with KWSP <b>[Employees’ Provident Fund]</b>, Perkeso <b>[Social Security Organisation]</b> and LHDN <b>[Inland Revenue Board]</b>, after which FMLLP will evaluate the matter</p>

  <p><b>[Kelantan advisor Tan Sri Annuar Musa has offered a payment scheme to former players owed money by the team]</b> As a way to assist <b>[the payment]</b>, we the <b>[Kelantan]</b> sponsors have volunteered to offer a settlement scheme to all local and foreign players owed money by the Kelantan FA <b>[KAFA]</b>. Players or officials who agree to provide a 50 percent discount to KAFA will be paid the remaining amounts in cash, within 30 days of them providing us with the written agreement.<br /><br />A number of sponsors have agreed to assist in paying the 2017 squad’s wages for June <b>[which is supposed to be paid in July]</b> earlier, so the players can celebrate Aidilfitri. The wages for May too will be paid at the same time on June 20 2017, in a breaking of fast event which will be held in Seri Puri Bukit Marak. This means there are no overdue wages for the 2017 season!</p>

  <p><b>[Kelantan main advisor and funder Tan Sri Annuar Musa has promised to settle the club’s unpaid wages to former players and officials by the end of this year]</b> We will work out a schedule for the payments so the debts can be paid as demanded by FMLLP <b>[M-League organiser Football Malaysia LLP]</b>. The Employees Provident Fund arrears amounting to RM300,000 and debts to government agencies have also been discussed. The debts we incurred in 2016 will be settled.<br /><br />Imam’s signing is important to the Red Warriors, in order to strengthen our attack. I will fight to the very end to ensure that Kelantan remain in the Super League and avoid relegation</p>
