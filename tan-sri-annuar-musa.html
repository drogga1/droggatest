<blockquote>
  <p>[Tan Sri Annuar Musa revealed his decision to withdraw from the contest, citing the need for harmony among the FAM executive committee [exco] of the coming term] What good will it do if a house is built but the work is not finished? When the winners’ authority is questioned and the losers mocked. If that happens there will not be harmony in Malaysia’s footballing fraternity. Improvement cannot take place, instead it will be a step back, from bad to worse. Therefore I’ve contemplated carefully and decided to let the other [presidential] candidate, the Crown Prince of Johor [Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim] to win unopposed and be announced as the new FAM president.<br /><br />The commitment and determination shown by TMJ can be an important asset to FAM. The support and consent of His Royal Highness the Sultan of Johor is also a tribute to Malaysian football. Thus TMJ should be given the best possible opportunity to improve Malaysian football and to fulfill all his promises. I too on 16th November [2016] had sent an SMS to TMJ suggesting that he takes over the presidency. At that time I promised to make efforts so that he would run unopposed. Today I fulfill that promise<br /><br />I will now focus my attention towards the Kelantan team, especially to help the team improve its grassroots football program in order to produce more young talents, which have always been the foundation for the development of the Red Warriors. In addition, my main task is to repay the trust of the people of my area [the Ketereh parliamentary seat in Kelantan], as well as my role as the national information chief of UMNO, in preparation for the 14th general election, God willing</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The consultant of Kelantan, Tan Sri Annuar Musa has slammed Football Malaysia Limited &amp; Liability Partnership over its threat to deduct points as punishment] I hope in this new era of FMLLP, it would be wiser in managing the league. They must understand that the teams that join the league give life to FAM, but the teams themselves are in a lot of problem. Teams have to find sponsor money from government agencies, spending at least RM15 million to RM20 million in order to win a prize money amounting to less than RM2 million! Points deduction is more of a threat and punishment, and it is not helping at all<br /><br />We have become a source to make life easier for FAM and FMLLP so it is better for us not to join the league at all if they keep punishing us instead of solving the issues and finding the real cause. Nobody wants to stay in debt or fail to pay the salaries. There is a big factor here which sooner or later other teams in the league will suffer as well if we don’t solve it</p>
