  <p>[Last year was tough for MLS fans in Northern California] Last year was so difficult because even when we played well, we found ways to lose. At the end of the season, we were just defeated. There was very little hope, very little motivation. Getting a new coach to come in and change the mentality has given us hope.</p>

  <p>[San Jose Earthquakes understanding what Matias Almeyda is asking ahead of 2019 season] At first, it was really awkward, but when we spent those 17 days in Mexico it became kind of fun. Everyone downloaded the app Duolingo. All the guys are trying to learn Spanish, all the Spanish-speakers are trying to learn English. We have these Spanglish conversations that are funny. It’s worked out well. And Agustin, our translator, does an amazing job of keeping up with how fast Matias talks and how fast he coaches. It’s been a much smoother transition than I had expected.<br /><br />I think there’s definitely a learning curve with every new coach, with every new system. Our hope is that we pick it up quickly, but what we’ve loved is that when we weren’t very successful with it in the preseason, he’s not the type of guy that’s going to say, “OK, let’s change it. That didn’t work. Let’s do something else.’ He’s confident in his system, he knows it works, he knows if we do it correctly, it’ll pay dividends<br /><br />I’m not going to lie to you, the team’s losing mentality was not right. I heard a lot of excuses every game. It was a weird environment because it seemed that we gave up on the season. This is a completely new team right now with the new group of coaches who have a completely different mentality, a winning mentality. They’re trying to give us information, a winning mentality</p>
