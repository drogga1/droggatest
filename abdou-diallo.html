  <p><b>[Diallo spoke about the possibility of joining Les Parisiens last week]</b> A young player in Europe who tells you that PSG’s project is not interesting is not credible, it’s a nice project. It’s a form of acknowledging my accomplishment to hear that, but without wanting to resort to the worn-out phrases of footballers, I have a contract. So far I have not been told that I have to go. I don’t want to make a big fuss. We have to see if the vision is the same. And once we are all on the same wavelength, we make a decision. I am waiting to see, to hear what the people have to say to me, what they think of me<br /><br /><b>[His position in the side has come under threat however, with former club captain <a href="mats-hummels.html">Mats Hummels</a> returning to Signal Iduna Park last month from reigning champions Bayern Munich]</b> He is a historical player of the club, the country and he will bring us experience. In addition, I think he is another serious competitor. You have to see it as a challenge</p>

  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain have signed Abdou Diallo from Borussia Dortmund]</b> It is a great honour to be involved with such a prestigious club as Paris Saint-Germain. I have always said that the Parisian project was very attractive. Joining the capital club is another important step in my career. I am committed to giving my all for my new club and look forward to bringing my qualities and desire to this team renowned for its high quality and high ambitions</p>

  <p><b>[Abdou Diallo says Kylian Mbappe has become a real killer in front of goal]</b> He grew up, he gained a bit of weight. But he is the same. Of course, he is more mature. Now, we can talk about more things with him. When I was in Monaco, he was very, very young. But he is still the same. In the game, he is becoming a real killer. He didn’t have those qualities when he left Monaco, even if he scored many goals for Monaco. Now, he is very accurate</p>
