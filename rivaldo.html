  <p><b>[Why can’t <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> score free kicks any more?]</b> When you are in a difficult time, you sometimes go back to your training and make technical changes to get through it. The best players, like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and <b>[Lionel]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, have amazing skills, but they train hard too.

But there are many coaches who do not like these players because they detract from the coach himself, so they prefer to talk about these players as if they do not know how to play as a team and they are good only individually<br /><br />I prefer difference-making players because football is joy and everyone likes something different. The team is always important, but you need to have different players who can do something more on the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[The possibility of Barcelona piecing together a ‘Fantastic Four’ of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Neymar and Antoine Griezmann has the support of Blaugrana legend Rivaldo]</b> Messi-Suarez-Neymar-Griezmann would be fantastic for Barcelona. An attack with these four players would be spectacular and I think it’s possible to accommodate them all. It would be just a question of preparing a good system in training to make it possible. I don’t see a problem in playing with this Fantastic Four at the same time. Barcelona tend to have about 75 per cent of ball possession in a game, so they spent most of their time in offensive tasks and having these four players would be sensational.<br /><br /><b>[Messi is reflecting on more international heartache with Argentina at the 2019 Copa America]</b> Right now, Lionel Messi should feel sad after fighting so much for his national team and losing yet again. Argentina hasn’t won the Copa America since 1993 and Messi wanted this title very much. I’m sorry for him as he represents so much for football and it’s disappointing to see him not achieving one of the remaining goals in his career. But this is how football works and many European players were also brilliant in their careers and never won anything for their national teams. Messi still has two chances to win with Argentina. Next year there will be another Copa America and then there will be 2022 World Cup in Qatar, so I believe he has still two opportunities to finally win a trophy with his national team.<br /><br />Nowadays, people only talk about Messi but in other times Argentina were known as a strong outfit with many excellent players - they were not reliant on anyone. If Messi had the luck of playing for Argentina in other generation, he could have already won something. When Brazil face Argentina, knowing that Messi is their best player, they can concentrate on creating a strategy to stop him. This time, Casemiro, Arthur Melo and Philippe Coutinho collaborated in zonal marking that worked well. That doesn’t happen in Barcelona where Messi has more freedom for having other great players by his side, and not needing to run backwards to defend</p>

  <p><b>[Rivaldo not expecting Brazilian starlet Vinicius Junior to be stunted at Real Madrid]</b> Real Madrid are looking for ways to accommodate star players. Despite Vinicius Junior’s recent comments, I believe he can easily play by Eden Hazard’s side at Real Madrid and they can even form a nice offensive partnership. Playing alongside such a quality player as Hazard can only let him more relaxed as he will benefit from it as well as Real Madrid. Vinicius just needs to focus on his work and try to convince <b>[Zinedine]</b> Zidane to make him first choice. The club are making many changes to the squad, so they need to adapt to each other, and Zidane’s work will be crucial - he is an excellent manager. As a player, Zidane was known by being a false lazy on the pitch - very clever - and he certainly has a plan to put these two players together, so they combine and adapt to each other on the pitch. Real Madrid should be much stronger next season<br /><br />Brazil is building a nice bunch of young players with next World Cup on their minds. They’re using the Copa America to gain some confidence. It’s always nice to pick up some confidence with titles, so Brazil need to round of their strong campaign with a victory this Sunday when they play the Final against Peru. I said that Brazil was 100% favourite to win Copa America with Neymar on the team, but without him that would decrease a bit. The team has other excellent players who are proving their value and winning a competition without Neymar would testify to their strength. Gabriel Jesus has impressed me. We all know that things didn’t went well for Jesus at the 2018 World Cup, as he was a regular first choice player and didn’t score a single goal. But Tite kept his confidence in the kid and Jesus has rewarded his manager. He is still a young player with great potential and time to evolve - he will have many more opportunities. Jesus had a tough season, losing some importance in the Manchester City team, but Guardiola will be is happy seeing him shining for the Brazilian national team and gaining confidence for next season</p>

I think a lot of the fans are angry with everything that happened, but football is how it is, football is good, and Neymar is a great player who has personality. So if he comes here of course there will be times when he is criticised by some fans, but in the games, the training sessions, Neymar will still be the same Neymar, and it could be something special for Barcelona<br /><br />He should say sorry. Officially, yes. Say sorry, say he was wrong, say that this is his home, that he is going to be the difference. I think that all the fans … many will understand, they’ll see him on the pitch in the league, the Champions League, doing things well, and the fans will forgive him easily. If it’s like it was when he was here playing football before together with Messi and Suarez, it was great for the club.

  <p><b>[Rivaldo urges Barcelona star Philippe Coutinho to consider his options carefully]</b> We all know that Philippe Coutinho played his best football at Liverpool, and I always believed that he could replicate it at Barcelona, but things haven’t been going that way. The chance of a return to Liverpool could be beneficial for him, but I’m not sure if he is thinking of going back to England. He might stay at Barcelona to try to raise his game and prove his value, showing that he can get through that bump in the road. He is coming back from winning a Copa America title and his confidence is high, so it’s hard to say if he’ll stay or go.<br /><br />I really appreciate his qualities as a player and think he has time to show his best at Camp Nou this season. Let’s wait and see… If he decides to join Liverpool, they will become stronger, but they are European champions and that will add more pressure for him, as it’s tough to win it successively. It would be a big challenge for both club and player. Remember, they were Champions League finalists and then winners in consecutive seasons after Coutinho’s departure, so if he does return, he’ll face that extra burden to win trophies for them</p>

  <p><b>[Rivaldo claims Paris Saint-Germain can recover their investment in Neymar]</b> It’s general knowledge that Neymar wants to leave PSG for another big European club, but that’s not a guarantee and if he ends up staying, he would need to focus on his football rather than anything else. He is not happy with PSG and I believe he could even regret his decision of joining - with all due respect - but the situation is complicated as they spent a lot of money on him. PSG don’t want to get hit with a big loss after investing more than €200 million but I believe they can recover their investment or at least exchange him for money and other good players in the business. So, hopefully, it should be straightforward. With his recent comments and behaviour, it’s possible that fans won’t be too happy with him if he remains. He must face the music and simply play his best football. If he manages to achieve something special with them in Europe perhaps the fans won’t criticise him as much<br /><br />If it was my decision, I wouldn’t leave Barcelona for PSG. After all, La Liga is a very competitive league and gives you better exposure. The French league has nothing like that, with PSG stronger than any of their domestic rivals</p>

  <p><b>[Former Brazil star Rivaldo believes Paul Pogba and Christian Eriksen would fit in well at Real Madrid, but says the Spanish giants do not need them]</b> The press are saying that Madrid need to reinforce their midfield, with Christian Eriksen and Paul Pogba among the rumoured targets. Both are excellent players and would fit well at the Bernabeu. In spite of their bad pre-season, I’m not sure that Madrid need reinforcements. Critics of Madrid’s midfield should not forget that Casemiro is only returning to the team now after injury, so they have been playing without their starting defensive midfielder and one of the most important players. Madrid will improve with Casemiro back in the squad, although his absence doesn’t explain their awful pre-season</p>

I don’t think leaving would solve his problems, and it would be preferable to stay and keep fighting for his place<br /><br />Gabriel Jesus is full of confidence after a successful Copa America campaign for Brazil and looking forward to regaining his place in Manchester City’s first team. He lost his place to Sergio Aguero last season, but I believe Jesus has the ability to be a starter in any team. The morale and confidence that he is bringing from Copa America could help him to become a regular starter and scorer for the Citizens this season</p>

  <p><b>[Rivaldo says Neymar moving to Real Madrid would not be a betrayal to Barcelona]</b> There have been many rumours about which of the clubs negotiating for Neymar - Real Madrid and Barcelona - needs him most now. But Neymar is such a talented player that any team in the world would benefit from having him in their side. Of course, I would prefer to see him back to Barcelona but if he ends up at Real Madrid it will also be a big move for him. For now, what is clear is the player’s desire to leave PSG. With two big Spanish clubs competing for him, he should be even more eager to fly away from Paris. If Zinedine Zidane signs Neymar for Real Madrid, I won’t see it as a betrayal. Neymar left Barcelona to sign for PSG and now could fly to Madrid, so it’s not the same as if he had left Barca for Madrid. He must also be professional, but I bet that if he has the chance to get back to a place where he was happy before, and where he knows most of the players, he would love to return to Barcelona. But that depends on the offer Barcelona could make for him. PSG won’t accept a lesser offer from Barca just because Neymar prefers to go there. They don’t want to lose money and will obviously accept the best offer available<br /><br /><b>[Barca have already brought in the likes of Frenkie de Jong and Antoine Griezmann this summer]</b> Barcelona start their La Liga campaign this Friday with a trip to Athletic Bilbao’s San Mames stadium, but I’m convinced they are ready to give a nice response, despite not being yet at 100%. Lionel Messi might not play because of an injury, but the club signed important players like Antoine Griezmann and Frenkie de Jong and I expect a good performance from the team. Barcelona’s focus this season should be the Champions League, which is the trophy that club and fans are fighting for in the last few seasons.<br /><br />Of course, they won’t simply give up La Liga and deliver it to their rivals, but I think that Ernesto Valverde should give more chances to substitutes and youngsters from La Masia in some La Liga matches. I wouldn’t see it as a major failure to lose the La Liga title, as Barcelona have been dominating domestically, and now all their focus should be turned into Champions League success. La Liga is important but Barcelona’s main goal this season as to be Champions League as it is a much important title they are chasing for a while now</p>

  <p><b>[Rivaldo backs Neymar’s Juventus move]</b> In a moment like this, of course Neymar would be a great signing for Barcelona, despite all that happened after his departure and with some people against his return, but I think he could be a big help and with his excellent football, he would end up convincing everybody. Anyway, this transfer can only be complete if Barcelona decide to invest in him as he is an expensive player, and it now seems like Juventus are also thinking about signing Neymar. It would be great to see him playing alongside Cristiano Ronaldo. I believe it would be wonderful for CR7 to have Neymar by his side, as the Brazilian would help him a lot with assists and goals all season.<br /><br />I even imagine them combining for brilliant plays and Neymar could also help by sharing responsibilities as Juventus only has one big star now. It would be a beneficial move for the players and naturally for the club. With Neymar wishing to leave PSG, it will be important that a transfer is complete before deadline day at the end of the month, after all it would be tough for him to stay in France. He would have all the fans against him for a while and it’s never easy to be booed by your own club fans. Yet, Neymar has enough personality to handle it if necessary and prove his value anyway, as he is a great player</p>

  <p><b>[Philippe Coutinho’s move to Bayern Munich has disappointed Rivaldo]</b> I always believed that Philippe Coutinho had the ability to succeed at Barcelona, but things were taking too much time and both parties agreed on a transfer to Bayern Munich. I’m a little disappointed about his failure in gaining a regular place in the first team, but perhaps he was no longer confident about it and unhappy, so he opted for a move to another big club trying to finally recover his best football from his time at Liverpool. It’s never easy to find your space in a team where Lionel Messi constantly takes all the credit and responsibility. There are few players in the world capable of reaching such a situation and imposing themselves, and maybe Coutinho didn’t have enough patience to find his spot in the team. The Argentinian star is the team leader and will keep playing at his best level for about three or four more years, so it is difficult to see other players shining at their best at Barcelona</p>

I think he turned down <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>’s offer because he’s not yet ready to embrace such a task in an early phase of his new job as a manager. For now, he prefers to keep gaining experience and maturity as a coach. But while he didn’t accept such responsibility now and will wait for the right moment, I’m sure he would be <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>’s coach someday and hopefully with success.<br /><br />In the case of <a href="ronald-koeman.html">Koeman</a>, it’s different. He is an experienced manager with an international reputation and would have been a very good option. He is well known worldwide, has a good knowledge of the club and is used to big pressure like he will find in the Champions League and other competitions. But it didn’t turn out to be the time for his comeback</p>

Honestly, I think he will end his career at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a>. He has been one of us since he was 14-years-old. He has a big affection for the club and the club for him, so I don’t think he would benefit from leaving. I see him as a player of just one club, like <a href="francesco-totti.html">Francesco Totti</a> in AS Roma or Rogerio Ceni at Sao Paulo. It’s tough to conceive of the idea of watching <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> playing against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> in the Champions League, so even if he leaves in the future I imagine him more outside Europe, in China or the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> on a transfer motivated more by financial than sporting reasons<br /><br />He hasn’t scored in his last three matches and many commentators are saying the problem at the club, following <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s criticism of <a href="eric-abidal.html">Eric Abidal</a>, is the main reason for that. But I don’t see it that way and think we’ll soon have <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> scoring again. The team has returned to winning ways, as we saw last weekend when they beat <a href="real-betis.html">Real Betis</a> 3-2. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> provided his team-mates with two assists and that’s important as he plays a central role in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>’s attack, with his passing skills crucial to generating good chances. His class is undeniable, so I don’t see reasons for concern<br /><br /><a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> are among the clubs being linked to <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>.

But they are yet to improve under new boss <a href="quique-setien.html">Quique Setien</a> and the team haven’t truly found their best form this season. They have great players but they need to be much better in possession. They also need to shoot more from outside the box to surprise their opponents.

But as we saw against <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> in the Champions League this week, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is targeted by opponents and if he doesn’t show up the team immediately feels it. That said, I believe <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> earned an important equaliser at <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> and taking a 1-1 back to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> should be enough to help them seal qualification in the second leg<br /><br /><a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> have injuries and suspensions to contend with for their second leg against <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>. This comes from the club’s bad planning after some players left in January and almost no reinforcements arrived. <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Arturo Vidal</a> was sent off at <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> but a player of his experience should have controlled himself and remembered that referees are less tolerant in the Champions League than in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>.

Of course, it won’t be easy to make anything similar and he would need to have the right players at the right time to put his system working perfectly.

Any manager would love to coach <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. Much will depend on the players he has when he arrives in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>.

So, it’s crucial to analyse these factors carefully before making an offer to sign a player, as it isn’t just the taste of the president and board that should decide this kind of stuff.

He will move to a big club and to a country and competition he knows well where he had his best years so far, so if that transfer really happens, I’m sure he will have a good chance of seeing things improve for him in the future, after all, he has already shined on <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> before. Looking at <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a>’s last few years we can say that he didn’t achieve what was expected of him, but he still has time to recover his best football and with his confidence back he could easily become the same player he was at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>.

The club no longer trusts him to be a decisive player after some internal problems in the last few years.

The lack of goals is demotivating and damages <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a>’s confidence, so I believe it’s important for <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> to help him. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> could, for example, let <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a> take penalties when <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are winning comfortably - just to get the Frenchman scoring - just like he did with <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> in the past.<br /><br /><b>[Rivaldo admits the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Blaugrana</a> have not been at their best, but he feels it is too early to judge Quique Setien]</b> <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> beat Leganes 2-0 last night but they didn’t produce a great performance and many are still sceptical about <a href="quique-setien.html">Quique Setien</a>’s new system. I think it’s difficult to pass judgement after just two matches post-lockdown. We need to wait a few more weeks to see how the team evolves. It’s understandable that their rhythm and intensity isn’t at its peak yet as they were a lot of time without playing or training. There are players returning from injuries and others still looking to be fit, so we must give them some more time before deciding if <a href="quique-setien.html">Setien</a>’s system can truly work in the long run. At the moment, and while the quality of play is not yet at his best, the most important thing is for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> to continue grabbing wins, to keep the leadership of <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> ahead of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and put pressure on them</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona continue to lean heavily on the likes of <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>, <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Sergio Busquets</a> and <a href="gerard-pique.html">Gerard Pique</a>, with Rivaldo adamant that an ageing squad is not a major concern for the Liga giants]</b> These guys are important to the team, and have a bright future, but I don’t think they are the ones to make the difference. The responsibility should lie with the veterans, those with more experience and they are the players who must give more. I read in the press that they have many players over 30, but I don’t believe that’s a problem<br /><br />It’s obvious that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> have to improve their football, and that’s up to the coach, <a href="quique-setien.html">Setien</a> has to find a formula to do something new. He needs to find a way to take advantage of the quality of the players he has at his disposal. Of course, recent matches make everyone doubt the progress because we’re used to seeing a different kind of Barcelona<br /><br />I want to believe that the mediocre recent performances are the result of these strange times that we’re living in. I hope that in the next two or three matches they improve their level of playing</p>
