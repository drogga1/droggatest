  <p><b>[Fortuna Dusseldorf coach Friedham Funkel believes that Niko Kovac has made Bayern Munich defensively weak]</b> <b>[They]</b> make it very easy for their opponents. The cause of which is their defence, which is very weak and has conceded 17 goals in their first 12 games, as much as they usually concede in an entire season. <b>[They]</b> are very, very vulnerable.<br /><br /><b>[Funkel singled out Germany international Jerome Boateng for specific criticism]</b> No coach in the world should stand for Boateng playing like that. He’s too laid back to run. He wants to avoid having to duel Lukebakio. That should not be happening</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Bayern’s defensive debacle: Time for Kovac to ditch Neuer &amp; Boateng?]</b> Manuel is not so stable this season because the defence is not so stable. He is still our best goalkeeper in Germany. He can’t do anything about the goals. But, in a good phase, he might have saved one or two, because he’d play a bit more successfully. People know that now too. Bayern have conceded 17 goals, and that is in just 12 games. They’ve sometimes done that after 34 games!.<br /><br />When I see how Boateng tried to play the offside trap on the second goal - my dear fellow, that was alarming. No coach in the world can do anything about Boateng playing the offside trap only because he’s too lazy to run after his man. He takes two steps forward and wants to get out of a race with Lukebakio. That shouldn’t happen with such a world-class player</p>

  <p><b>[Head coach Friedhelm Funkel has accused Lewis Baker of going AWOL after missing his side’s last match before the winter break]</b> He’s in London and supposedly sick, I can’t check that. Normally he would have been here. I don’t know what the reason is that he isn’t here. What I do know is that Lewis Baker wasn’t in the squad against Union Berlin <b>[before Christmas]</b> and should have trained with the others at 10am. But Baker was simply not there during training. There was no excuse in advance</p>
