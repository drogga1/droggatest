Reds manager Klopp is now a three-time Coach of the Year winner in Germany - a feat previously only achieved by Felix Magath. The European champion made for an obvious choice as he finished 44 votes clear of second-placed Friedhelm Funkel, the mastermind behind Fortuna Dusseldorf’s unexpected 10th-place finish in the Bundesliga. Eintracht Frankfurt head coach Adi Hutter pipped Bayern Munich boss Niko Kovac to third</p>

  <p><b>[Head coach Friedhelm Funkel has accused Lewis Baker of going AWOL after missing his side’s last match before the winter break]</b> He’s in London and supposedly sick, I can’t check that. Normally he would have been here. I don’t know what the reason is that he isn’t here. What I do know is that Lewis Baker wasn’t in the squad against Union Berlin <b>[before Christmas]</b> and should have trained with the others at 10am. But Baker was simply not there during training. There was no excuse in advance</p>
