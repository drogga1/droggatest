  <p><b>[Valverde lays out plans in Barca unveiling]</b> Just walking around the museum, I am aware of the demands of this club. I know the importance of the Barca style and I want to dig deep to see what I can add to that. From <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi to <b>[Andres]</b> Iniesta, passing by all the other players, I want to create a team spirit and to excite our fans.<br /><br /><b>[Asked about Messi]</b> It’s a unique experience to be able to coach Messi. He is the best player I have ever seen on a football pitch. I know it seems like he is at his peak, but every day he surprises you and the next day he is even better. I hope to enjoy his play and my idea is to help him to get even better, if there is anything to improve on… I want to enjoy the experience of being with him<br /><br /><b>[Argentine is out of contract in 2018 and Valverde was asked whether he was worried that the club’s star man had still not signed a new deal]</b> I’m not concerned because all the information I have is that everyone is optimistic. I want Leo to be happy here, where he has always been<br /><br />It’s a tough start, but even better. We start the season by playing for a trophy and that makes this challenge ahead even greater<br /><br />I have to adapt to the style and the play of the club. I know the style passes by having a great collective game and great handling of the ball in the midfield. Barca have a tradition of playing 4-3-3, also 3-4-3 more recently, but I don’t consider that so important. Fomations have to be moved, the idea is to have control of the ball<br /><br />We are going to try and win as many trophies as we can</p>

It’s one thing to see him from the other side, but it will be another thing to see him in training and witness what he can do – I have never coached a player of his calibre. Sometimes, it can be true that he’s on the wing a little too much, perhaps, but that is something I will have to study and see if I can improve</p>

  <p><b>[Ernesto Valverde is setting ambitious targets after succeeding Luis Enrique at Barcelona, with his intention to win everything at Camp Nou]</b> I want to win every game, from first to last, I want to win everything, that’s my intention. If there’s a good atmosphere and a group that push you, everything becomes much easier. It’s a challenge, a responsibility and a dream because Camp Nou will be full of people who expect a lot from us, so we must be able to return the favour. I want to convey everything I feel to the fans, and that can vibrate with the team. Even though I already knew about it, I’m realising the sheer size of this club. When a club like Barca call you, it’s always a great moment. I decided to end my four-year spell in Bilbao. Sometimes, for a club like Barca to call you, not only do they need to like your style, but it must also coincide with timing, your situation.<br /><br />The game is a reflection of the coach’s idea. I want a team spirit that infects the people at the club, a style of play that is intense, a team that carry the weight of their game and an ambition in accordance with what’s asked of us. There are many things that I already see in this team. The formation sets the base for your idea, and you have to make sure the players are comfortable so that you can achieve what you want to achieve.</p>

In terms of his position, playing in the middle is good both for him and for us. However, he can play well anywhere.<br /><br /><b>[On Luis Suarez]</b> The important thing is to create chances - the goals will come. Luis is an aggressive player with his finishing and is always close to scoring. I wasn’t worried when he wasn’t scoring as much, because it was a question of time before he found the net again. Also, we have players who are able to score, and it’s important that there are so many players who score goals<br /><br />Neymar’s departure was a difficult moment for the club.

Dembele has been out injured for a while, and for a match like this, coaches go with the things they know best. Aleix also gives us things, a different profile. When we are faced with a match like this, I rely on certainties. I had to respect what we have been doing, so I played Paulinho as a starter and I brought on Aleix Vidal for more depth. It wasn’t the time to experiment. That’s how I see it.<br /><br /><b>[Dembele went on strike in order to force through his move from Dortmund]</b> There is no reason to make a big thing out of it. The fact is that he didn’t have a proper pre-season and we want to help him recover, little by little<br /><br /><b>[What looked like a hamstring strain was complicated by tendon damage, it came as he attempted a needless back-heel flick]</b> When a player is going at that speed and does a back-heel, it can happen.

  <p><b>[Ernesto Valverde says he isn’t feeling the pressure of mounting speculation about his future at the club]</b> Coaches always move with the idea of working hard and giving everything in every game. We know what football is like, that there is always permanent instability. When the results are bad or when you lose, as has happened tonight, I suppose we will talk about this and other things. It’s inevitable but I will do my job<br /><br /><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> were also frustrated by VAR as goals from <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="gerard-pique.html">Gerard Pique</a> were ruled out for handball and offside respectively]</b> We were dominating the game but there are details that you can’t neglect. It was a game that we dominated, we came back after Atletico got the first goal. We had the game in our hands and they turned it around in two plays. The goal to make it 2-2 came after a situation where we did not know how to stop the game. They overloaded us inside with our defence open, had fast players going forward and surprised us with that play. I don’t think we were outplayed but there were two specific situations in a game we had controlled. They hurt us when it seemed like the game was going our way. I loved that the opponent had been ahead and we turned it around, but then it went the other way again</p>

  <p><b>[Ernesto Valverde says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> can’t be compared with anyone]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> can’t be compared with anyone. It’s very difficult to tell him if you’ve seen this or another player when he does things in training that you haven’t seen yourself. Many times, from the touchline, you’re always thinking what can be the best option and, ultimately, he sees it much better than you from on the pitch. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is a very easy player to coach because he also has a great impulse with respect to the team. He has a great ambition to win, he always feels such an obligation to the game as for the club. He transmits that to the group and it forces everyone to be at a higher level. Seeing him play is impressive from afar <b>[…]</b> but even more so from up close<br /><br /><b>[Valverde went on to defend how he set up the team during his time at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a>]</b> It’s about trying to be superior to a rival and dominate in the game, which is having more chances than your opponent and they have fewer than you. There are times when you have possession and not chances and without chances, you don’t have that dominance, but to have chances, you have to have the ball. I like being the master of the ball because you take it off your opponent. The question then is if you’re deep or not with that ball. Each person has to see how they feel at ease to be able to get their message across. Ultimately, possession is a way to win a game. It’s a bit magnified by the media, but it’s nothing more than criteria. If you want to be aggressive with the ball, you also have to be aggressive without it. In my case, it’s about wanting to take the initiative of the game and that happens because the opponent don’t want to play.</p>
