It’s very difficult to tell him if you’ve seen this or another player when he does things in training that you haven’t seen yourself. Many times, from the touchline, you’re always thinking what can be the best option and, ultimately, he sees it much better than you from on the pitch. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is a very easy player to coach because he also has a great impulse with respect to the team.

There are times when you have possession and not chances and without chances, you don’t have that dominance, but to have chances, you have to have the ball. I like being the master of the ball because you take it off your opponent. The question then is if you’re deep or not with that ball. Each person has to see how they feel at ease to be able to get their message across. Ultimately, possession is a way to win a game. It’s a bit magnified by the media, but it’s nothing more than criteria. If you want to be aggressive with the ball, you also have to be aggressive without it. In my case, it’s about wanting to take the initiative of the game and that happens because the opponent don’t want to play.</p>
