I can guarantee you it was not for trying. I did my best, but football is not like maths: often a lot of things out of our control affect the way we feel and the way things turn out. I am sorry it did not work out as I would have wished in this amazing huge club. I want to give special thanks to all the directors and management of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> as well as to every member of the staff and colleagues as they gave me all their support. Also a special mention to all the fans who always trusted me and showed me their respect and love.

  <p><b>[An understandably emotional Angel Di Maria dedicated the goal he scored for Argentina against Chile in the Copa America Centenario group stage to his late grandmother]</b> It’s difficult to be away when something like this happens. My mom asked me to stay here with my team-mates and to win the game. I am so happy because I was able to score, it was for my grandmother and my family that are having a difficult time. I knew that I could score. In the morning when I knew what happened I knew that I would score today, and that happened and it was for her.</p>

  <p><b>[Angel Di Maria believes the criticism being levelled at Cristiano Ronaldo by Real Madrid supporters has become exaggerated]</b> It is exaggerated. He has given so much to Madrid, as others have. He has won two Champions Leagues and people forget that a bit. They always want more. The same has happened with <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi. People say he’s not scoring enough, he’s not like he was before, but overnight something sparks and the goals start to flow. I don’t understand how people can question Cristiano.<br /><br />Some players are mentally stronger. I see Benzema as very strong - even though this happens, he likes to play and enjoy himself. Danilo looks a bit different, it’s a bit harder for him, and his head affects him a bit more. He must think about enjoying himself and being positive when he is playing. It happened to me many times, I had some ugly moments at Madrid, but it all changed and when I left Madrid in the end I was much loved</p>

  <p><b>[Angel Di Maria has conceded that another summer of big spending at Paris Saint-Germain could force him towards the exits]</b> Football is a strange game. I am happy here, but the club needs to sign new players and to do this, others must be sold. It is not my decision. It is also the club’s. For the moment, I am calm. We must simply continue to work hard; the club and the supporters need to stay patient. The most important thing is to continue to sign great players who want to win things or have already won things and are experienced - the rest will come on its own.</p>

  <p><b>[Angel Di Maria has revealed how Real Madrid handed him ‘the most difficult day of my life’ as they dashed his World Cup dreams in 2014]</b> I remember getting the letter from Real Madrid and tearing it up before I even opened it. It was the morning of the 2014 World Cup Final, at exactly 11am and I was sitting on the trainer’s table about to get an injection in my leg. I had torn my thigh muscle in the quarter-finals, but with painkillers, I could run without feeling anything. I told our trainers these exact words: ‘If I break, then let me keep breaking. I don’t care. I just want to be able to play’. So I was putting ice on my leg when our team doctor, Daniel Martínez, came into the room holding this envelope, and he said ‘Look, Ángel, this paper came from Real Madrid.’ I said ‘What are you talking about?’ He said ‘Well, they’re saying you’re not in any condition to play. So they are forcing us to not let you play today’. I immediately knew what was happening. Everybody had heard the rumours that Real wanted to sign James Rodríguez after the World Cup, and I knew that they were going to sell me to make room for him. So they didn’t want their asset to be damaged. It was that simple. That’s the business of football that people do not always see. I told Daniel to give me the letter. I didn’t even open it. I just ripped it into pieces.<br /><br />I had not slept much the night before. Part of the reason was that the Brazilian fans were setting off huge fireworks outside of our hotel all night long, but even if it had been completely quiet, I don’t think I would’ve been able to sleep. It is impossible to explain the feeling you have on the night before a World Cup Final, when everything you ever dreamed about is right in front of your eyes. I sincerely wanted to play that day even if it ended my career. But I also didn’t want to make things complicated for our team. So I woke up early that morning and went to see our manager, Mr Sabella. We had a very close relationship, so if I told him that I wanted to start, I knew that he would feel the pressure to put me in. I told him sincerely, with my hand on my heart, that he should put in the player that he felt he had to put in. I said ‘If it’s me, it’s me. If it’s another, then it’s another. I just want to win the World Cup. If you call on me, I will play until I break’. And then I started crying. I couldn’t help it. The moment had overwhelmed me.<br /><br />I treated myself with an injection before the match and again during the second half, so that I would be ready to play if I was called from the bench. But the call never came. We lost the World Cup - and I couldn’t control anything. It was the most difficult day of my life</p>

We see in each of his matches the potential that he has - he exploits it every time, even if he is only 19<br /><br /><b>[On Neymar]</b> He’s the same as he was before his injury, driven by his great ambition<br /><br />I am very happy here, so I can only wait to see what will happen. The coach immediately came to talk to me, he made me understand that he was counting on me, that I was important to the team. I think he has come to win the Champions League … and we have a good chance of winning because we have Neymar, Mbappe and Edinson Cavani. The best! The club knows what I want, we’ll see. I’d like to continue here, but I have always said that I would like to finish my career in Argentina. I hope that my last club in Europe will be Paris</p>

The draw put us in a group with two superior teams, Liverpool and Naples, who are very strong at home.<br /><br /><b>[Di Maria is not writing his team off]</b> We still have three important matches in the Champions League, which will be decisive. We have a good team, a great coach.

It’s hard not to be favourite. But we already know that just because you are Argentina does not mean that you win. Today everything is very even.

  <p><b>[Angel Di Maria admits that playing alongside the likes of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> for club and country has often restricted him to training-ground practice when it comes to free-kicks]</b> Yes, I do. I’ve always had people around me like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> … in the national team, but at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and Manchester <b>[United]</b> too! I’ve always been surrounded by top quality players, who score a lot of goals! But I’ve learned little by little. You never finish learning. There is always room to improve. With Madrid, I would only take free-kicks in training because either <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> or <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> would take them! With hard work I gained in confidence and when I got my opportunity here (at PSG), it was lucky that I scored. That’s important!<br /><br /><b>[Asked how he decides which side to aim for]</b> It’s a feeling… the moment you see the wall, you see where the goalkeeper is, all of that. Your team-mates help too because they create panic in the wall. That’s when you start to realise what the best choice will be<br /><br />Honestly, I don’t set myself goals. The only objective I give myself is to be a champion, to win every title. That is all I want at the start of the season. Afterwards, individually, I don’t set myself targets. Like I said, I work hard for the team, I try to do my best. If I can score, I score. If I can provide an assist, I provide an assist. After that, it’s about running and working for the team. That’s all I focus on</p>

  <p><b>[Angel Di Maria claims that he didn’t have a choice but to take the No.7 shirt at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> I don’t really know. When I arrived, I saw that the No.11 was available. It’s a shirt number I wore a lot when I was younger and I was keen to get once again. At <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, No.11 was already taken, so I took 22. At <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> they gave me No.7, I didn’t get a choice. I would have liked 11 but there we are. Here, I had a choice, so I chose 11!<br /><br /><a href="psg.html">PSG</a> is very important to me. They welcomed me with open arms in a period when I was finding it difficult in Manchester. I came here with ambition, and determination to succeed. Little by little, I showed that I was capable, that I could help the club achieve great things. I always do my best to help the club succeed</p>

  <p><b>[Angel Di Maria has revealed that he tore up a letter from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> requesting that he miss the 2014 World Cup final with Argentina]</b> The only three who know the truth are doctor Daniel Martinez, <b>[coach]</b> Alejandro Sabella and me. I had a tear in the game against Belgium, I was at about 90 per cent. The leg wasn’t totally right, but I wanted to play and I didn’t care at all if I never played football again. It was one of the things I was told could happen, but for me it was the World Cup final, it was my final. I knew <b>[<a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> wanted to sell me, and so the letter arrived. Daniel told me it was from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, but I didn’t even want to look at it and I tore it up. I went to talk to Alejandro and I told him, crying, that I wasn’t at 100%. I knew he loved me and that he wanted me to play, but he sought the best for the team. I was going to have an injection. I wanted to try. But after the meeting, he decided to play Enzo Perez in my place<br /><br /><b>[Di Maria and his family are making sure they stay at home to minimise the risk of contracting Covid-19]</b> What we are experiencing is crazy, we are not having a very good time. We have been isolated for 14 days. We have two more days at the request of the club. We’ve been out to the supermarket only once and returned, because we do not want to expose our daughters. Luckily with video calls we can talk <b>[with family in Argentina]</b> every day and that gives us more peace of mind</p>

  <p><b>[Angel Di Maria told his friends about how he despised playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>]</b> I didn’t have a great relationship with the coach, so I think the decision to join Paris was the best solution. Life in England was a bit difficult. It is not easy for a South American. Some people get on fine, and for others it is harder to adapt. My family wasn’t happy. My daughter was suffering. So it was important to leave</p>

  <p><b>[Jorgelina Cardoso, has claimed that she never wanted her husband to make a move to <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>]</b> I remember Angel coming up and saying, ‘An offer from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> has come in. Maybe we’ll be a little more financially secure…’. We fought about it. I told him, not a chance, he could go on his own. ‘No, come on. Let’s go’, he replied. There was a lot of money involved, and afterwards, the Spanish were calling us peseteros (people only interested in money). And they were right! If you are working for a company and the competition comes along and offers to pay you double, you take it! I didn’t want to go to Manchester because at that moment in time, I was friends with Gianinna <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>, who was married to <b>[Sergio]</b> <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a>, and we flew from Madrid to his house in Manchester to pay him a visit for two or three days when Angel had a few days off at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. It was horrible! All of it was horrible, we went to the house and we were like… ‘See you later guys, we’re out of here’. When we left, I said to him, ‘Go to any country - except England’. Anyway, one year later and there we were in England and it was horrible, a shithole.<br /><br />I didn’t like anything about it, not a thing. The women are all skinny, prim and proper <b>[…]</b> weird. You’re walking down the street and you don’t know if they’re going to kill you or what. The food’s disgusting.

  <p><b>[Angel Di Maria says he is happy he did not join <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> when they tried to buy him from <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> three years ago]</b> I was very happy in Paris, but people at the club at the time told me some things, which turned out to be lies in the end. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> tried to get me to come. The two clubs discussed it, but <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> did not want to sell me and it ended there. These lies annoyed me a lot but, in the end, not leaving was a good thing because I am very happy in Paris today<br /><br /><b>[The 32-year-old’s contract expires in 2021, but he hinted that he will extend his deal as he wants to see out the remainder of his career with <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>]</b> I want to end my career in Europe with <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> is the only thing I want and have in mind. I’m happy here, my family is too. As for the rest, I don’t know for the moment. No discussions have been initiated and this is not my intention at this time.

Not only to win the trophy, but because of the affection I have for the club and for its supporters. I have the feeling that over the past two seasons, I have won the respect of the supporters. Mentally, it changed a lot when I felt that they encouraged me more, that they sang for me. It gave me a lot of strength, I try to thank them for what I do on the field. If I could bring them the Champions LEague before leaving, it would be perfect to end our story</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> cancelled too soon for Di Maria as <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> star eyed all-time assist record]</b> Like many, I think we rushed to make such a decision. From what we can see, France is today one of the countries where the health situation is the most favourable, and yet everything has been totally stopped for good. These are matters of politics and for doctors. We would have liked to finish the championship but decisions have been made and we must accept them. If they made this choice, it is because they first thought of the health and well-being of people, so that is fine with me<br /><br /><b>[On a personal note, the Argentine has been left to lament the timing of the stoppage]</b> The past year has been incredible for me. When I think about, I say to my wife: ‘What bad luck that everything stopped’. I experienced a season without the slightest cloud, without injury, I played many good matches. Ending the season as the leading assist maker in <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> is a source of pride. I’ve always said it, I prefer to make a decisive pass than to score a goal. To tell you the truth, I even set myself the goal of beating the record for assists in a <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> season because I read that I was only four away <b>[with 11 matches to play]</b>.</p>
