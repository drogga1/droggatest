  <p><b>[Angel di Maria on Wayne Rooney]</b> <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> is at the top level. Playing with him is a pleasure and a point of pride. When I was 15, more or less, I used to watch him playing with United. I admired him and wanted to be like that. The other day I was talking to my friend and I said, ‘Rooney and me understand each other, just like <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and me in the Argentina squad, or <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. I get on really well with <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a>, we get together on the pitch to kick the ball about, to do things. He’s a spectacular player and he’s one of the top players in the game</p>

  <p><b>[Angel Di Maria has jokingly referred to Lionel Messi as a dwarf]</b> I had the chance to go to Barcelona and it didn’t happen. The truth is that if I went, it was to be with him <b>[Messi]</b>, to watch him every day, because when he gets the ball I’m a spectator.<br /><br /><b>[Di Maria is still getting the chance to work with a five-time Ballon d’Or winner with Argentina]</b> Yes, I love to play with the Enano <b>[dwarf]</b>, I love to see him in training too, the things he does. It’s something unique, impossible to explain. The other day in the session, <b>[Marcos]</b> Acuna hit a cross that was impossible for anyone and he scored it with a scissor kick. There you say ‘that’s it, leave it, what can you do, it’s a goal, haha’. None of us could do it. For that, I’m here enjoying it<br /><br /><b>[Messi is back with the Albiceleste despite having faced criticism of his contribution at international level]</b> I see him happy, very happy, he gets along very well with the boys<br /><br />The issue is that we are the Argentine national team and we have Messi. It’s hard not to be favourite. But we already know that just because you are Argentina does not mean that you win. Today everything is very even. If you do not give everything on the pitch, it’s difficult. In order to achieve this title, we will have to leave one hundred per cent or more out there</p>

  <p><b>[Argentina’s Angel Di Maria has defended Lionel Messi’s displays at the Copa America]</b> I think Leo is doing things very well. He’s not scoring goals like he usually does, but I think he’s doing a good job. He’s running and he’s giving everything. He has to keep running and then the rest will come. I think he is doing very well.<br /><br />With Brazil it’s a complicated game, but I think all the teams make it difficult for you. Brazil will play as our equals and they will have the home support. We have to try to play our way, do what we did against Venezuela and hopefully things will go well</p>

That we had not been together much as some had not been called up <b>[to the senior team]</b> before. Yet, it felt as though we had all been together for many years. He said that we had all rowed in the same direction from the first day. That he was very proud of the youngsters for their commitment to this jersey and if they were there and gave what they gave at the Copa America, it was because they more than deserved to be there. Once he finished, everyone was in tears because it touched everyone’s hearts, especially the youngsters. The young players are the ones that have to carry on in the same path. It will not be easy for them. They will have to work and continue giving their all as sooner or later, luck will be on our side<br /><br /><b>[It has been suggested the 31-year-old lacks the passion required to lead the team]</b> There was a lot of criticism that he didn’t sing <b>[the national anthem]</b>, that he didn’t talk. This Copa America was different. He proved it. What made me happier was to see how he spoke in front of the group, how he spoke to reporters, what he said. The important thing is that Leo is like this. I like this Messi</p>

I think that it’s getting more competitive with every passing year. Every season, teams are stronger, it get harder to win. My two first campaigns here … I’m not saying that they were east but the opposition was not as strong as it is now. Little by little, the league has become more competitive, harder to win. Teams have worked out how to play against us. Coaches have formulated plans to play <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, Marseille, <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>. It’s important and I think that it is helping the league grow. Many feel the league is weaker than others but look at other leagues, look at England! <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are streets ahead, and when we build up a similar lead it’s because the league isn’t as good?!

  <p><b>[Angel Di Maria says he is happy he did not join <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> when they tried to buy him from <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> three years ago]</b> I was very happy in Paris, but people at the club at the time told me some things, which turned out to be lies in the end. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> tried to get me to come. The two clubs discussed it, but <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> did not want to sell me and it ended there. These lies annoyed me a lot but, in the end, not leaving was a good thing because I am very happy in Paris today<br /><br /><b>[The 32-year-old’s contract expires in 2021, but he hinted that he will extend his deal as he wants to see out the remainder of his career with PSG]</b> I want to end my career in Europe with <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> is the only thing I want and have in mind. I’m happy here, my family is too. As for the rest, I don’t know for the moment. No discussions have been initiated and this is not my intention at this time. I want to focus on the field, the rest will come later<br /><br /><b>[His Champions League triumph came during his time at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, but he hopes to claim the European crown with his current side before he departs]</b> It would be amazing to win it again. Not only to win the trophy, but because of the affection I have for the club and for its supporters. I have the feeling that over the past two seasons, I have won the respect of the supporters. Mentally, it changed a lot when I felt that they encouraged me more, that they sang for me. It gave me a lot of strength, I try to thank them for what I do on the field. If I could bring them the Champions LEague before leaving, it would be perfect to end our story</p>

  <p><b>[Ligue 1 cancelled too soon for Di Maria as <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> star eyed all-time assist record]</b> Like many, I think we rushed to make such a decision. From what we can see, France is today one of the countries where the health situation is the most favourable, and yet everything has been totally stopped for good. These are matters of politics and for doctors. We would have liked to finish the championship but decisions have been made and we must accept them. If they made this choice, it is because they first thought of the health and well-being of people, so that is fine with me<br /><br /><b>[On a personal note, the Argentine has been left to lament the timing of the stoppage]</b> The past year has been incredible for me. When I think about, I say to my wife: ‘What bad luck that everything stopped’. I experienced a season without the slightest cloud, without injury, I played many good matches. Ending the season as the leading assist maker in <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> is a source of pride. I’ve always said it, I prefer to make a decisive pass than to score a goal. To tell you the truth, I even set myself the goal of beating the record for assists in a <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> season because I read that I was only four away <b>[with 11 matches to play]</b>.</p>
