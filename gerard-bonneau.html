<blockquote>
  <p><b>[A move to Barcelona and a Euro 2016 quarter-final with France - Samuel Umtiti’s career-defining week]</b> It’s a rise that’s logical for him. He’s been improving at a steady pace since he arrived at Lyon in the Under-9s. I don’t think Barcelona are taking a risk in taking Samuel. They’ve been watching him for a long time and they know what he’s capable of<br /><br />Like Barcelona, I think that Deschamps believes in him and is prepared to put his confidence in him. Samuel has the qualities to play in this squad. And it’s a dream for him.<br /><br />I don’t see him having a problem. He won’t have a bad game on debut - on the contrary, he’ll show the world why he’s there. If you followed him at Lyon, you’d see that the leaders of the squad were Maxime Gonalons and him. There are players who have great experience, but he has always had this mentality.<br /><br />He’s always been very mature for his age. He gets on well with everyone and on the field he’s already a very good player</p>
