<blockquote>
  <p>[Front and center on the tour is Christian Pulisic, Dortmund’s American star and the U.S. national team’s best player] Now we feel like it’s the right time to come here. Christian obviously opens some doors, and If the door is open Borussia Dortmund walks through, [that’s] the whole story of Borussia Dortmund. He obviously helps, but it’s not dependent on him only.<br /><br />We 100 percent would still be coming here if we didn’t have Pulisic. We had the same situation with [Japanese star Shinji] Kagawa. In 2010 he joined, we had him for two and a half years and then obviously then he left for Manchester United. Our ambition was always back then was to get to a certain level in Japan. We started at a certain level with Kagawa, but our ambition was to be able to stay at a certain level even if he leaves.​ It is the same now with Christian<br /><br />Commercial would never influence sports in our club. Decisions to sell players are purely taken by [the sporting side] and purely for a sports perspective. That’s why we would never sign a player only because he’s from, for example, Mexico or Japan. We only sign players because we feel like there is potential and they bring us to the next step on the pitch. If they happen to be from Japan we as commercial guys have to use this wave in the right way<br /><br />Before we really started to think about the U.S. we did a deep analysis of the past five years on our own social and commercial channels and it’s really interesting to see that, in certain regions like Chicago, there was real interest. We monitored this closely and it’s part of the decision why we’re going to go to LA, Chicago, Pittsburgh and Charlotte. We saw when Christian came in there was another boost, but it’s not necessarily dependent on him, and we feel like there’s an underdog story, you could call it a hero story, that we’ve created the past decade and we want to get Americans in touch with it<br /><br />What we say in Germany is Dortmund is driven by intensity. If you come to the stadium you will feel that intensity. Our challenge is how can we bring this to the U.S. How can we export that feeling and intensity and authenticity that the club stands for in Germany to other markets? That’s a challenge, but obviously social media and digital world helps us a lot, and Christian helps us a lot</p>
