  <p><b>[Eduardo, the former Arsenal striker who started his career at Dinamo, is embroiled in a law suit against Zdravko Mamic seeking to break a civil contract that means he will pay 10 per cent of his earnings to the Croat until the end of his career]</b> I helped Eduardo, paid for his surgery when he was 17 and about to be thrown out from Dinamo during his loan spell with Inter Zapresic. I paid for his wedding, I bought a house for his mother… That rude kid should have more respect! I made him famous, I enabled him to transfer to Arsenal and he gave me nothing!.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Dinamo Zagreb president Zdravko Mamic claims Tottenham wanted Alen Halilovic and Tin Jedvaj to replace Gareth Bale in 2013, but the deal fell through]</b> Our biggest failure were transfers of Alen Halilovic and Tin Jedvaj. When they were 16, Tottenham sold Bale to Real for €100m and wanted to buy them for €25m. I met <b>[Tottenham chairman]</b> Daniel Levy in London. We started negotiations at €10m and finished at 25, and signed a deal. As I returned to Zagreb, I presented that deal to the Halilovic and Jedvaj families and they agreed. But after a few days, Halilovic’s father changed his mind saying Alen was not happy with the deal. I went crazy and called the whole thing off. And Dinamo lost because we sold them a couple of years later for much less money.<br /><br />When we negotiated with Tottenham over <b>[Luka]</b> Modric, Levy offered €10m in cash. They understood and accepted a €25m deal</p>

  <p><b>[Mamic insists that he was risking his future]</b> It was a business risk I took! You always speak about Modric and Eduardo, but what about those players I invested in and never got anything in return because they failed to make a career?.</p>
