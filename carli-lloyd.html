My dream is to play for the U.S., and if I can’t even make the JV, what’s the point? So I am seriously considering finishing up my time with my team at Rutgers, getting my degree and calling it a career. I always thought it would be cool to be an FBI agent. Maybe I can do that.

It’s not going to be easy.<br /><br />The three back is an awesome formation I think. It allows us to be on our front foot. But with that being said, they have players like Thomis, who is extremely athletic, super fast, and our wing backs had to be in a more defensive position in the beginning of the game, which is unfortunate because they’re also our attacking players as well</p>

I always make sure to take care of my body on and off the pitch, and with my training regime I feel as fit as I have ever been. And for me I am more motivated than ever because there’s a lot of people out there that think that I’m too old, that I’m not going to be able to influence the game, that I’m not going to be able to do the things I used to do.

  <p><b>[Carli Lloyd is well aware that she’s a different player now than she used to be]</b> I’ve played center mid alongside Shannon Boxx for so many years where one of us goes forward and one holds and vice versa. I’ve played holding mid in the 2012 Olympics, I’ve played left mid, I’ve played right mid, I’ve played attacking mid. Obviously with age you’ve got to change some things. I still feel probably as fit as I’ve ever felt, as explosive as I’ve ever felt but these last couple years I’ve really been trying to train my brain in a different way. I’m not the Carli Lloyd from five years ago that’s just going to get the ball and start running towards goal. I’ve got to be able to play smarter with my brain<br /><br />These last couple years for me personally has been studying the game and trying to evolve.

I’ve really been dissecting the games. I’ve always been a person who watches every game that I play in and kind of dissects it and studies it, but now it’s more with my brain and less with the body. I know what I need to work on. I know some of the things they want and I’ve just got to be able to do it and be kind of an unpredictable No 9. I’m not going to be the standing target player, I’ve got more to offer than that and I’ve just got to continue getting better<br /><br />This isn’t the end. I’ve got to keep climbing</p>

  <p><b>[Carli Lloyd believes she could be a successful NFL kicker after going viral for making a 55-yard field goal while visiting a Philadelphia Eagles practice]</b> I love <a href="crystal-palace.html">the Eagles</a>. I’ve been an Eagles fan my whole life. I had an off-day and I figured I’d come out … I brought my boots. I could kick all day long. I could kick field goals all day long. I absolutely love it. There’s a lot the same with kicking a soccer ball and kicking a football. I love kicking long balls in soccer, and it carries over to football. The technique is the same, and I think I’m very accurate. I started at 25 <b>[yards]</b>, and they kept moving me back. I hit one short, I think. There were a couple with the wind that went wide. I got to 55, and that was it. One take. It was good. I had no idea anyone was videotaping it or putting it on cell-phone video. I tried from 57, but it was wide; the distance was good. I would have kept going - my competitive nature. But I felt like I was holding them up out there<br /><br /><b>[Lloyd was flooded with messages after the clip went viral on social media]</b> When we got in the car, it was unbelievable. The texts, the videos, everything going viral. I had no idea. It was insane. It still is insane. I could not believe the attention on social media. I just had a conversation with Randy <b>[Brown, the former mayor of a town near Lloyd’s home and assistant special-teams coach with the Baltimore Ravens]</b>, actually. The coaches and his GM, they all saw the video. They were like, ‘What is she doing next week?’.

Put on the helmet, strap on the pads, go for it. The mindset I have, I think with practice, I know I have to work on my steps and my technique, but I think I could do it and do it well. It could be a huge, pivotal moment. There is no reason why a woman could not do this. And I actually invite the pressure. I love the pressure. When I have to nail something - shooting hoops, axe-throwing, kicking a field goal - that is the moment I live for and want. It’s worth having some conversations about it. With practice and someone showing me, I know I can do it. I have one of the most accurate shots in our game. <b>[The]</b> big thing would be getting used to the big boys out there.

  <p><b>[U.S. women’s national team and Sky Blue FC veteran Carli Lloyd caused quite a stir when a video surfaced of her nailing a 55-yard field goal while visiting the Philadelphia Eagles and Baltimore Ravens in August]</b> Next thing you know. it became majorly viral<br /><br /><b>[When asked which teams offered her a role as a professional kicker]</b> I can’t disclose. You guys may never know. Like I said, I have a game this Thursday, which I happen to be playing in Philadelphia. It’s not something I would’ve passed up. First and foremost, I am a soccer player. But it’s been crazy. A casual day, me just having some fun, being competitive and kicking field goals went to being the most talked-about news around the globe. It’s just crazy how all of that works<br /><br />I know that there’s some challenges involved with this and I know that there’s probably some players and people and everybody around the globe thinking this is the craziest thing<br /><br />I also see it from the one perspective of maybe this is kind of something that’s going to break down some barriers and give people, women especially, the confidence to know that maybe they can be a part of any NFL team as a kicker. I’m not trying to be a running back or a quarterback; that would be an epic fail. But I do know that I could kick a ball pretty well and I pride myself in my technique and really it’s all about getting it up and over. I know that there’s loads of people that are saying, you know, big men coming at you. I don’t know. I’d have to seriously go out to the field. Helmet, pads, two-step, really get the technique down, really practice it and then kind of see from there if it’s possible<br /><br /><b>[The NFL does have female officials, female scouts as well as female assistant coaches. So could a female kicker be the next step?]</b> No other female has ever done this on the professional stage, so I know there are a lot of challenges and I get that. I’ve had other girls that have played for their youth teams or high school teams as a kicker and I’ve gotten messages saying that I’ve given them the confidence to go for it even more. That’s kind of the message that you want to hear. Obviously, there’s challenges with that, playing in male-dominated sports. But we live in a different time in this world. I think anything is possible. I think somebody’s got to be the first one, right?</p>

  <p><b>[Carli Lloyd has said this summer’s World Cup was absolutely the worst time of my life, despite the U.S. women’s national team winning the tournament]</b> I’m not going to lie and sugarcoat it. It was absolutely the worst time of my life. It affected my relationship with my husband, with friends. It really was rock bottom of my entire career. But somehow, you see light at the end of the tunnel, and I can honestly say I’m having more fun now playing than I ever have in my career. I think I just learned a lot throughout it. There’s no denying it, I deserved to be on that field that whole World Cup, but I wasn’t. And I think I’ve grown as a person, as a player. It sucked. It absolutely sucked<br /><br />I was super happy for my teammates and happy for Megan, who put the team on her back, and for several other players. It was great to see, and I’m happy that I could still have been a part of it. I’m waiting on a new coach to be announced and if that coach would like to see me in the Olympic plans then I’m all for it</p>

  <p><b>[Asked if she believed the women’s national team could be competitive against the men’s national team]</b> I’m not sure. Shall we fight it out to see who wins and then we get paid more?<br /><br />I don’t have the physical attributes and the speed and the strength that male athletes are born with. None of us women do. There are some incredibly skillful women that play soccer, and it was just disappointing to hear over and over again the argument of us not being as skilled as the men. So I had to find some funny remarks just to kind of keep the whole mood light. That was just one of them that came out and went public<br /><br />As a whole, we need the culture to change. We need everybody to feel united. I wish that we integrated more with the men’s team</p>

  <p><b>[USWNT star Carli Lloyd says NFL dream may have to ‘get pushed a year or so’]</b> I’m focusing on soccer at the moment, but I’ve always been a kid who loves a challenge and I’ve never backed down from any challenge. I know with proper training and the right technique and someone showing me how to properly kick, I know that I can do it. It may have to get pushed a year or so. I know the times right now are a little up in the air, so we’ll see. I’m not ruling it out<br /><br /><b>[she confirmed a determination to be a part of the US team in Japan]</b> For me now it’s another year to be able to prepare, to be able to push the boundaries, the barriers, of becoming more fit, stronger, to better my game, and I’m excited about it.<br /><br /><b>[Despite the allure of the NFL, she may have stayed in soccer in 2021]</b> It gives me another year, because I didn’t think I was going to be ready to be done after this year, so I get another year to play. Everyone’s talking about the age. It’s a year later; it’s not going to make much difference because I’m feeling at the top of my game and feeling really, really good right now</p>

  <p><b>[USWNT star Lloyd loving life under <a href="vlatko-andonovski.html">Andonovski</a>]</b> Vlatko has held everyone accountable, no matter who you are or how old you are. If you are playing well in games and in training, you will play. I love that<br /><br />Vlatko has a unique and dynamic philosophy of how he would like the team to play. He has identified our strengths and is tweaking his philosophy to get the best out of our team. I like that he states that no two games are the same and we need to adapt to the day<br /><br />It is also the first time that we have had a coach in all my years on the national team that takes a big interest in improving us as individuals. Vlatko has brought a rich learning environment to our team. It really is very different to the past<br /><br />Vlatko has slowly integrated his style of play since coming in and we have been able to implement it with each camp we have been together. In <b>[Olympic]</b> qualifying, you saw the team starting to come together and getting better with each game and in the She Believes Cup we continued to improve. We played three different opponents, England, Spain and Japan, who played three different styles and we adapted to all three. I think we walked away knowing we have become a lot more versatile as a unit, but also knowing that there are certain areas where we can improve<br /><br />I try to find the silver lining in every situation I am faced with. A lot is out of our control right now, but our attitude toward life is in our control. I have never had this much time to pause my life and have nothing planned on my calendar. I’ve been enjoying time with my husband after being on the road my entire career. I’ve also been enjoying cooking and trying different recipes, getting some things done around our house, and, thankfully, we have a facility that I can go in and train five-to-six days a week. I have been building up my fitness, becoming stronger and super sharp with my touches on the ball. I now have an opportunity to continue to become the best I possibly can in this next year<br /><br />I have not spoken to anyone yet but I’m sure I will at some point. I know they are busy implementing their ideas and I hope to provide input when the time is right. As I’ve got older, I have gained more and more interest into the development methods and systems we are using to grow the game. I have my views and hope I can express them when the time is right</p>
