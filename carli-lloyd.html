  <p><b>[Carli Lloyd has hinted that she’s fielded interest from NFL teams after her field goal kicking display blew up on social media this week]</b> I was casually just wanting to bang in a few field goals because I’m a competitor and I really enjoyed doing it. I started at 25 yards and just kept moving back. I was aiming for Elliot and Tucker’s 61-yard record. I attempted at 57, had the length but it didn’t go in between the small goal posts. It was a lot of fun and definitely blew up more than I could ever imagine<br /><br /><b>[Lloyd also revealed that there have been some initial discussions about her getting a shot in the NFL]</b> There’s been some interesting chatter about it. I think anything is possible. It’s been really interesting because for me, I’m just an athlete, I’m a competitor, but for so many other people I think they’re starting to think, ‘Will there ever be a female in the NFL at some point?’. I think we’re at that crossroads as far as equality and women empowerment so you’re seeing the crosshairs of that. I’ve definitely got some enquiries, I’ve definitely got some people talking.

  <p><b>[Carli Lloyd believes she could be a successful NFL kicker after going viral for making a 55-yard field goal while visiting a Philadelphia Eagles practice]</b> I love the Eagles. I’ve been an Eagles fan my whole life. I had an off-day and I figured I’d come out … I brought my boots. I could kick all day long. I could kick field goals all day long. I absolutely love it. There’s a lot the same with kicking a soccer ball and kicking a football. I love kicking long balls in soccer, and it carries over to football. The technique is the same, and I think I’m very accurate. I started at 25 <b>[yards]</b>, and they kept moving me back. I hit one short, I think. There were a couple with the wind that went wide. I got to 55, and that was it. One take. It was good. I had no idea anyone was videotaping it or putting it on cell-phone video. I tried from 57, but it was wide; the distance was good. I would have kept going - my competitive nature. But I felt like I was holding them up out there<br /><br /><b>[Lloyd was flooded with messages after the clip went viral on social media]</b> When we got in the car, it was unbelievable. The texts, the videos, everything going viral. I had no idea. It was insane. It still is insane. I could not believe the attention on social media. I just had a conversation with Randy <b>[Brown, the former mayor of a town near Lloyd’s home and assistant special-teams coach with the Baltimore Ravens]</b>, actually. The coaches and his GM, they all saw the video. They were like, ‘What is she doing next week?’. I’m laughing about it, but the more I think about it, this has the chance to be sort of a pioneering moment for women<br /><br /><b>[The USWNT veteran, who helped her side retain the World Cup in July, hopes one day there could be a place for women in the NFL]</b> I know that I could actually probably do it. Put on the helmet, strap on the pads, go for it. The mindset I have, I think with practice, I know I have to work on my steps and my technique, but I think I could do it and do it well. It could be a huge, pivotal moment. There is no reason why a woman could not do this. And I actually invite the pressure. I love the pressure. When I have to nail something - shooting hoops, axe-throwing, kicking a field goal - that is the moment I live for and want. It’s worth having some conversations about it. With practice and someone showing me, I know I can do it. I have one of the most accurate shots in our game. <b>[The]</b> big thing would be getting used to the big boys out there. But nothing scares me. You hold yourself back if you’re afraid. What’s the worst that can happen? I don’t make the team? Let’s just say I did try. Maybe I change the landscape a lot</p>

  <p><b>[Carli Lloyd has found herself talking seriously about becoming an NFL placekicker]</b> There’s got to be a first for everything. I know that mentally you need to have thick skin, you’ve got to be mentally tough. I invite pressure, I love pressure, I’ve got that all kind of ticked off and now it’s just a matter of knowing if I can do it and go from there<br /><br /><b>[For one, she’ll have to do so with a helmet and pads on. She also won’t have the luxury of kicking without any resistance in front of her]</b> I’d maybe need a couple 300-pound men to rush at me. I want to actually go out there and try to take a two-step kick to make sure that I can actually do it. If I can do that from a pretty good distance then I would feel a lot more comfortable.<br /><br /><b>[Ellis is set to leave her position in October and when her replacement comes in, Lloyd will have much more clarity on whether her future will involve footballs of a round or oblong shape]</b> I’m waiting on a new coach to be announced and if that coach would like to see me in the Olympic plans then I’m all for it. But if that coach doesn’t then I’ve got to think of some other things that I want to do.</p>

<p><br /><br /><b>[Could Lloyd take a hit? Most NFL kickers are among their teams’ smallest and most vulnerable players anyway, and Lloyd is under no illusions that she’d be any different]</b> You can’t really touch a kicker but it happens. But yeah, 300 pounds coming at me, I’d probably try to give my best shot but I don’t know, I might be in the hospital after that</p>

Hopefully we can sit down with U.S. Soccer again and figure things out<br /><br />When I stepped on the field tonight I kind of thought it would be fitting to do it.

You guys may never know. Like I said, I have a game this Thursday, which I happen to be playing in Philadelphia. It’s not something I would’ve passed up. First and foremost, I am a soccer player. But it’s been crazy. A casual day, me just having some fun, being competitive and kicking field goals went to being the most talked-about news around the globe. It’s just crazy how all of that works<br /><br />I know that there’s some challenges involved with this and I know that there’s probably some players and people and everybody around the globe thinking this is the craziest thing<br /><br />I also see it from the one perspective of maybe this is kind of something that’s going to break down some barriers and give people, women especially, the confidence to know that maybe they can be a part of any NFL team as a kicker. I’m not trying to be a running back or a quarterback; that would be an epic fail. But I do know that I could kick a ball pretty well and I pride myself in my technique and really it’s all about getting it up and over. I know that there’s loads of people that are saying, you know, big men coming at you. I don’t know. I’d have to seriously go out to the field. Helmet, pads, two-step, really get the technique down, really practice it and then kind of see from there if it’s possible<br /><br /><b>[The NFL does have female officials, female scouts as well as female assistant coaches. So could a female kicker be the next step?]</b> No other female has ever done this on the professional stage, so I know there are a lot of challenges and I get that. I’ve had other girls that have played for their youth teams or high school teams as a kicker and I’ve gotten messages saying that I’ve given them the confidence to go for it even more. That’s kind of the message that you want to hear. Obviously, there’s challenges with that, playing in male-dominated sports. But we live in a different time in this world. I think anything is possible. I think somebody’s got to be the first one, right?</p>

But somehow, you see light at the end of the tunnel, and I can honestly say I’m having more fun now playing than I ever have in my career. I think I just learned a lot throughout it. There’s no denying it, I deserved to be on that field that whole World Cup, but I wasn’t. And I think I’ve grown as a person, as a player. It sucked. It absolutely sucked<br /><br />I was super happy for my teammates and happy for Megan, who put the team on her back, and for several other players.

  <p><b>[USWNT star Lloyd loving life under Andonovski]</b> Vlatko has held everyone accountable, no matter who you are or how old you are. If you are playing well in games and in training, you will play. I love that<br /><br />Vlatko has a unique and dynamic philosophy of how he would like the team to play. He has identified our strengths and is tweaking his philosophy to get the best out of our team. I like that he states that no two games are the same and we need to adapt to the day<br /><br />It is also the first time that we have had a coach in all my years on the national team that takes a big interest in improving us as individuals. Vlatko has brought a rich learning environment to our team. It really is very different to the past<br /><br />Vlatko has slowly integrated his style of play since coming in and we have been able to implement it with each camp we have been together. In <b>[Olympic]</b> qualifying, you saw the team starting to come together and getting better with each game and in the She Believes Cup we continued to improve. We played three different opponents, England, Spain and Japan, who played three different styles and we adapted to all three. I think we walked away knowing we have become a lot more versatile as a unit, but also knowing that there are certain areas where we can improve<br /><br />I try to find the silver lining in every situation I am faced with. A lot is out of our control right now, but our attitude toward life is in our control. I have never had this much time to pause my life and have nothing planned on my calendar. I’ve been enjoying time with my husband after being on the road my entire career. I’ve also been enjoying cooking and trying different recipes, getting some things done around our house, and, thankfully, we have a facility that I can go in and train five-to-six days a week. I have been building up my fitness, becoming stronger and super sharp with my touches on the ball. I now have an opportunity to continue to become the best I possibly can in this next year<br /><br />I have not spoken to anyone yet but I’m sure I will at some point. I know they are busy implementing their ideas and I hope to provide input when the time is right. As I’ve got older, I have gained more and more interest into the development methods and systems we are using to grow the game. I have my views and hope I can express them when the time is right</p>
