  <p><b>[Alen Stajcic praises star forward <a href="sam-kerr.html">Samantha Kerr</a> after her superb performances throughout 2017]</b> The amount of attention she has received in the past few months has gone from zero to 100 in terms of publicity and in the media. To come out and still perform shows how much she has matured as a person and shows her sporting quality. She is really becoming one of the superstars of Australian sport</p>

  <p><b>[Alen Stajcic speaks after his side defeated Brazil 3-1 in the Tournament of Nations]</b> The last time we played them they <b>[Brazil]</b> walked off pretty unhappy having been beaten by ‘little old Australia’, the country that doesn’t really play football, beating the football powerhouse</p>

  <p><b>[In their statement on Friday, the FFA stressed that Heather Reid’s comments at the time of <a href="alen-stajcic.html">Stajcic</a>’s sacking didn’t impact their decision to part ways with the coach]</b> FFA by this statement wishes to make clear that <a href="alen-stajcic.html">Alen Stajcic</a>’s contract was not terminated on the basis that he had breached his contract or had engaged in any misconduct. Any inference that has been drawn about these being reasons for Alen’s contract termination is wrong. FFA acknowledges that some of the speculation about the termination of Alen’s contract was caused by statements made by one of its directors, Heather Reid. These statements were not made on behalf of FFA and did not reflect the decision of the Board or the reasons why it made that decision</p>

  <p><b>[The transformation of Australia’s Sam Kerr: From wild winger to best No.9 in women’s football]</b> The first time we all saw <a href="sam-kerr.html">Sam Kerr</a> play we all thought she was something special. A gifted mover, mobile, athletic and the ability to beat opponents with ease - and most importantly the desire to run with the ball and not fear trying to be unpredictable or creative</p>

  <p><b>[Stajcic rewards Lewis Miller with senior contract]</b> Lewis has shown a lot of promise this season and has shown great poise since coming into the side, so it’s great that we can reward him with a new contract<br /><br />He’s a very talented footballer, and he continues to grow and mature - he has potentially a very exciting future ahead of him and our job here is to help him develop to his full potential<br /><br />It’s great to see the Mariners giving boys like Lewis, Sammy <b>[Silvera]</b>, Gianni <b>[Stensness]</b> a real chance to show what they can do as a core value at this club is to discover and allow really talented boys to flourish in a professional environment</p>
