  <p><b>[Frank Stapleton says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> Can Be Stronger Without <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>]</b> I feel that money will be used very, very quickly. When the top players have left <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> the actual team has not been diminished in any way, they have gone on to be stronger again. The Champions League final for <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> will have opened his eyes, what Man United need to do to stay top, not only in England but in Europe</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> Striker Frank Stapleton Expects Great Things From <a href="javier-hernandez.html">Javier Hernandez</a> After World Cup 2010 Showing]</b> United fans’ views on him are now totally different and I think the expectations are now going to be much higher. He might have arrived without much of a fanfare at the start of the new season but he has shown at the World Cup that perhaps we can expect more from him. He has a good opportunity now to hit the ground running in England. Time will tell how he handles that. But the good thing for him is that <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> knows just how to introduce young players.<br /><br />If the player shows up well early on in pre-season then the manager might just says let’s go with him. Players find their level. It might start well for Hernandez and then he peaks and there is a reaction. But <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> will see that and know it is time to give him a breather. He might not have considered Javier for an immediate impact.<br /><br />But it has happened in the past where players who were looked on as ‘ones for the future’ have made such a good early impression that the United manager has given them a chance. I am sure Sir Alex will have been taken by what he saw at the World Cup. None of us knew what to expect from Hernandez. Nobody had seen anything of him and in truth those early games didn’t suggest much.<br /><br />But he grew in the tournament and when you score goals of the quality he has on the biggest stage of the lot then you have to sit up and take notice.</p>

  <p><b>[Former international Frank Stapleton has suggested that the Ireland captain must accept the fact that he may not be guaranteed a starting place in <a href="giovanni-trapattoni.html">Giovanni Trapattoni</a>’s team]</b> It comes to us all, but at the same time I think that Robbie would still be delighted to be part of it. And he is realistic enough to know that he won’t be always starting and that he may be thrown in in games to try and turn things round if there is a problem. I think you have to come to terms with that. It is not easy but you have got to be realistic in the modern game<br /><br />It’s down to him staying fit. He knows how competitive it is at international level. He may not be getting that level of fitness at club level but at some point you can switch on to that. It doesn’t mean that you will be as sharp but we still shouldn’t dismiss what Robbie has to offer because he has experience and he did so much during his career, for Ireland mainly. Transition is the word but how do you find a replacement? How do you find someone who is going to give you goals to win matches. At the moment, we need one or two of the other lads who are coming through to all of a sudden have a spurt and start scoring at that level. I know people might ask, ‘should Robbie be starting?’. I don’t know whether the manager is going to start him or not and certainly this game against Poland is the chance to give somebody else the chance</p>
