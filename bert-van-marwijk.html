  <p><b>[The Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk is confident that <a href="robin-van-persie.html">Robin van Persie</a> will shine for Oranje]</b> <a href="robin-van-persie.html">Robin van Persie</a>’s such an amazing footballer. He hardly needs any space or time to become dangerous. He’s shown that again during the training session in the past couple of days. I had a lot of faith in him during the 2010 World Cup and he won’t miss out on a spot in Oranje just like that. He can play in several positions. He’s played as a right winger, as a forward in a 4-4-2 formation and even as a ‘trequartista’. And he’s performed at a very high level in all those positions.</p>

  <p><b>[GERMANY 2-1 THE NETHERLANDS, JULY 7 1974]</b> The players all know each other very well. They have either played with each other or have locked horns several times. They have a lot of respect for each other and that’s the way it should be. Germany versus the Netherlands will always be a special game. I’m part of the 1974 generation, so I still vividly remember that time. The relationship has improved a lot since then, though</p>

  <p><b>[Bert van Marwijk speaks in his first press conference since taking the job]</b> In modern football you have to have influence on the game when you don’t have the ball. In modern football it’s all about transition. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> may have the best team in the world. They may have the best possession, but they also score the most goals out of transition. I go to the World Cup with only one thing that counts - to survive the first round. If I didn’t have confidence in <b>[getting to the next round of World Cup]</b>, I wouldn’t be sitting here</p>

  <p><b>[Bert van Marwijk says his new-look UAE are on the right track]</b> I think we have almost 50 per cent of a new team, with very young players. This is the second game in the qualification and when I now see the performance of this team, I can be satisfied.<br /><br />I think we played a good game. The players showed a lot of discipline on the pitch; we didn’t have a yellow card either. We had full control of the game, the only thing from the first half was the last pass. We were not stable and secure enough with the through-ball.<br /><br />In the second half, it was much better. We scored four goals. I can be satisfied and very happy.<br /><br /><b>[Appointed in March, Van Marwijk chose the same starting line-up as against Malaysia, with four players - Ali Saleh, Khalifa Al Hammadi, Mohammed Al Attas and Jassim Yaqoub - aged 23 and under]</b> Young players can become better players when they train. So that is always the doubt of a coach. On one side you want to give the young players a stage to perform at this level. On the other side, you also want to win</p>

  <p><b>[UAE manager Bert van Marwijk ‘frustrated’ after World Cup qualifier defeat in Thailand]</b> The result of the match makes sense especially after the outstanding performance of the Thailand team, who deserved to win and lead the group. But I was saddened after Thailand’s second goal, which me frustrated a lot, although I was happy with Mabkhout’s goal. We tried to equalise, but we weren’t successful and could not translate the chances into goals<br /><br />Although I am not satisfied with the performance, we were almost going to win the match, especially with the last opportunity in the second half and the final minutes of the match. <br /><br />We are not very good, we played almost good. But that’s football, something that happens. It’s nothing <b>[on our hopes of qualification]</b>; if we win or we lose, it’s the same. We know Vietnam very well, they are a good team. But we will come back very strongly</p>
