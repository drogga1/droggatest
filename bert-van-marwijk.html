  <p><b>[The Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk is confident that <a href="robin-van-persie.html">Robin van Persie</a> will shine for Oranje]</b> <a href="robin-van-persie.html">Robin van Persie</a>’s such an amazing footballer. He hardly needs any space or time to become dangerous. He’s shown that again during the training session in the past couple of days. I had a lot of faith in him during the 2010 World Cup and he won’t miss out on a spot in Oranje just like that. He can play in several positions. He’s played as a right winger, as a forward in a 4-4-2 formation and even as a ‘trequartista’. And he’s performed at a very high level in all those positions.</p>

  <p><b>[GERMANY 2-1 THE NETHERLANDS, JULY 7 1974]</b> The players all know each other very well. They have either played with each other or have locked horns several times. They have a lot of respect for each other and that’s the way it should be. Germany versus the Netherlands will always be a special game. I’m part of the 1974 generation, so I still vividly remember that time. The relationship has improved a lot since then, though</p>

  <p><b>[Bert Van Marwijk appointed Socceroos coach for World Cup in Russia]</b> I know a lot about the players and how the team has been playing after coaching against them for the two World Cup qualifiers, in 2016 and in June last year. I have also been impressed by the national team set-up that the FFA has developed over the past few years. I want to thank Steven Lowy, David Gallop and <b>[FFA’s Head of National Performance]</b> Luke Casserly for the confidence they have shown in me. My response to them has been that we are not going to Russia just to be competitive. I want to win our matches.<br /><br />I know a lot about the players and how the team has been playing after coaching against them for the two World Cup qualifiers, in 2016 and in June last year.

  <p><b>[New Australian boss Bert van Marwijk has brushed suggestions he will follow the legacy set by former coach Ange Postecoglou]</b> I have respect for the former coach, but I will do it my way. I’m a realistic coach. I like creative football, I like to have the ball but I also like to win. That’s the most important thing. I think it’s important we play in a way that fits the players. Also the coach. You cannot play in a way the players cannot do. In modern football you have to have influence on the game when you don’t have the ball. In modern football it’s all about transition. Manchester City may have the best team in the world. They may have the best possession, but they also score the most goals out of transition.<br /><br /><b>[On Tim Cahill]</b> I think it’s a very good signal that he’s gone to play for Millwall. But I will not say anything on the qualities of the players<br /><br /><b>[Van Marwijk outlined his goal was to get the Socceroos to the knockout stages]</b> I go to the World Cup with only one thing that counts - to survive the first round. If I didn’t have confidence in <b>[getting to the next round of World Cup]</b>, I wouldn’t be sitting here. They <b>[Australia]</b> can play football. They try to play football. They are strong physically. The challenge is to let them play in a way that we have more chance to win games for example against France</p>

He’s a young player, he has to learn a lot. But he can make a difference. If he can make a difference in the last 10 minutes, I will not hesitate <b>[to pick him]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[On Fran Karacic]</b> He is playing in the highest division in Croatia. He is already the captain. He plays only right back. I didn’t see him myself. The information came from <b>[assistant coach]</b> Ante Milicic. We don’t have a lot of choices for the right back position. He is one of them</p>

  <p><b>[Socceroos coach Bert Van Marwijk believes the Video Assistant Referee system should be implemented like its tennis challenge countepart]</b> I saw the goal but I didn’t really see it that well from my position. Later on I heard that it was offside. In tennis the players can decide when they use the video referee. Maybe we can think about giving both teams one or two or maybe three possibilities to ask the video referee. Maybe that’s better and more honest because now everybody is depending on what the video referee thinks and sees <b>[when it comes to flagging decisions]</b>.<br /><br />I understand that you try to change the rules to make football better. A camera on the goal - I understand that. A video referee - I understand that. But I already have seen games with video referees where nobody has seen the incident in which the VAR is flagging. The on-field referee had already made the decision earlier but is forced to take minutes over on the sidelines reviewing the incident, while everyone in the stadium doesn’t know what is happening. <b>[The process]</b> has to be quicker and faster to make decisions</p>

  <p><b>[Van Marwijk acknowledged the ruthless nature of the squad cuts]</b> It is always a challenging task to reduce a squad, however this is the nature of professional sport at the highest level. Overall, I believe we have named a strong and ambitious squad for our training camp in Turkey and friendly against Czech Republic in Austria. I am sure that in training in Antalya, and in our match against the Czech Republic, we will see players pushing to go to a higher level as they compete for a place in the final squad.</p>

  <p><b>[Asian Cup hero James Troisi among four axed from Australia’s final World Cup list]</b> I have been very pleased with the effort and application of all of the players during our time in Turkey, and in Austria. Every step of the selection process has been difficult because the players have all given everything to make the final selection. However considering many factors, we have now settled on our final squad for Russia. I believe this group of players can do Australia proud at the world’s biggest football tournament if we continue to work collectively and intensively over the next two weeks and into the competition.</p>

  <p><b>[Bert van Marwijk has certainly been impressed with Daniel Arzani to date]</b> Everybody knows he’s a big talent but he hasn’t played so long in Australia. It’s an exception that I named him in the squad but I trust his qualities. He has to learn a lot but he’s very talented and an intelligent player. I think it’s good for him to play 25 minutes today. We will see for the next game if he starts.</p>

  <p><b>[Bert van Marwijk feeling Australian ahead of facing ‘emotional’ Peru]</b> I feel already, a little bit, as an Australian. It’s been very nice to work with these players and the whole squad.<br /><br />The opponent is an emotional team so you can expect everything. We have to trust our way of playing. I think that’s the key so there is nothing to do with forcing some things. Forcing things is only in the second half, and it depends on how the situation is. I don’t think you must force something from the beginning. We must first get our natural rhythm that we play</p>

  <p><b>[Socceroos adamant Peru’s first goal was offside]</b> In my opinion we are unlucky because the first goal was offside and the second goal was very lucky<br /><br />We became better and better, but at the World Cup you can see for this team it is difficult to make goals at this level, because against France we were at least equal and against Denmark even better. But in all three games we couldn’t make the difference in goals and that is something this squad misses at this level. When you see the statistics today, we had maybe 60 percent possession and we had a lot more chances and shots at goal, I feel they shot three times and made two goals</p>

  <p><b>[Bert van Marwijk says his new-look UAE are on the right track]</b> I think we have almost 50 per cent of a new team, with very young players. This is the second game in the qualification and when I now see the performance of this team, I can be satisfied.<br /><br />I think we played a good game. The players showed a lot of discipline on the pitch; we didn’t have a yellow card either. We had full control of the game, the only thing from the first half was the last pass. We were not stable and secure enough with the through-ball.<br /><br />In the second half, it was much better. We scored four goals. I can be satisfied and very happy.<br /><br /><b>[Appointed in March, Van Marwijk chose the same starting line-up as against Malaysia, with four players - Ali Saleh, Khalifa Al Hammadi, Mohammed Al Attas and Jassim Yaqoub - aged 23 and under]</b> Young players can become better players when they train. So that is always the doubt of a coach. On one side you want to give the young players a stage to perform at this level. On the other side, you also want to win</p>

  <p><b>[UAE manager Bert van Marwijk ‘frustrated’ after World Cup qualifier defeat in Thailand]</b> The result of the match makes sense especially after the outstanding performance of the Thailand team, who deserved to win and lead the group. But I was saddened after Thailand’s second goal, which me frustrated a lot, although I was happy with Mabkhout’s goal. We tried to equalise, but we weren’t successful and could not translate the chances into goals<br /><br />Although I am not satisfied with the performance, we were almost going to win the match, especially with the last opportunity in the second half and the final minutes of the match.<br /><br />We are not very good, we played almost good. But that’s football, something that happens. It’s nothing <b>[on our hopes of qualification]</b>; if we win or we lose, it’s the same. We know Vietnam very well, they are a good team. But we will come back very strongly</p>
