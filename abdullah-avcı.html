  <p><b>[New Besiktas coach Abdullah Avcı says Frank Lampard is following in the footsteps of predecessor Maurizio Sarri in playing N’Golo Kante as a box-to-box midfielder. Chelsea vs Liverpool in Istabul]</b> Kante’s return to the starting line-up significantly improved Chelsea. It’s impossible to define Kante as a classic defensive midfielder. Lampard assigned him to a box-to-box role against Liverpool and this resulted in an impressive performance<br /><br /><b>[Known for his tough tackline and breaking up play, Kante impressed Avcı in possession and with his willingness to carry the ball forward, and he was quick to back Sarri’s previous decision]</b> He made eight successful dribbles which is his career high! Sarri was constantly criticised for this but Kante was the best Chelsea player on the pitch<br /><br /><b>[Despite being a huge fan of Kante’s display, there was another player who caught his eye]</b> I also liked Pedro. He’s the ideal attacking wing player in modern football; he can help his team, protect the ball, he doesn’t lose possession easily and can dribble past his opponent in the blink of an eye<br /><br />With Maurizio Sarri, Chelsea used 4-3-3 formation very efficiently and became one of the fastest-passing teams in the Premier League. They made a good start but had some troubles in the final third as the season continued. It appears that we’ll see mainly a 4-2-3-1 formation this season. Before the Liverpool game, I was expecting Chelsea to have less possession and go with a more transitional offense mentality with Frank Lampard. This UEFA Super Cup game proved my expectations are correct. However, they may struggle gaining results if these defensive problems aren’t fixed. Obviously, it’ll take time for us to see what Lampard has in mind but this team have a strong tactical-memory from last season and I believe that this philosophy will evolve into a more efficient strategy</p>
