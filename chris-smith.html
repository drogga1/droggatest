  <p><b>[Wolverhampton Wanderers supporter Chris Smith speaking emotionally to the club’s official website after players at the English Championship club raised £8,000 for his daughter Jessie-Leigh, who suffers from cerebral palsy, as a surprise Christmas gift. The funds raised will help Jessie-Leigh have an operation to help her live more comfortably and potentially allow her to walk]</b> I was lost for words and can’t thank the players enough. I had no idea this was going to happen. We have already raised half for the operation with various activities. We have been going to a lot of lengths to try and achieve this. It is a long operation with a lot to go through afterwards, but hopefully, we will reach the goal that we have set out to do, which is for Jessie-Leigh to take her first steps</p>
