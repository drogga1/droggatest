  <p><b>[Fenerbahce’s Josef De Souza, who counts Teixeira as a close friend and played alongside the forward for Vasco Da Gama, insists Alex Teixeira still wants to join the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> outfit and only moved for the money]</b> I spoke to Alex, and really, he said that things were well advanced <b>[to go to Liverpool]</b>. And then I talked to him again, when he signed for the club from China. And Alex, I can say that he was totally willing to go to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. And he still keeps that dream, from what he told me, in his heart. Of course he wanted to play for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. But it happened, football has these things. I think it was good for him, good for his family. Our career is very short, and the more you can combine one thing with another: play in a good league and earn money, that’s great. But if you can’t put the two together, it is obvious that filling your pockets will speak much louder</p>
