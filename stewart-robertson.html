  <p><b>[Rangers managing director Stewart Robertson believes Caixinha is the best man for the job]</b> We are delighted to welcome Pedro to Rangers. We compiled a shortlist of high-quality candidates for the position but we knew after our initial meeting with Pedro that he was the right man to take this club forward. He is a man of great experience and authority and the board has no doubt he will help us achieve our long-term goals. I would like to thank the Rangers supporters for their patience throughout the process but we were determined to appoint the best candidate possible.<br /><br />I would also like to thank Graeme Murty for taking control of the first team. He will complete his duties at Celtic Park on Sunday before returning to his role with the under-20s and Pedro will begin his work on Monday morning.</p>

  <p><b>[Rangers managing director Stewart Robertson has reiterated the club’s support of VAR in a statement which claims striker <a href="alfredo-morelos.html">Alfredo Morelos</a> is singled out for special attention in Scottish football]</b> This is not a criticism of referees because they often have to perform under very difficult conditions and in a highly emotive environment, as do our players and coaches. The speed at which the modern game is played also means it is extremely difficult to make split-second calls with the degree of certainty required. We believe the introduction of VAR would help referees enormously and reduce the number of wrong decisions which sometimes have a dramatic effect on the outcome of matches. In recent weeks, Rangers has suffered from errors of judgement but it is our strong view that VAR would be to the benefit of everyone and in particular the referees themselves</p>
