  <p><b>[Kevin Sheedy backs ‘leader’ Seamus Coleman to shine at Euro 2016]</b> Seamus has become a leader in that group. He has shown all the attributes he has at Everton on the international stage now and it is no surprise that Martin has made him captain in games. He will be really looking forward to the competition and I think Seamus will do really well.<br /><br />I go back to my own experiences playing in Germany in 1988. Our first match was against England and it is important not to get beaten in your first game. If Ireland can win their opener against Sweden then they have a great chance of qualifying. It is a really tough group with Belgium and Italy in there as well. But with the Irish support that will be there, and the squad we have and players playing for top sides, I am hopeful we can do really well out there</p>
