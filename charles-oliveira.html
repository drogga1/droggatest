  <p><b>[Charles Oliveira talks about Khabib Nurmagomedov]</b> I can’t say anything about Khabib, he’s been defeating everybody, He beat all the top guys. But they’re all strikers, none of them were jiu-jitsu guys who were unafraid of being taken down. I’m the answer to his game, I’m the right guy to fight Khabib, I think that, if I win two more fights, who knows, I might have this opportunity to fight him. It would be great since I have my jiu-jitsu and I’m not afraid of being taken down</p>

  <p><b>[Charles Oliveira Is Focused On Climbing To The Top]</b> Everything happened the way it should have happened. I lost to some big names, former champions and fighters that became champions after, but everything that happened was part of my journey. I had my ups and downs. I accepted some fights that now I don’t think I should have, but I see myself in the best moment of my career right now and I’m ready for everything<br /><br /><b>[I accepted some fights that now I don’t think I should have, but I see myself in the best moment of my career right now and I’m ready for everything]</b> My daughter was born two years ago and that changed my life completely. Also, after my loss to Paul Felder, my team and I sat down and said, ‘We need to change a few things.’ We figured out where I could improve, fixed things and that’s when everything clicked<br /><br /><b>[the fact that he’s etched his name in the UFC record books clearly means something to the streaking Brazilian finisher]</b> <b>[The ups and downs earlier in my career]</b> made me learn a lot, made me evolve and that’s why today I’m the UFC fighter with the most submission finishes ever. <b>[Holding that record]</b> makes me really proud. I came from a poor community and now I have the most submission finishes in the UFC. I broke Royce’s record and have added to it two more times. I have a lot of good things going on in my life and I’m really proud of everything that has happened<br /><br />I wanted to fight and I was ready to fight anybody the UFC offered me. I would have accepted any name the UFC offered me.<br /><br /><b>[offering his assessment of Gordon and how he sees the fight playing out]</b> He’s a tough guy. He moves forward, has some good takedowns, and takes a lot of punches. It’s going to be a big war on Saturday, but I’m going to do what I always do: show that I’m a better fighter standing up and put on a great show again for the Sao Paulo crowd. I want to beat this guy on Saturday and hopefully it won’t last long so I can get another fight this year because next year, I want to focus on the belt</p>

  <p><b>[Charles Oliveira is now on 6 fight win streak, and he has the second most finishes in UFC history(15) following the 16 finishes of Donald Cerrone]</b> I don’t care who it is, I don’t care what name he has if they come in here it’s going to be a bad night</p>

  <p><b>[Charles Oliveira continues to engrave his name deeper into the history of UFC. In his latest stint, Charles went up against Kevin Lee and extended his win-streak]</b> I would fight <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> in any weight, no problem. It would be a good fight, I’d really like to fight him. It could be at 155 or 170, it doesn’t matter<br /><br /><b>[After defeating Kevin Lee, Oliveira stated that he is ready to fight for the UFC Lightweight Championship]</b> I’m ready to fight for it now. There’s not much I can say, I don’t leave it in the hands of the judges. I knock out or I submit. It’s my time. It’s a new history, it’s a new Charles</p>

  <p><b>[Charles Oliveira Believes <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> Vs. <a href="tony-ferguson.html">Tony Ferguson</a> Is Cursed]</b> I think this Khabib fight with <a href="tony-ferguson.html">Tony Ferguson</a> will never happen. Something always happens, someone gets hurt. This time was the coronavirus<br /><br /><b>[Oliveira believes that will likely be the case as he feels Ferguson has the edge over Gaethje]</b> <a href="tony-ferguson.html">Tony Ferguson</a> is in a very good moment in his life, is beating everyone, and <b>[he]</b> has a unique style. I think it would be a tough fight for <a href="justin-gaethje.html">Justin Gaethje</a> now, because <a href="tony-ferguson.html">Tony Ferguson</a> was training to fight the champion <b>[and had]</b> an opportunity to become the world champion. So he was definitely training like never before, and <a href="justin-gaethje.html">Justin Gaethje</a> wasn’t training for a fight.<br /><br /><b>[…]</b> Now that he <b>[Gaethje]</b> has more time, he will get better prepared. We know he has heavy hands, hits really hard, so anything can happen. But I still think <a href="tony-ferguson.html">Tony Ferguson</a> wins<br /><br /><b>[he has a few targets in mind]</b> Looks like <a href="dustin-poirier.html">Dustin Poirier</a> will fight that skinny guy, Dan Hooker, so the only ones left are <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a>, Donald Cerrone and Paul Felder. Since Cerrone was one of the last fights I lost, who knows. I’ve been asking for a fight with <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> for a while, but if it doesn’t happen, we’ll see</p>
