<blockquote>
  <p>It’s no secret that Turkish President <a href="recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> sees his country as the pre-eminent Muslim power in the Middle East. He regards his vision of political Islam as competing with that of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. He frequently accuses the United States of trying to belittle his country, and ruminates about a ‘greater Turkey’<br /><br />It was the first time <a href="recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Erdogan</a>, who was speaking at a provincial rally of his governing AKP party, had raised the subject <b>[of nuclear weapons]</b>. It may have been the Turkish leader riling up his nationalist base. It may also have been a warning that, should Iran and Saudi Arabia move toward becoming nuclear-armed states, Turkey would not stand idly by<br /><br /><a href="recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Erdogan</a> has compared both modern Germany and Israel with the Nazis, and has threatened to unleash hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees on Europe<br /><br />But it’s a long leap … to a program to develop nuclear weapons. Turkey is developing (with Russian help) a nuclear power program, but it is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and there is a whole world of difference between nuclear energy and nuclear weapons<br /><br />Ziya Meral says this appeals to religious and conservative circles as well as an influential strand of opinion that welcomes <a href="recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Erdogan</a> taking a stand against what are perceived as the double standards of the West<br /><br />… Partly in response to Europe’s less than wholehearted embrace, <a href="recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Erdogan</a> has imagined a new place for Turkey, one where it will pick and choose its allies and project power thousands of miles from its coast. This expansionist role includes a garrison of troops in Qatar, a growing naval role in the Red Sea, support for Libya’s government against the Saudi/UAE-backed forces of Khalifa Haftar and Turkey’s largest overseas military base in Somalia<br /><br /><a href="recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Erdogan</a> has already taken this tack when complaining about western ‘financiers’ undermining the Turkish economy. Last year, as the Turkish lira crumbled on international markets, he said those who plotted against Turkey in a failed coup attempt were instead trying to target the country through its economy. And during his spat with the Trump administration over the detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson, <a href="recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Erdogan</a> declared: ‘This is not some random country. This is Turkey’<br /><br />Now in power for nearly 17 years, President <a href="recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Erdogan</a> is Turkish policy. Power has been concentrated in a small circle around him; Ankara’s foreign policy is driven by his instincts. They may change depending on tactical advantage (the fall-out and subsequent make-up with Moscow, for example, and the exploitation of Jamal Khashoggi’s murder to seek to humiliate the Saudis).</p>
