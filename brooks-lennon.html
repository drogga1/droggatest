<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Having joined Liverpool in 2015, Lennon competed for a place in the Under-23 squad and earned one]</b> There’s players from all over the world fighting for positions. I got so many new experiences over there. I grew as a player, on and off the field. I’m incorporating what I’ve learned over there in my game now.<br /><br />I knew I wanted to go on loan to get some first-team experience and RSL was my club when I was going to the academy, before I headed over to Liverpool. They were open to having me come back - they were really excited for me to come on loan, so I think it was the best option for me<br /><br />I think some of the guys here have really taken me under their wing and showed me what it takes to succeed in MLS. They made the transition really easy and I feel really comfortable with this team. Obviously Kyle Beckerman is a guy who is a leader on and off the field. Chris Wingert, Yura Movsisyan - all these guys have given me tips on what to do and what not to do. I think having those guys on the team, especially as a young player, helps in confidence<br /><br />It was different. Living in a foreign country is hard sometimes. You have to get used to the culture and coming from Arizona and moving to Liverpool was a big culture shock but I think I dealt with it really well and I enjoyed myself over there. I grew as a player and I got experiences that I wouldn’t have gotten if I didn’t make that decision. I’m really happy that I went to Liverpool for so long and that I’m still with such a historic club. I think me being in Liverpool was a really big thing for my career and I’m really happy I made the decision<br /><br /><b>[On Jurgen Klopp]</b> He’s a world-renowned coach, very passionate about the game, wants to win and you can just see that in the training sessions. I think he liked how I played as a player and how I worked really hard and hopefully, I can continue to impress. You never know in the future</p>

  <p><b>[Brooks Lennon believes the United States has the talent to win its first Under-20 World Cup]</b> Really excited. I’m unbelievably honored and proud to be called up for the World Cup. Every kid’s dream is to play in a World Cup so I’m really excited and can’t wait to get started.<br /><br />I’m going to set the expectation bar pretty high. We have unbelievable talent on that team. We have a team under an unbelievable coach in Tab Ramos who is really highly <b>[regarded]</b> in U.S. Soccer and the world. If we can just follow what he says and start playing together, then honestly, I think we can win the whole tournament with the talent that we have<br /><br />It felt great.The Mexico-U.S. rivalry is always a big one and coming out with the win was a great feeling. I think that was a pivotal moment in that tournament and we just built off that win and kept the results going and eventually we won the CONCACAF championship. It was a really cool feeling - we made history</p>
