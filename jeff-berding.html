  <p><b>[FC Cincinnati fires Alan Koch]</b> After a series of recent issues and a team culture that had deteriorated, we determined that it’s time to make a change to return a club-centered focus to the team. This decision is not driven by recent game results themselves, but rather the underpinnings that have led to those results. We have not come close to maximizing the talent we have in the dressing room this year, nor have we seen a foundation being built that will set us up for success this year and into next year. Our whole locker room is committed to our club goal of earning an MLS postseason bid, and we need to put them in the best position to do so<br /><br />We appreciate Alan’s contributions to FC Cincinnati in the United Soccer League and wish him well<br /><br /><b>[FC Cincinnati will turn to assistant coach Yoann Damet]</b> I am confident that Yoann will immediately infuse the locker room and soccer staff with a positive energy and team approach. He is respected and trusted and will lead the hard work that gets the best out of our players</p>

  <p><b>[FC Cincinnati officially confirmed Ron Jans’ departure following an investigation, with the Dutchman opting to resign]</b> As <a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a>’s investigation unfolded and some themes emerged, Ron offered his resignation and we agreed that it was the best course of action for everyone involved with FC Cincinnati. We place the utmost importance on a strong culture within our club, beginning in our locker room, and that every person connected with FC Cincinnati feels valued, respected and trusted. Racial and cultural diversity is a major part of what makes the game of soccer so special, and we place the highest priority on respecting every person involved in our game. This includes absolutely everyone associated with our club, from our locker room and front office, all the way through to our fans</p>
