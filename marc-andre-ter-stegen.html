  <p><b>[Barcelona star Marc-Andre ter Stegen has selected the five goalkeeping rivals he considers to be the best in the world]</b> <b>[David]</b> De Gea, <b>[Manuel]</b> Neuer, <b>[Gianluigi]</b> Buffon, Alisson, Ederson. I can’t say who is the best, because all of them have their qualities. There are many goalkeepers out there who can make a difference.<br /><br />A bloody nose. That’s how I ended up as a goalkeeper. A lot of things happened in between, but that’s really what it started with. A boy I played with on my youth team in Monchengladbach, when I was about 10 years old, kept getting them. I’m not sure why. He was our goalkeeper and he got one during a match. Our coach needed someone else to go in the goal, but no one else would. So in I went. When I first began playing football I was a striker. I loved scoring goals. I played to score goals. It’s what made me happy. So I went and played keeper and … I liked it. There wasn’t any big realisation or change for me. I didn’t all of a sudden fall in love with goalkeeping, but … it was fun. And every time I went in, I felt more comfortable. Team-mates and parents would tell me how good I was doing. But despite all that, I still loved the feeling of scoring a goal, rather than stopping them. Scoring - that’s what made me happy. That’s what I wanted to do</p>

  <p><b>[Marc-Andre ter Stegen writes about returning to play against his boyhood club Borussia Monchengladbach]</b> When we arrived, everything was so familiar - but also just a little bit different. For the first time ever, I entered the stadium through the visitor’s entrance. I sat in the visitors changing room, something I had never done before in my senior career. Even walking out to the warm up, I had to correct myself to step onto the other side of the pitch. When I did, I looked up at the stands and all the supporters stood up and started clapping for me. It made me very emotional. I started to get goose bumps all over, and I couldn’t hide the tears in my eyes. Eighteen years, it’s a long time. That’s how long I was at Borussia. It was my life. And I was proud that the fans there still welcomed me. Leaving the pitch that night, though, I felt the difference. Monchengladbach will always be special to me. Monchengladbach will always be the place that shaped my career and that eventually allowed me to live every kid’s dream of playing at the Camp Nou</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen is excited to be considered as one of the team’s leaders this season]</b> The team in general will decide on the captaincy. It’s not the most important thing but I’m proud my name is being mentioned. I’d be proud to be one of Barcelona’s captains, but for me it’s not that important. We don’t need four captains because there are more captains than just four.<br /><br /><b>[On Jasper Cillessen]</b> I can’t really say much about Jasper. If he wants to leave it depends on him. It’s a personal thing. I understand that he wants to play, but I also want to be No 1 and to play in all the competitions. He knows it and the club knows it.<br /><br /><b>[Ter Stegen is no regular for the Germany team]</b> It was hard because, after having a season like the one we had just finished, I was looking forward to the tournament. But you have to respect the decision of the coach. It was very tough not to play, really, but I was there to help the team, which is the least I could do. It was a pity we couldn’t at least reach the quarter-finals, which was the first objective, and then to repeat our success of four years ago. But this is football and sometimes football does not go the way you want</p>

But also, I like to really be far away from everything just to disconnect and to be myself. Spending some time with my wife, which during the year is a bit difficult. And then I’m working on my physical strength which is the least I can do<br /><br /><b>[q: This season is an important one in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> because of the significance of the departure of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. How do you think that impacts the rivalry between the two clubs?]</b> It doesn’t change. Of course, he was a very important player for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and he will be a very important player for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> as well. For us, it doesn’t really change. They have so many good players that we need to be aware of. They’ll have a good season. It’s not just about <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, even if he had a big impact for them. As I said before, we lost <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Andres Iniesta</a>, who was a big personality and a wonderful player, and I think for them it will almost be the same<br /><br /><b>[q: What makes the rivalry between <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> so special?]</b> During all these years, both teams were very close to each other, and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> came up recently a bit more. They’ve won a lot of trophies. We’re big rivals, of course, but then on the other hand we have the political situation in Spain. But I think we as football players we’re always just aware of playing football and we really want just to win our games for the fans, for the supporters, for us and for the whole club<br /><br /><b>[q: Is there another rivalry out there that catches your attention like this one?]</b> I think it’s the biggest rivalry we can find worldwide. I think there are other really big matches out there but I think <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> is always one of the biggest there is<br /><br /><b>[q: How hard was it for you to go to Russia and stay on the bench throughout the entire tournament for Germany?]</b> Very difficult. You need to imagine that you had a good season and then you go with expectations to reach the World Cup and then in the end you’re not playing. Of course, it’s not fun being in this situation. I knew that even if I didn’t play, I had to be supporting the team – to be there for them 100 percent. I think it was the least I could have done, and I did it 100 percent as I always do. It was unlucky that we couldn’t go further than the group stage<br /><br /><b>[q: What do you think Germany can learn from the elimination, and what can you learn from your experience in Russia?]</b> First of all, I think it’s very difficult to say now what we learned from it because we didn’t even play one game <b>[after the group stage]</b>. … We need to work on many problems. I think there was a lot of discussion after we got knocked out, so we need to <b>[examine]</b> things a bit differently now. There was a mix of discussions involving <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> and some other players, but I think the most important thing is that we concentrate on football and be happy to be a part of the national team. I think this got lost in the last couple of years, so what we need to do is just be happy that we can play for such a wonderful nation and that we can play in front of over 80 million people every time we are on the field<br /><br />Yeah, I think there will be a change, for sure. We’ll see how it works when we’re back with the national team, but now it’s just time to focus on the club level, which is, for me at the moment, way more important than the national team. We’ll see when we are back in September with the national team, then we’ll have another opportunity to talk about the national team<br /><br /><b>[q: What has been your initial impression of the Brazilian newcomers <a href="malcom.html">Malcom</a> and Arthur?]</b> I just got to know them recently, just a few days ago. I can mainly speak about them as a person, because it’s very difficult to assess in these two, three, four days. I think they fit very well into the locker room. Very interesting. I saw a bit in the match when they played against Roma <b>[in Dallas]</b>, they’re very interesting football players with a lot of potential. For us, it’s very important that they feel comfortable with us and that they adapt very quickly. They’re Brazilian and speak Portuguese, which is not that far away from Spanish. It’s difficult maybe in the beginning, but step by step they’ll get used to it. I think it’s easier to adapt than a German- or an English-speaking player. … We are all at their disposal to explain what they need to know about <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. And football is so international that everybody understands its language. There are not that many words needed<br /><br /><b>[q: Let’s talk about <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>. How hard is it stopping him in penalty kicks in practice?]</b> I faced him once in an official match. It’s always better to have him on your team than playing against him. It’s not just about <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. We have so many good players, but of course he can make the difference, but we have a lot of players that can make the difference as well. Every player who’s on the field can learn from Leo. It’s not just about football, we’re talking about a guy that’s mentally strong. Look at how many years he’s now played at a big level, always scoring, doing the work he’s doing every day and even getting better. This is what everybody could learn. He’s an idol in this respect for everybody, and one of the people that is working a lot on his own skills, not just looking at the others. He just wants to make himself and the team better, and everyone should think like this. It’s very easy to work with him – he’s a very humble guy, everybody has a good opinion about him – and when it comes to football, there are no words for what he’s capable of doing on the field<br /><br /><b>[q: Psychologically when it comes to defending a penalty kick, how do you try to gain an edge over the kick taker?]</b> You prepare yourself. You know exactly what they did in the past. You know more or less where the kick will go. Of course, you can just see more or less what he’s done in the past, but you never know what he’s going to do. Everybody has a different style, so I wouldn’t want to talk about it since I’m <b>[still]</b> an active player. Everybody has their own style on how to face penalties as a goalkeeper – some aren’t <b>[looking at their opponent]</b>, some do it more, some are moving and some not<br /><br /><b>[q: Were you always a goalkeeper growing up?]</b> No, I started playing on the field and later I got to be the goalkeeper<br /><br /><b>[q: What position?]</b> Ah, it changed. I had some different positions. At first I was a forward, and then step by step I kept moving back and now I’m here at the goal. This was my way<br /><br /><b>[q: People categorize you as a sweeper keeper, so do you think those childhood years playing different positioned may have helped?]</b> To get a good feeling for other positions, for sure. But I was very young. It’s good to have an idea of what the others need to do, so for me at the end, it was always good to have skills with my feet. You have so many modern goalkeepers and they’re all different. There’s not just one type of modern goalkeeper. We have so many good goalkeepers in Europe. When you speak about so many goalkeepers, you speak about so many different styles, and it’s very interesting to see that every <b>[club]</b> has a very good goalkeeper, but different. I like to see differences and I like to talk about them<br /><br /><b>[q: How has the position evolved over the years?]</b> Twenty years ago, you could receive the ball from your own <b>[teammate]</b> and lift it up. Even in this aspect, when this changed, it was very difficult to <b>[adapt]</b> to this change. I never had to deal with it because the rule had already been in place. From that point on, goalkeeping got more and more modern and different<br /><br /><b>[q: Soccer in the United States is growing, but it took a hit when the men’s national team didn’t qualify for the World Cup. What do you think is missing here in this country?]</b> To be honest, I didn’t see a lot of <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, but I know that it was very hard. You have different sports here in the U.S. – I was at the basketball game <b>[recently]</b> and it was totally crazy<br /><br /><b>[q: Which game?]</b> When Miami won the <b>[NBA Finals]</b> trophy <b>[in 2013]</b>. I was in the city and I saw three games when they won it against San Antonio. <b>[The atmosphere]</b> was spectacular. When you compare it to football, maybe there’s some difference, but the sport is growing here and it has way more potential. And this is what we’re trying to do with the International Champions Cup. You see differences but we’re getting closer<br /><br /><a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, I think physically is very good, but also in Germany, Spain and England there are things to improve. It’s very interesting for <b>[Americans]</b> to see the difference and what to work on. For us, the people here are very interested in football. You can fill the stadiums easily when you have a big game coming up. The people like football, it’s not that they don’t like it … it’s a bit shorter than <b>[American]</b> football, so for the people it gets more and more interesting<br /><br /><b>[q: What’s one of your favorite things about America? Is it the food, the movies, the music, the culture? Maybe the sports?]</b> The music is good. I was at the basketball game. When you talk about soccer or football, you need to point out that basketball is way bigger here than in Europe<br /><br /><b>[q: Is basketball probably it for you?]</b> I mean, I was at the big games<br /><br /><b>[q: Is there a basketball team you root for in the United States?]</b> I was just in Miami, so if I had to pick a team it would be Miami. To be honest, I really like what <a href="lebron-james.html">LeBron James</a> is doing. It’s very interesting to follow him a bit<br /><br /><b>[q: He’s in Los Angeles now]</b> Yeah, I know.

  <p><b>[Marc-Andre ter Stegen has revealed that he considered leaving Barcelona]</b> It was a situation that cannot be forgotten. As a person who wants to play all the time, like me, it was a very complicated situation. And the competition with Claudio was not easy at all. I will not deny that there were times when I was thinking about changing, looking for solutions, because you see that the club say: ‘Do not worry, Marc, you have our confidence, you will be here for many years, we trust in your performance’ . But then you see that reality was not like that. With Luis Enrique he talked a lot about it. But of course, he saw that Claudio was also doing a very good job. After two seasons, the situation demanded a solution. In the end, the club sold Bravo and has clearly positioned itself in my favour.<br /><br /><b>[on Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> I do not notice a single player. Madrid has very good players, with a lot of individual quality. It is true that Cristiano has scored many goals and has been a very important player for Real Madrid, of course you will notice his departure from the club. You will see how that is solved in the future. The important thing for us is to be focused on ourselves and to make the season as successful as we can, with the great team we have, be better than everyone else and achieve our objectives</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen admits that the absence of Lionel Messi for Sunday’s Clasico represents a blow]</b> He is in good hands and the most important thing is that he gets fit again and just relaxes and lets us do it. Of course it’s not a nice situation for him. But he is also confident that he will be back on the pitch quickly. If you don’t have the best player in the world in the team, it would be strange if you didn’t notice the difference. But we have so much individual quality in our team that we will try to compensate for his absence as well as possible. It’s important that we show personality and know that we have great players. I am confident for the Clasico.<br /><br /><b>[On Lionel Messi]</b> He has many facets and is a player who demands a lot. That is very positive because he pulls the whole team together. He’s been the best footballer for many years because he just has a talent that cannot be described. Even if you see him, you cannot understand it. Everyone looks at him from a different angle, but he never tires of doing what he does every time. It is very impressive to see how he has been playing at this level for years<br /><br /><b>[On Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> Ronaldo has been a very important player for Madrid in the past, scoring many goals. But Real also has so much quality that they will try to compensate for it differently. The same is true for us: if the best footballer in the world is missing, we have to compensate for it as much as possible and others have to take on this responsibility<br /><br /><b>[On Real Madrid]</b> I think they will be dangerous until the end. But we have to look at ourselves and win our games. We have to get a good feeling and I hope we can carry this on for as long as possible. We have a good atmosphere within the team and hopefully we can benefit from that as well.</p>

He’s a guy who could play for any really big team, but he’s also a guy - and you have to respect this - who always said: ‘No, I’ll stay where I belong, where my family is, where I have support.

  <p><b>[Marc-Andre ter Stegen has revealed that he considered leaving Barcelona in 2016]</b> Basically, Claudio <b>[Bravo]</b> and I both managed to deal well with the situation <b>[of competing for the No.1 shirt]</b>. He is a great goalkeeper who earned the place back then. The coach did not have to change because he had a goalkeeper in the league who showed good performances. Of course, you start to ponder <b>[your future]</b> because playing football is the most important thing. It would not have been better if the coach had said: ‘You’re playing in the league now and <b>[Bravo]</b> in the other competitions.’ That was not what I wanted and in 2016 came the situation where I had to think about leaving Barca. The club was up to date all the time. Claudio and I dealt with the situation openly and said we did not like it. At some point there is the moment when it is no longer tenable. Then Barcelona clearly made a decision and decided for me. I think I have paid it back so far.<br /><br />It’s wonderful in Barcelona. I love the city. My wife is happy too. We have everything we need here. Of course, I miss the family from time to time, but they have always the opportunity to visit me. I have another three and a half years contract.

Everybody knows what is healthy and what’s not. Healthy food is fresh products, fresh food on the table. We try to do this. A lot of vegetables, a lot of fruit - but be careful with sugar. We aren’t 100 per cent strict with it. There are no bans, we mostly eat in a vegetarian way<br /><br />The thing I miss the most is being on the pitch with my colleagues, my friends and playing in front of people, competing at the highest level. It’s difficult to hold back in the most important weeks of the season and to maintain the fitness level on your own. I pay a lot of attention to maintaining my level physically. There’s not much going on with the ball right now. I do different stuff. Right now I am working with a fitness app, doing challenges every day and finishing them<br /><br />You should always try to see some positives in any situation, like being with your family now. We love being at home and we really enjoy our time together</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen gives his perspective of the COVID-19 crisis]</b> It can be analysed from a negative point, because we cannot leave the house, but I don’t see it that way. It’s a circumstance that makes us value much more the things in which we can believe, which are more basic, but which, in the end, are also truly important</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> star Ter Stegen looking at the bright side of lockdown]</b> In every negative situation, like the coronavirus pandemic, there are positives. We can be with our families and especially now, as he is growing so fast. It’s nice to be with him. In the beginning, it was challenging because of the lack of sleep. We had to find a way to do it and now Dani and I are doing very well<br /><br /><b>[Ter Stegen is sharing night-time duties with his wife as they tend to Ben’s needs]</b> Normally it’s Dani, but now that I’m at home and I can make my own schedule, she made me as well. She said, ‘Maybe we can make it one night you, one night me’. It’s only one time which is nice, he lets us sleep easily. It’s one time, it’s nothing big. Then he goes back to sleep which is absolutely fine. I’m good, my family is doing good. We are at home as everybody should be and trying to spend some time together, trying to make things a bit easier even though it’s not a fun situation<br /><br /><b>[Just as with Ben’s nappy needs or middle-of-the-night feeds, Ter Stegen is attentive to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s demands]</b> We try to do whatever they say to do or what is necessary to do</p>

  <p><b>[Ter Stegen confirms <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> renewal has been put on hold]</b> We have already had the first conversations. But as I said, we have parked it. There are much more important things. I am very happy here and the sporting situation is good, the team is doing well. What more can I ask for?<br /><br />People laugh when I tell them I have no idea about football. I don’t see a lot of football, except when there are good games or when I’m particularly interested in one because I have a relationship or a friend. Sometimes they ask me for a player’s name and I have no idea</p>
