When Atletico had to wait for me they didn’t, there was still a month to go in the transfer market. I’ve done everything to come back to Atletico Madrid but I wouldn’t fight the same to return. When Atletico didn’t wait for me, I had to go to Conte with the tail between my legs.<br /><br />In life anything can happens. I don’t close the door to anybody.

It also depends on the match between Tottenham and Swansea. In any case, we will do our best.

  <p><b>[Diego Costa felt targeted by Premier League referees]</b> The suspensions I received made me reflect. I stopped and thought about it. I realised I was the only one losing out at the end of the day. Back then sometimes I thought the suspension was unfair and that I was right and the others were wrong, that they were exaggerating. But either way I was always losing out. So it was a question of either letting them send me out all the time or changing, because with no change from my part I would never be playing, never enjoying. So I decided to avoid arguments with referees, with players from the other teams. I just knew they would not let the slightest thing pass, not with me<br /><br />I want to play. Playing right now is great. We are playing to win a championship. During the previous season I was out a lot of the time, either because of a suspension or an injury or for another reason. So this year I really want to play the remaining matches and enjoy myself here in Chelsea</p>

  <p><b>[The president of Diego Costa’s first club, Barcelona Capela, believes he would be a huge loss for Chelsea if he does leave this summer. Barcelona Capela president Paulo Sergio Moura said]</b> Incredibly, he was never a rebel. He was a rebel like any young man, he had his problems, but his rebellion was more because of a lack of money than anything else. He was rebellious because of this, but on the pitch, he was never that irreverent Diego that he is today. With us, he was always a team player.<br /><br />If you ask me, I can’t explain why it was there <b>[in Europe]</b> that he assumed this behaviour. Maybe I’m not saying that’s the explanation or the motivation, but there are a lot of problems with the adaptation of Brazilian players and we realise that in some big clubs, there’s a group and, until you really prove that you are good, that you really will occupy that place, you end up suffering direct bullying because they do not like to follow the Brazilians much. You end up having to fit in by being more robust, in a more intrusive way. You have to really face it with an open chest<br /><br />I believe that’s become a tendency for Diego, he saw himself needing to fill a specific role but it ended up becoming more of an obligation for him, a label. That’s Diego’s brand, he saw it as a good thing, despite the controversy. Most people see it negatively, but it hasn’t brought bad things for him so far. It only grows, the media loves talking about it. The fans love him. If he leaves the club, I think Chelsea would fall apart.<br /><br />In Spain or Portugal, anywhere else he’s been to, he’s treated like a king. I believe he even likes being labelled, but deep inside he’s a very good lad, a great person. He’s outgoing, goofy, loves to talk, it’s not malicious, ignorant or stupid. He’s totally gentle outside the pitch, a nice guy<br /><br />We invited some people from Portugal, from Gestifute. We were aware of a friendship with Jorge Mendes at the time and he asked Armando Silva to come here to take a look at Diego. At one point, Silva was scheduled to come to Brazil and, just at that time, Diego was punished for a red card and was given a 180-day suspension. Diego came to me and said: ‘I told you, Paulo, that I did not want to be a footballer, I don’t want to, this is to show me that I’m not going to be a footballer.’ He didn’t want to play any more and gave up playing football.<br /><br />After three or four days before these people arrived we went to the Federation because we had all the games recorded and the footage proved that he did nothing to anybody. The Federation reversed the decision and I just called him to tell him to go to the game. He arrived without training.<br /><br />I talked to the coach and we agreed that he was only going to play after half-time, and when the game was almost over, the coach put him in. The scout, in the five minutes he had seen Diego play, said, ‘thank you, I’m leaving, I don’t want to see anymore, I’ve seen enough and I want him’. We tell this story to really show that he’s a star and is pre-destined for everything<br /><br /><b>[And his arrival at Barcelona Capela came just at the right moment]</b> Diego arrived at a time when they needed a striker with his characteristics and, at the first opportunity, he already showed that he was different. The story of Diego Costa is like that of so many other boys who turn up to play football. He turned up on a normal day to just have a trial with us, he did not come from any other club. His uncle came looking for us, he talked to a scout who still works here today, who is Moacir, Jaba’s nickname, and asked him to give Diego a chance to have a trial at the club. And Diego, as fate would have it, arrived on the right day and at the right time. It came on a day when we needed a player and in the position he was trying out for. We were going to compete in a tournament in January and, in the preparations for the tournament, the boy from his position got injured and could not travel and he arrived just that day!<br /><br />It was said to him and to his uncle that, if he passed the trial, he could go on the trip with us. If his uncle would authorise it, because he was a minor, he would go on the trip and we would take advantage of that. It was not an ‘important’ game, so it did not have to be registered with the Federation. And he was like any other boy. Arriving on the trip, you quickly noticed that he was way above the boys who were already at the club<br /><br />Diego was 15 years old, he was soon going to be 16. He had come from Sergipe, and the family stayed in Sergipe, but it was a structured family and he came to live with his uncle here in Sao Paulo, and his uncle made some contacts and came straight to clubs. He found the right club, which was ours, still good! Diego lived with his uncle in the East Zone of Sao Paulo and had to cross the city to train at Barcelona, as the headquarters are in the extreme south of the city. In addition to the difficulty of travel, the financial factor was also an obstacle in the beginning of his career. He considered stopping playing several times, because he was tempted by the money you could earn from working<br /><br />It was a long journey because our training centre has always been here, so we had this problem of travel and, to this day, we are a small club and we do not have many options to drive boys here or to help financially. It was a big problem for Diego too, like it is for others, adapting to the club, because he had to come every day, come and go, and that in a way tired him a little because he came to training, boys, under-15, the club’s facilities were small, the food was not the best<br /><br />At certain times, he looked like he was tired and, because of this, he tried to give up, stopped playing football, and it happened several times, not only once. At least three times he wanted to give up playing football. Especially because his cousins worked, all of them earned money and worked. They got salaries of 2,000 reals, 1,500, which at that time was huge money and here, at the club, we could give him 200, 300 reals<br /><br />He was a boy of just 15, it was to help with his costs, to keep an eye on him, to pay for the driving and to come to train. And he would suffer with his family boring him, talking a lot and he would always say that he was going to get a job and he was not going to be a footballer anymore. I would go there and talk, explain. I called him back to play football at least three times, I went to his house and asked him to go back and play.<br /><br />Diego is very special, he really is. His life was a series of fateful events, everything that happened to Diego, since the beginning, there has always had a star shining on his forehead. I even bet everything I needed to on Diego because I could see that he was a very different boy from everyone else.<br /><br />Physically, psychologically, professionally, he was a spectacular player. Even at that age he was already spectacular. He was three or four years beyond the capacity of the other boys, and he looked like he belonged to a very strong group, and he far surpassed it. He was a difficult boy for defenders, his opponents put three, four, five people on him, but they could not stop him.<br /><br />He was a boy who created an environment, he made the atmosphere, was very playful, so everyone liked him. He was a person who shone here from beginning to end, so there was no way to not notice Diego.</p>

I will only sign for another club in Europe, they know that. Otherwise I’ll stay with my current contract.<br /><br />I have a contract and no intention of leaving, but if there are changes to be made that might reduce my chances, if the coach won’t count on me anymore or is to give space for another striker, I know that I’ll have to leave. But only to where I’m willing to. Everyone know what my preferred club is, there’s nothing to hide.<br /><br />Money is good, but I’m grateful for what I have right now and I have other things to look forward to, like playing the next World Cup. I know that I have a chance to be called if I’m playing well and at a high level, that’s something I want. If I have to move to another city or another country than Spain, I don’t think I’ll go, I’d rather stay at Chelsea. If the club wants to sell me, they know where I want to go<br /><br />I guess we were a little off coming into the match, while Arsenal showed they wanted to win it. They scored once and had the chance for a second during the first 45. We came better for the second half and scored the equalizer, but they went ahead soon after. It happens, I want to congratulate them for the fine display. I wish this final was played before the end of the league so we wouldn’t finish with this feeling just after winning the Premier League. To play a beautiful final like this and lose is a little bitter, but that’s football</p>

I’m on the market and so I’m looking for a team. If the coach doesn’t want you, you have to leave.<br /><br />It would be nice to go back to Atletico but I have to think everything over.

When we heard that Conte didn’t want me anymore, my agent went to find out if there was interest from Atletico for me coming back. Of course for the warmth and respect that I earned there, they showed interest. But they wouldn’t pay a fortune. Atletico is a team growing every year, a big team, but they can’t pay an extraordinary amount</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Costa has warned Chelsea that they cannot decide who they potentially sell him to after telling him he is surplus to requirements]</b> Chelsea have offered me to several clubs, but I was very clear with them. I said that if I’m not part of the manager’s plans, I would like to choose my destination. I’m not going to let them decide just to get more money. When I came to Chelsea they paid a lot less compared to what’s being offered to them. I think they should take into account everything that I’ve done.<br /><br />It’s not my fault that I’m not at the club. If it was down to me I’d be playing. It’s already been one month. Holidays are good but it gets tiresome. I didn’t provoke the situation, but now that it’s come to this the club has to think in two ways. Of course they need to get something back <b>[in a sporting sense]</b>, like I gave them on the pitch, but financial as well. After three years they will receive a fee higher than what they paid.<br /><br />I’ll be honest, I have my agent and none of that <b>[Chelsea wanting him to return]</b> has reached me. People at the club called me before <b>[earlier in the summer]</b> to give me extra holidays to not have contact with the manager. I was always meant to turn up with the group, but they were already saying that I’m going to have to come back and train with the reserves. I said that this was a lack of respect. We won the league and I haven’t done anything so serious to deserve being treated in that way.<br /><br />It won’t be the same as before <b>[between him and Conte]</b>, and we don’t know if the fight for the position will be fair. Because of me having exposed the <b>[text]</b> message I understand that he’ll be annoyed, so if I go back I have to see if things would be clean, just and correct. That’s how I like things. If I go back now I don’t think it will be a fair situation. It won’t be an honest fight for a position <b>[in the team]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Diego Costa has had a fresh dig at Chelsea manager Antonio Conte, insisting that his text to tell the striker that he wasn’t needed at Stamford Bridge was a moment of madness]</b> Conte’s text? It was a moment of madness. It can happen, but I thought it was disrespectful. I always asked to speak face to face with the coach and the board. I never sent <b>[them]</b> text messages, so it shows what kind of person he is. If something makes me sad about this situation, it’s <b>[the fans’]</b> affection as they’d always supported me, even during the delicate moments. If I’d been in the team for three years, it was for them and the dressing room, which was very much united. It was a great experience.<br /><br /><b>[Costa reiterated that he wants to move back to former club Atletico Madrid]</b> I already have in mind where I want to play and I’ve made it very clear. <b>[Spain’s]</b> a country with which I identify a lot due to the climate and the people. I fell in love with Madrid. We have to wait for the right moment</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Costa is a charitable prankster. Paulo Sergio Moura said]</b> Incredibly, he was never a rebel. He was a rebel like any young man, he had his problems, but his rebellion was more because of a lack of money than anything else. He was rebellious because of this, but on the pitch, he was never that irreverent Diego that he is today. With us, he was always a team player.<br /><br />I believe that’s become a tendency for Diego, he saw himself needing to fill a specific role but it ended up becoming more of an obligation for him, a label. That’s Diego’s brand, he saw it as a good thing, despite the controversy. Most people see it negatively, but it hasn’t brought bad things for him so far. It only grows, the media loves talking about it. The fans love him. If he leaves the club, I think Chelsea would fall apart<br /><br />In Spain or Portugal, anywhere else he’s been to, he’s treated like a king. I believe he even likes being labelled, but deep inside he’s a very good lad, a great person. He’s outgoing, goofy, loves to talk, it’s not malicious, ignorant or stupid. He’s totally gentle outside the pitch, a nice guy</p>

I could not have asked for anything more on my second debut, to be back playing again and to have scored a goal is fantastic.</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Costa was booked again in his latest outing for Atletico Madrid]</b> The officials hate me and there’s nothing I can do to change that. Some of them book me for the smallest issue and it did not matter what it was but <b>[against Bilbao]</b> the referee was going to book me no matter what. You can look back at the replay and analyse it, but I did not overstep the mark and did not deserve it, but there is nothing I can do about it now. The penalty appeal? I think it is yes, I was knocked off balance by contact from the defender when I was going to shoot so I think it was!<br /><br /><b>[On Antoine Griezmann]</b> I think people make a lot of stuff up. The fans are behind Griezmann. He’s got quality and, every summer, a big team want him. It’s normal for him to get angry. I get angry too at times. It’s part of football. But the fans are delighted that Griezmann can be here and hopefully he’s here for many more years</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Costa believes Spain’s 6-1 win over Argentina on Tuesday indicates just how valuable Lionel Messi is to his country]</b> You have to do an analysis in all aspects. The Argentines criticise Messi a lot, but you can tell that when Messi is not there, they are something else. A player like Messi should not be criticised. You should thank God that he’s there. Messi must always be treated well. Even if he plays a bad game with the national team, having him on the field makes a difference.<br /><br /><b>[On Spanish national team]</b> This team wants to do something big again. This is a good team for the World Cup. I had a bad time for six months because I was not playing, but I knew that when I came back, I could do well, and being in the national team makes me very excited</p>

If he leaves, we also must be happy because he’s given us a title this season but, in the end, I think he’ll stay.</p>
