Mourinho has not told me anything. One has to take into account that many times I am the one that makes the decision depending on how I feel. Here I have the confidence of the coach, the technical team, and if there is a problem I tell them. If I’m here and I’m injured then I don’t play because it would be worse.<br /><br />I’m here ready to play. I’ve had some problems but it’s getting better. I’ve already played three games in a week and the coach <b>[Del Bosque]</b> knows that I carry some problems, but I will treat them during the week</p>

On a personal level I am not happy because I didn’t manage to score against Macedonia, although I’m happy with the victory. We’ve gained three points which are important for our qualification.<br /><br />Am I suspended against Luxembourg? It’s the first I’ve heard about it…</p>

Hazard is happy here but when a team like these knocks at the door you have to think about it. He’s a world-class player.</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Costa warns Atletico Madrid they missed their chance to bring him back]</b> Atletico knows I have a special feeling for the team, I lived the best moment of my career there. El Cholo <b>[Diego Simeone]</b> knows it wasn’t impossible for me to come back to Atletico. The relationship with Conte didn’t start well because when he arrived I told him I wanted to go to Atletico. Chelsea’s fans love me a lot, even more than in Atletico, figure that! When Atletico had to wait for me they didn’t, there was still a month to go in the transfer market. I’ve done everything to come back to Atletico Madrid but I wouldn’t fight the same to return. When Atletico didn’t wait for me, I had to go to Conte with the tail between my legs.<br /><br />In life anything can happens. I don’t close the door to anybody. Now I’m fine at Chelsea but you never know. I hope Real Madrid doesn’t get Hazard or Courtois</p>

Everyone knows that <b>[PSG]</b> is a respected team in Europe. Monaco also has a great project and great players.</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Costa believes a six-point affair on Wednesday could see Chelsea write Manchester City out of the Premier League title picture]</b> After a loss at home and with a rival closing the gap the importance of the game only grows. We know this game against Manchester City will be a six-point affair since if we win the game they will <b>[practically]</b> be out of the title race while we keep the advantage. It also depends on the match between Tottenham and Swansea. In any case, we will do our best. We hope that the next game the ball will go in, and that we do a better job at handling these counter-attacking plays so we do not suffer from early goals again, and thus avoid what happened <b>[against Palace]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Costa felt targeted by Premier League referees]</b> The suspensions I received made me reflect. I stopped and thought about it. I realised I was the only one losing out at the end of the day. Back then sometimes I thought the suspension was unfair and that I was right and the others were wrong, that they were exaggerating. But either way I was always losing out. So it was a question of either letting them send me out all the time or changing, because with no change from my part I would never be playing, never enjoying. So I decided to avoid arguments with referees, with players from the other teams. I just knew they would not let the slightest thing pass, not with me<br /><br />I want to play. Playing right now is great. We are playing to win a championship. During the previous season I was out a lot of the time, either because of a suspension or an injury or for another reason. So this year I really want to play the remaining matches and enjoy myself here in Chelsea</p>

I could not have asked for anything more on my second debut, to be back playing again and to have scored a goal is fantastic.</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Costa was booked again in his latest outing for Atletico Madrid]</b> The officials hate me and there’s nothing I can do to change that. Some of them book me for the smallest issue and it did not matter what it was but <b>[against Bilbao]</b> the referee was going to book me no matter what. You can look back at the replay and analyse it, but I did not overstep the mark and did not deserve it, but there is nothing I can do about it now. The penalty appeal? I think it is yes, I was knocked off balance by contact from the defender when I was going to shoot so I think it was!<br /><br /><b>[On Antoine Griezmann]</b> I think people make a lot of stuff up. The fans are behind Griezmann. He’s got quality and, every summer, a big team want him. It’s normal for him to get angry. I get angry too at times. It’s part of football. But the fans are delighted that Griezmann can be here and hopefully he’s here for many more years</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Costa believes Spain’s 6-1 win over Argentina on Tuesday indicates just how valuable Lionel Messi is to his country]</b> You have to do an analysis in all aspects. The Argentines criticise Messi a lot, but you can tell that when Messi is not there, they are something else. A player like Messi should not be criticised. You should thank God that he’s there. Messi must always be treated well. Even if he plays a bad game with the national team, having him on the field makes a difference.<br /><br /><b>[On Spanish national team]</b> This team wants to do something big again. This is a good team for the World Cup. I had a bad time for six months because I was not playing, but I knew that when I came back, I could do well, and being in the national team makes me very excited</p>

If he leaves, we also must be happy because he’s given us a title this season but, in the end, I think he’ll stay.</p>

Watch the game properly, don’t just say things because its your national team.<br /><br />I was a bit lucky in the goal, but I am happy because it had been a very hard-fought game and <b>[Iran]</b> were all behind the ball. The key was to win. They were all pushed back and we knew we had to have patience and wait for the right time to score<br /><br />We played a great game against Portugal and today the opponent was a lot more defensive. They took a while to get into the game. But the most important thing was to win and keep moving forward</p>
