  <p><b>[Diego Costa says <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Antoine Griezmann</a> does not deserve to be criticised for leaving <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> to join <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, saying it was the striker’s dream to play with <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> and Lionel Messi]</b> <b>[Griezmann’s]</b> dream was to play with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a>. As a footballer you always want to test yourself and it is normal that he would want to play there, to see if he can be an important player as he was at Atleti. We cannot say anything bad<br /><br />If all that with the video hadn’t happened, it would have been a quiet exit<br /><br /><b>[Atletico splashed out a club record €126m to sign <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a> from <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> as <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a>’s replacement]</b> When he arrived, you could tell he was a quiet person who listens. He doesn’t act like a star, and that is good. That’s how it is in our dressing room. When a person arrives and sees that the dressing room is quiet, he enters that dynamic. He arrived here and showed his quality against <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, against <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, in training. The people can see that he has a gift</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Costa says <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> may have won league titles in Italy and England, but the Inter coach would not last a season in charge of Real Madrid]</b> <b>[Conte and I]</b> had problems off the pitch, but I think he is a really good manager. I have no hard feelings towards <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>, but to be a top, top manager, he needs to change the human side of his management. He is very suspicious. At a team like, say, <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, he would never last a season<br /><br /><b>[Although he was born in Brazil, Costa made just two appearances for the national team before switching his allegiance to Spain. The striker faced criticism for his decision, but he says former Brazil boss <a href="luiz-felipe-scolari.html">Luiz Felipe Scolari</a> made it an easy one]</b> After the friendly against Russia, he said he would call me up again because I hadn’t played many minutes. I think it was just to get in my head. I remember several forwards were injured but <a href="luiz-felipe-scolari.html">Scolari</a> would not select me. I stayed quiet, but wasn’t selected for the Confederations Cup. The possibility of Spain emerged and I accepted. How could I say no? Suddenly, they started saying <a href="luiz-felipe-scolari.html">Scolari</a> wanted me. Well, he never called me once. How could it be that he wanted me? I then saw it written that I had ruined the dreams of millions of Brazilians. Why not say that he didn’t look for me? Then it’s simple.</p>
