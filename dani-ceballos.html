  <p><b>[Tottenham’s rumoured pursuit of Dani Ceballos has become trickier with the Real Madrid midfielder declaring he does not want to be sold. Ceballos, 22, has been mentioned as a potential makeweight in a deal that could send Christian Eriksen the other way]</b> I don’t want to be sold. I want to enjoy myself and feel important, wherever that may be. I have a bit of experience and I believe that next year will be my best year <b>[yet]</b>. I play to have fun. I really want to show what I’m good at. This year hasn’t been my best season. I wanted to get things off my chest.<br /><br /><b>[A full Spain international, Ceballos is currently preparing to face Germany in the final of the European Under-21 Championship]</b> The important thing is that we’re in the final. They came out on top two years ago. It was a tactically masterclass. We have the opportunity for revenge. This team has room to improve and we’ve still not reached our best level. We hope to be at our best in the final</p>

Arsenal are in talks with Real Madrid over a move for Dani Ceballos.</p>

<p>: 2019 07 24
Arsenal are continuing their pursuit of Wilfried Zaha and Kieran Tierney as they prepare to announce the signings of Dani Ceballos and William Saliba.</p>

<p>: 2019 07 25
Arsenal have completed the signing of Real Madrid midfielder Dani Ceballos on a season-long loan deal. The Spaniard will wear the No. 8 shirt for the Gunners, the squad number previously assigned to Aaron Ramsey, who left the club to join Juventus on a free transfer</p>

  <p><b>[Dani Ceballos says Unai Emery was the deciding factor in convincing him to join Arsenal on loan from Real Madrid]</b> The coach was the turning point in terms of me joining this massive club. He’s a Spanish coach and he knows me from my time at other clubs. I’m really happy to be able to help Arsenal achieve our objectives. I knew I had the confidence of the coach, which was very important for me from the start. I was aware of the responsibility that wearing this shirt entails and it was a tremendously proud moment when I decided to join Arsenal. He’s a very tactical coach and I think that’s going to really help me to perfect my positioning. I think we’re both going to try our best to make me a better player.<br /><br /><b>[Ceballos will hope to settle in and stake his claim for a starting berth as soon as possible]</b> I have the coach - who is Spanish - and Hector, which will help me get used to life in London. I get on really well with Hector away from football, on a personal level. I told him I was thinking of joining and he told me not to think twice because this is a great city and a great club and that I was going to have a great time. I can’t wait to see him and say thanks for his help in getting me here. I need to get used to what the club expects of me and adapt as quickly as possible because that will be vital if I’m to be successful at this club<br /><br /><b>[Speaking following the completion of his temporary switch to Emery’s side]</b> I’m really proud to be able to wear this shirt. I’m joining an historic Premier League side and it’s a step forward in my career. I know the Premier League because I followed it while I was in Spain. It’s a very tactical league but it’s also physical. I’ll need to adapt to the team but I can’t wait to get started. It’s really exciting.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal’s new loan signing Dani Ceballos says inspiration from the late Jose Antonio Reyes helped convince him to join the Gunners]</b> Arsenal have always kept a close eye on my career. But at the end of the day all players have to make decisions in their careers. This is a historic club that I’ve always looked out for because of Jose Antonio Reyes, who is from the same town as me and played here. He made history at this club, winning the league title, so it’s an important step in my career for me to join Arsenal.<br /><br /><b>[For Ceballos, growing up with local hero Reyes playing for some of the world’s biggest clubs proved quite the inspiration]</b> I spoke to his father just before coming here. He told me not to think twice because this is a wonderful club. Jose had a fantastic time here. When I came into the training ground today I saw a picture of him and it really struck me because he’s like my childhood idol. Being at the club where he made a name for himself is a big step forward and I hope to make this club even bigger</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal new boy Dani Ceballos is eager to emulate the impact of his fellow Spanish midfielders Santi Cazorla and Cesc Fabregas at the Emirates Stadium]</b> When I knew I was joining the club I looked at the Spanish players that had played here in the past. I think Santi Cazorla played some amazing football here and Cesc was the captain for a long time<br /><br />I think Cazorla is one of Spain’s best midfielders. I’d love to play with him one day - although that would be tricky because there’s a big age difference between us. The level Cazorla played at last year after coming back from a really serious injury that just wouldn’t go away … I really think you have to take your hat off to him because I don’t think many players would be able to do what he has done<br /><br /><b>[Ceballos also singled out compatriot Cesc Fabregas as an inspiration]</b> Cesc has always been a player with real character and pride inside. I think you have to have a huge sense of responsibility to be the captain of a club as big as Arsenal and he never faltered. He always took responsibility at Arsenal, Barcelona and with Spain and he’s always stepped up at the key moments at all of his clubs</p>

Now, No.10s have virtually disappeared in football. You have to be more complete, quality has to be accompanied by the physical side.

  <p><b>[Ceballos eager to prove his worth to <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> after <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> loan]</b> I have not spoken to <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>, he is now focused on his players. When my loan contract ends I will be a <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> player again. My goal is to succeed there.<br /><br />I had to be away for a long time due to injury but I worked hard to turn the situation around. With <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a>, I have had a very good relationship since he arrived, he has given me confidence and now I am focused on ending the season in the best possible way and achieving our goals. <br /><br />We are training with a lot of precautions, two tests per week; I am not afraid because I see it being difficult to get infected in training with so many measures</p>

  <p><b>[Ceballos open to <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> stay as <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> loan runs down and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> door remains closed]</b> The owner of my future next year is me. Next year I want to play and I will hardly be able to do it at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. Would I return with <b>[Zinedine]</b> <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>? I have to make the decision. He told me this year that the best thing was for me to leave and get experience. Everyone makes their decisions and they must be respected, I have nothing against him because he has always been very clear with me. <a href="real-betis.html">Betis</a>? It is an option. I do not close the door to play in any club. I do not rule out continuing in the Premier <b>[League]</b> <br /><br />The coach plays a game very similar to what <b>[Manchester]</b> City is trying to do and I think we make a game philosophy that is difficult for the rival to fit in with. He does not talk about anecdotes with Pep <b>[Guardiola]</b> but it shows in his training, I have learned a lot about soccer in a different way. It is a luxury to be able to learn from a coach with these qualities</p>
