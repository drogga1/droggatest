  <p><b>[Real Betis midfielder Dani Ceballos holds Sergio Ramos up as his role model in football]</b> Pepe Reina said that Ramos is unstoppable. But if you are focused on not letting him get his run-up in at the right time, you could have a chance. If you let him measure his distances and jump easily, he has the ability to suddenly appear in the key moments. Sergio Ramos could be a mirror for me and my career, although he started at Sevilla and I am at Betis. He made the move to Madrid when he was only 19 and today he is the captain. Let’s hope someday I can achieve the things he has. It is true that Real Madrid were interested in me, and they tried to sign me in the past. But my goal was to be at Betis and to grow at Betis. I think I chose well and if I am going to play for a big team one day, I am going to go to play, not to be on the bench. When a player bursts into a club like Betis, the interest of other clubs should serve as extra motivation to continue working and finish the season the best way possible. I am happy now where I am and I hope to achieve great things one day.<br /><br />Betis are going to face a team that is in the La Liga title race and cannot afford to fail anymore. We hope to be competitive. The Bernabeu is impressive. Playing there is the dream of any child and facing their world stars will be a challenge. Madrid are playing at a high level. Their recent poor results have only been down to a lack of concentration</p>

I talked to him, but it was his decision. Lopetegui had a lot of faith in me and he gave me minutes after not playing much, but I think the change of coach has been good for us because we’ve put three wins together and I think that’s very important. Solari’s been very clear with me since our first encounter. We have a big squad and we all have to give something. After the game against Barca, we hit rock bottom and I think the change has been good for us. Mentally we were in a very bad way, but Solari has managed to turn things around. We’re very happy with Solari. He’s brought in some very good dynamics, but we don’t make these decisions. They’re made above us. Is our physical preparation better with <b>[Antonio]</b> Pintus? For me, that’s silly talk. Three weeks is too soon, but the team are fine physically</p>

  <p><b>[Ceballos opens up on snubbing <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> I was proud to have a club like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> after me, but I chose <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because of <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> and how he was with me. Right now, I wouldn’t fit in at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> very well. Unai was key to me being at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I went to play at a club like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because, apart from the fact that it’s a massive club, Unai practically came to my house to tell me that he loved me as a player, that he’s been in love with me since I played for <a href="real-betis.html">Betis</a>…<br /><br />The confidence of a coach is key to giving your best performance. Unai told me that I would be important with him at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and I didn’t have any doubts about going there. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is a great coach but you have to look at the playing philosophy of each team. Right now, my style of play wouldn’t fit in the best possible way in a team like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Still, being linked to the best teams just shows I am doing things right<br /><br />I’m a football player with a great vision for the game and I think in recent years I’ve improved my defending too. I work hard on the pitch and I have the quality to make that final pass. These days coaches want ‘complete’ players, whereas before it was all about having quality and attacking. Now, No.10s have virtually disappeared in football. You have to be more complete, quality has to be accompanied by the physical side. The most difficult thing in football is to have quality, the physical side can be improved with hard work and dedication day by day - I think <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is going to give me many things that I didn’t have before</p>
