  <p><b>[Cantona revelling in Cosmos role as United legend makes <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> return]</b> At first, it was difficult for Eric to understand what we were doing. But after two or three meetings he came to New York, loved the city and his family moved as well. His biggest passion is developing talented young players. That is his dream and his vision. He has a very clear strategy for what he wants to do with his kids. Once we explained what we wanted and showed him a documentary about Cosmos’ history, he stood up and said ‘this is a combination between sport and art. I love it’<br /><br /><b>[The New York Cosmos are hoping to become a <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> franchise]</b> Our biggest asset is New York City. We intend to capitalise on that. We are working with the city on four solutions, looking at the transport and what the best environment to have the stadium in. Discussions with the league are ongoing over the potential for a temporary solution as a two or three year stop-gap. That would give us the opportunity to find the right piece of land and build the right stadium. We are confident that in the next couple of years we will be in an exciting place</p>
