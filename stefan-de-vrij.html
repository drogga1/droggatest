  <p><b>[Lazio centre-half Stefan de Vrij has suggested that he could hand Liverpool further frustration in their pursuit of defensive reinforcements]</b> I’m very happy to be here, we are talking to the club now and I hope to find an agreement.

  <p><b>[Stefan de Vrij is ready to step out of his comfort zone at Lazio]</b> It has been a very difficult period full of speculations on my future to come to this point that nobody desired. Unfortunately we were not able to find a satisfying agreement for both parties due to various reasons. I understand the disappointment of the Lazio fans very good and it hurts me leaving in this way. Even though I am very happy and I feel at home here, sometimes we need to get out of our comfort zone to achieve our desired goals. I will be forever grateful to Lazio and to the fans for always being there for me, for the trust and opportunities given. I have always tried to demonstrate that by giving the best of me and I will keep doing that until the end. Thank you, Stefan.</p>

  <p><b>[Stefan de Vrij says there’s a new king in town after winning Milan derby]</b> The coach made us understand what he wanted and where to improve during the break, fortunately we scored two goals in quick succession and we were back in the game. We won.<br /><br />The goals were incredible feelings and memories that will last forever. Winning is a unique feeling. It’s tight in the table so we have to continue like this and win our games. We’ll start focusing on <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> now because it won’t be an easy game on Wednesday</p>

  <p><b>[Stefan de Vrij says <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> will become decisive for Inter after an underwhelming start to his career at <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a>]</b> He can become decisive and I think he will become decisive. Now he is getting used to the game, he begins to learn the language. In training, we all see that he is very strong and soon we will see his pure qualities on the field<br /><br /><b>[De Vrij also reserved praise for Inter’s star forward duo <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a> and <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a>]</b> They are very strong physically. They are a fast and mobile couple. In training, I noticed that they are two very difficult to mark strikers. By training with them we can all improve. <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> is very well. He feels at home, he is always positive and tries to help In the game, when I can, of course, I look for him. Of course he can still improve, like all of us<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on the philosophy <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> has implemented at Inter since inheriting the managerial reigns last summer]</b> He is a great coach, he conveys a lot of passion and desire to win. He wants us to play very aggressively and that we build from the bottom. He is very attentive to the tactics and cuts that can make the difference. The first game will be the most important, we are preparing at best to be ready.</p>
