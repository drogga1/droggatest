  <p>[Ronaldo’s unlikely friendship with Ed Sheeran] I met Ronaldo and he came to my concert and invited us to his house which has a club in it. We went there and he showed me my dance routine from the Thinking Out Loud video. He had learned it with his girlfriend, which was amazing.<br /><br />[Sheerhan is planning to meet up with Ronaldo and his other half Celina Locks again] I get to see him again, that’s exciting. I really like him. He was so cool. I got a shirt signed from him and it says, ‘To Ed, you fans. Ronaldo’.</p>
