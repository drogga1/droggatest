  <p><b>[Football needs a Lionel Messi World Cup win more than the Barcelona and Argentina requires global glory]</b> I don’t think it will be enough for some people, so nothing changes. For him and my country, I’m hopeful he wins. Johan Cryuff didn’t need to lift the World Cup to be the best in the history. <b>[Alfredo]</b> Di Stefano the same. Football needs Messi to lift the World Cup, not vice versa<br /><br /><b>[On Sergio Aguero, Gonzalo Higuain, Paulo Dybala and Mauro Icardi all proven performers at the highest level in Europe]</b> It depends on what Sampaoli wants. If you want to play wide and make crosses, I think Icardi is the best. If you want to play in the middle with faster passes, then I think Higuain and Aguero are the best. I don’t understand what our identity is. At this moment, there are a lot of young players but the World Cup is only two months away<br /><br /><b>[On Argentina’s chances]</b> I think we are competitive. I don’t want to be in Sampaoli’s shoes and say who should start or not. I don’t think that’s the right way to help. I only speak when I’m watching on the television or at the stadium. At this moment, I only want Argentina to be competitive. The bad results, conceding six to Spain and four to Nigeria, are matches for the coach to know who should be in the World Cup. Argentina depends on Argentina. This Argentina, in normal circumstances, won’t have a problem with Iceland, Croatia or Nigeria. The problem will come when we start the first knockout match. We will win the group and go through. We are one of the favourites but we are also one step down from Brazil, Germany and Spain</p>

  <p><b>[Mauro Icardi is the best penalty box striker in the world but is being overlooked]</b> It seems to me that Icardi is not one of Messi’s friends. The national team is now made up of a magic circle, do you understand me? Icardi is not part of the circle and therefore, unfortunately, he will not go to the World Cup in Russia. This is my opinion. The team needs a striker like him, but <b>[Jorge]</b> Sampaoli and Messi think otherwise<br /><br />In the penalty area, no other player in the world is as good as him. When he gets the ball, he’s deadly. Of course, if you want to build a move from deep, then <b>[Sergio]</b> Aguero is more suitable. After Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, who are both from another planet, there are many strikers who could potentially be considered as the third best in the world. In my opinion, Icardi should definitely be considered among them. Inter must do everything they possibly can to keep him. The Nerazzurri directors are good and will solve his future no problem</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho brings a warpath as a manager and has revolutionised the profession]</b> It was more than just about me. It was amazing, his history in Inter. I tried to help him when he moved there. It was great for us to work together again after Chelsea. Jose is different. Jose makes a difference and writes history because the future of his clubs will never be the same after him, because when he comes he brings a warpath as a manager. I think he became a great manager after he left Porto. I think Chelsea gave him more of a reputation which grew and grew. I think to be part of that moment was like being part of history. After Mourinho, football managers all changed. They changed what they said in press conferences and the way they behaved. Everything changed. In that moment we understood that managers don’t just choose the starting 11. They must understand everything all around. It is about your relationships with your players, staff, doctors and media. He understood all of it and he was very clear with everybody. With the fans, with the media, the players and the owners. I understood that it is more than just about the first XI, he was more than that. I am very proud of my career. I had the chance to play in many great teams such as Chelsea, Milan, Parma, Lazio and Inter. There was also the national team. Sometimes you have a chance to win or you are second but I always was a competitor. This is important. That I had dreams to play in great clubs and reach it. This is something that’s special. Now, when I look behind me, I say: ‘Wow, what a career,’ and I am very proud of that.<br /><br /><b>[He won the Premier League title during his time at Chelsea]</b> It was great. I have wanted to come back to play. I have thought about it a lot. I would love to run on this pitch and be at Stamford Bridge, I don’t want to cry but it will be very hard. I have a lot of feeling for both teams. I think it will be an amazing match because it will be the first time playing there since I left the Chelsea team in 2006. To come back to Stamford Bridge will be special. I come back to watch some games, but to be on the pitch will be different. The atmosphere feels different when you are on the pitch. The last time was when we lifted the Premier League trophy against Manchester United, that was the last game that I played at home. To come back will be something special for me. It was the first league title that I won. After this victory, I won three in a row with Inter. It started something great. That day was amazing. This year was amazing. We beat Manchester United 3-0 at home. They came second and it was amazing. I think Friday will be something special for me personally because that feeling I had on that day was very special. To come back and feel that day again makes me feel nervous, I don’t know. It is difficult to explain your feelings when they were so intense. For me, it is difficult to explain my feelings and I am very emotional because I played with and against these guys. They played in the stadium that made me cry when we won the Premier League. I have a lot of memories. I don’t know, I am very excited to be part of it<br /><br />I represent the Chinese group who bought Parma, I am the vice-president for them. I work like this but my dream is to come back to the pitch and become a manager. At the same time, I have the chance to help a club that I played for at the beginning of my experience in Europe. It is not a bad position and I like it, but I want to be a manager in the future. I want to come back to the pitch because the pitch is different to being in the offices, behind a desk. I am waiting for a good project but I like so much to watch every tournament. I watch football in England. I follow the Premier League and the Championship. If a good project comes to me, I don’t worry much about the country. It is about the project. Normally, you want to stay in a country that you know and prefer, but work is work. A job is a job. I will listen to every offer, regardless of which country or league, and see whether it could work</p>

  <p><b>[Alvaro Morata has been backed to be a success at Chelsea]</b> I think he is a great player. However, you need to be patient. He has showed he is a very good striker, but normally when you play in a big team it is difficult to be at a high level for the whole year. In the past, the same thing happened at Juventus, but that is because he is young. He can be the future of Chelsea but it depends on him. It is important to see if he is happy. If he is happy at Chelsea and he can show his best in this team then it would be great for everyone, but if he wants to come back to Juventus and make another experience then we will see.<br /><br />It is different than my experience at Chelsea because I was older than him. I had already been past my best level. The Premier League at that time wasn’t the best in the world. Now it is. At that time, when I played, Serie A was actually the best. Then, AC Milan called me, the second time was Inter. It was difficult for me to adapt that way around. If you want me to offer my personal opinion, I say stay at Chelsea! Show your best there because you play in the best league in the world. Chelsea can win the league again. They have big decisions to make, to go with Conte or not. For the players, though, everything is clear for their futures, it is down to them to choose. I think he should stay and that’s regardless of the manager, but you never know, whoever the manager is may have other ideas.</p>

  <p><b>[Inter are set to complete the signing of Lautaro Martinez after the striker arrived in Italy for a medical]</b> He is very good and can play in many roles; on the wing, as a secondary striker or up top by himself as the main striker. He has a knack for scoring and he’s an intelligent guy. Coming to Inter isn’t easy, he’ll need to be helped and protected. Then hopefully he can show all of his qualities from the beginning, but it won’t be a disaster if he needs a little time to settle in. He can play with Icardi, I don’t think there will be any problems. He reminds me a little bit of Aguero in some ways, like with his low centre of gravity, but he’s Lautaro Martinez.</p>

  <p><b>[Hernan Crespo says Lionel Messi is already a legend]</b> I don’t want to compare Maradona and Messi. We are proud because they are both Argentine and we a really proud of that. I think it is not important to compare him. It is Messi. He is great and that’s even if he never wins the World Cup.<br /><br />He would be like Di Stefano or Johan Cruyff that were the greatest players in the world, even without winning the World Cup. I think Messi, from his generation, deserves to win the World Cup. But football isn’t about what you deserve, you just have to do it and that’s it<br /><br />I hope that the national team can win the trophy, but it is not easy. I think we are one step down from the favourites of Spain or Germany. I think we are at the same level as England, Brazil or Belgium, but we have a chance because we have great players. We have a new manager that was in charge for the last 10 games. It is not easy for him to win something important but I dream because we have a great player like Messi. There’s also Sergio Aguero, Gonzalo Higuain, Paulo Dybala. I hope he call Icardi. You never know, it is one month where anything can happen. You need balance, yes. We have problems in the midfield because we don’t have many options. Our forwards are perfect because we have a lot of options to score. Different ways they can combine to score, but you need somebody in the midfield. We have a few players but there aren’t enough at the highest level. <b>[Javier]</b> Mascherano doesn’t play at a high level because he is in China. <b>[Ever]</b> Banega is at Sevilla but he has good moments and bad moments. The other one is <b>[Lucas]</b> Biglia, he is at AC Milan but has a lot of injuries. We don’t have a lot of choices<br /><br />I know him very well. I think for him it is a dream to manage the national team. I am very happy whenever he is happy. He is my friend</p>

Inter are at a more advanced stage of their development, as after six years they are back in the Champions League and Suning have been working on their project longer than Elliott management. Milan are coming off a chaotic period. With Leonardo and Paolo Maldini as directors, at least they are starting to recreate some of their identity, but they need a few more years to get back to the golden era<br /><br />I think Higuain is ideal for Gennaro Gattuso’s tactics. The same goes for Icardi at Inter, and Luciano Spalletti’s wingers are perfect for setting up a deadly finisher like him. “I was a mix between the two. I would move like Icardi in front of goal but participate more in build-up play like Higuain</p>

  <p><b>[Hernan Crespo has explained the emotions that went behind the now-famous photo of him staring at his <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> winners’ medal in the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> dressing room]</b> This image means I was appreciating what I had, being isolated a little bit from the madness around you, congratulating yourself and analysing the work behind the achievement. I looked at the medal and I thought: ‘You got it, what an achievement.’ That’s what’s it all about. To prepare and to achieve it.<br /><br />It had consequences for many people: the kit man, the massage man, fans, there was so much happiness behind all of that. And that is just for some lucky people. That’s the reason why I try to convince my teams to understand how they impact everyone. That’s why I want my teams playing in a certain way, being respectful between themselves and to their opponents. For all of it, because you, unintentionally, are an example and everybody is looking to you</p>

  <p><b>[Former Argentina star Hernan Crespo says <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> target <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a> should stay at Inter for the next few seasons to continue his development]</b> I would love for <b>[Lautaro]</b> to stay for a thousand reasons. He’s in a big team and doing two or three years like this is good. You have to live with that pressure of having to play at that level all the time. You need a balance that you can get if you stay in the same place. It seems to me that it would do him good to stay in that sense. He is young and has had many changes. This was his first year as a starter, he earned it and the season did not even end.<br /><br />Lautaro could well be the new <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a>. He’s not as sharp in his dribbling, but he is more of a team player than Kun, who too often gets distracted and looks disinterested. Lautaro is always participating in the move, so he can play as a lone centre-forward or with another striker like <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a>, even in a trident. I really like his mentality</p>

  <p><b>[Hernan Crespo has described <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a> as a complete player]</b> I would like him to stay at Inter because this has been his first year as a starter. I wish he had a bit more of a solid foundation before another change comes. Trains slow down at the best stations and Lautaro is one of them<br /><br />He is a very serious and focused boy. I really like that. He has a lot of personality. He is a complete player who can play in attack both alone and accompanying another striker<br /><br /><b>[Crespo also reserved praise for Lautaro’s international team-mate <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>]</b> What I admire about <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> are the forms, the way he achieves things and his consistency. They kick him millions of times and he gets up and continues playing. Respect the opponent and the game to the fullest. This is an example that transcends beyond soccer.</p>
