I can’t pass judgement on the legal issues but I can say that we’re going ahead in spite of the difficulties. My lads are motivated and want to end their season on a high note. I have a stupendous group. Please don’t ask me to say anymore, this is such a difficult moment for us at Parma</p>

  <p><b>[Why <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> god <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> will never be worshipped in the same way in Argentina]</b> Leo is very much loved, he is Argentina’s top scorer.

It is impossible to know what they think and what they live. It makes me happy to see him play in the national team, I would love, as an Argentine also, to see him become world champion. Leo is a guy who has been at a very high level for many years, receives kicks, gets up and carries on, always working. Actually, if you think about it, somehow it is soccer that owes <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. But that is not going to take away greatness. We are Argentines and we want him to be world champion, I want it all my heart, but he goes beyond a title and he will not stop being immense.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Argentina star Hernan Crespo says <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a> should wait a few years before leaving Inter]</b> He must stay at Inter without doubt for a simple reason. He did well in Argentina with Racing, he arrived at Inter and for one season he was on the bench, then he was promoted to being a starter. This is his first season as an indispensable player. He needs at least three years to finish growing, then he can think about a transfer elsewhere<br /><br /><b>[The former Argentine international says that he believes that the club has changed in a big way in recent years, especially this season under <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a>]</b> I have followed the evolution of Inter. <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> and <b>[Beppe]</b> <a href="beppe-marotta.html">Marotta</a> have brought a different style to the past.</p>

Lautaro could well be the new <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a>.

I really like his mentality<br /><br /><b>[Crespo said of the two-time World Cup winner, a man he considers to sit alongside legendary figures of the modern era]</b> For people of my generation, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> was a phenomenon. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">CR7</a> has had the good fortune, like <b>[Lionel]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, to play at the same time and improve each other but for Il Fenomeno <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> it was different. At the time there was probably not as big a stimulus that <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> have today to improve even further.<br /><br />Without a doubt <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> has shown incredible longevity but the way that Ronnie got in on goal and the things he used to do to get away from opponents make him unreachable<br /><br /><b>[Crespo is currently working his way up the coaching ladder, with a spell being taken in as manager of Argentine side Defensa y Justicia, but he hopes to return to Europe at some stage in the future]</b> I would like to manage the teams I played for. sI want to go back to <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a>, so long as they do not pull it down.

I looked at the medal and I thought: ‘You got it, what an achievement.’ That’s what’s it all about. To prepare and to achieve it.<br /><br />It had consequences for many people: the kit man, the massage man, fans, there was so much happiness behind all of that. And that is just for some lucky people. That’s the reason why I try to convince my teams to understand how they impact everyone. That’s why I want my teams playing in a certain way, being respectful between themselves and to their opponents. For all of it, because you, unintentionally, are an example and everybody is looking to you</p>

  <p><b>[Former Argentina star Hernan Crespo says <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> target <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a> should stay at Inter for the next few seasons to continue his development]</b> I would love for <b>[Lautaro]</b> to stay for a thousand reasons. He’s in a big team and doing two or three years like this is good. You have to live with that pressure of having to play at that level all the time. You need a balance that you can get if you stay in the same place. It seems to me that it would do him good to stay in that sense. He is young and has had many changes. This was his first year as a starter, he earned it and the season did not even end.<br /><br />Lautaro could well be the new <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a>.

I really like that. He has a lot of personality. He is a complete player who can play in attack both alone and accompanying another striker<br /><br /><b>[Crespo also reserved praise for Lautaro’s international team-mate <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>]</b> What I admire about <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> are the forms, the way he achieves things and his consistency. They kick him millions of times and he gets up and continues playing. Respect the opponent and the game to the fullest. This is an example that transcends beyond soccer.</p>
