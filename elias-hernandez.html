  <p><b>[Cruz Azul can build on Jornada 1 success to make Estadio Azteca feel like home]</b> I felt happy to support the team, play in my part and bring this fan base some happiness. Beyond scoring, I think it’s important to praise the team’s effort because we’ve really understood what the manager has asked us.</p>

  <p><b>[Elias Hernandez made Cruz Azul move at right time]</b> I think this has been the club where I’ve found another type of demands. I’m not saying that in the other teams I’ve played in there haven’t been teammates who have had talent - of course there have been. But with the team that has come together, the players who have arrived, I think the team in all positions has two or three players who have great quality and that makes it so the team is working in the way it is.<br /><br />From the moment I decided to come to the club, I knew the responsibility, the pressure. I’m happy with the new challenge. It’s gone well for us, and we’re hoping to continue on a good path. We’ve had a good start. The idea is to go game by game, look for qualification <b>[to the Liguilla]</b> as quickly as possible and the team has taken this idea on really well</p>
