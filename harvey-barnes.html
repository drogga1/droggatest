  <p><b>[Manchester City youngster Phil Foden deserves all the attention he has been getting]</b> I was actually rooming with Phil. I was meant to be with Ben <b>[Chilwell]</b>, but he got pushed up to the seniors, so I thought I had the room to myself - but then Phil came in! Phil’s a great young player. There is a lot of attention around him at the minute, which is deserved. Rooming with him you get to know him a lot better, he’s a great lad. He’s getting in a great Manchester City team at such a young age, but you can see his quality in training.<br /><br /><b>[On Ben Chilwell]</b> He was always year above me at Leicester, but we played together in youth teams, U21 and U18s. His quality’s always been there. He had to be patient. He wasn’t getting the opportunities a few years ago, but he has done really well to take his chance when he got it and is now a big part of that Leicester team<br /><br />He was a help last year when I was at Leicester and not getting much pitch-time. He’d already been through that the year before and knew how I was feeling. I knew this year I had to get out on loan and get first-team football</p>
