  <p><b>[Practices became more structured and players were required to undergo nasal examinations to ensure that none was using cocaine.

  <p><b>[Batistuta’s quiet goodbye]</b> I’ve always given everything for every team I’ve played for so that the ordinary fans, the people in the stadium, could identify with me. I owe a lot to the fans of Roma, <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> and Argentina. They were the reason I played, my inspiration. I always worked hard to improve my game, to prove to myself that I could be one of the best for as long as possible. To be honest, I couldn’t care less what the others think.<br /><br /><b>[…]</b> When I was playing football I never enjoyed it that much, I was never happy … if I scored two goals, I wanted a third, I always wanted more. Now it’s all over I can look back with satisfaction, but I never felt that way when I was playing</p>

  <p><b>[Mauro Icardi should be given the opportunity to lead Argentina’s attack instead of Gonzalo Higuain]</b> The number 9 has to be the one who scores the goals. I like Higuain very much, but unfortunately he isn’t contributing the way he does in Europe. He’s playing very well for Juve and is in the running for a lot of trophies, but if he needs a rest then why not give Icardi a chance? This is a national team, not a club team, so therefore you have to live in the moment.</p>

  <p><b>[Lionel Messi will never match Diego Maradona as the greatest of all]</b> Diego was the greatest of all. He represents an Argentinian in many things, not just in football. He has a charisma. He has rare talent and fantasy. Messi, even if technically is same or more, he doesn’t have more charisma than Maradona had. Diego could bring to life the entire stadium. Everyone looked at him. I played with him and I can tell you how decisive he was.</p>

  <p><b>[Gabriel Batistuta has admitted to having snubbed Manchester United and Real Madrid during his iconic career]</b> I never enjoyed being the star-man because as soon as you become the focal point of the team, you assume an extra burden of responsibility. I received many offers namely from Real Madrid, Manchester United and Milan, but I preferred the tranquillity of playing for Fiorentina. If I had gone to Madrid, I would have scored more than 200 goals, but I knew I would have got bored. The same thing would have happened to me at Milan. Although I have never won a major trophy, I consider myself a winner because I helped Fiorentina to compete with the big boys.</p>

  <p><b>[Argentina legend Gabriel Batistuta has revealed he begged a doctor to amputate his legs after suffering years of mobility issues since his retirement in 2005]</b> I was crying from the pain so I asked a doctor to amputate my legs. I felt pain, pain and more pain. The operation was a solution I’d been chasing for at least six to seven years. In 40 days, once I remove the brace, we’ll know if the pain has disappeared and I can finally walk like a normal person again<br /><br /><b>[Batistuta says he is far form the first goalscoring icon to have experienced such problems off the pitch]</b> As soon as I stopped playing, I found my ankles to be in pieces. Bone against bone, supporting a weight of 86-87 kilograms. The slightest movement became agony. I had the same problem as Marco Van Basten, who said enough was enough at 28 years of age. I couldn’t get out of bed on some days. I’d be crying with anger and I said to myself: ‘It can’t go on like this’. I felt sick, so sick that I went to a doctor friend of mine and asked him to amputate my legs. I prayed to him, I insisted. I told him that this was no longer life</p>
