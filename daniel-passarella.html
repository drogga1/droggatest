  <p><b>[But the first came at home in 1978, when Gen. Jorge Rafael Videla, head of the military junta that was responsible for the disappearances and deaths of tens of thousands of Passarella’s countrymen, triumphantly handed him the trophy]</b> If I’d known then what was happening, I wouldn’t have played at all<br /><br /><b>[Fernando <a href="fernando-redondo.html">Redondo</a>, one of the world’s finest defensive midfielders, refused to cut his hair for the cause, and though Passarella has since ended the ban, he and <a href="fernando-redondo.html">Redondo</a> have yet to reconcile. Passarella has said part of the problem is that <a href="fernando-redondo.html">Redondo</a> did not want to play a different position on the national team]</b> If I select a player who thinks he’s doing the team a favor by joining us, then I not only irritate myself but my players, as well<br /><br /><b>[Passarella did not leave Batistuta off his World Cup team, and ‘Batigol’ has responded with four goals in three games in France]</b> He has worked very hard, and he deserves his success. I hope he finishes leading scorer, but I know that his first desire is that the team go as far as possible</p>

  <p><b>[With Cool Precision, Dutch Eliminate Argentina]</b> We were very tired after our long game the other night and our opponents had an extra day for recuperation<br /><br /><b>[For what it is worth, Passarella said he thought the ultimate winner of the World Cup would be produced from the Tuesday night game here]</b> because they will have an extra day of rest, and that is very important at this stage. Any team that avoids head-butting in the open will also have an advantage</p>

  <p><b>[Two-time <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup winner and former Argentina captain Daniel Passarella speaks about his opinion on who should wear the captain’s armband for his country]</b> Not giving the captaincy of Argentina to <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> would take a weight off of him. I think Argentina already have a great leader, which is Ramiro Funes Mori. He should be the captain. The leader of the group is something different to the way you play and the talent of each player. I admire <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, but I think his personality, his way of being, is withdrawn and timid</p>

  <p><b>[Passarella, who led Argentina to World Cup glory at their home tournament in 1978, believes <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s differing form for club and country comes down to attitude]</b> He’s a great player who can give a lot to any team. But when he plays for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> he has a different attitude. He’s better there. Sometimes these things happen. You play well for a team and they love you, but you don’t feel at ease and something doesn’t fit. I don’t know what it is, but it should be something you feel inside</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> was a member of the squad which displayed ‘Las Malvinas son Argentinas’ <b>[The Falklands are Argentine]</b> banners during friendlies in the build-up. The war was already under way when the team left for Spain but there was never any question of the team not taking part. Daniel Passarella, the 1982 captain, later admitted it was the wrong decision]</b> I should not have played at the 1982 World Cup. A lot of kids died in Malvinas and I, as the captain, should have done something to stop us going on the pitch</p>
