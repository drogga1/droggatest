<blockquote>
  <p>[Lille midfielder Thiago Mendes says he is happy to be linked with Paris Saint-Germain] I do not think about that. I’m just focused on playing football right now and helping my team in the best way possible. The rest I leave in the hands of the leaders, the president [of Lille]. If there is an offer coming in and it’s good for both sides then we’ll talk, but at this point I’m just focused on the games. I’m happy with the interest of other teams, but as I said, I’m just focused on Lille. I want to give continuity to what I do, to my work, the rest I leave it in the hands of the president, the leaders, if they receive something they will tell me and we will discuss. I thank the other teams for making offers but now I am focused only on the objective of defending the colours of Lille.<br /><br />With the results of last year, this season is excellent for our team. I think we have great players who make the difference in attack, we have players who make a lot of effort. Three defeats at this time of the season is not what we expected but now we will have to continue, focus on the next game, win and give continuity to all of this. I think we learned from last season. When our supporters invaded the pitch, I had never felt such a sad feeling. I think it’s not just me, many players have figured out that it should not happen again. Coming to a critical situation of almost falling in Ligue 2, I believe that the fans have the right to criticise the players, but this is in the past now. Today we are having a very good time in the league and I still hope to give pleasure to our supporters</p>
