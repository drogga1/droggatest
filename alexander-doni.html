  <p>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> keeper Alexander Doni explains his role in <a href="alisson-becker.html">Alisson Becker</a>’s move to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>] When I saw him play, I immediately recommended him to <a href="john-achterberg.html">John Achterberg</a> and tried to get him signed. I explained to John that he was a very skillful player and that he would soon play for the national team. The first time I saw him playing for Inter, I knew he had what it takes to succeed in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.<br /><br />[Fighting off close competition with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s <a href="ederson.html">Ederson</a> for the number one spot, Doni was asked if Alisson ranks at the top of the list when it comes to the best in the world] Yes, without a doubt. I am very impressed with how quick he was able to adapt to the way <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is played and how quick he obtained success in England. This only shows what a great player and person he is. Besides being an overall complete player, I really like how he is able to maintain calm and control<br /><br />[When asked about his time at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, Doni reflects fondly on his time on Merseyside, despite only making four appearances before his departure in January 2013] It was short lived due to the issues I had, but it is a great club, a great city, and I am very grateful to have worn this amazing jersey. I still speak with <a href="john-achterberg.html">John Achterberg</a>, I think he is a great person and a great professional and I will always follow his career and Liverpool</p>
