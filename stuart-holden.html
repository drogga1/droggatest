  <p><b>[Carlos Cordeiro won the U.S. soccer election but must now defeat the ghost of Sunil Gulati]</b> We had a candidate that we could get behind, but also that we could unify behind. And we could use that power of the athlete to make a statement in a time of discourse, and all the separation and all the vitriol and everything that’s going around U.S. Soccer right now, that we had the ability to push our power behind someone and show that the athletes were in strength behind a single candidate and I think that’s what ultimately got us that consensus.<br /><br />Carlos Cordeiro is not Sunil Gulati. Carlos Cordeiro wants to lead with governance, he wants to lead by building a consensus and I think he wants to empower soccer people</p>

  <p><b>[Carlos Bocanegra being considered for USA general manager position]</b> Ultimately, he believes in the power of the athlete as well, and empowering athletes going forward. And you can mark my words, that’s something that we’re going to hold him accountable <b>[for]</b>, for some of the things that he’s talked about from the governance, from general manager, from having athletes involved in soccer decisions.</p>

  <p><b>[Stuart <a href="dean-holden.html">Holden</a> in his open letter addressing his retirement]</b> Life is great … isn’t it? Sometimes, life works in just the right way. As I sat down to write my retirement letter, the final chapter of my 11-year career, my wife went into labor with our first child</p>
