They have been gigantic experiences for him as a coach. Annoying experiences. But he also learned a lot and you never know in advance how such an adventure goes<br /><br />One club relieves the trainer quickly, the other is more steadfast and follows his line. I’ll look at those kinds of aspects. I do not exclude that I take the step, but I feel that I can achieve a lot at <a href="psv.html">PSV</a>. A longer European adventure for example</p>

  <p><b>[Phillip Cocu will not try to fill <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>’s shoes after taking charge of <a href="derby-county.html">Derby County</a>]</b> First of all, I’m very happy to be here, of course. I think this is the right step in my career - and the right fit. I can imagine the fans are sad he’s gone, because he did a good job. But it is a great opportunity for him to lead a team like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I’m not going to try to be like him - I’ll be myself - but what I like is the bond between the club and the fans<br /><br /><b>[Derby lost to <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> in the play-off final last season and Cocu feels, if his squad is strengthened, another top-six finish is a realistic goal for the 2019-20 campaign]</b> We are still working on strengthening the team. But in certain positions, we need some players with more experience, to guide the rest of the young team. There’s no buying just for buying. There always has to be an idea behind it. I believe we have the potential to be in the top six again. And reaching the play-off final last season is one more experience for the players. Especially with a younger squad, you need those experiences</p>

I am very happy he has joined the team. He will get better and develop, but for his age he is a very good player</p>

Like I said before, the team we are working on completing, the team we said is not complete yet, it’s true we are working on getting the team done. I cannot say anything about names before things are done. We have a lot of players we think could be an asset for the team, you try to get the best you can with resources you have at the club. A few more days and hopefully I can tell you something more</p>

  <p><b>[Rams boss Cocu added on acquiring the services of an iconic figure <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a>]</b> <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> is an extremely talented and top-class footballer. It is an exciting prospect for him to be joining <a href="derby-county.html">Derby County</a> and he can bring so much to this squad, both on and off the pitch. He has enjoyed a wonderful career, both in club football and for England, and he still has so much to give as well. His credentials speak for themselves. But to have a player with his leadership, skill, experience, character and work ethic will be huge for us. He knows what it takes to succeed as a player and I have no doubt he will have a positive impact right across the club. The inspiration and motivation this can generate is massive for all of our players from the first team right through to the youngsters in the Academy. It is entirely in keeping with, and in support of, the club’s philosophy and approach. I am looking forward to working with Wayne from the start of next year and welcoming him to the club</p>

It’s good that he is here and the fans can see him. He will get involved in team tactics and we can use and benefit from his experience<br /><br />He will get to know the way we want to play and how we want to work. He will be important between the link up in players and management. It’s an important period for us to make a good combination</p>

He comes back from the States, joins us and now plays his old club where he had a great career. We have to wait for a month but I’m sure he’ll be ready. It will be a beautiful game not just for Wayne, but everyone at the club. It’s a great game to look forward to and we will also try to win it, against a strong opponent</p>

  <p><b>[Derby maintained their late charge for the Championship play-offs with a 2-1 victory against Reading at Pride Park]</b> We just focus on one game at a time and on our football. We were playing much better before the break happened and we have carried that on after the restart. It is not the same without the fans but we have been very good at home and it is pleasing to get another win. We are in a position to fight for a play-off spot with all the other teams</p>

Both teams tried to play with a lot of energy and at a high intensity but in the end a great goal gave us the win<br /><br />We have some very tough games coming up but they are also great challenges for us. We have to show that we’ve developed against the bigger teams but there are still a lot of games to play and I’m just happy with this win</p>

  <p><b>[Andre Wisdom may miss rest of <a href="derby-county.html">Derby County</a> season after knife attack]</b> Definitely not for the weekend and I don’t know at the moment if he will play <b>[again]</b> this season. It could be but maybe not. It is up to him and it depends on his recovery. Not only does he have to recover from his wounds, although he needs time for that, but also the mental impact of such an event, which is quite big. I said to him he can have the time he needs to get well and the moment he feels ready to come back and start training again, then the door is open for him but without any pressure. We need to give him all the time he needs to recover.</p>

  <p><b>[In-form Said Benrahma scored two second-half goals as he inspired automatic promotion-chasing Brentford to a 3-1 victory over Derby at Pride Park]</b> It’s frustrating, events occur during the game but I think we played a decent game against a very strong team. Ben took full responsibility for his mistake but I think it’s also too easy to only blame the goalkeeper because if a striker, Benrahma, is able to take a shot in the 18-yard box just two-and-a-half minutes after the break it is just poor defending by the whole team</p>

  <p><b>[A <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> mistake all but ended Derby’s promotion hopes as Cardiff consolidated their position in the Championship play-offs with a 2-1 home victory]</b> It’s mistakes which cost us the game. It’s always something you try to avoid but you have to be solid in defence and not make mistakes. We didn’t do that. In the last three games there have just been too many mistakes and they have been unnecessary - that’s why we are not in the play-offs.<br /><br />Conceding poor goals is something we need to change for next season if we want to get into the play-offs. I can see the progress we have made this season, but in the end we are playing games to win them. We are mid-table and it’s not good enough to get into the play-offs. They are out of sight</p>
