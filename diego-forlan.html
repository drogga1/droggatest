  <p><b>[Diego Forlan about his coaching plans]</b> I’d love to work as a duo with my brother. He played football too, as a defender, and my dad was a player, too. We’re a very close family as a whole and of course the three of us - my dad, my brother and I - are always going on about football. They were both defenders and I’m a striker, so we could get a good team going</p>

  <p><b>[The former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and <a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a> striker has expounded on why he chose the ISL over the other leagues]</b> I am 37 and about to move to India to continue my football career. The world’s second-most populous country will be the eighth in which I have lived and played professional football after Argentina, England, Spain, Italy, Brazil, Japan and Uruguay.<br /><br /><b>[Wrting about the extent to which he looks after his fitness habits]</b> I keep really fit. I wake up at 7am each morning and work out with a personal trainer. I still have the drive and motivation to play. I still feel sharp in front of goal and I was playing for the national team until last year<br /><br /><b>[Expressing the notion behind his choosing India as his next destination in a career that has spanned over 500 league games]</b> So, why India? It is different, for a start. I had offers to play in England this summer and last. The only team I will play for in England is <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. If <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a>, <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a>, <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a> and <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> all get injured, I would be happy to go on an emergency loan and help out United. Maybe play at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> away, score a goal or two and then make way when the injured come back.<br /><br />I had offers from Spain and Italy, too. But I feel that I have done my time in both countries, sampled the life there and enjoyed myself. Now I am ready for something new. India is definitely that. Cricket is the Number one sport, especially in Mumbai where I am headed, but the ISL has been a success.<br /><br />The average attendances across all the games was 27,224 last season. That makes it the fifth-highest average for any league in the world. Atletico de Kolkata, who have links to my old club <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>, had a crowd of 68,000 for one game<br /><br />The standards are improving, too. When the league started in 2014, the big-name foreign players tended to be ones who had just retired. Now, because the Indian League wants to improve standards, they are attracting people who are still playing. <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Nicolas Anelka</a>, Elano, <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a>, <a href="adrian-mutu.html">Adrian Mutu</a>, <a href="florent-malouda.html">Florent Malouda</a>, Helder Postiga, Didier Zokora and <a href="john-arne-riise.html">John Arne Riise</a> and my old teammate Simao were all involved last year<br /><br /><b>[He further added on the coaches and the format of India’s most popular league]</b> Some will be involved again, while Steve Coppell and <a href="gianluca-zambrotta.html">Gianluca Zambrotta</a> have already been confirmed as managers. The teams are spending serious money to get good footballers. The league may be extended next year from the current three-month format<br /><br /><b>[The former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> star forward propagated the notion of quitting football once he fell out of love with his vocation]</b> I do not intend to stop when the Indian Super League, which only lasts for three months this season, finishes before the end of 2016. I would happily play in North America next year and have already had people sounding me out about it. I do it because I love football. It is my job. It is what I get paid to do and it is what I still enjoy. If I did not, I would quit<br /><br />I have happy memories from all. Some worked out better than others and I would have rather played more games and scored more goals at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> or <a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a>, but I look back at my career with pride. People used to say that a football career was 15 years. I have been playing professional football for 20 and have no intention of stopping. My father always told me to enjoy playing while I could, so I am doing that<br /><br /><b>[About his wife Paz Cardozo]</b> Football has allowed me to see the world and in Paz, I have a wife who is keen to see the world with me. She was happy to move to Brazil and Japan. She was also happy to be back in our native Uruguay for the birth of our first child, Martin.<br /><br />Some players have partners who are not keen to move around. If Paz did not want to, I would not be going to India, but this is a lady who did really well learning Japanese when we lived there, who climbed Mount Fuji without me and who learnt to paint in a Japanese style. She is enthusiastic about moving to India and taking our son with us</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Forlan says Joao Felix has a big future ahead of him at <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> following his record-breaking move from Benfica]</b> I saw him at Benfica and he did spectacular things. He’s a different player and he’s lucky to now be part of a hard-working and humble team. They know that they’ve achieved what they have through effort and sacrifice and some of that is down to the coaching staff. If he’s humble, respectful and can listen, he’ll be a player who grows up to give us a lot to talk about. He has a big future<br /><br /><b>[The Uruguayan believes that <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> are on the right path to finally win the European Cup one day]</b> They came very close twice. Once leading until the 93rd minute and losing the other on penalties. They’re on the right track but everyone prepares themselves to win the Champions League. Nobody wants to cross Atletico because of what they’ve achieved. They’ve earned respect<br /><br /><b>[Forlan went on to praise the club’s steady progress over the last decade]</b> They grow year after year. They changed the stadium and they’ve shown their development in the most important way - with results. <a href="diego-simeone.html">Diego Simeone</a>’s arrival has meant that year after year the players change but the requirements are the same</p>

  <p><b>[Having travelled all over the world taught me a lot]</b> How every country lives football, how the prepare for the day to day, how the cultural side affects the working tactics on the different teams. Then it’s 11v11 inside the field but there are some things you have to realise that won’t be the same in Japan, here in Uruguay or in Spain. I’ve learned a lot from all of them. I’ve learned a lot from the Spanish football, from the Italian football, from the Brazilian football. For me, that’s an advantage of having travelled all over the world and being able to learn it. To experience it and adding things because I don’t have a crystal ball, and neither do the Spanish or the Japanese. I think a bit of everything is important to do something better</p>
