  <p><b>[Southampton defender Nathaniel Clyne is determined to impress for England and make the right-back position his own]</b> I need to go the training sessions and show what I am about and hopefully I will get my chance and start for England. The aim is to take step by step but I am not here for fun and games. I am here to nail my colours to the mast and hopefully take that right-back position and make it my own. I am not really focused on who is in or who is out, who is injured or not. I am just focusing on myself and if I am doing well then hopefully I will get a chance, like I have done, and play well when I get one. I am still up and coming in the game and I still need to improve on my game. Hopefully this will be another step for me, to play for England, and hopefully I will improve. I am buzzing and I can’t wait to get started and join in with the lads. They are world-class players and to see what they are like in training and hopefully I can match up to that.</p>

  <p><b>[Southampton full-back Nathaniel Clyne is in no doubt that he has the talent to be a star for England]</b> It’s always good to play for your country. If you play well then you get picked up. I think I’ve got the ability to play for my country, definitely. I’m playing with lots of confidence. Hopefully I can get called up again and receive my first cap</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool star Nathaniel Clyne ready to make up for lost time]</b> They were tough times. It was difficult, for sure. To be out for so long is frustrating, and the fact that it came during pre-season probably made it even worse. Then to eventually have to have surgery, that was another setback, it was tough. You’re there, and the players are all going out to train while you’re off to the gym or the physio room, day after day. You’re on the bike or whatever, and that’s all you can do. It does affect you.<br /><br />Yeah it wasn’t easy. When I came back it was the business end of the season, so the games were big and had a lot riding on them, so to have to go straight in was a test for me. But it was important for me to get a few minutes under my belt, get a taste for it again and set me up to go again in pre-season. I’ve worked hard to get my fitness back, and I can feel the benefits. I’ve been working hard, the club gives us regimes to follow even during the off-season, so that we keep ticking over. I probably need that more than others because I’ve been out so long, so I’ve already been doing bits. I feel as fit as ever and I’m already looking forward to the start of pre-season. It’s about proving to people now that I’m back and I’m as good as ever<br /><br /><b>[Clyne’s absence last season opened the door for both Joe Gomez and Trent Alexander-Arnold at Liverpool]</b> I can remember when he first stepped up from the U23s to the first team. Straight away in training you could see his potential. He’s had his chance this season, and he’s taken it very well. He’s a very confident player, good on the ball. He’s impressive. He’s passed all the tests that have come his way, and I’m sure if he’s given a chance in the World Cup he will do really well. Since I’ve been injured, I’ve watched how Liverpool have done well and how England have done well, and that’s given me extra incentive. It’s a big motivation. Like I say, I’m fully fit now, and I can’t wait to come back and show how good I am again!<br /><br />Of course I look forward to it. I think everyone does. I’ll be watching the games as much as I can, certainly all the England games. I’ll be cheering the boys on, hoping they can do well. I’m confident that England will do really well, actually. They’re a really solid team, very good defensively. We don’t concede many goals, and the new formation I think has helped with that. Then you look at the attacking players who can create and score goals, there are lots of them in the squad. We have a very complete team<br /><br />It can help that maybe there isn’t as much expectation as in other years. But there is always pressure playing for England, that’s just a fact. Whether it comes from the media or wherever, it will always be there. But for me we should be confident going into the tournament, we have a good team, good players and we have a chance to do well<br /><br /><b>[Good enough to win it?]</b> I’m not going to say that! I can’t call who will win it actually. There are four or five really strong sides in there; Brazil, France, Germany. But England shouldn’t be written off, I’m sure of that!</p>

  <p><b>[Nathaniel Clyne is reluctant to speculate on his Liverpool future]</b> I haven’t really spoken <b>[to Jurgen Klopp]</b> or thought about what’s going to happen at the end of the season. I’m just concentrating on playing football right now and staying match fit, and improving. I am starting to get my rhythm back and that comes with playing matches - and it’s part of the reason I came here.<br /><br />You can see right now in the dressing room they will just be enjoying the opportunity they have. They’re top of the league - it’s on them really. All they need to do is do their best in their games and that will lead them over the line<br /><br />We’ve done really well against Arsenal and hopefully we can do the same again - but it’s not going to be easy going to the Emirates against a tough Arsenal side. Everyone is going to have to be at the top of their game to get something. With any big team you have to be at 100 per cent. I always relish playing against the big teams and putting on big performances. It shows your character</p>
