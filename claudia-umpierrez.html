  <p><b>[Claudia Umpierrez set to referee at her second <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Women’s World Cup in France]</b> As the captains chose which end to play from, my career seemed to play out before my eyes like a movie. I thought about how it had all started on a little pitch in my home town of Pan de Azucar, and then looked at where I was now - in a stadium in front of over 30,000 spectators<br /><br />The path to becoming a referee was and still is tough. I train in the morning, after that I work a seven or eight-hour-day as a lawyer and then also look after my daughter.<br /><br />If you asked me if I’d rather be a full-time referee, my answer would obviously be yes. But unfortunately that’s not possible, because I couldn’t put food on the table for my family in the country where I live if that were my sole profession<br /><br /><b>[Umpierrez is nevertheless trying to make the very best of the situation]</b> Being a referee is my passion. To be a good ref, you have to be persistent, be able to make decisions and you can never give up. It’s important to establish clear lines on the pitch, but at the same time it’s the players who are the main protagonists, not the referees - that’s something we should never forget.<br /><br />I would love to see more women refereeing men’s football. That was a milestone and great experience. It demonstrated what we women are capable of and that we can be counted on.<br /><br />Working in men’s football has allowed me to focus on my rhythm and my stamina and I’m reaping the benefits now, since women’s football has now come on immensely in recent years and got a whole lot quicker<br /><br /><b>[Umpierrez is of course looking forward to the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Women’s World Cup in France]</b> The 90 minutes of every match is what it all comes down to. You have all this preparation but that is the important part</p>

  <p><b>[Uruguay’s Claudia Umpierrez will sound her whistle to kick off this summer’s Women’s World Cup]</b> I’m incredibly happy to have been given this opportunity. All the hard work has paid off. It’s the biggest match of my life. I got a taste of the World Cup at Canada 2015, but this tops everything</p>

  <p><b>[Claudia Umpierrez, from Uruguay, was chosen to be the referee in that match, assisted by Luciana Mascarana also from Uruguay and by Ecuador’s Monica Amboya]</b> It was not an easy job at all, quite the opposite … I thought it would be easier than it really was</p>

  <p><b>[Claudia Umpierrez speaks about leading the first all-female refereeing team to officiate at a men’s World Cup]</b> There were tears of sadness at times when things didn’t go the way we wanted, but now the tears are of joy because it feels like our like dreams are being realised</p>
