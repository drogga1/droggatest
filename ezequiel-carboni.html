<blockquote>
  <p><b>[When <a href="diego-simeone.html">Diego Pablo Simeone</a> saved Catania from relegation]</b> The results hadn’t arrived under Giampaolo. From the moment <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a> arrived, he had the necessary personality to manage a group that was full of Italians and Argentines.<br /><br />When Catania are doing well, it’s a crazy place and that victory generated an enthusiasm that lasted for such a long time. <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a> was decisive in the management of a tough situation and that victory gave us more belief and only strengthened our faith in him. Yes, the coach made us train with incredibly intensity but what is maybe discussed less is his great quality and his incredible ability to read his opponents. He gave every one of us homework to do and then he left us in peace: you knew that every team made had received his orders and that they wouldn’t fail to carry them out.<br /><br />We had just won at <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a> and were were on the return flight to Sicily. Sporting director Pietro Lo Monaco had convinced the pilot to put the radio on so that we could listen to the final few minutes of Genoa-Sampdoria. Mauro Boselli’s injury-time winner for Genoa meant we were mathematically safe and I still remember today with great emotion the explosion of joy that lasted until the end of that flight. We were all celebrating. I had never seen Lo Monaco so happy. But <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a> and his staff were also euphoric</p>
