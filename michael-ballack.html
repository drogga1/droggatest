I’m going to talk to Philipp about this. This is not an issue for me, though. I am still the captain</p>

He grew up in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> and he is for sure one of the most gifted players we have at the moment. There a few players like him who know what to do in every situation, just like he does. If he is able to perform on his highest level, there are few others who are able to always make the right move like he does. But he has to feel good and he has to bring it. That he was not able to do so in the recent past, neither at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> nor the national team, is probably for many different reasons. Maybe it was trust, there were a lot of speculations, but I think <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> knows best how to treat him</p>

  <p><b>[Former Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack believes that Diego Costa needs to show more loyalty to the Blues]</b> It’s up to him with his attitude and his commitment to the club. Because he’s playing for Chelsea and they gave him the possibility to shine and to perform well at one of the biggest clubs in Europe - and he should not forget that. Of course, offers are coming with crazy numbers from China, but players should remember they are playing in a fantastic league in Europe and are top of the top, in terms of being watched, the quality of clubs, the players and they are on good money. Nobody would complain about their contracts<br /><br />It’s a bit of a disturbance to see all these offers coming in, but Costa is professional enough to see what a fantastic club Chelsea is. On the other side, each club and each player has to deal with these kinds of situations. What is important; is that they win the league and the next game. Already, he found a good answer last week by coming back and scoring</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Ballack says John Terry should remain at Chelsea]</b> I can’t really recommend playing for another club because if you play for Chelsea for such a long time at that level - especially in the Champions League - and playing for the title, it is a little bit difficult to take a step down. You should always try and stop at the highest level, where people will remember you really well, what you have achieved, what you have done - for his country as well - and I’m pretty sure he will find a good solution for himself. It’s not always easy to find a good access as a player when you get older. It’s never easy, because you love that sport and you want to do it as long as possible. But I think he will do the right step - I would not do it <b>[join a lower club in England]</b>.</p>

His charisma is not so good, fellow players, coaches, fans and the media do not feel that he is fighting against his current situation. He’s more an introvert player.</p>

I know what it means if your career comes to an end and you’re getting older. You don’t know whether you extend your contract, play for another club or go abroad to America. I’m sure he has some options but if you think long-term, you have to feel comfortable with the decision.<br /><br />If you don’t feel comfortable with what you want to do then don’t do it. That’s what I can advise. It’s not always easy to make a decision because you must be 100 per cent convinced.

  <p><b>[Michael Ballack has called on Antonio Conte to splash the cash to convince Eden Hazard to stay at Chelsea and reject a move to Real Madrid]</b> Any club in the world wants to have him. If Real Madrid wants to spend so much money then that shows how good he is but he has to make sure he knows what he has at Chelsea. If we talk about winning the Champions League, of course, Real Madrid is ahead because Chelsea aren’t in the competition yet. It could be a factor for a player to know, that his club will spend, to sign those two or three players <b>[to get to the next level]</b>. To show their existing key players, to see that they can be happy with that squad, right now <b>[and trust]</b> the squad to prove what they can do. That’s something that he should look at as well. He is a superstar in that team and, of course, Chelsea is always a team that looks to win the Champions League as well. The club always looks to make sure that the club is strong enough to achieve that target. If you are a main player and a key player in that team, that’s something you will think about.<br /><br /><b>[Hazard went on a 356-day goal drought in the Premier League last season]</b> He had a difficult year last year where he seemed at times to not be as motivated. He didn’t enjoy his football that much compared to this season. It looks like that watching him on the pitch.<br /><br />If you fight for years to be in that position and you want to make a move, especially in this case to Real Madrid, everything would start again new for him. Of course, <b>[he can do it]</b> he has that quality, but next to him will be one, two, three of a different calibre.<br /><br />He will have to fight for his place again in that team. We know the history of players at Real Madrid and things are not easy at that club. It is a fantastic club though and I can’t give him advice, he must decide it. There will be money involved for the player, from the clubs, everyone will have to be happy from that side <b>[for it to happen]</b>.<br /><br />It is a big match with different expectations <b>[for both teams]</b>. Chelsea are leading the league and they want to protect first place, especially after defeat at the weekend, they want to prove again that they are right at the top of the league. Manchester City are fighting for the Champions League place, that’s a really tricky game for both. They are two fantastic teams with a lot of fantastic individual players, so there will be a lot of quality on the pitch and hopefully we will see some goals and some offensive football</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Ballack has revealed that he has been hugely impressed by Manchester City’s Leroy Sane]</b> I am impressed by his physical improvements since he changed club, as he was just a young kid from Schalke. He adapted quickly to the Premier League and he has this confidence to go dribbling, he’s open to face defenders. Sometimes he gets knocks but he stands up and is not hiding. He is asking them questions again, not scared of the challenge. He has improved his game so much, because of his physical ability to make long runs. Sometimes he will play full-back, wing-back or on the wing.<br /><br />I’ve seen fantastic games when he has been more defensive and made his long runs forward with the ball and without the ball. His vision on the ball <b>[is great]</b>. his left foot, he has a great touch and I am sure with Pep Guardiola as a coach, he will learn and learn and learn more as he grows in age. He has shown that with the national team as well when he played in the last months. He was quality, not nervous and performed immediately. I am pretty sure he will be one of the key players in the future for Germany.<br /><br />I didn’t expect Chelsea would come back so quick and so strong after a difficult season. I thought Man City is the team that you have to beat <b>[to win the title]</b> this year. Sometimes a new coach can find it not easy. A long season with the Champions League, things change, a different style of football and the team has to adapt to the coach as well. Sometimes it works well <b>[like with Chelsea]</b>, sometimes it is not so quick <b>[with City]</b>. I am sure he has the quality and Man City has the quality to win the league next year.</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Ballack says that Germany will be taking a risk selecting Manuel Neuer for the World Cup with the goalkeeper having not played due to injury for nine months]</b> I think it’s a really delicate situation. A special situation. Neuer is the world’s best goalkeeper, and he has this special status because of that. If we were talking about anyone else, they would not be in the squad. But the coach and the training staff have this belief in him. They have a good relationship.<br /><br />Neuer says he is pain free, he is training. For a goalkeeper, the situation <b>[of not playing for so long]</b> is a bit different to what it would be if he was an outfield player. It’s still a special situation, though, as he hasn’t played any games yet ahead of the World Cup. Of course, it is a risk to take him but we have people who are taking the responsibility for that choice. The coach, of course, has to believe in him and the team also as the players always have to believe in their goalkeeper. I think the trust is there and when they see him in training they will know. But, of course, there is always a little bit of risk there when you haven’t played any games</p>

  <p><b>[Leroy Sane snub makes no sense]</b> For me, it makes no sense at all. As you mention it, he had a great season. The way he is playing football I think suits every team. There’s no tactical scheme which doesn’t allow him to not be in the first XI or even in the squad. It was surprising for me and for a lot of people. To get the final answer, you have to ask the coach Joachim Low his thoughts were about that. He was comparing him with Brandt, in a one-versus-one comparison he decided with Brandt. I don’t think that’s 100% the answer, to be honest. There must be something going on behind the scenes where he is not happy with Leroy Sane to make the decision. He should tell this then, so everyone knows that this has happened why he is not part of the squad. Football-wise, it is very hard to understand. I was not working with him on a daily basis but there must be something behind the scenes which forced him into that decision. When I see the games, and that’s what counts in football, week-in week-out, in every competition, he plays well so that’s why it is very difficult to understand.<br /><br />We have a great squad. He is really lucky to pick from so many good players. It is not just one Leroy Sane, we have lots of different players with <b>[Marco]</b> Reus, with <b>[Julian]</b> Draxler who also not always playing but he trusts them more at the moment. You have to accept that but he has options, that’s the main thing. He has options and he can make decisions to also maybe wake up the team a bit because the last performance didn’t go so well <b>[a 2-1 defeat to Austria on Saturday]</b>. We will see. I am really looking forward to the World Cup, as are many people as we are expecting really good football. Germany is well prepared like always, we are one of the favourites.<br /><br />We are having this little bit of extra pressure maybe because all the teams want to play really well against Germany. So we know really well about that but we are prepared. We have a good balanced team and, yes, I expect that we will go far. If you win it and I know it from my past, the expectations then grow but it is up to the coach and the players to handle that pressure. To handle that expectation, not to block or be stiff. Just go there, enjoy your football and perform. I don’t think that it is not a success if you don’t win.<br /><br />What we want to see is good football, that talents are improving and they are playing their game. Sometimes you can lose games unluckily or the other team is better than you and has a great day as well. That can happen in football. A lot of things have to come together to win a World Cup. It is not easy, you need also a little bit of luck in a few situations. What I expect is good football and hopefully we can see it. I think the squad improved compared to 2002, and even 2006. You could already see a few young talents came up through 2010. Finally 2014 we could win it.<br /><br />I think that compared to the last World Cup in 2014, we have lost some leaders. Phillip Lahm, Miroslav Klose, <b>[Per]</b> Mertesacker, <b>[Bastian]</b> Schwiensteiger are not playing anymore. These are the leaders that you have to replace. This is not easy. It is not work from one day to another, it needs time. We have a few players who were part of the former team. <b>[Thomas]</b> Muller, <b>[Manuel]</b> Neuer and also <b>[Mats]</b> Hummels. They can lead the team. Some young players coming in, Draxler, <b>[Leon]</b> Goretzka, Sane is not in the squad which is a bit surprising. I’d love to see him playing as well but these kinds of players gives the team a bit of specialty and hopefully it can work out as well</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Ballack has spelled out how Chelsea can lure Eden Hazard into renewing his contract at the club]</b> You have to pay him a lot of money! But more importantly, you have to give him a vision. You have to tell him how important he is, ask him what he wants from the club and to give him a little bit more responsibility. You need to find out what he wants as well, ask him if he’s happy. Of course, you want to win something and be as successful as possible as an individual player. It is normal to look around and think, ‘With what club can I achieve that with?’.<br /><br />It is a good example when you see the best players and superstars in the team are happy. How they perform is a good sign that something is right in the team. That the relationship is good, that the atmosphere is good. I always said he is an incredible player. From my perspective, he should have even more responsibility and even more impact on the team. Not just to enjoy individual freedom which he likes. Players sometimes don’t want to have this heavy weight on their shoulders to carry the team or to get asked in certain situations to have that responsibility. I think he is the player who should do that in that team. If you understand how important it is for yourself and for your game and you can handle it, then it will transfer to the team and you will take the next step<br /><br />Of course, the team was still good after last season. There’s not huge changes in the squad from before but sometimes they were a bit pragmatic and you could see as an opponent team what to expect when Chelsea was coming. It is a bit more flexible now, I would say, with a little bit more freedom to go forward. A little bit more freedom in certain positions in the pitch. They still have that Italian base, a defence-orientated structure which is really important to win in the long term, and to be successful in the long term you need defensive organisation. They had that before but my opinion is that there’s a little bit more going on and movement towards the front</p>

  <p><b>[Ruben Loftus-Cheek was told as a youngster to watch Michael Ballack in Chelsea’s academy at Cobham Training Ground]</b> I say use your strength. His size is a natural gift and he has used it in the past. He just scored three goals and that has a big impact. He should work hard and go in that direction. He has been compared to me, but comparisons can sometimes put pressure on. It is the same if people compare him with another ex-player, he has to find his own way. As a player, he is able to play a good role in a big team. It is interesting and nice to hear <b>[that he was told to copy my game]</b>. He has a big advantage because he has the body to impose himself. He has the personality when he steps on the pitch, people recognise him and he can naturally intimidate his opponents. He should use that, not be overconfident but use his body to also intimidate the opposition players. He needs to find a way to be a consistent member of the squad and to make that next step now. It is really important at a really good club to be in the first XI and develop himself week-in, week-out on the pitch, not just to come in as a sub. Of course, it will be really difficult but that should be his target now in the near future - be in the first XI. Even if you are happy at the club, you need to ask for it. His type of player, midfielders who drive in the box, are really rare. There’s lots of players around who can read the game well and are technically brilliant and defensively orientated but to be able to score in the box sets you apart. Chelsea have had fantastic players like that, the best example is <b>[Frank]</b> Lampard. That’s something he should develop and that’s a difference between really good players and world class players in that position.<br /><br />This is a big squad and there’s a lot of competition in the Premier League. I am smiling because I know about internal battle for places a little bit. That is normal for a club like Chelsea for the level that they want to play. They have multiple options for one position. There’s many good players in that position. That’s a luxury but not a worry for them<br /><br /><b>[On Manchester City]</b> I don’t know if they can make 100 points every season, it seems difficult. Especially with the tight competition in the Premier League. Of course, this achievement shows the quality that City has. It is something that should challenge Chelsea and with the squad they have, they are able to do it. They are unbeaten right now in all competitions and they should develop a mental quality ahead of a game directly against Man City. That game could affect Man City as a team. In football a lot can happen, I wouldn’t say Man City have won the title already. The new coach and the way they play, they are able to compete and they should maintain it and try to win it. Hopefully at Chelsea they don’t think that Man City are too good! That would mean you give it up early. They are a strong opponent, of course, but they can be beaten. You have to be extremely consistent and strong in the long term to compete. Man City barely drops any points. When you see their matches, they have a plan in the way they play. They also have a great depth of their squad, this is a really challenging situation for everyone. For me, Chelsea’s squad is good enough to compete in both Europe and the league easily. I know from my experience in the past, if you find a good squad balance, you can compete in both competitions</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho would bring a certain glamour to Bayern Munich]</b> Right now Niko Kovac is the head coach and that should be respected. He does a good job. <b>[But]</b> one cannot deny that, at some point in the future, the appointment of Mourinho would bring a certain glamour to the club and the Bundesliga. It has been seen with Pep Guardiola - his appointment gave the league a giant jolt, even if he did not win the Champions League at the end with Bayern. Guardiola introduced a certain style of play, he’s an exceptional coach. In addition, the international profile of each club is many times higher when you get Guardiola or Mourinho. With a coach like Mourinho, it’s probably easier for a club to get top stars. At the moment, the Bundesliga does not have the same appeal for world-class players as the Premier League. But Bayern would be well-advised to have world stars in their team.<br /><br />Mourinho spoke in high spirits about the club. And at Bayern, again and again, top foreign coaches have had success: Giovanni Trapattoni, Louis van Gaal, Pep Guardiola, Carlo Ancelotti</p>

  <p><b>[Ballack dismisses criticism of ‘intense’ ex-Chelsea boss]</b> You really get caught by his personality and by his ambitions. Working with a coach like that was something totally new for me. He was impressive and I felt totally comfortable with the decision <b>[to sign for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b>. The relationship is still good with him. You will not find many players who speak badly about him<br /><br /><b>[When quizzed on <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>’s sudden <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> exit in September 2007]</b> I was experienced enough to understand. When you are not winning, the coach is more or less the weakest person in the team who can be replaced. He was in his fourth year. If you look at the average time a manager has to work in a club, it was quite a good time. The way he worked was so intense that maybe you come to a point where things are not working anymore. Even then, the fans know what he achieved at the club to take them back to that level<br /><br /><b>[Ballack said of Grant, who was sacked after just eight months at the helm]</b> He never really had a chance. It is really difficult, after <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>, to work at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. It could cause a problem for any manager because <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> had such a relationship with the players and the fans. Grant managed the team in a different way. A lot of players thought he would be weak, but he wasn’t. He was really smart and intelligent</p>

  <p><b>[Germany great Michael Ballack says <a href="kai-havertz.html">Kai Havertz</a> should resist the urge to leave Bayer Leverkusen for <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> at least for the time being]</b> Players with his quality are in demand everywhere, but I think he’s in good hands in Leverkusen. The general conditions there are perfect for top young players and their further development. Leverkusen play attractive football, the training opportunities are very good. Leverkusen also offers a cautious environment. As a player <b>[at Leverkusen]</b> you can sometimes make mistakes without being the focus of criticism - you should appreciate that. Of course, a player like <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> would also like to play in the Champions League, so it would be important for Leverkusen to qualify<br /><br />As a footballer he’d bring everything with him. If we talk about <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, if you want to take the next step as a player, you also have to be prepared for such a challenge in order to survive in such a robust environment. That will really weigh up his surroundings - <b>[determine]</b> when the right time has come to take the next step</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Ballack says <a href="kai-havertz.html">Kai Havertz</a> needs regular Champions League football and Bayer Leverkusen must secure a top-four finish]</b> I think he’s a great talent. He has outstanding technical skills and plays very freely. It will be important for him to always play in the Champions League in order to be able to compete with the best. Therefore it will be important for Leverkusen to reach fourth place<br /><br /><b>[Ballack warned the 20-year-old still has plenty of room for improvement]</b> One thing is clear - <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> is not yet a finished player. That is not meant negatively, but I still see potential for improvement in his personality development and body language. But that is completely normal at his age. As a captain, he first has to learn to deal with this responsibility. His style of play has always been very carefree. If he ever lost the ball, he was allowed to stop. With a top club, everything will be more difficult and will no longer be accepted. He must and will be aware that he has an exceptional position in Leverkusen. He should ask himself now, ‘How long do I want to have this? How long do I enjoy it? Or will I take on the next challenge with even greater demands on my game this summer?’. It comes with games and experience, especially with your own aspirations. It is crucial what <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> demands from himself and his team and where his own path should lead. In any case, he has to be mentally ready for a change.</p>

I think that in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> he has decided on a club where he has a better chance of playing, which is very important to him.

He is a robust player, is very fast, but he is also physically good in a duel and he will quickly get used to it</p>
