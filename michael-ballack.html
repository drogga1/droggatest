  <p><b>[Lahm was eventually made captain of Germany and <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>. He took over from Ballack when the latter was injured in the runup to the 2010 World Cup. Ballack, however, would not go quietly. Only a few days after Germany’s campaign in South Africa ended in the semi-finals against Spain, Ballack criticised Lahm]</b> I am the captain of the national team. <a href="philipp-lahm.html">Philipp Lahm</a> made his claim at a moment that I felt was inopportune. I was injured and couldn’t defend myself. A player can’t request what position he wants to play - and it is the same with the captaincy. One should respect that there are hierarchies. I’m going to talk to Philipp about this. This is not an issue for me, though. I am still the captain</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Ballack on <a href="mario-gotze.html">Mario Gotze</a>’s return to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>]</b> I can’t judge that move, just like most of us can’t. He grew up in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> and he is for sure one of the most gifted players we have at the moment. There a few players like him who know what to do in every situation, just like he does. If he is able to perform on his highest level, there are few others who are able to always make the right move like he does. But he has to feel good and he has to bring it. That he was not able to do so in the recent past, neither at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> nor the national team, is probably for many different reasons. Maybe it was trust, there were a lot of speculations, but I think <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> knows best how to treat him</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Ballack claims mentally weak <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> were never a match during his time at Chelsea]</b> They were always special games for me because <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are a good club to be playing against but I always felt at that time we were mentally stronger and we were the better team. The statistics from that time show some good wins for us, but we also lost to them. Now with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> playing <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> this season, it is a situation where you can put a rival in trouble with a big victory.

Experience speaks strongly in their favour. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s transfer ban has compelled them to put their faith in young players.

  <p><b>[Ballack dismisses criticism of ‘intense’ ex-Chelsea boss]</b> You really get caught by his personality and by his ambitions. Working with a coach like that was something totally new for me. He was impressive and I felt totally comfortable with the decision <b>[to sign for Chelsea]</b>. The relationship is still good with him. You will not find many players who speak badly about him<br /><br /><b>[When quizzed on <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>’s sudden <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> exit in September 2007]</b> I was experienced enough to understand. When you are not winning, the coach is more or less the weakest person in the team who can be replaced. He was in his fourth year. If you look at the average time a manager has to work in a club, it was quite a good time. The way he worked was so intense that maybe you come to a point where things are not working anymore. Even then, the fans know what he achieved at the club to take them back to that level<br /><br /><b>[Ballack said of Grant, who was sacked after just eight months at the helm]</b> He never really had a chance. It is really difficult, after <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>, to work at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. It could cause a problem for any manager because <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> had such a relationship with the players and the fans. Grant managed the team in a different way. A lot of players thought he would be weak, but he wasn’t. He was really smart and intelligent</p>

  <p><b>[Germany great Michael Ballack says <a href="kai-havertz.html">Kai Havertz</a> should resist the urge to leave Bayer Leverkusen for <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> at least for the time being]</b> Players with his quality are in demand everywhere, but I think he’s in good hands in Leverkusen. The general conditions there are perfect for top young players and their further development. Leverkusen play attractive football, the training opportunities are very good. Leverkusen also offers a cautious environment. As a player <b>[at Leverkusen]</b> you can sometimes make mistakes without being the focus of criticism - you should appreciate that. Of course, a player like <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> would also like to play in the Champions League, so it would be important for Leverkusen to qualify<br /><br />As a footballer he’d bring everything with him. If we talk about <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, if you want to take the next step as a player, you also have to be prepared for such a challenge in order to survive in such a robust environment. That will really weigh up his surroundings - <b>[determine]</b> when the right time has come to take the next step</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Ballack says <a href="kai-havertz.html">Kai Havertz</a> needs regular Champions League football and Bayer Leverkusen must secure a top-four finish]</b> I think he’s a great talent. He has outstanding technical skills and plays very freely. It will be important for him to always play in the Champions League in order to be able to compete with the best. Therefore it will be important for Leverkusen to reach fourth place<br /><br /><b>[Ballack warned the 20-year-old still has plenty of room for improvement]</b> One thing is clear - <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> is not yet a finished player. That is not meant negatively, but I still see potential for improvement in his personality development and body language. But that is completely normal at his age. As a captain, he first has to learn to deal with this responsibility. His style of play has always been very carefree. If he ever lost the ball, he was allowed to stop. With a top club, everything will be more difficult and will no longer be accepted. He must and will be aware that he has an exceptional position in Leverkusen. He should ask himself now, ‘How long do I want to have this? How long do I enjoy it? Or will I take on the next challenge with even greater demands on my game this summer?’. It comes with games and experience, especially with your own aspirations. It is crucial what <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> demands from himself and his team and where his own path should lead. In any case, he has to be mentally ready for a change.</p>

For Timo, because he fits there, because the way <b>[Chelsea]</b> play football suits him. I think that in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> he has decided on a club where he has a better chance of playing, which is very important to him. The team will be renewed, it will certainly be strengthened and a lot of money will be spent in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> to knock again at the top. A good young team is being built there, which is very promising<br /><br /><b>[Ballack expects big things of the striker, he admitted that the added physicality of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> would require no little adaptation]</b> That is the biggest difference in England that there is less whistling (from referees), especially for strikers. It is much more intense, with a lot more duels. He has to get used to it quickly because that’s the point. He is a robust player, is very fast, but he is also physically good in a duel and he will quickly get used to it</p>
