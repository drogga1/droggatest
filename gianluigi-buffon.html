Even Buffon works to be a better player and if you’re a 19-year-old goalkeeper, you can improve by playing regularly and learning from your mistakes.

  <p><b>[Gianluigi Buffon feels that Juventus were overconfident prior to last season’s Champions League final against Real Madrid]</b> We went to Cardiff with a lot of confidence - maybe too much - and that might be the first and most serious mistake we made in that final. But we shouldn’t blame ourselves: they deserved to win as they proved to be the stronger team on the field. The best team won, but we weren’t that bad to be beaten so heavily. There are moments in these matches when luck smiles on you and on that day it did not help us. I hope that we can find the weapons to make the match more balanced this time. We have to set up with our best qualities on the field, which is what our coach will try to do.<br /><br />I always thought it would be better to play them twice than in a single game. I realised that in 180 minutes we beat Barcelona and in 90 we lost to Madrid. I don’t know if we’re unbeatable, but we’re a difficult team for anyone to face and I hope we can prove it. But we’re not favourites, remember that. They say we have a 50% chance of going through but I don’t agree. We have a chance, yes, because we’re an ambitious side and our team is made up of players with a lot of history. But we’re facing the best. Real Madrid are a better team than Juventus. I’m not just saying that, it’s what history says, based on accolades and statistics. In such a situation, I think winning the Champions League remains a dream, one which will be very difficult to achieve. We can compete against Real Madrid, but they have shown over their history and over the past few years that they have something special and something different</p>

  <p><b>[Gianluigi Buffon has launched an astonishing broadside on referee Michael Oliver after his Juventus side exited the Champions League at the hands of Real Madrid]</b> A quality referee does not destroy the dream of a team that has put everything on the field for 90 minutes. He wanted to play the part of the protagonist. A human being cannot whistle for an incident so doubtful after a game like that, unless you have a garbage bin instead of a heart. If you do not have personality, you should be in the stands eating chips with your family. This referee did not have the courage or the personality for this level. I could’ve told the referee anything at that moment, but he had to understand the degree of the disaster he was creating. If you can’t handle the pressure and have the courage to make a decision, then you should just sit in the stands and eat your crisps. If you don’t have the personality needed for certain levels, it’s better to watch the game in the stand with your wife, maybe eating chips. It’s a question of the kind of sensitivity that every man must have, knowing whether to officiate or not. It means not knowing where you are, what teams are playing. In practice, it means you don’t know shit.<br /><br />For me it has always been an honour to face Real Madrid, who will win the Champions League. They are truly great, a great team, a great club, and a great crowd. But tonight, we deserved at least extra time. We started with little chance of doing so, which was understandable after the first leg. But I play with guys that are capable of any feat. I’m proud to be part of a team like that. It disappointed me to leave the boys with 10 men, but I said objectively Real Madrid deserved the victory, we shake their hands and move on. We will be furious when stepping on to the pitch in Serie A this weekend. Furious</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon has no regrets over his referee rants]</b> I don’t have to make up for anything, because I am a human being who puts passion, sentiment and anger into what I do. You find a way to speak, right or wrong, that at times can seem excessive … but this is me, I am Gigi Buffon. The other night the game had finished an hour and a half ago, so consequently what one expresses at that moment are sentiments and thoughts that are strong, in certain respects raw, but the sentiments of a man who won’t hide behind a veil of hypocrisy and instead throws out what is bubbling in his guts. End of story. Right there, you cannot ask a man who lives sport as deeply as I do to be balanced, because even if I expressed these feelings in an exaggerated way, they were still logical thoughts. I’d say them all again. Maybe with a different type of language, one that was more civilised, let’s say. But the content remains and I stand by all of it.<br /><br />Even if I was excessive, I said what I thought, that he should not have given that penalty. A referee with more experience would not have blown his whistle and decided not to become the protagonist of the match. He would’ve left it running, turned around and let the two teams fight it out in extra time. Let the pitch do the talking. I’m sure Oliver will have a great career in future, but he’s too young to officiate a match like that. The beauty, the imponderable nature of football, means that unfortunately this young man found himself in a situation that was too complex, too garbled and too big for him to deal with. So at the end of the day, what I said after the match, I don’t hold any rancour towards Oliver. I’m not even angry with him. It all ended there, but naturally in the heat of the moment one does feel I’m not saying penalised … I felt defrauded. Not defrauded of the result, but of the night. It was a night that can never be repeated.<br /><br />We could’ve written a memorable page in the history books of football for Juve, for Italy. Our victory combined with that of Roma would’ve been just incredible. Before being a Juventino, I am an Italian, and I really cared about Italian football doing well. Seeing Roma achieve that amazing comeback, I was so passionately cheering them on. Seeing Juve go to Madrid and come back from 3-0 down … I got emotional. It was just priceless. I have lost more important matches than this, but the way it developed and was evolving, it was the most wonderful and exciting match I had ever experienced with Juventus. I think the same is true of my teammates and the fans.<br /><br />It wasn’t a situation where you could say: ‘That is definitely a penalty.’ I’m not saying it wasn’t a penalty, I am saying it was a dubious situation. In a game like that, 20 seconds from the end, a dubious situation is not going to be enough for an experienced referee to transform everything. In my view, an experienced referee would make a different evaluation. Give me at least the legitimacy to defend in an exasperated and passionate manner the performance of my teammates, to defend those 5,000 fans who came to Madrid to cheer us on. I have to defend my teammates and fans, even in a not very composed fashion, because I feel it. I had to let that out, even if it damaged my reputation</p>

  <p><b>[Gianluigi Buffon has admitted to snubbing a very big offer from Manchester City]</b> When I was a boy playing for Parma, Ferguson tracked me closely for two or three years, and he’d always send scouts to watch me. At the time, Parma was my world and I didn’t feel like leaving. I later had a very big offer from Manchester City, when they started to build the team and become the most important side in Europe. They wanted me to be the first signing, but I stayed at Juve.</p>

  <p><b>[Buffon has no regrets over ‘beautiful’ decision to leave Juventus for PSG]</b> For me, it’s been a beautiful experience. xxI have spent nine months in a stupendous city, a city that welcomed me with affection and warmth. It has been a great pleasure and I am very happy to have made this choice to come here.<br /><br />I wanted another footballing experience and life experience, that could be enriching for me, and I have to say, today, all the reasons for coming here, for making this choice, have been fulfilled, because I have always been curious to confront myself with different worlds. I have always been humble enough to try and learn from different experiences and this has been the case here in Paris. I have learnt quite good French which is something I know will help me in the future and make me a better person, more confident in myself. And this has been very important for me<br /><br /><b>[He said of his battle with Alphonse Areola for regular minutes]</b> Yes, we can say this is the first time I’ve experienced this because at Juventus over the last two or three years, normally if I wasn’t injured, the other ‘keeper would only play 10 or 15 matches, and I think that was important because everyone needs to feel that they are an important part of the team. This year has definitely been something different, something I wasn’t used to, but something I happily accepted. I happily accepted it because I’m a person that loves being a part of the group with the other guys, always trying to convey positivity and conveying positivity means accepting the coach’s choices that can benefit the other players and I think this is a great thing. And I have to say that with Alphonse, Sebastien <b>[Cibois]</b> and Thomas <b>[Chesneau]</b>, we have created a really great working unit, with friendship and admiration, and I think that is our greatest victory as goalkeepers</p>

With regards to the future, I let life show me the way: at this moment I would do myself an injury if I thought I would stop playing, because I feel I am a point of reference, beyond the games that are played</p>

He has the awareness that he can be decisive either starting or starting from the bench. For us being able to count on Paulo in this condition is very important. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is a champion of football history, he’s undeniable. He’s a player with a determination, a ferocity, a mentality that I have found, to date, in no one</p>
