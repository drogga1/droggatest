  <p><b>[Even Monaco ace Kylian Mbappe cannot break down the brick wall that is Juventus]</b> We studied Mbappe, as he is a devastating player. I’ve met some over the years, but at his age with that technique, physical strength pace, and above all his movements, I’ve not seen someone like him. I think Mbappé is going to become extraordinary.</p>

  <p><b>[Barzagli hails Juventus after Spurs comeback]</b> We are capable of anything, including 50 terrible minutes and then turning the result around. At a certain point, we started playing well and scored two goals. We had to suffer too and were lucky with that upright, but we need luck in this competition! At half-time we had to adjust a few things, but above all just had to believe. We started the second half in a bit of a shaky way, but we were facing a really impressive team. Juventus proved we were tough and Juve are nothing if not tough.</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus defender Andrea Barzagli has announced that he will be heading into retirement]</b> Future? I’ve thought about it a lot. When you’re a footballer you have trouble thinking about the aftermath but because of injuries you have to think about it. I am attracted to everything and will evaluate my options in the coming months. Manager, coach or columnist? I have to understand what I could be good at and what could interest me. I have to find something that gives me great enthusiasm.<br /><br /><b>[On Juve’s failure to cross a title line against SPAL]</b> We wanted to win today, it was a shame because we played a good game, even if we suffered during the second half. We would have liked to close the conversation this afternoon, but too bad</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> defender Andrea Barzagli has announced his decision to retire]</b> Playing football was my dream as a kid. I have been thinking a lot about my future and it is time to call an end to my career. I will start out on a journey to understand what to do after a career in football. There is a lot to think about over the next few months and a little sensation of confusion. I have to discover what I am capable of and what works for me. Playing football was my dream as a kid and I have always enjoyed it. Now I have to find something else that gives me as much enthusiasm</p>

  <p><b>[Former defender Andrea Barzagli insisted a decision has not been made yet amid growing links to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> boss <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a>]</b> People seem to take <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> for granted, but a decision hasn’t been made yet and there are still a lot of names being mentioned. The <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a> directors have barely put a foot wrong over the last few years and in my view, they’ve chosen the right man: if it’s someone with a new idea or much the same, that I don’t know. I don’t know what the situation is at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, but I hear talk of <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> and it’s nice to dream. After all, nobody believed it last year when <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> arrived, but dreams can come true. We’ll see when the club makes its announcement. <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> worked under stress for five years and was criticised too much, but he did well and continued the winning streak started by <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a>.</p>

I felt the need to live more with my family who, silently over all these years, have supported and accompanied my professional choices. I decided to focus on them today, despite another family, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, to who I will always be linked and eternally grateful - but it was right to choose.<br /><br />My thoughts go to those who have always shown me the utmost esteem and total professional and human closeness. The president, the coach, Fabio <b>[<a href="fabio-paratici.html">Paratici</a>, Juventus’ sporting director]</b> and <a href="pavel-nedved.html">Pavel Nedved</a> <b>[club vide president]</b>. Figures that have contributed to my growth and that have walked with me with discretion and friendship<br /><br />Thanks would be many. The fans, the professionals who work every day to make <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> what it is! I summarise everything in a big and gigantic ‘Come on <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>!’</p>
