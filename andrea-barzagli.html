It’s a PlayStation goal. It will go down in history</p>

  <p><b>[Andrea Barzagli talks about his long-time team-mate Gianluigi Buffon]</b> We’ll miss him, he’s a leader and the greatest goalkeeper of all time. He is a man who in the locker room lets everyone take a step up in quality. He never says anything without thinking it over and everyone listens</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus defender Andrea Barzagli has announced his decision to retire]</b> Playing football was my dream as a kid. I have been thinking a lot about my future and it is time to call an end to my career. I will start out on a journey to understand what to do after a career in football. There is a lot to think about over the next few months and a little sensation of confusion. I have to discover what I am capable of and what works for me. Playing football was my dream as a kid and I have always enjoyed it. Now I have to find something else that gives me as much enthusiasm</p>

  <p><b>[Former defender Andrea Barzagli insisted a decision has not been made yet amid growing links to Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri]</b> People seem to take Sarri for granted, but a decision hasn’t been made yet and there are still a lot of names being mentioned. The Bianconeri directors have barely put a foot wrong over the last few years and in my view, they’ve chosen the right man: if it’s someone with a new idea or much the same, that I don’t know. I don’t know what the situation is at Juve, but I hear talk of Guardiola and it’s nice to dream. After all, nobody believed it last year when Cristiano Ronaldo arrived, but dreams can come true. We’ll see when the club makes its announcement. Allegri worked under stress for five years and was criticised too much, but he did well and continued the winning streak started by Antonio Conte.</p>

  <p><b>[Barzagli leaves <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> coaching role for personal reasons]</b> I have decided to make a life choice. It was a heart choice! I felt the need to live more with my family who, silently over all these years, have supported and accompanied my professional choices. I decided to focus on them today, despite another family, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, to who I will always be linked and eternally grateful - but it was right to choose.<br /><br />My thoughts go to those who have always shown me the utmost esteem and total professional and human closeness. The president, the coach, Fabio <b>[<a href="fabio-paratici.html">Paratici</a>, Juventus’ sporting director]</b> and Pavel Nedved <b>[club vide president]</b>. Figures that have contributed to my growth and that have walked with me with discretion and friendship<br /><br />Thanks would be many. The fans, the professionals who work every day to make <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> what it is! I summarise everything in a big and gigantic ‘Come on <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>!’</p>
