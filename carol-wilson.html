<blockquote>
  <p>[Now, as England prepare for the semi-final of the 2019 Women’s World Cup against the USA, the women who blazed a trail nearly five decades ago are together again – and roaring on a new generation of Lionesses] They’ve done so well – they’re getting stronger and stronger and stronger, and we’re behind them 100 per cent<br /><br />[The 1971 Women’s World Cup was not an official FIFA tournament. Nor were the England team sanctioned by the FA, who did not lift its 50-year ban on women playing football at all until later that same year] We weren’t a professional team, we had no support whatsoever.<br /><br />[the organisers of the six-team tournament referred to them as ‘Ingleterra’, which caused some disgruntlement back at home with the FA and the Women’s FA, who controlled women’s football – they did not want anyone laying claim to the England name without proper authority] Harry Batt worked tirelessly. He had to beg to get us sponsorship so we could go. We didn’t know any of this – he kept it from us because he wanted us to just concentrate on the football<br /><br />[And, although they failed to register a win in Mexico, they still see the tournament as a success] We were kids. That stadium held 107,000, and I didn’t see many spare seats. It was two, three times the size of crowds they’re getting at the moment, and it was daunting. We had six men and their dogs in England, and we were getting hurled abuse half the time! To go in front of all these people, and they thought you were gods – we weren’t used to any of that.<br /><br />[The heat and altitude was also a surprise, as were some of the other playing conditions] We had a short while where we could walk out on to the pitch and just acclimatise ourselves. The first thing I thought was, ‘Oh my God, we’ve got a flat pitch’ – we used to play on sloping pitches in the UK!<br /><br />[And they are all excited to be reunited. 48 years on, 11 groundbreaking Lionesses are heading to Lyon to cheer on Neville’s side courtesy of UEFA’s #weplaystrong campaign] This experience has been phenomenal for us. We’re so grateful. The whole team are reeling. We’re in the same sort of bubble we were at that time – it’s taken us back a wee bit!</p>
