  <p><b>[Aston Villa vs Birmingham City]</b> I wouldn’t say we have kept close contact or we ring each other every day but of course I have had communication with Dean Smith. Then when we see each other after games we have good chats and talk about things from before when we were team-mates and other things that are going on now we are managers. But now we are enemies for 90 minutes and I am sure we will have a good chat afterwards.</p>

  <p><b>[Connor Wickham and Massimo Luongo scored from corners as <a href="sheffield-wednesday.html">Sheffield Wednesday</a> dented Bristol City’s play-off hopes with a 2-1 win at Ashton Gate]</b> The players deserve huge credit because they have come back from the enforced break with a fresh attitude and mentality. It started in the draw with <a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a> and today we looked solid defensively and threatening going forward. We can only focus on things we can control and I sense the start of the culture change I was talking about as being needed before the season was interrupted<br /><br />We needed a fresh attitude and mentality because we were letting ourselves and our fans down. The players have had time to reflect and work on their fitness. It is only a couple of steps forward, but I have been really pleased with the last couple of games. No one is getting carried away because there is a lot of work still to do. But the signs are good that the players are taking on board what we want from them</p>

  <p><b>[Matheus Pereira’s double helped West Brom kick-start their automatic promotion push in the Championship with a 3-0 win at <a href="sheffield-wednesday.html">Sheffield Wednesday</a>]</b> I think the first half was a missed opportunity for us. They looked a bit nervous, but we didn’t quite take advantage of it. It is a very unfortunate scoreline. We gave it everything, but their freshness showed in the second half.It was definitely not a scoreline that we deserved</p>

  <p><b>[Preston rekindled their Championship play-off hopes with three late goals at Hillsborough to sink <a href="sheffield-wednesday.html">Sheffield Wednesday</a> 3-1]</b> I didn’t see a big interference for it (the disallowed goal). It was a bitter blow. It would have put us in a good moment to win. But it’s about being able to focus in the big moments. It is game management. We lack concentration in those moments. There is a lot of work to do here, but I’m determined to get it right</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="sheffield-wednesday.html">Sheffield Wednesday</a> took advantage of QPR’s post-lockdown blues by cruising to a 3-0 victory at Loftus Road]</b> Obviously we have to be very pleased with the performance and the result. We had lost three games in a row and we needed to respond. It was a very pleasing day. We got a complete performance. When we can keep our concentration and our focus we know what quality we have. The players focused on the game plan and got their reward. It was a team who played with good passion and heart, and that’s the recipe we need. It shows they’ve got it in them, and they just need to do it more
consistently</p>

Obviously we wanted the three points, it was a difficult game and they came with a really solid shape and made sure they were hard to break down<br /><br />It was a tight game, a tough game and physically the teams we’re playing against in this period, they’re all having an extra day’s recovery than us. That’s tough going, we don’t have the luxury of making a lot of changes in the squad, but the concentration was there</p>
