  <p><b>[Sven Hubscher says <a href="kevin-prince-boateng.html">Kevin-Prince Boateng</a>’s self-confidence set him apart from his team-mates at Schalke]</b> He was enormously confident, but also open, polite and reserved. He expresses his opinion when he thinks it is necessary, but always keeps his decency. Back then, we used it as the cornerstone on which our many young players could find direction in for themselves. We talked about him for the first time at a training camp in Doha. When it turned out that there was an opportunity to sign him, <b>[Schalke coach]</b> Jens Keller called him. Boateng just said: ‘Coach, put the No.9 shirt aside, we’ll rock this thing’. He was exactly the experienced player we needed. I still remember his first game against Leverkusen in front of a home crowd. He was playing at No.6 at the time. In one situation, Max Meyer did not pass to him, but played a pass out wide. Since the situation was near the dugout, it was very easy to hear him (Boateng) shouting: ‘Max, play me over. Max! Max!’ Meyer just replied that Boateng had been covered. He replied: ‘I don’t give a sh<em>t, play me over’. We missed having such a player like that before<br /><br /><b>[Hubscher went on to insist that Boateng’s fitness issues led to his eventual departure]</b> It wasn’t for a personality reason, we simply could not get his susceptibility to injury under control. He was no longer as efficient as we were, and he too would have wished for it to be the case, because even under <a href="roberto-di-matteo.html">Roberto Di Matteo</a>, whom he always addressed as Mister, he was an important personality<br /><br /><b>[When asked what made Boateng stand out at Schalke]</b> His self-confidence. He didn’t care whether we played against Leverkusen or <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>. He didn’t give a sh</em>t. He simply had this self-image that everyone has to be guided by. This helped our entire team at this point. And, of course, he could also play very well</p>

  <p><b>[When asked what <a href="joel-matip.html">Matip</a> tells him about <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s managerial style]</b> <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is very emotional and that translates to the players. Everyone is ready to go full throttle. Competition also plays an important role, which makes the coach’s work easier. Nevertheless, he says that everyone is ready at any time to march like soldiers for <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>. He has never had a harder preparation in his life than in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. How fit the team is can be seen on the pitch. They play with a chain of four in defence, in front of that, three madmen run from right to left and, in front of that, they have three grenades that do the damage. That’s how they won the Champions League last season<br /><br />From my own players <a href="joel-matip.html">Joel Matip</a> <b>[has impressed me most]</b>, who didn’t have an easy time at Schalke. His accomplishments have not always been valued, although there are few players who play braver with and without the ball. Since the Champions League victory last season, it should be clear to everyone what quality he has</p>
