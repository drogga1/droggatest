  <p><b>[Lotta Schelin did not score in the opening 3-3 draw against Nigeria either, and Sweden find themselves third in their group with two points]</b> I see goals and victory. There is nothing else. The way we performed against the USA will give us confidence<br /><br /><b>[As for the USA game]</b> You don’t get too many chances against the best team in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Lotta Schelin speaks about the team’s initiative with adidas to print empowering tweets from women on the back of their jerseys instead of their own names]</b> The national team shirt is an important symbol and it constantly reminds us that we can win whatever game it is in whatever competitions. I think it is great that we can join forces with other strong women and that we together can show that everything is possible. There is always a need to show young women that it is possible to succeed and that no one should feel limited in what they can achieve and particularly not because of their sex</p>

  <p><b>[Germany face Sweden as title defense campaign begins]</b> We have a bit of a feeling of revenge when we look at the previous tournaments. We’ve been analyzing their team and what they’re doing and we think we can beat them</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Lyon and Sweden legend Lotta Schelin on Wendie Renard]</b> I came to <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> in 2008 and Wendie was 18 and even then you could see was going to be a good player. She was so tall, so powerful and she had so much potential, but her heading wasn’t that strong at the beginning. But I saw her working on it, she was so persistent and she said to herself, ‘I can be the best in the world, so I need to work on this.’ A year or two later she wasn’t just a good defender, but she was scoring goals as well. I only won headers once in a while in training against her. If it was a clean duel, it was impossible. I had to use my speed and try to surprise her if I ever played against her at international level, but she reads the game so well, so it was always a challenge.</p>
