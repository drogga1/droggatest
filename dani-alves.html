  <p><b>[Brazil full-back Dani Alves came to the defence of team-mate Neymar in the wake of growing criticism and reports of a potential Paris Saint-Germain exit]</b> If a team has Messi, it must play for Lionel Messi, as it is with Cristiano Ronaldo. And Neymar is no different, he’s on another level and, the more the team dedicates itself to him, he’ll continue to give an answer on the pitch. I don’t think these kind of players do things that are not for the sake of the team. I realised this when I played with Messi: if he’s on my side, why should I do other than trying to get the ball to him? I know how decisive he can be, he must have the ball. And Neymar is that kind of player. But sometimes I feel there’s this sensibility over Neymar that everything he does should be put under scrutiny. I disagree with a lot of the criticism about him because some of it targets his off-pitch doings and not his football, where he’s always provided results. As a friend, my job is ensuring Neymar understands that he must find ways to realise his gift for football</p>

I am a free agent, but I don’t want to know anything’. Why? Because I needed to perform well here. If I did well here, it would open many doors. People would see my quality, my dedication and my achievements. After that, my mindset was: I want to know what my possibilities are right now. And there were a few. But, for example, none of them were something I wanted, except the team of my dreams<br /><br />What I wanted, the key point for me, was having the stability to fight for the 2022 World Cup.

  <p><b>[Dani Alves says <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> is a genius that football gave us as a gift]</b> I think Pep is a genius. A genius that football gave us as a gift, as a coach, as a person. How he got the best out of every player - those that played a lot, those that didn’t play as much - creating a synergy with a lot of respect between those inside the team. That puts him in a very special position in my life and a very particular position. I think he’s a nonconformist genius, a methodical genius, a perfectionist genius and I think that makes him unique. Wherever he goes, he can win more or he can win less, but I think a player that works with him will never be the same.

  <p><b>[Dani Alves says <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> star <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> must change his ways if he is to be treated with the respect he deserves]</b> At times, in order not to generate a certain type of feeling, he retracts. <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is a very sensitive person. <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is very affected by many things, and at times many of those are unjust. <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> has the sensibility of a child. But Ney is not a child, no. He is a man. People have to start learning to respect <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>. The Ney of the Brazilian team people don’t respect. He’s known as the outsider and people don’t respect that<br /><br />Ney has already won in football so he can talk and say what he wants. There are a lot of people who keep talking, commentating and haven’t won anything. That is why I want him to put himself out there. When they say something that is not right about, you whether it’s Casagrande or someone else, you have to stand up for yourself. Today he is the most important Brazilian football player and <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is among the top in world football. He needs to take a stance because he is in a place where he has to position himself and people have to understand who Ney is, how he thinks, and they have to start to learn and respect Neymar<br /><br /><b>[It is not just for himself that <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> should tidy up his action]</b> Ney has had a responsibility ever since he became a role model to kids, to other athletes. When you start having that responsibility, you cannot disappoint them. It’s then when you have to take a stance</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> defender Dani Alves has compared the club’s performance in the 2015 Champions League final to Muhammad Ali after recalling their hard-fought victory against Juventus]</b> We were up against very physical opponents and we knew we had to win by having the ball. It does not matter how strong your opponents is if you have them chasing after the ball so that they get tired. The moment they let their guard down is the moment to attack. We were like Muhammad Ali: we floated like a butterfly and stung like a bee. I think we were deserving winners of the final and we celebrated a lot as we had repeated the treble. I remember pretty much everything about the final. It’s very recent and not a lot of time has passed since then. I remember it was a very special moment but also a tough one on a personal and collective level. People thought we couldn’t win another treble and were supporting our opponents to stop us doing it. We were aware that people thought we could not do it. When you are prepared to face that, it’s unlikely negative things happen. That is <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>’s secret in finals: they are always prepared.</p>
