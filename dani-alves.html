I will repeat it to make myself clear: I respect Cristiano Ronaldo. Everyone tells me what a fantastic professional he is. As for CR7, it’s different, he was my rival and I had to compete with him. When I said he always wanted the limelight, that when you win you are going to be the star but when you lose they will go for you, I said it in a very respectful way. And I think the same of <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi or Neymar. But my thoughts were not negative. What happens is that the press sold them differently, saying that I had spoken ill of him. And Ronaldo believed it. That’s why he did not greet me at the Ballon d’Or gala in 2015. I do not need to talk about anyone to go out in the newspapers. I have no ego.</p>

  <p><b>[Dani Alves says Barcelona have failed to fill his void since Juventus move]</b> Barcelona now? It’s strange! I’m sure they miss me! I think they appreciated me as a professional, a football player, and as someone who was good to have around the place, who made every game unique, with a new dance or new music or whatever. I brought a bit of joy to the dressing room. I’ve spoken to them and they’ve told me that that’s what they miss about me the most: how happy I am and the way I am. They say I’m unique<br /><br /><b>[Alves added on a new chapter in his distinguished career]</b> Italy? It’s different but it’s a challenge at the same time. It was strange to begin with, but I’ve always enjoyed a challenge, which is why I decided to make the move. I have to say that I didn’t feel as comfortable any more at Barça. Things changed at a club level, and as time went on, I always seemed to be the one in the firing line. ‘Dani’s the one who has to go,’ they’d say. I just got tired of it. I decided to head off in a new direction and find happiness somewhere else. Strange to pull on the black and white jersey? Yes, it was! I played for the same team and with the same team-mates for many years. It’s weird, but that’s football. I’m a very restless person and new experiences excite me more than anything else. And that’s what I’m having right now with Juve</p>

It was wonderful here but to come back to Barcelona I would have to set a lot of things straight and the egos of certain people, which are giant, would not allow it. Some people loved me in Barcelona and some didn’t. The Catalans are special people, my lifestyle doesn’t really fit in with what they like or what they think it ought to be.

I don’t like to keep bad energy trapped inside me, as that would make life bad. I am sorry if someone felt offended, but I simply wanted to get out this bitter-sweet sensation at my departure from Barcelona. I did feel that I was slightly pushed out. I used the media in Madrid to express that because I knew they would not manipulate what I said, whereas the media in Barcelona may well have manipulated it.</p>

They only offered to renew my contract when the FIFA ban came into effect. So that’s when I decided I would play and I signed a renovation with a free clause. The people who run Barcelona have no idea how to treat the footballers<br /><br />Things changed at club level. And as time went on, I always seemed to be the one in the firing line. ‘Dani’s the one who has to go,’ they would say. I just got tired of it<br /><br />I don’t know how to live any differently.

I’m like Conor McGregor. Before going to battle, I won’t say that he’s a phenomenon. It’s part of the game. How to stop a player of his level, while respecting the rules?

  <p><b>[Dani Alves has emerged as a top target for Manchester City, but he has admitted in the past to being unaware of their existence until 2009]</b> I didn’t realise until about five years ago that Manchester had two teams. Of course Manchester United have been one of the most famous and successful clubs in Europe for many years - but I thought they were the only one. When Manchester City got new owners and started buying some of the best players in Europe everybody knew who they were - but until then I must be honest I didn’t know about them. I think this is the reality of modern football. You don’t need 10 or 20 years to establish yourself - if you have rich owners you can do it in two or three years. It doesn’t matter if I or anybody else agree with it - it is just the reality of today.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool had a deal in place for Dani Alves prior to him joining Barcelona in 2002]</b> We had the deal - finally after enormous complications - tied up for Dani Alves and then the decision was should we buy two players or should we spend all of that on a full-back? Alves wasn’t the player then that he is now, but he always looked like he would be a great player. Would he have been a better signing than <b>[Jermaine]</b> Pennant and <b>[Peter]</b> Crouch for example? Probably yes, but it’s easy with hindsight.<br /><br />Clearly, we were trying to make that final step. We didn’t have Chelsea’s money so we were trying to be smarter. Looking back, if I could do anything different, it would be to focus on buying one at a time rather than having to buy five or six every season.<br /><br />There were a lot of great things that happened with recruitment. Gerard signed Sami Hyypia and Stephane Henchoz. My very first signing was Gary McAllister. When Gerard came to me and said he wanted him I paused for a minute and thought: ‘Really?’.<br /><br />Gerard’s rational was that he was the best striker of the ball in the Premier League and with the youngsters coming through would be great in the dressing room. What a contribution he made in that 2001 season. During Rafa’s era we brought in the likes of Xabi Alonso, Pepe Reina, Javier Mascherano, Luis Garcia and Fernando Torres so there were a few half decent ones</p>

The thing is, he had to come out of his shadow a little. Playing with someone as unique as Leo is the most incredible thing that can happen to you, but there’s always that doubt in your mind if it’s you that really has the quality or if it’s him. I always loved playing with him, but he’s Argentinian and Ney and I are Brazilians. Sooner or later we had to come up against each other. I think you’ve got a better chance of achieving things individually when you’re not so close to a player like him. It was important for Ney’s own development and for Brazil for him to follow his own path.<br /><br />I hardly had anything to do with it, though I was involved when he signed for Barcelona. I gave him some advice and told him about all the good things I’d experienced at the club and in the city. But it wasn’t like that this time. It was just a case of me getting here before him, though there was a moment when he was unsure about what to do. I just told him to follow his heart and be happy.

  <p><b>[Why Cristiano Ronaldo, Sergio Ramos &amp; Real Madrid don’t like Dani Alves]</b> The Ballon d’Or thing is a little tiresome because it has been moved to a different playing field.

Moving away from that, perhaps he has less chance. The winner will be the one who has had the best campaign, or the best publicity campaign. We are talking about the Ballon d’Or as if we were talking about politics. The one with the best campaign wins, not the one who plays the best football.<br /><br /><b>[And in 2015, after Barca had won the treble and Luis Suarez was left off the final shortlist for the award]</b> Cristiano Ronaldo doesn’t deserve to be among the Ballon d’Or finalists. It’s not only about scoring goals<br /><br /><b>[Alves played down his feud with the Madrid forward]</b> If people only knew how much I respect Cristiano Ronaldo. I will repeat it to make myself clear: I respect Cristiano Ronaldo<br /><br /><b>[Asked about the Madrid skipper being booed by fans at former club Sevilla]</b> The problem is that, days before moving to Madrid, Ramos swore eternal love to Sevilla. He didn’t make history there, certainly not enough to not celebrate goals or to ask for respect. I was there for six years and I won many titles there</p>

In the changing room, the PSG doctors told me that we would have to wait until the next day to get the results of some tests, but I knew in my heart that it was over. Everyone came in celebrating with the Coupe de France trophy, and I never want to show any negative emotion around my teammates - if you know Dani Alves then you know I’m always one happy motherfucker - so I was smiling and trying to have fun.

But when you have an extra, like Ney, you become a little stronger. But you do not weaken without it, you only increase your qualities, you increase your power, but you do not diminish without him. Our responsibility remains the same - we represent a history and we have to defend this history with great honour.<br /><br /><b>[Alves said he was eyeing the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, but knows he must continue performing]</b> It <b>[2022 World Cup]</b> is a goal I have, but I do not allow myself to look too far forward, because when you look far ahead you forget to look at now. I cannot forget to look at the now because the opportunities I have to be here can not to be distracted with the future and not with the past. What matters is the present. I reinvent myself. When you reach a certain age, you begin to raise doubts, a lot of talk about the selection is renewed or the clubs have to renew, have more players, young people, but both in the clubs and in the national team, it values itself by results</p>

But, for example, none of them were something I wanted, except the team of my dreams<br /><br />What I wanted, the key point for me, was having the stability to fight for the 2022 World Cup.

A genius that football gave us as a gift, as a coach, as a person. How he got the best out of every player - those that played a lot, those that didn’t play as much - creating a synergy with a lot of respect between those inside the team. That puts him in a very special position in my life and a very particular position. I think he’s a nonconformist genius, a methodical genius, a perfectionist genius and I think that makes him unique. Wherever he goes, he can win more or he can win less, but I think a player that works with him will never be the same. Every day is a learning <b>[curve]</b>, it’s a class like you were going to college.

I remember pretty much everything about the final. It’s very recent and not a lot of time has passed since then. I remember it was a very special moment but also a tough one on a personal and collective level. People thought we couldn’t win another treble and were supporting our opponents to stop us doing it.
