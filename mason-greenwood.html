  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> starlet Mason Greenwood has signed a new four-year contract at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>, with the extension of a further year]</b> Having grown up as a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> fan, playing for the first team is a real dream come true. I know that, when I play for this club, I represent the whole Academy and I want to repay the faith that my coaches have shown in me with my performances on the pitch. I am learning all the time from the manager and his coaching staff and I know that this is the perfect club to help me reach my potential</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> striker Mason Greenwood is desperate for the chance to prove his worth in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> after signing a four-year deal at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>]</b> I’ll try my best and give it all for the team. <b>[My aims are]</b> to show everyone what I can do really and why I signed a contract - why I’m here. I just want to show everyone<br /><br /><b>[Greenwood also explained why he takes penalties with his right foot, even though he prefers his left]</b> Actually, it happened when I was in the Under-13. I missed with my left foot against <b>[Manchester]</b> City when I was struggling in a game and, ever since, I’ve just gone with the right foot. Ever since then, really<br /><br /><b>[The youngster actually made his debut in the Red Devils’ famous 3-1 win against <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> in March and Greenwood admitted it was an incredibly proud moment]</b> It was amazing. Winning the game, from being down in the result, but it was me representing the whole Academy. Coming onto the pitch, I was representing the whole Academy, from all the youth levels, so it was a great feeling</p>

  <p><b>[Mason Greenwood out to emulate record-breaking <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> &amp; follow in <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>’s footsteps]</b> <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> and the Brazilian <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> have always stood out for me. I’ve always looked up to them. <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> is such a great goalscorer, that is what I want to be. He’s done most things on a football pitch and you have to have a role model. I’ve never seen him! I’ve seen his games obviously and watched the highlights on YouTube. Hopefully I’ll get to meet him one day. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> was quite a while ago - but my dad used to show me clips of him. He used to play for all those great teams<br /><br />I’ve got so many role models around me and Marcus is another one. I just want to follow in his footsteps. He’s a goalscorer, he shoots off both feet, he’s quick. <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> was a great goalscorer at United, too. And he’s a great manager in my eyes</p>

  <p><b>[Mason Greenwood says <a href="juan-mata.html">Juan Mata</a>, <a href="daniel-james.html">Daniel James</a> and <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a> have helped him to adjust to life in <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s senior squad]</b> Obviously, it’s tough playing at the top level but it’s good to have all the other lads helping you out on the pitch. It’s like you never feel alone. If you make a mistake, it’s okay because everyone makes mistakes. I would say all the other lads help you; before the game, they are geeing you up and everything. I sit next to Juan, Dan James and <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a> in the dressing room so they are the main ones, who help me out a lot. But all the lads are really nice and helpful<br /><br />It makes you feel good knowing you’ve actually played against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham Hotspur</a> in a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> game, and started. It helps your belief. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> was probably my hardest game so far. I found myself in pockets though and was getting on the ball in space and turning and running and passing. It was a bit of both and it was hard sometimes but, at other times, it was okay, I would say. We were working hard for each other and got the win. We deserved it as well</p>

  <p><b>[Greenwood: I feel like I’m following in <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>’s footsteps]</b> Yeah, definitely. He’s been in the academy and come through the ranks and I feel like I’m following in his footsteps. He’s a few years older than me but I can definitely take a lot of inspiration from what he has achieved so far. I’ve known him for a long time so I’ve seen how well he has done and how he has progressed as a player, so there’s lots to learn from being around him<br /><br />It was a different level really. The crowds there were all a lot bigger than what I was used to playing in front of, and there were a lot of fans from all around the world, so it was a good experience. To go away with strikers such as <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a>, <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a>, <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a> and <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> was the best way to learn, just seeing how they worked as top strikers and top finishers was great for me. They all looked after me and helped me on and off the pitch<br /><br />It’s been good to play in some massive league and cup games with the first team, but I’m still doing the same things that I was doing in the Under 23s and youth teams. I think I have to trust the things that have got me to where I am and continue to try to do them in the first team</p>

  <p><b>[Greenwood: I want to make my mark at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> &amp; win trophies]</b> It’s mind-blowing really. Being in the <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> first-team dressing room and stepping out at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>. I can’t explain it really. It’s just amazing. You see me smile when I score. It’s out of this world. I want to make my mark at the club and score as many goals as I possibly can. I want to win trophies at United, every young boy coming up from the Academy does, so it would be amazing to get one of them soon.<br /><br />Everything has been quick and I’ve had to take everything on board really and to listen to what the manager and the other players have to say. It’s been a hard journey and I’m nowhere near where I want to be yet. I’ll carry on working hard and keep going. But if someone said to me at the start of the season, ‘you’ll score 10 goals for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in your first season’, I would have taken it straight away. I’ve done that now and I want more<br /><br />Ole is a major part. He has done it himself and knows what is he is talking about. Everyone listens to him. He helps me a lot. Obviously, Kieran <b>[<a href="kieran-mckenna.html">McKenna</a>]</b> as well. I was with him in my first season in the youth team and now he’s with the first team</p>
