  <p>[Central Coast full-back Storm Roux made it clear on Wednesday that the Mariners are desperate to get off the bottom of the league] It’s our main focus now. The gap is not as big as last season - that was a shambles of a season, if we’re honest about it - we know it was. This season we’re showing signs of improvement and Paulo [coach Paul Okon] has come in here and done a good job. We’re going to be giving it all we’ve got in the last three games to get the points. We’re desperate not to get that wooden spoon and the way we’ve been playing this season, we don’t deserve it.<br /><br />[Asked about how to stop Roar’s lead striker Jamie Maclaren] The hard thing about him is that he’s always in the right place at the right time. It just means the back four have to be focused and know where he is. That’s what good strikers do - they score goals - so we’re going to have to find a way to stop that. We played well against them [last time] but just couldn’t get the job done. We’re going to tweak some things here and there and hopefully come up with a formula to get the result</p>

  <p>[Storm Roux has decided to stay with Central Coast, citing coach Paul Okon - who is in his first season with the Mariners - as a key drawcard] Paolo has come in this season and given our team direction and he’s a coach that I want to play for. Paolo will have a full pre-season under his belt [next season], bring in the players he wants and we will compete. All the boys in this team feel as though we are building towards something, Paolo is a great coach with a great history as a player so he’s certainly taught me a lot as a player this season<br /><br />To be able to extend my contract here at the Mariners means a lot. This club gave me my chance in professional football at 20 years old and I was thrown right into the starting team, which was massive for me. For the past four years, I’ve played a lot of games for this club and to captain a couple of games for the Mariners when ‘Monty’ [captain Nick Montgomery] has been out is a huge honour - this is very special and I just want to see this club get back to where it should be, which is fighting for a top-six finish. I think I took the first season for granted and thought that every season would be like that - then obviously we haven’t had it since and I’m desperate to get back to finals football, I miss it a lot and it’s something I want to be a part of next season</p>
