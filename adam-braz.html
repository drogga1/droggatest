  <p><b>[Montreal Impact announce Blerim Dzemaili signing]</b> Dzemaili’s profile is very interesting for our team. We see him as a hybrid central midfielder between a No. 8 and a No. 10. He has the physical capacities to play box to box, and one of his main strengths is his ability to make late trailing runs in the box. He’s an international player with a lot of experience playing at the highest level. He’ll bring a lot to this group, not only on the field but also in the locker room with his experience.</p>

  <p><b>[Montreal Impact re-sign team captain Patrice Bernier]</b> We’re happy to have come to terms with Patrice for the 2017 season. It was important for us that Patrice finishes his career here, with our club. We’re also pleased to be able to integrate him as an academy coach starting in 2018. He will be the eighth former Impact player to have such a role within the club, which demonstrates a very clear philosophy when it comes to the make-up of our technical staff</p>

  <p><b>[The Montreal Impact have announced the signing of striker Matteo Mancosu to a two-year deal with the club]</b> We are very happy to have finalized this agreement with Matteo and to be able to count on his services for the next two years. He was able to integrate well with the group upon his arrival last year and demonstrated his qualities on the field during the latter part of the season.</p>

  <p><b>[On Alejandro Silva]</b> Alejandro is a right-sided attacking player with a lot of experience playing in South America. He will add a different dimension to the attack and will help improve the overall quality and depth of the team. His versatility on the field is very positive in that he can also play as a central midfielder.<br /><br />We are in discussions with other clubs regarding specific players that Remi has identified. We are hopeful that we can conclude certain moves in the not so distant future</p>
