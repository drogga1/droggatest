  <p><b>[Sotirios Kyrgiakos says Impossible to overstate how good <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a> was]</b> I have many great memories from my career. But I have to say that being signed by <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was something very important for me.<br /><br /><a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> chose me for the club, and for that I have to thank him. I can say for sure that he was the best manager I worked for. He is very smart, fantastic tactically and also a great person.<br /><br />It was an honour to play for King Kenny. For me, he and <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> are the two greatest players ever to have played for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. They have played a huge part in the club’s history<br /><br />It is impossible to overstate how good a footballer <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a> was. He was such a great player and a great leader. He helped everybody on and off the pitch. I know he will help Rangers a lot. He already has. I hope soon he will win some trophies, because I have no doubt he will make a very good manager too. Rangers is a big football club – the best in Scotland. To play against Celtic in my time there was huge and unique. It is the biggest football derby on the planet, for me.<br /><br /><b>[He tends to keep a low profile now. He is not involved with the game and usually declines media requests. He does, however, keep a close eye on the progress of his former clubs]</b> I watch them all. I will always support them. To have played for such a big club like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is very important to me. I can say it was something special in my career. I see what <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> is doing now with the team. He has done great work wherever he has been as a coach, and what he has done with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is huge. To have won the Champions League and soon <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, that is special</p>
