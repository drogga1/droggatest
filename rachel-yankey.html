  <p><b>[<a href="ellen-white.html">Ellen White</a> has taken this World Cup by storm with her five great goals so far - and there’s nobody more pleased than former England and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> Ladies team-mate Rachel Yankey]</b> Ells has been brilliant. I think her movement has been fantastic, and she’s a worry up there. Ellen has brought something else to her game. When I speak to her, she says, ‘I’m just really enjoying myself, Yanks!’ She’s in a happy place and you can see that when she’s playing - it’s really good to watch<br /><br />It seems like everybody has their opinion on the England team, and other teams, and VAR, and everything. It’s led people to talk about women’s football as they would any other game of football.<br /><br /><b>[Of course, England’s success so far has been vital in generating interest back at home in the tournament]</b> There are so many players you could talk about, and still ones you feel like there’s something more to come from them - hopefully that will come tonight. They’re embracing it. They’ll go out there and they’ve got nothing to lose. They will learn so much. After this World Cup is done, they need to bring it back to club form, and be playing at the same high level so that we can generate a fan base there and keep the momentum.<br /><br /><b>[And as for the USWNT, Yankey says it will be a tough test]</b> The USA are a good side. I don’t think they’ve performed as well as they could have in every game. I definitely think they were very lucky against Spain. Spain rattled them physically, they didn’t give them any time to breathe, and if England can do the same thing, they have a better group of players than Spain do - and a different sort of mentality. But you can’t take your eye off of them. At any moment they could just come back and win the game.<br /><br /><b>[However, she also thinks it is a challenge to which <a href="phil-neville.html">Phil Neville</a>’s side can rise]</b> Sometimes it’s easier to be the underdog - there’s no pressure on you, there’s no expectation, only the expectation that you put on yourself. I think if England go into it playing the same way, the same sort of style that they played against Norway, I think they’ve got every chance of really causing the USA some problems. England looked fresh against Norway <b>[in the quarter-finals]</b>, I think they looked really good, and if they can play at the same high tempo with the same aggression without giving up the ball in dangerous areas, if they can eradicate those little mistakes, I think they can win this one</p>
