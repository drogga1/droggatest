  <p><b>[Africa Cup of Nations 2021 dates remain unchanged despite coronavirus]</b> For now, the Africa Cup of Nations is still scheduled for January to February 2021. The only reason we would shift Afcon would be a situation that continues into the year 2020, and if this current crisis does not allow us to play all the qualification matches. We still have four qualifying days to play and we can play them in two international windows. We have four at our disposal: June, September, October, November. At this point, anything is possible. If we can’t play matchdays three and four in June, we will play them otherwise in September or October and we will play match days five and six in November</p>

  <p><b>[Caf Secretary General Abdelmounaim Bah says moving the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) tournament to June or July is not an option]</b> What we can say is that all the confederations hope to be able to play again this year and each is making its <b>[own]</b> arrangements. In this regard, the Asian confederation has announced that it will resume its qualifications in October and November. And at Caf we subscribe to this logic. The international windows scheduled for March and June have been cancelled, but the months of October and November 2020 represent a lot of hope. We no longer include September in the strategies because it will be quite complicated to have the teams travel from one country to another as early as September. This means that the matches can resume locally but international matches will be difficult to be held because of the travel factor<br /><br />If we cannot make up for the Afcon 2021 qualifiers in October and November, we will have to think of another plan… But today the longer the crisis lasts, the more this scenario deserves to be thought about. Afcon next January, however, remains our number one priority. January 2022 remains the second option for Afcon 2022 <b>[…]</b> As everyone knows, playing in June/July in Cameroon is difficult because of the weather conditions. In addition, in June/July 2021 there is already a lot of competition with the Euros and the Copa America. So the best time to postpone the Afcon would be January 2022. But all that I repeat, these are alternatives because our priority for the Afcon is to play in January 2021<br /><br />We can announce here that the Champions League and the Confederation Cup are the competitions by which we will resume very soon. Besides, this year we have four magnificent posters not to be missed</p>
