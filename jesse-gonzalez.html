  <p><b>[United States goalkeeper Jesse Gonzalez says he always felt welcome in the U.S. national team system]</b> From the first moment, since Klinsmann was here, the United States has opened the doors to me and said they were very interested in me. As a player, you want to be in a place where you’re valued. I think that was a big part of my decision.<br /><br />I chatted with Osorio, I talked with Osorio and everything. The truth is I respect him as a good manager, but he didn’t convince me with what we talked about. I think it was a lack of opportunity. As a young goalkeeper, I think even to go and train and see how everything is with the senior national team and start to get in rhythm</p>

  <p><b>[That doesn’t mean, however, that FCD will look like a youth team in the upcoming season]</b> Balance is the key. In life we have to look for balance. We can’t eat a good steak every day. Some days you have to go buy a burger from McDonald’s. If you don’t, the value of the steak isn’t the same. The value of lobster isn’t the same. We’re going to be looking for a balance in this group. Young guys, guys in the middle, more veteran players and we’re committed to this. The club has the philosophy of developing and playing young players.<br /><br /><b>[While young players like midfielder Brandon Servania and forward Jesus Ferreira may be pushing for spots]</b> The players have to earn their opportunities, just like a veteran player. They know that. Even though I’ve coached a lot of them in the past and I know their families and I know their backgrounds, I have to treat them just like the other players. They’re competing, but they’re doing it well. Whether it’s a young player or experienced player, they’re all showing they’re part of this family, part of this culture of development, a growth-minded mentality</p>
