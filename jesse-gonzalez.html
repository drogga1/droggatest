  <p><b>[MLS has announced that FC Dallas goalkeeper Jesse Gonzalez has been suspended following alleged incidents of domestic abuse]</b> FC Dallas goalkeeper Jesse Gonzalez has been suspended by <a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a> following a report made to the Frisco Police Department alleging incidents of domestic abuse. <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is conducting an independent investigation into the matter and will remain in close communication with FC Dallas, local law enforcement, and the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Players Association throughout the process. The player proactively submitted to, and is currently undergoing, an assessment by Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health (SABH) doctors. Gonzalez will not be eligible to participate in any team activity until the assessment is complete, he is cleared for participation by the SABH Program doctors, and <a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a> completes its investigation. <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> will not have further comment on this matter until the conclusion of the League’s investigation<br /><br />Earlier this week, we learned of allegations involving goalkeeper Jesse Gonzalez. FC Dallas takes these matters extremely seriously and fully supports the league’s swift action to suspend the player while an investigation takes place. We continue to work closely with <a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a> regarding this. As this is an ongoing investigation, FC Dallas will not have further comment at this time</p>
