  <p><b>[Nashville CEO Ayre reveals secrets of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s revival]</b> That chapter is over, it was some of the best time of my life and I’m proud of my time there and grateful, but I’m just a fan now. I love watching them. I love seeing what they’re doing, I love what they’re achieving. It’s kind of nice because, for those 10 years, it’s hard to enjoy it as much and it’ll be the same here with Nashville. You look at the game in a different way. If a player does well, you probably think that his agent is going to call and ask for a new contract. If he does badly, you know the media are going to kill you. There’s a bunch of things that go on around games and day-to-day that stop you from enjoying it as much as you’d like. I enjoyed my time there but, as a fan now watching the games, it’s easier to appreciate it more. Now I can stand in that bar and swear at the TV! Granted, there’s not much swearing at the moment since they’re absolutely awesome<br /><br />I could see that commercially, the business was really poor. It was a long way behind the competitors in United and they were losing a lot of opportunities. They won the Champions League in 2005 and didn’t really capitalize on that commercially. I really went in there to try and transform the revenue as the big challenge. Then we got embroiled in the big ownership issue and what that did was really tear at the fabric of the business. It was tragic in many senses and it was ironic because we were adding revenue with the big sponsorship deal with Standard Chartered, the deal with New Balance, those were coming to the table and, at the same time, we were haemorrhaging money because of the structure with ownership. We really started to turn the corner when Fenway Sports Group came in. I worked very closely with John <b>[Henry]</b> and Tom <b>[Werner]</b> and Mike <b>[Edwards]</b> and it was a process of seven or eight years, and that process still continues today. I think anyone in there would say they still have work to do<br /><br />Jurgen is incredible and I’m his biggest supporter and brought him to the club, but that transformation on the management side, it started with <a href="kenny-dalglish.html">Kenny Dalglish</a>. Bringing Kenny back to stabilize the ship when it was in turmoil. He’s one of those unique unicorns that could get everybody to buy in and realign very quickly, and he did an incredible job, took us to two finals in his first year, and then to transition into the sort of coach that knew the game well and would play and develop young people. Then, <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> comes in and does a wonderful job and gets us to second place and, ultimately, transitions all the way to Jurgen, who is a phenomenon really. None of that stuff happened overnight. We had a plan, we had to get with the plan<br /><br />On the pitch, if you look at the team that plays now, I would guess there are six or seven players like <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> who have been there through that journey that I was there for and others that arrived during that timeline like <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a>, <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> and Roberto <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>, and others that have come and gone like <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> or <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a>. This idea that somebody could take over a club at that level now and just transform it with two or three players, I don’t buy that. You have to have a system and a process and you have to build the business on the field as well as the business off the field<br /><br /><b>[Nashville SC is a much different challenge than <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, and Nashville is a much different city than <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> The best analogy I can think of is it’s like buying your first house. You’re literally involved in everything. I just had a meeting next door to look at a load of seats for the stadium. It’s like picking the carpet or the furniture for your house. It’s incredible. I did that to some degree at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> when we built the new stand, but to do it for a whole stadium and a training ground, it’s incredible<br /><br />From a personal perspective, I’ve never lived or travelled in the south of the United States, and you hear that phrase ‘Southern Hospitality’ and you find it in spades here in Nashville. The warmth of people, genuine warmth, people are really nice. I live 30 minutes south of the city in the countryside with a really outdoor lifestyle. The food is incredible. If I want to go watch a live band tomorrow night in Nashville, I’ve got 200 venues to choose from. There’s always something going on here. It’s like living in New York or London, but without the concrete jungle and traffic and bad stuff. There are lots of stuff going on here, but in a rural environment with really friendly people. What’s not to love really?<br /><br />I’ve tried to take a lot of the things we used there and bring them here. The way we do recruitment, the way we approach revenue generation, the way we develop our brand. We’re trying to be an authentic club in the U.S. and <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, but we also make it work for the U.S. market. There are things you can do here that you’d get shot for if you tried to do at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, but there are lots of similarities in the way we’re approaching it. I loved my time there at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Nobody is happier than me to see them doing so well</p>

  <p><b>[Nashville SC expecting to push out of Inter Miami’s shadow ahead of first <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> season]</b> In terms of the most challenging, there are two parts. One is, as a new club, to build a whole roster of players, and you don’t know. We still don’t know 15 days from the start. We’d like to think we know how good we think we are or will be, but you really don’t know, right? That’s the same whether you’re at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> or Nashville Soccer Club. Until you put 11 players on the pitch, even then it takes four or five months into the season before you know how you shape up relative to everyone else<br /><br />That’s the hardest, I think. At every club I’ve been involved in, you’re buying three, four, maybe five players in the offseason. Here, we were assembling a roster of 30 players, and that’s a lot to get right and a lot can go wrong. That’s the most challenging and the most unknown at this stage<br /><br />The second piece is that we start with no fans, right? We start with no club, no fans, so it’s like you’re selling fresh air to some degree. We had fans from our minor league team in USL, but you’re building something different here at a different level. You’re marketing what’s coming and telling people how great it’s going to be, but everyone is acting with a lot of good faith, really. It’s challenging to get that right<br /><br />If you do this job in this sport for any club, the big moments, whether it’s seeing your team in a big final at Wembley or in the Champions League or opening day here in Nashville on the 29th of February, you just hope that you feel proud of what you’ve achieved with your team. You’re one person in a group of people, so you can’t, and you shouldn’t get carried away with the idea that you did it. We all did it<br /><br />I’m absolutely certain that I’ll feel proud. Somebody asked the question about how we’ll measure success this season and, for me, the way we measure success is if we can look everyone in the eye, whether it’s owners, supporters, sponsors, ourselves, and can we say that we feel proud of what we did?<br /><br />I know that, and I hope that, on the 29th when they walk out, we’ll feel proud that we spent the last two years pulling this thing together</p>
