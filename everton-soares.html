  <p>[One thing can be said about Brazil’s new sensation Everton Soares: he most certainly does not lack confidence. He said after scoring on his Copa America debut] I’m a player that’s always trying to get on top [of the opposition]. Cutting in from the left with dribbles and good finishes. Clubs in Europe have this style of play too and maybe I can fit in at Manchester United and others</p>
</blockquote>

<p>: 2019 07 09
Everton Soares supplied the same electric pace and dribbling ability as his more illustrious compatriot and shared the Golden Boot with Paolo Guerrero with three goals, including a fine finish to open the scoring against Peru.</p>

  <p>[Perhaps his misfortune was even a blessing in disguise for Tite’s men, who caught a glimpse of life without Neymar and found it was far from unpleasant] If Neymar were here I would probably have had few opportunities. I knew that I had to take advantage of any chance that came my way. Thanks to God things went my way</p>
