We are <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> and we must live up to the badge<br /><br />Under the circumstances that they have been through, the players have shown great professionalism. Parejo is our captain. He’s not just a player but also somebody very important for the fans. He’s spent many years here, in very different times, and gone through many difficult situations as well as other nicer ones. He knows the club well and his attitude is very positive for all of us. I think it’s a great show of responsibility. That’s the way we want everybody to be. I hope that his optimism and mentality as captain is contagious</p>

  <p><b>[Albert Celades was forced to attend the club’s Champions League press conference without any of his players after they chose to boycott the media event because of the sacking of their previous coach]</b> Obviously it’s not an ideal situation but it’s the players’ decision, really. I don’t have much more to say about that. There isn’t anything I can do about it. I speak to the players every day. They took this decision but there is always dialogue. The reaction I’ve had has been very good and I’m sure it will continue to improve. The spirit is very good. (Tuesday) is the start of the best club competition in Europe and that is ample motivation for the players to give their best. They want to play, taste the atmosphere. and be in the starting XI. No-one wants to miss out and that, for me, is the most important thing<br /><br /><b>[Celades was aware of the task faced by his players, but he believes they can cause issues for the English club and force a result away from home]</b> It will be a big challenge but a fascinating one too. We’re sure they can cause us a lot of problems. We’re going to prepare for the game in the best way possible and try to get a result</p>

  <p><b>[Valencia are unbeaten in five league games, with coach Albert Celades heaping praise on his players, particularly Parejo, for earning a share of the spoils from a game in which they were often on the back foot]</b> To come here against this team, we knew it would be difficult. The team responded in a brilliant way in the second half, showed a lot of personality and ambition. It is a luxury for us to have a player like Parejo, with his personality. When he has the ball, things happen. I love the way he wants to play, to make others play, to cause problems for the opposition. <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a> underwent an X-ray and MRI scan at the Clinica Universidad de Navarra on Saturday and the report indicates he suffered a grade two sprain of the external lateral ligament of the right ankle</p>

But he played for a while today and that gives us a lot of joy<br /><br /><b>[Celades again refused to be drawn on that suggestion]</b> I don’t know what happened.

  <p><b>[Albert Celades on using GPS technology]</b> During my career, I’ve carried out a scientific study, a doctoral thesis, and then with the emergence of the GPS technology, I found myself faced with such an overwhelming amount of data. You collect lots of information and it’s difficult to interpret and the only possible approach was a scientific one.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest revolution I’ve witnessed in all these years was when I was at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, with the release of a program called AMESCO through which we started to receive information about the effort put in by all of the players during matches. That was nearly 20 years ago now.<br /><br />Another of the most significant changes I’ve witnessed is the increase in the number of games. Playing twice a week greatly alters the training programme compared to having one match per week. The whole training schedule is targeted at ensuring that the player is in the best possible shape on those two matchdays<br /><br />The player has a far more acute sporting culture in every sense and takes better care of themselves. This applies not just to the conditioning training but also to their personal care regimes, including rest, weight and their diet, etc</p>
