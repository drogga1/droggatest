  <p><b>[How <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> came to bid for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> star <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>]</b> We were in London on a conference call. Pairoj Piempongsant was getting heated. The phone was on the table and he was speaking to Paul Aldridge, who had previously been with <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>, got himself in a bit of trouble <b>[over <a href="carlos-tevez.html">Carlos Tevez</a> and <a href="javier-mascherano.html">Javier Mascherano</a>’s transfers]</b>, and was also part of Thaksin’s world.<br /><br />So picture the scene. There’s Paul with his London accent: ‘Pairoj, you got to tell me what we’re doing, it’s getting out of control’. Pairoj was lying on a chaise lounge, getting a massage, and shouting: ‘Yes, yes, yes! Very messy, messy, it’s getting messy’. Something got lost in translation and - on my daughter’s eyesight, this is the truth - that was misheard as ‘we’ve got to get Messi’. That was the enduring comedy of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, I suppose. Paul came to me afterwards: ‘Garry, this is getting confusing, I don’t know what we are doing here’. I said: ‘Put the offer in, let’s see what we come up with’. Then Dave Richards called me the next day from the Premier League: ‘Garry, have you put in an offer for <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>? Seventy million pounds? Are you mad?’. He said he’d had a call from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and they wanted to know if it was real. They were saying to Dave that, if it was real, they might have done a deal a few weeks earlier<br /><br /><b>[Instead of signing <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, City ended up setting a new British record transfer when they signed Robinho from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> The truth - and Peter Kenyon and I still talk about it - is that Robinho thought he was going to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. Robinho was already on his way from Madrid to London and he was heading to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. We got ourselves in the middle of the flight details and put him on a private plane, still to London. Then the agent gods got to work on him. I’m still not sure he knew he was going to end up, ultimately, in Manchester. What he knew was that he was going to earn a lot of money playing for another team in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, whereas in Madrid he wasn’t getting game time. He was going to be a very wealthy man and you know that was the motivation. We announced it in the lobby of our London office, so he had never even been to Manchester before he signed</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> CEO Garry Cook has revealed the extent of the club’s attempts to sign <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> <b>[<a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a>’s agent]</b> Paul Stretford, who I love dearly, is a great guy. We’d always approached him and said: ‘would there ever be opportunity? Would you ever think about it?’ You’re always trying to find a way. <b>[United chief executive]</b> <a href="david-gill.html">David Gill</a> knew we were talking and that we’d had that conversation. And Paul told us: ‘we’re not averse to it, we’re going through a bit of a <b>[contract]</b> negotiation right now, but it’s not going well because they don’t want to sit down and talk to Wayne.’<br /><br />I think David, who is one of the most upstanding guys, always had confidence Wayne wasn’t going to go. For United, it was a case of: ‘let’s not let this get out of control, let’s get a grip of it before something stupid happens’. But we had conversations with Paul and we had a situation where I felt very confident. <b>[<a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a>]</b> was part of our discussions within our internal team. ‘There’s an opportunity,’ I said, ‘I think we should go for it.’ We pushed on the accelerator and that’s when we got the call from Paul saying Wayne had been locked away with Alex and they were going to do a deal. Apparently Alex had cancelled his training session, walked into a room and said: ‘right, you’re not leaving here until we figure this out’. Everybody was doing their job correctly. We were trying to get one of the best players in the world. They were trying to hold on to one of the best players in the world and his agent was trying to get the best deal.</p>
