  <p><b>[Late acquisition Grana outshining FC Dallas’ big-money winter buys]</b> In general the league has really good left wingers, really fast and with experience. Today we faced a really good team. From midfield forward they’re really good. Really good. And we played well.<br /><br />Since I arrived I’ve felt very comfortable, very happy. Now the family is here, truthfully I’m even happier. With the team, I think it’s a good team and there are great people not only within the team but also around it. The kit man, and more, the masseuse. There’s a group of people here who are important, good people helping the team move forward. I think on the field we’re humble, all working for each other. This is important. We faced a strong team today with David Villa, who is a star player, and we played well but couldn’t get an important victory</p>

  <p><b>[Hernan Grana said he felt comfortably initially but he too was soon facing a challenge, matching up with Marcelo coming forward from left back]</b> Obviously we were facing a top-level team where there are a lot of star players. When everybody came in, first it had just become 1-0, and I knew it was going to be a little tougher still, but we survived really well and got the tying goal. It was good, really good. The team was good and we working together there. I think it was a great game for the fans.<br /><br />At the start we didn’t know how it was going to work because we really had no idea how we were going to work together, movement, calls. We got to know each other a bit and worked together well enough. We moved well. It’s not easy. You only have a few days and you’re playing against a team that’s been playing together for several years. It’s tough, but I’m happy for our team, that we worked so well</p>
