  <p><b>[Joan Gaspart claims <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> has been sending warnings to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> that he doesn’t like how the club is going]</b> What I can say is that I want to be at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> as long as possible. I’ve said throughout my career that this is my home. But I also don’t want to have a long-term contract and only be here because of it. I want to be here because physically I’m fine, to play and be an important member of the squad<br /><br /><b>[He went on say, while admitting that he is not in talks regarding a new contract]</b> I need to see there’s a winning team because I want to keep winning things at this club. For me, money or a clause don’t mean anything. Other things motivate me and the most important thing is having a winning team<br /><br /><b>[He told Cadena Ser on Messi’s exit clause]</b> <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Andres Iniesta</a> and <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> had things like this in their contracts, it’s nothing new. What <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has is part of the philosophy of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. I know him well and I don’t think his words were a challenge to the club because it’s not his style. After every statement came a ‘but’ and while the club might understand them as irrelevant, I think they are warnings that he doesn’t like how the club is going<br /><br />I know that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and the president tried to sign <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> but <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> asked for €300 million and while <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is an exceptional player, as a matter of dignity, they couldn’t do it. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> did well trying to sign him</p>

  <p><b>[Gaspart hopes the Brazil international ends up back at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a>, where he left in 2017 for a world-record €222 million]</b> I would love to see <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. I understand that he can still contribute. What I don’t know is the fine print. I forgive what it takes to get him back. I would like him to play for Barca</p>
