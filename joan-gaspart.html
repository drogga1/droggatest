  <p><b>[Former Barcelona president Joan Gaspart, who had to deal with Figo’s exit as soon as he took over in 2000, said]</b> I have experienced this type of situation. Neymar is in the Figo chapter. He was all alone and now he will be accompanied by Neymar.</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar may end up at Real Madrid]</b> Neymar’s possible move to Madrid is not comparable with Figo. Figo left with treachery and with no time to renew the team, and he was a coward who betrayed us. Neymar went for money, full stop.<br /><br /><b>[On Gerard Pique]</b> Pique could be president. I’ve known him since he was a kid and he’s showing that as a businessman he does very well. If Beckenbauer, Angel Maria Villar and Platini can do it… why not Pique?</p>

  <p><b>[Former Barcelona president Joan Gaspart believes Luis Suarez deserves a new, five-year contract at Camp Nou]</b> I love what Luis Suarez has been saying, he is a great player and a sensational person. Players are usually selfish, they usually think that they come first and if they start to slip over the years it is not their problem. I heard him and thought, damn, what a great guy! If I were president I would give him five more years on his contract and if he doesn’t play, it’s fine!<br /><br />Messi should decide that on his own, with the medical staff, I would not risk an out-of-this-world player like him. Valverde has been very sensible saying that we need him but we are not going to risk a repeat of the injury. Messi takes care of himself, he exercises and that is good because when his arm is cured he will be available and in perfect shape right from the off</p>

  <p><b>[Former Barcelona president Joan Gaspart has revealed that Ronaldo was keen to stay at the club prior to his blockbuster move to Inter Milan]</b> Ronaldo wanted to stay at Barcelona, he was happy and his wish was to renew. We had even typed out the contract in front of the player himself and his two agents. It was three in the afternoon and we justifiably decided to go out to eat and celebrate Ronaldo’s renewal, and then return to the office and sign the agreement we had reached.<br /><br />We even toasted with cava to celebrate the agreement. That was a mistake because if we had not gone out to eat and had signed at the same time we reached the agreement, Ronaldo would have stayed at Barcelona<br /><br />At that time we did not pay much attention to the agent’s absence. When he came back he apologised, had some coffee and toasted before going to the office to sign the contract. From the first moment we got to president <b>[Josep]</b> Nunez’s office, the agents began to put obstacles up, they told Ronaldo to go home and that they would call him to sign. I asked them if they did not want to sign. They insisted they did but what they wanted was to renegotiate almost the entire contract, increasing the financial terms. They were trying to destroy the talks<br /><br />When we managed to renegotiate the five points they requested, they found a sixth part, which we also solved, and then a seventh. In tears, <b>[Ronaldo]</b> told me that he was sorry but his agents had a much better offer than ours and that it was better for all parties for him to go to another club to make much more money<br /><br />We did not agree and I went to FIFA in Zurich to file a complaint against Inter. The decision was taken to set up an arbitration committee to decide how much should be paid, not if the player could go to Inter, it was clear that was going to happen. FIFA agreed with Barcelona and Inter had to pay a further 400m pesetas. I personally told Moratti that what he did was not right because he knew we were negotiating and we had closed the operation. He has always denied knowing that we had come to an agreement but that’s a lie. Whenever I see him I remind him that Ronaldo did not want to go to Inter, it was his agents who convinced him due to the money<br /><br />Ronaldo told me <b>[in 2002]</b> that if we equalled Real Madrid’s offer, he would choose Barcelona but it was a huge offer and we could not make such a big investment for a player who had left in that way. Ronaldo’s heart is more Blaugrana than Madrid because he has better memories of his time at Barcelona</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona went to untold lengths in order to secure the signing of PSV sensation Ronaldo]</b> I even had to disguise myself to seal his signature. It didn’t take long to reach agreement with PSV. The fee back then was 1,500,000,000 pesetas - around €15 million in today’s money. But the agreement had a little problem: we needed to get the player’s agreement and we needed it before July 15, because that was when the pact with PSV was set to expire.<br /><br />PSV realised they didn’t want to lose the player and they called the CBF in order to stop Ronaldo signing for Barca. There were two security guards that didn’t want me to go through and see Ronaldo or any other player. I met a Spanish waiter in the hotel and he lent me his work clothes, gave me a tray and a Coca-Cola. I put on the disguise, said ‘hello’ to the security guards and told them a guest had asked for a soft drink. This time they let me past. I knocked on Ronaldo’s door and he himself opened it. He signed the contract right there, on the bed</p>

  <p><b>[Joan Gaspart claims <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> has been sending warnings to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> that he doesn’t like how the club is going]</b> What I can say is that I want to be at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> as long as possible. I’ve said throughout my career that this is my home. But I also don’t want to have a long-term contract and only be here because of it. I want to be here because physically I’m fine, to play and be an important member of the squad<br /><br /><b>[He went on say, while admitting that he is not in talks regarding a new contract]</b> I need to see there’s a winning team because I want to keep winning things at this club. For me, money or a clause don’t mean anything. Other things motivate me and the most important thing is having a winning team<br /><br /><b>[He told Cadena Ser on <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s exit clause]</b> <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Andres Iniesta</a> and <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> had things like this in their contracts, it’s nothing new. What <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has is part of the philosophy of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. I know him well and I don’t think his words were a challenge to the club because it’s not his style. After every statement came a ‘but’ and while the club might understand them as irrelevant, I think they are warnings that he doesn’t like how the club is going<br /><br />I know that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and the president tried to sign <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> but <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> asked for €300 million and while <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is an exceptional player, as a matter of dignity, they couldn’t do it. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> did well trying to sign him</p>
