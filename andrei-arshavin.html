  <p><b>[New <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> Signing Andrey Arshavin Admits To Fitness Worries]</b> Even before the end of the first half I felt as if I had spat my lungs out. It was a hard match for me. In the second half my legs simply refused to serve me. I am not physically strong enough yet to play the whole of the match. But I think with each coming game I play it will be easier in this sense.<br /><br /><b>[Regarding his new team-mates, the player suggested that he still needs time to be able to click with them]</b> We do not fully understand each other yet. I need to get used to the new kind of football and to my new team-mates before I begin playing my usual way</p>

But now if we win games in hand we are still in the race but at the same time we cannot lose more points</p>

  <p><b>[Why a weary and wounded Andrey Arshavin could struggle to be <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s tormentor this time]</b> With my knock at the moment I’m trying my best and after each kick I am feeling pain, but I still train every day. I’ve had a few other injuries.<br /><br /><b>[It’s also the mental strain of working alongside team-mates that technically just aren’t his equal.

Of course, we try to win every match, but class is class<br /><br />If <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> want to become champions, how can they select Arshavin as centre forward? I am 173cm and it suits me, but next to the big centre-halves of United it is very difficult to fight for the ball, especially in the air</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> star Andrey Arshavin admits his season could be over]</b> I pulled my calf muscle and, it seems, tore it. If the scan confirms the initial diagnosis, as seems most likely, I’ll be out for a long time. At best I’ll be back in three weeks, at worst I won’t play again this season at all.<br /><br /><b>[William]</b> <a href="william-gallas.html">Gallas</a> suffered a similar injury. He was treated for three weeks in England and then three more in France. He only just recovered, played against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, and is now out of action again. We didn’t play the way we wanted and now I’ve got myself into this mess. I could have easily missed the game because of pain in my groin, but I gave it a go. But fate, it seems, was against me playing Barcelona<br /><br />Our rivals also have absentees - for example, <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> is out. A lot will depend on what happens when <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> play each other on Saturday. I hope for a draw. Then we would be trailing by two points and one point, respectively. If <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> win it will be one and three. If <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> win, making up four points on <b>[Sir Alex]</b> Ferguson’s team would be extremely difficult.

  <p><b>[Robin Van Persie’s Return Came Too Late To Save <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s Season]</b> Unfortunately it <b>[Van Persie’s return]</b> is slightly too late to win a trophy. Some of Robin’s shots were difficult to save but Gomes has done it. It helped <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> to beat us for the first time in 11 years <b>[in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b>. He had a big impact last season and he has done well before his injury, so he is showing his quality. It would be easier for us <b>[if we had not had the injuries]</b>. I cannot say we would be champions but it would be easier for us<br /><br /><b>[He admits that it has been frustrating watching his team-mates in action and has targeted the game against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> as a possible return]</b> It was a shame for me. I was watching as my team was losing but it was a shame because I could not help my team-mates. I am recovering and I hope to be back for <b>[Saturday’s home game against]</b> <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. This season has been tough, tight, sometimes it was even difficult for me and my team but in general it was not bad. Hopefully we will win the last three games. We have got a lot of goals at the end of the games, we managed to do some comebacks and we have to use that spirit next season. We can fight again next season</p>

When sitting on the bench during the Udinese game, I told <a href="nicklas-bendtner.html">Bendtner</a> that we have no players who can feed <a href="robin-van-persie.html">van Persie</a> or use the strong sides of other forwards. <a href="nicklas-bendtner.html">Bendtner</a> said that only <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> could have replaced Cesc. I’m glad I had the opportunity to play with such a great footballer. Some are irreplaceable.<br /><br /><b>[With <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> and other players in his position, we will play different football from that of Cesc and Samir period]</b> It’s difficult to say whether <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> can fight with the Manchester clubs and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, but those teams look very intimidating<br /><br /><b>[Arshavin also praised new colleague <a href="per-mertesacker.html">Per Mertesacker</a> but admitted to knowing nothing about defender Andre Santos, who joined the club from Fenerbahce]</b> I know <a href="per-mertesacker.html">Mertesacker</a>, he is a good defender, and he will help us. I don’t know anything about Andre Santos apart from that he is a Brazilian international. We could use another defensive midfielder, but unfortunately the bid for Yann M’Vila <b>[the France and Rennes midfielder]</b> didn’t work out. It will be interesting to play <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> in the Champions League. I’ve seen them play against Hamburg, and <a href="mario-gotze.html">Gotze</a> is amazing.

  <p><b>[Andrey Arshavin says <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> is not in a good position]</b> It’s difficult to replace a guy who managed the team for more than 20 years. <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> is not in a good position I would say.

I did not feel anything special before the game. When I came out onto the pitch and was warming up, I thought ‘we will not lose today’. That was the only thing I knew before the game. Of course I could not imagine before that game that I would score four goals. If you look at the stats, it was my best game.

  <p><b>[Andrey Arshavin says <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> is world class, but he has no future at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> As a player, of course, I respect him. Mesut is a world-class player. But for me personally he slows down the game. I would prefer to use another player. Mikel, as we can see, is the opposite and plays him a lot. He has improved his game at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> but still, in the future, I do not see him there<br /><br />For me, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s squad is not balanced. Offensively-wise they are very good and in attack, they play very pretty football. It’s good to watch. But defensively - even in my period - <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is weak. Sometimes that is down to injuries and sometimes they don’t have enough experience but I don’t know why this doesn’t change<br /><br />Regarding <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a>, it was a good choice because he has spent time at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and knows the club well. He worked next to Arsene and can take good experience from him. He also has the respect of the club and players. And since he has taken over at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> they have changed: not too much but in a good way.

He has been at the club for 13 years and knows the problems better than anyone. All the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> players are behind him - and if he leaves they will all leave.
