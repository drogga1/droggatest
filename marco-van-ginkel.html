  <p><b>[Van Ginkel not ruling out <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> stay: I’ve gone through dark times but I’m not a quitter]</b> You get dispirited when you hear everything has to be done again. I needed a new surgery, but didn’t know when. My knee needed flushing out to get rid of that infection, so I had three surgeries in six days. That was quite an event, but infections like that could end your career. I wasn’t thinking about that, though. The flushing out helped me a lot, but I had to wait four to five months before I could get going again. That was a long time. I have gone through dark times. I usually am a very positive minded person. The people around me always supported me, as does <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I won’t give up easy, because I’m not a quitter. Of course, I had some very bad days, though<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he could return to fight for a place in <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>’s squad in the near future]</b> You have to ask <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> has an option to lengthen my contract for two years. I have to wait and see. My primary focus is to get fit again, and then we’ll see what happens<br /><br /><b>[He added on whether he still sees himself as a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> player]</b> Yes, I do. I walk around the club facilities every day, with all the players. And when you’ve been around as long as I have, you know all the physios, doctors, everyone</p>

  <p><b>[Marco van Ginkel says that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have opened talks with his agent over a contract extension]</b> My agent, Karel Jansen, is in talks with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> about a new contract for me. I am very happy at this show of confidence in me by the club. It is quite something when a club tries to keep a player who has been out injured so long and in these uncertain times as well. If a deal can be done I expect to make my comeback in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s Under-23 side. Otherwise I will be a free agent this summer, and we’ll look elsewhere. The prospects look very good. I have worked really hard to come back. I can now train four to five times a week. I was on the point of rejoining group training in March before the coronavirus outbreak</p>
