  <p><b>[Marco van Ginkel is ready to leave Chelsea permanently should he fail to convince Blues boss Antonio Conte of his worth ahead of the 2018-19 Premier League campaign]</b> PSV is my team now. I don’t think about other teams or Chelsea. I do follow them, but it’s not my team now. We all know each other personally here, so I don’t feel like I’m on loan. Sometimes there is no other option <b>[other than going on loan]</b>, PSV keeps having faith in me. I had an injury last summer and If PSV would have tried to sign me back then, Chelsea would’ve declined it. That’s why I extended my contract with <b>[Chelsea for]</b> another year, because I only had one year left, now it’s two. They didn’t want to let me go, perhaps because of the lower price.<br /><br />There is a group <b>[of loanees]</b> that does have chance at Chelsea. I’ve been part of the selection already, so I have the confidence I will get back into it. I watch them often. I try to watch almost every game of them. They are doing terrific and I think you could say they will clinch the title. When I was younger I watched English football all the time, but I didn’t support a specific club. Now Chelsea is my club, and so I cheer for them. The extra motivation to get back <b>[to Chelsea]</b> is always there. Not only because get into Champions League. Of course it’s nice to play matches in the Netherlands, it’s great. It’s nearby to your family and friends, but eventually you want to make the next step. If that’s not at Chelsea, then I might look for something else.<br /><br />I knew it for sometime <b>[that I would rejoin PSV]</b>. It was a pity, because I’d liked to play for a whole season at PSV. You’re disappointed in the beginning, but you don’t get anywhere if you make quarrel about it. I managed to get over it. My family, girlfriend, friends and others helped me out. Most of it you have to do it yourself. The Eredivisie level is not a low standard, but my choice was crystal clear <b>[to return to PSV]</b>. You do have a lot more time in midfield in the Netherlands, but this is a grassroots league. In Italy and England there are a lot of experienced players, and you are the rookie<br /><br />Vitesse didn’t want to sell me to a domestic side. Vitesse were one of the top three sides <b>[when I was at the club, therefore they didn’t like the idea. Ajax would’ve been a good move. I even talked to Frank de Boer and Marc Overmars, but it wasn’t decisive. I’ve become champions with PSV, so Ajax is not really relevant anymore. They don’t have to get back at me again. If I pick PSV two times, it isn’t an option for me. In the case <b>[that I return to Holland]</b>. It will only be for PSV, that’s all there is. If it’s going to happen for a third time, I don’t know. I don’t look further ahead of things<br /><br />I played a reasonable amount of games in the Netherlands already, so I hadn’t had the feeling to return. Then came AC Milan along, and I wanted to see how a things would work out in the Italian league. I am happy with the experience <b>[in Milan]</b>. You get more mature. Inzaghi was the manager back then, and he wasn’t all that compliant. He made a lot of decisions no one understood. The day before a game he would let you know if you’d play or be benched. If I played two good games in a row, I’d be a substitute the third game. These kinds of things; there wasn’t any logic at all, of course politics were involved. Before the winter break I already had the feeling I’d play a whole season. But was kicked during a training session and one other time I slip sprain my other foot, and got injured</b></p>

  <p><b>[Marco van Ginkel says that he might have stayed at Bournemouth, if he was in Nathan Ake’s shoes]</b> There was a certain pride when he was called back by Chelsea. He returned to Chelsea and it was going well for him at Bournemouth. Perhaps I would have stayed there <b>[at Bournemouth]</b>. There might have been a clause in his contract and Chelsea bought him back on those terms. Now he’s often in the stands and not on the bench. I talk to him about it on a regular basis. Yes, he’s fed up <b>[but that’s normal]</b>. First you play every game and then you only train. That’s not your aim.<br /><br />I don’t consider him like my little brother, but we do know each other very well. I helped him out in the beginning, and the other way around. I know English, but it comes helpful when you have a guide around. I helped him out football wise. It was very nice there was a countryman around. Nathan was still a youth player, but he soon got into the first team. Patrick van Aanholt was also there, so we speak each other a lot. Some players I do talk to, and you follow each other on Instagram. You ‘like’ certain posts, or say something. That’s good, because you keep an eye on each other that way<br /><br />I played with Lewis Baker in the Under 21s. We had a game at Vitesse last week, and I talk to some guys, with Lewis for example, and we speak about how everything is going for us. He’s doing quite well and scores a lot of goals. He is technically gifted and two legged. It’s a very strong player. You could almost say he’s my competitor in midfield, but he’s a different kind of player. So I don’t see him as such</p>

  <p><b>[Van Ginkel not ruling out <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> stay: I’ve gone through dark times but I’m not a quitter]</b> You get dispirited when you hear everything has to be done again. I needed a new surgery, but didn’t know when. My knee needed flushing out to get rid of that infection, so I had three surgeries in six days. That was quite an event, but infections like that could end your career. I wasn’t thinking about that, though. The flushing out helped me a lot, but I had to wait four to five months before I could get going again. That was a long time. I have gone through dark times. I usually am a very positive minded person. The people around me always supported me, as does <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I won’t give up easy, because I’m not a quitter. Of course, I had some very bad days, though<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he could return to fight for a place in <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>’s squad in the near future]</b> You have to ask <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> has an option to lengthen my contract for two years. I have to wait and see. My primary focus is to get fit again, and then we’ll see what happens<br /><br /><b>[He added on whether he still sees himself as a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> player]</b> Yes, I do. I walk around the club facilities every day, with all the players. And when you’ve been around as long as I have, you know all the physios, doctors, everyone</p>

  <p><b>[Marco van Ginkel says that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have opened talks with his agent over a contract extension]</b> My agent, Karel Jansen, is in talks with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> about a new contract for me. I am very happy at this show of confidence in me by the club. It is quite something when a club tries to keep a player who has been out injured so long and in these uncertain times as well. If a deal can be done I expect to make my comeback in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s Under-23 side. Otherwise I will be a free agent this summer, and we’ll look elsewhere. The prospects look very good. I have worked really hard to come back. I can now train four to five times a week. I was on the point of rejoining group training in March before the coronavirus outbreak</p>
