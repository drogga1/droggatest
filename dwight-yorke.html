  <p><b>[Dwight Yorke says scoring a hat-trick during our 6-1 demolition of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in February 2001 ranks as one of his fondest memories in a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> shirt]</b> <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> being one of our main rivals over the years, it was one of the fixtures to look forward to. Outside of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, it was the next big fixture in my time. So being able to score three against them in such a crucial game, it has to go down as one of my fondest memories at United. There are many fond memories in there, but as a striker you are always judged on the number of goals you score as well.<br /><br />To score three against them on that day, against <a href="david-seaman.html">David Seaman</a> as well, who was one of the best goalkeepers in world football at the time, to have done that against such a quality goalkeeper and team, I was very happy about it<br /><br /><b>[When he got word of his likely inclusion, however, he was keen to seize his chance]</b> I actually remember that during the week, I just had a feeling that the gaffer is giving me the heads-up that I was going to be playing. The opportunity had been very limited, so when the gaffer gave me that opportunity and said there’s your chance, I was ready to go. I felt well going into the game even though I hadn’t played that much and when I went out there I felt good, the instinct kicked in. It was just great to have the opportunity, and to score three on the day was the icing on the cake<br /><br />It meant a lot to me. I wasn’t playing regularly because Coley and Teddy were doing the job. They were the first pairing which is understandable. If you drop off you’ll be left behind. When you come up against a big rival, you want to do well because in the back of your mind you think if you do well you get back in the team. But we played <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> the next week and I didn’t play! The gaffer said he could have scored that hat-trick! That’s what he said to me!</p>

  <p><b>[Kane is a complete player but Martial can be <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>’s permanent No.9]</b> Martial’s hat-trick last night and the way he scored the three goals shows he’s an accomplished finisher. The fact is: when you play for United you’re scrutinised if you’re inconsistent and singled out for criticism if you don’t perform. We’ve got to remember these are young players and are very new into the Man United way of life. United are always linked with quality players and <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> is at the top of the tree in terms of a No.9, he’s a complete player - but what we’ve seen is that United have invested a lot in young players and the No.9 position is a tricky position to play, it’s a specialist position, Ally <b>[McCoist]</b> will vouch for that. So if someone like <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> wants to join our football club that can only be a huge plus, but for now we have a lot of talent in the young squad and they just need game time<br /><br />To be a No.9 you need to play there week-in, week-out; not one week on the left, then on the right and then you come back into the centre. The best goalscorers in the history of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a> for instance, he only played in one position and he wasn’t interested in anywhere else. The likes of <a href="robbie-fowler.html">Robbie Fowler</a>, <a href="andy-cole.html">Andy Cole</a>, <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a>, they only played in one position and that’s why they were the best, and <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> is in that bracket too. Martial has been at the club for a few years now and his preferred position is playing as a centre-forward, and he got his opportunity and he really made it count. So I think he’s ready to go</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> should go for Sane if he can’t get <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a>]</b> United has got a real good attacking bunch of young players. Add in <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a>, I like the boy Sane. If I was to airdrop, the boy Sane at City I really do <b>[like]</b>. We haven’t got a left-footed sort of winger. The boy <b>[Mason]</b> <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a> is coming to the fore recently but I like Sane. I really do think this kid is probably the quickest out of all them as well and he’s really got a good attitude. I know he’s got some injuries but if I was brave, if I was Man United manager at this point in time that’s the type of person I would go for. He’s had a couple of years in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, I’ve watched him very closely, he’s a player that I like a lot. The boy <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> is obviously up there as well but if you can’t get him why not be brave and go for a player who’s played across next door and cause some stir, just stir it up a little bit. That’s what I would do.</p>

  <p><b>[The former Red Devils striker believes <a href="jesse-lingard.html">Jesse Lingard</a> should be seeking a switch in order to rediscover his spark]</b> We had a lot of hopes, he came through the ranks and we love that. He knows the club through and through, he loves the football club and we thought he was going to go on where <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> is at the moment. He’s come a little unstuck at the moment and he has to find another gear somewhere along the line. At the moment, it’s just not happening. At 27 years of age, you ought to be a bit regular. If it’s not happening, maybe he has to look elsewhere. But for now, he’s still got some games and he’s still got to prove himself. I think there is a little bit of a question mark over his name at the moment for sure, he’s fully aware of that, there’s no two ways about that. He knows that he’s not in the team and he needs to do more to get back in</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> is ‘perfect partner’ for Henry-like Martial at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> Anthony reminds me of myself and <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> in the way he has started his career playing out wide on the left or right before developing into someone who can play down the middle, while Marcus does not get the credit for how intelligent a player he is. He is the perfect partner for Anthony in that he can play just off him as a number ten and drop into the pockets, going long or short or floating wide off much like I did with <a href="andy-cole.html">Andy Cole</a>. Not that he has to be stuck in that role because he can also run beyond Anthony to get his goals too. I can see a good bond developing between the two and good connection. Of course both will like to score and they know as forwards they get judged on that but, as you saw against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, Marcus looked just as pleased to have set Anthony up for two of his goals as well. The key is building on that understanding but also having the faith of the manager who looks to have said to them ‘you are my front two’ and given them their heads to go out and do it.<br /><br />You do not necessarily need that experience as a manager if you have played at a level like Ole has. He has been there and experienced what it is like at the very top level. He has remembered it, learned from it and is now implanting it himself. You can see that in his work with Anthony and Marcus. The first two goals from Anthony against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> were proper goal poaching goals like Ole enjoyed scoring himself</p>
