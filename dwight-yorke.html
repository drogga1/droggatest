I have no doubt that he will be a fantastic player for us and he’ll probably go on to break a number of records because he’s got the attributes. He’s got the pace, he’s got the desire. I saw him training in the gym two weeks before the pre-season tour, and that tells me that he’s got the right attitude</p>

  <p><b>[On Marcus Rashford]</b> That’s the thing, we all started at some stage when we came into these big occasions and he’s blossomed in his own right. People tend to forget that he’s still only 19 years of age, and he will learn.<br /><br />He probably ideally wants to play centre forward but we all started off at left wing or right wing and you kind of develop your trade and you learn from that. Eventually he will no doubt be the number one striker at Manchester United Football Club for a number of years to come.<br /><br />He’s come from a humble background and he appreciates where he is and understands clearly that this is just the beginning. With all the hype he just needs to continue to work and keep his feet on the ground, and continue to produce the goods like he has been doing.</p>

Many young players and parents feel it’s not possible to have a future playing here in the UAE. I can tell you, coming from the Caribbean, anything is possible. To see what ESM Football Academy have been doing for the last 12 years in the UAE is very encouraging and it’s only going to get better. This is where it starts and we’ll be implementing the best options and methods for each player at the academy, to give them structure and the opportunity to have a bright future</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho is yet to embrace the Manchester United way which made Sir Alex Ferguson so successful]</b> Sir Alex Ferguson was a different manager <b>[to Mourinho]</b>, he understood the Manchester United way of playing. He instilled a lot of confidence in us and made us feel that we could go to the likes of Liverpool and Arsenal back in the day and overturn them, not just go there and get a draw but to go there and win a game.<br /><br />So we were pretty confident whether we were playing at home or away. We had a winning mentality to go to the likes of Liverpool and Arsenal and certainly get a result. So Sir Alex Ferguson’s approach to games was a winning attitude and a winning mentality and that’s how we approached it back then</p>

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford is the complete package and can shine as a central striker for Manchester United in time]</b> Strikers often say instinctive goals are better. You just let it happen, let it rip and when it goes in it’s magnificent. The instinct of being a centre-forward is important and that’s the position I’m sure you’ll end up in. It all comes from the instinct of being in the position at the right time and anticipating the move. You seem to have the lot: I can see all of the types of goals you are scoring, which makes it even more impressive at this early stage of your career. There was one magnificent goal from outside the box for England, when I thought ‘wow, we’ve got somebody here who can score goals and not just one type of goal’. It’s good to have that range. We all recognise the No.9 who just gets tap-ins, but you’ve got all of it and now you’ve added free-kicks to your repertoire as well, it’s even more impressive. This is still an early stage in your career and, if I was you, from past experiences, I would just have a collection of my goals and I’d keep reminding yourself of the things you can do, especially if you have a little period where you aren’t scoring. Have a selection of goals and get a feel-good factor about yourself. Even if you go through a drought, which everyone goes through, just go back and watch those goals. It gives you that buzz and a massive buzz. It puts that smile back on your face. It makes you think ‘damn I can do this stuff!’ That is what I used to do and, trust me, it works. That would be my advice. Just go back, remind yourself and look at the goals that you’ve scored, from the tap-ins to the wonder strikes. I would put a collection of them together, just for your private use</p>

  <p><b>[Should Paul Pogba leave Man Utd?]</b> No, I don’t think he should leave United. When you join United, you are under so much scrutiny, and if you underperform there are always people likely to criticise you - it’s just part and parcel of the game. He’s still in that development stage and he’ll embrace all this and understand he can’t just perform when he feels like.<br /><br />I don’t think he goes out there deliberately trying not to perform, I just think he’s not been able to express himself. It’s all about character, and understanding the character of the people you have brought to the football club. He’s a showman, Paul Pogba, and a great guy - you can’t take that away from him because that is his personality and he likes to express himself. I feel at times he has been restricted - defensively he has to contribute to the team, and it’s not just about Paul Pogba, it is about the team - but when it comes to the character of the person, Pogba is an entertainer. He wants to entertain, and sometimes he is not allowed to do that</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho has seen his brand of football at Manchester United slammed as a load of crap]</b> If you are on the front foot playing attacking football and you want to score goals, that is what people want to pay money to watch. I remember when we were playing Liverpool away from home and we recorded one shot in the whole match. That’s not Man United. You want people to go out and express themselves. You are hoping one of your big talents produces a magic moment that will go out and win you the game. United are waiting for that one moment and secure a 1-0 advantage. That is not the way we play. It’s a load of crap, in my opinion<br /><br />I think <b>[United]</b> would definitely win the league <b>[under Guardiola]</b> because <b>[City]</b> are on the front foot, playing attacking football. Look at the other side and the blue half of Manchester. Don’t tell me those players are far superior to the players we have. You look at Anthony Martial, <b>[Marcus]</b> Rashford, <b>[Jesse]</b> Lingard, you look at <b>[Alexis]</b> Sanchez, <b>[Romelu]</b> Lukaku. We have got a very, very strong attacking line-up. The difference is <b>[City]</b> have a manager who thinks positive and wants to play attacking football. On the red side, we have a manager who wants to win 1-0 and play defensive. That is simply the difference.</p>

  <p><b>[Dwight Yorke believes Manchester United are a very good side]</b> There is no way Manchester City are 19 points better than this United team. This is a very good side that Jose Mourinho has assembled. The proof has been there with victories over Spurs at Wembley, the comeback against City in the derby and home wins over both Chelsea and Liverpool. The away win at Arsenal was a cracker, too. You cannot tell me those were not top performances. But you can never take your opponent for granted and I think the manager has seen performance levels drop based on the opposition at times this season. There is no lack of ability in this team. You look at <b>[Romelu]</b> Lukaku, <b>[Marcus]</b> Rashford, <b>[Alexis]</b> Sanchez, <b>[Jesse]</b> Lingard, <b>[Paul]</b> Pogba, <b>[Juan]</b> Mata, these are all great players. It has the league’s second-best defensive record and, in David de Gea, the best keeper in the world. They just need to get that mentality right for every game. United have gone from sixth to second and are now in a third major final in two seasons. Mourinho has got the club going in the right direction again<br /><br /><b>[On Chelsea in the FA Cup final]</b> I fully expect United to win. I’m not being biased - I just believe they are the better side. Chelsea have had a really poor season and seem to be ending it with something of a whimper. Of course they’ll lift themselves for this - but so will United. They just need to do that for every game next season. I think the fact they haven’t always been able to do that has been the major cause of frustration for the manager this season</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United don’t need to look at the World Cup]</b> United and Jose don’t need to look at the World Cup. No player suits us more than Gareth Bale. Yes there will always be some exciting candidates to look at but Bale is someone who excites me. He is the right age, in his prime, and will be the perfect addition.<br /><br />We don’t know too much about Dalot and Fred and they haven’t been tested yet in our league. Jose has looked to improve as United always does and to do his business as early as possible. Every team each year looks to improve themselves by 10 per cent, but City have set the benchmark and now it’s down to United to respond to that. That’s what we’ll see this summer and the same goes for Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham as they look to close the gap. A lot of work needs to be done. But I don’t believe that City are 19 points better than United. United had some great results and beat City away and against Liverpool and Tottenham and Chelsea. They beat all of the big teams: it was just inconsistency that frustrated everyone. Whether that gap can be bridged remains to be seen but I don’t personally believe they are 19 points better than us.</p>

  <p><b>[Dwight Yorke believes ‘world’s best’ can be toppled]</b> I don’t think we can stop Messi. I think that you have got to concentrate on your game. I think we have to play the most near-perfect game to overcome Barcelona. We know that Messi is arguably the world’s best footballer in our generation, and when you have that sort of mentality, it is always difficult. But I feel if we play the team collectively and we play to our potential, even with Messi’s greatness, I think we may just have the edge on them. We have to play as a team and we have to play to our full potential and, of course, you need a little bit of luck in those games to go your way and, if we can get that on the night, there is no reason why United cannot come out victorious in those two-legged games.<br /><br />I would say that there was no other footballer in the world, even to this day, with a better delivery of a football than David Beckham. For me, not the greatest footballer I have played with, but certainly he was a big part of my success in terms of the number of goals that I scored at United. He is a great footballer, a great ambassador and a great guy. More importantly, I had a real good time, real fun, playing with David Beckham</p>

  <p><b>[Dwight Yorke says scoring a hat-trick during our 6-1 demolition of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in February 2001 ranks as one of his fondest memories in a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> shirt]</b> <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> being one of our main rivals over the years, it was one of the fixtures to look forward to. Outside of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, it was the next big fixture in my time. So being able to score three against them in such a crucial game, it has to go down as one of my fondest memories at United. There are many fond memories in there, but as a striker you are always judged on the number of goals you score as well.<br /><br />To score three against them on that day, against <a href="david-seaman.html">David Seaman</a> as well, who was one of the best goalkeepers in world football at the time, to have done that against such a quality goalkeeper and team, I was very happy about it<br /><br /><b>[When he got word of his likely inclusion, however, he was keen to seize his chance]</b> I actually remember that during the week, I just had a feeling that the gaffer is giving me the heads-up that I was going to be playing. The opportunity had been very limited, so when the gaffer gave me that opportunity and said there’s your chance, I was ready to go. I felt well going into the game even though I hadn’t played that much and when I went out there I felt good, the instinct kicked in. It was just great to have the opportunity, and to score three on the day was the icing on the cake<br /><br />It meant a lot to me. I wasn’t playing regularly because Coley and Teddy were doing the job. They were the first pairing which is understandable. If you drop off you’ll be left behind. When you come up against a big rival, you want to do well because in the back of your mind you think if you do well you get back in the team. But we played <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> the next week and I didn’t play! The gaffer said he could have scored that hat-trick! That’s what he said to me!</p>

  <p><b>[Kane is a complete player but Martial can be <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>’s permanent No.9]</b> Martial’s hat-trick last night and the way he scored the three goals shows he’s an accomplished finisher. The fact is: when you play for United you’re scrutinised if you’re inconsistent and singled out for criticism if you don’t perform. We’ve got to remember these are young players and are very new into the Man United way of life. United are always linked with quality players and <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> is at the top of the tree in terms of a No.9, he’s a complete player - but what we’ve seen is that United have invested a lot in young players and the No.9 position is a tricky position to play, it’s a specialist position, Ally <b>[McCoist]</b> will vouch for that. So if someone like <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> wants to join our football club that can only be a huge plus, but for now we have a lot of talent in the young squad and they just need game time<br /><br />To be a No.9 you need to play there week-in, week-out; not one week on the left, then on the right and then you come back into the centre. The best goalscorers in the history of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a> for instance, he only played in one position and he wasn’t interested in anywhere else. The likes of <a href="robbie-fowler.html">Robbie Fowler</a>, <a href="andy-cole.html">Andy Cole</a>, <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a>, they only played in one position and that’s why they were the best, and <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> is in that bracket too. Martial has been at the club for a few years now and his preferred position is playing as a centre-forward, and he got his opportunity and he really made it count. So I think he’s ready to go</p>

He is the perfect partner for Anthony in that he can play just off him as a number ten and drop into the pockets, going long or short or floating wide off much like I did with <a href="andy-cole.html">Andy Cole</a>. Not that he has to be stuck in that role because he can also run beyond Anthony to get his goals too. I can see a good bond developing between the two and good connection. Of course both will like to score and they know as forwards they get judged on that but, as you saw against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, Marcus looked just as pleased to have set Anthony up for two of his goals as well. The key is building on that understanding but also having the faith of the manager who looks to have said to them ‘you are my front two’ and given them their heads to go out and do it.<br /><br />You do not necessarily need that experience as a manager if you have played at a level like Ole has. He has been there and experienced what it is like at the very top level. He has remembered it, learned from it and is now implanting it himself. You can see that in his work with Anthony and Marcus. The first two goals from Anthony against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> were proper goal poaching goals like Ole enjoyed scoring himself</p>
