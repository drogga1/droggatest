  <p>[Manchester United have been offered hope in their pursuit of Daniel James, but Swansea have warned that they will not ‘give players away’] I can’t see there being many. If the Dan James thing happens then there might possibly be one or two, I don’t know. But I can’t see a fire sale of players. If someone comes in with an offer that is sensible and proper player trading then you would have to think about that. But you can’t give players away. You’ve got to get the right value for them. We aren’t in a position, and I am pretty well versed in financial positions and football clubs, where we have to sell a player or it is ‘Good Night Vienna’. We can hold out for the right prices.<br /><br />It is a given that we have to get them off the pay roll. Anything else we receive on top will be a bonus. Their wages are potentially crippling the club</p>

  <p>[Swansea officials are sad to see Daniel James go, but club chairman Trevor Birch wished him well for the future while confirming his departure] We are obviously hugely disappointed to lose a player of Daniel’s quality, especially after such a fantastic breakthrough season for us and the enjoyment he gave to those watching him. However, given the level of those performances and the fact he has one year remaining on his contract, it was inevitable that once a club of the calibre of Manchester United came calling it would be virtually impossible to hold on to him. It goes without saying that we wish him well at his new club, especially after the sad loss of his father recently. We can only thank Daniel for his contribution over the past season and the pleasure he brought to so many of us watching his performances. I’m sure he has a great future ahead of him and we wish him every success in his career.</p>
