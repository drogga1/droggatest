  <p><b>[Manchester United could earn a staggering £26.2 million per season if they were to sell the naming rights to Old Trafford]</b> Sponsorship demand for the content rights of the top clubs in the Premier League shows no sign of abating. We have seen enormous increases in rights values of the elite clubs over the last couple of years, especially regarding shirt branding and product endorsement. Although the UK hasn’t embraced stadium naming rights as enthusiastically as the United States, its potential to become an important revenue stream is highlighted by these figures. Clubs are continually looking at ways to generate extra value, and given the gilt-edged international demand for the Premier League TV rights, we may be entering a period where we start to see clubs monetising their stadium rights. This is potentially a huge opportunity for clubs, with 40 per cent of Premier League clubs, including Arsenal, Man City, Leicester, Stoke and Brighton all granting stadium naming rights to their grounds in recent years.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea warned by former chief executive they face having ‘no stadium, no manager and no star player’]</b> The Chelsea fans now face the prospect of no stadium, no manager and no star player if Eden Hazard moves to Real Madrid. I wasn’t really surprised <b>[by the stadium news]</b> because it’s obviously linked to the visa situation. There have been some rising costs in the stadium and it’s a difficult project to deliver - but I think this is clearly Roman upping the ante in the spat with the Home Office. We’ve moved into a different phase now. If the visa issue isn’t resolved I think anything could happen. I think there’s obviously a great deal of concern around at the moment. But I think it’s eminently sellable as a club, based in west London. With TV rights increasing, if Manchester United is valued at over £3 billion I think Chelsea is valued at £1.5 billion - and very attractive<br /><br />Of course to maintain the value of his <b>[Abramovich]</b> investment he needs to invest in players - and he didn’t</p>

  <p><b>[Graham Potter replaces Chris Hughton as Brighton coach]</b> We received a request from Brighton last week to speak to Graham over the vacant managerial position at the club. We had absolutely no desire to lose the services of Graham after the excellent work he had done over the course of his debut season. We therefore declined Brighton’s initial request to speak to him. We then spoke to Graham in length over the request. These discussions included the offer of a new, improved contract and certain assurances regarding future squad strengthening. These assurances would have had to sit within our current financial budget, but we were confident that by working together we could build on the excellent progress the team made last season. Unfortunately, following those amicable discussions, Graham expressed a desire to challenge himself in the Premier League and we reluctantly allowed him to speak to Brighton after agreeing a compensation package. It goes without saying that we are very disappointed to lose Graham and members of his backroom staff, but we would like to thank him for the excellent work he did during our first season of transition and we wish him well at Brighton</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> have been offered hope in their pursuit of <a href="daniel-james.html">Daniel James</a>, but <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> have warned that they will not ‘give players away’]</b> I can’t see there being many. If the <a href="daniel-james.html">Dan James</a> thing happens then there might possibly be one or two, I don’t know. But I can’t see a fire sale of players. If someone comes in with an offer that is sensible and proper player trading then you would have to think about that. But you can’t give players away. You’ve got to get the right value for them. We aren’t in a position, and I am pretty well versed in financial positions and football clubs, where we have to sell a player or it is ‘Good Night Vienna’. We can hold out for the right prices.<br /><br />It is a given that we have to get them off the pay roll. Anything else we receive on top will be a bonus. Their wages are potentially crippling the club</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> officials are sad to see <a href="daniel-james.html">Daniel James</a> go, but club chairman Trevor Birch wished him well for the future while confirming his departure]</b> We are obviously hugely disappointed to lose a player of Daniel’s quality, especially after such a fantastic breakthrough season for us and the enjoyment he gave to those watching him. However, given the level of those performances and the fact he has one year remaining on his contract, it was inevitable that once a club of the calibre of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> came calling it would be virtually impossible to hold on to him. It goes without saying that we wish him well at his new club, especially after the sad loss of his father recently. We can only thank Daniel for his contribution over the past season and the pleasure he brought to so many of us watching his performances. I’m sure he has a great future ahead of him and we wish him every success in his career.</p>
