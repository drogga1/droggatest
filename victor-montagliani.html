I totally understand why some fans were disappointed. I was a chairman of the Women’s World Cup, so I totally understand that. But by the time the error was kind of brought out, it was very difficult for many, many reasons to just even move one day. And we tried</p>

  <p><b>[Canada captain Christine Sinclair has become the record goalscorer in international football history]</b> Congratulations to Christine for this incredible achievement. It is an amazing feat and she deserves all the credit and accolades she will rightly receive. To play elite international football for 20 years at the very top level - in multiple World Cups, Olympic Games and Concacaf Women’s Championships - is remarkable in itself. To have scored an all-time international record goal haul, and to still be going strong, is truly outstanding.<br /><br />Christine’s achievements have made her an icon in Canada. She transcends the sport and is a wonderful role model for people across the country. I hope she continues leading the line for the national team and scoring goals, and I thank her for the enormous contribution she has made to the sport in Canada, the Concacaf region and across the world</p>

  <p><b>[Concacaf president Victor Montagliani says that the federation will most likely need to change its World Cup qualifying format as a result of the coronavirus pandemic]</b> I think we’re also looking at the balance of possibilities and probabilities and if this calendar is going to change, how is it going to change and how will it affect the format of World Cup qualifying, which in likelihood will happen<br /><br />That, to be honest, brings in a snippet of an integrity issue when teams haven’t been able to play. What we’re committed to is ensuring the format, whatever the format will be, has to fit into what the new calendar is going to look like and also be done from a sporting standpoint<br /><br />We may have to look at reformatting what this looks like-whether this is a Hexagonal or some other shape that is part of a kid’s block set. What we don’t know is what this thing will look like<br /><br />It has brought our confederation together. It has brought the confederation alive, and it would be irresponsible for us not to finish it off. We’re committed to that. It’s not the hardest thing to fit into the calendar. It’s only two match days. We’re committed to all our competitions</p>
