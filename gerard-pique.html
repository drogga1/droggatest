  <p><b>[Gerard Pique on <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s tactics]</b> We’ve had a number of years with homegrown coaches, first Pep and then Tito. We occasionally tended to exaggerate our possession-based style of play to the point where we were slaves of our own philosophy. Now we have Tata as our coach, who has the same football philosophy but also has other alternatives, and that is a very positive thing in my opinion. If you are under pressure, there’s nothing wrong with a long ball every now and then. That changes the game and could give you some rest and oxygen. You have to keep improving and developing in football or you will become predictable</p>

Then two more came very quickly and it looked too much like what happened a year ago. Surely it was a mental block, but football was also missing.

But I have the feeling that it’s an important missed opportunity <b>[for Barcelona]</b><br /><br /><b>[Real now move one point ahead of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in the league standings]</b> We still have a margin of improvement and it is enough for us to win <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> if we do things well until the end of the season - but we have to do them well. Whenever you lose <b>[at the Bernabeu]</b>, you get hurt. Because of the importance of the game, the points <b>[…]</b> If we won, it was an important step. We have to focus on improving, especially on our second half performance</p>

  <p><b>[Gerard Pique has defended <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> assistant Eder Sarabia for his foul-mouthed rant in El Clasico]</b> The assistant coach is full of adrenaline and intensity which manifested itself in this way at the Bernabeu, but it is all completely normal for us. All the players discussed it in the dressing room. The boss apologised and we told him that nothing had come from us; if anything it <b>[the controversy]</b> related to the image of the club. What’s more, we like that there’s intensity in the dugout and they are living <b>[the game]</b> too. When the club is weak, these types of things come up. A few weeks ago, the talk was about the players not having a huddle before the game because of the change of coach, then it was the warm-up was different. It’s the same thing. It’s another story that happens after a defeat and you always have to go out and deny it. <b>[Sarabia’s behaviour]</b> is completely normal<br /><br />We knew it was going to be very tough because we are coming from the defeat at the Bernabeu and they are having an exceptional season and they’ve reached the final of the Copa. It wasn’t going to be easy; they play good football, we try to, and the game was decided by the small details. Some hands inside the penalty area have given us the three very important points that are going to help us fight for the title</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona star Pique believes June 12 is too soon for <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> return]</b> I would like it <b>[the season resuming]</b> to be June 12, but it will depend on the numbers.
