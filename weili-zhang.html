  <p>For Joanna Jedrzejczyk, I don’t think she’s the fighter she used to be, I’m not very interested. She needs me more than I need her and she is struggling in the division to fight me, but I don’t know if I will give her the chance. I want to fight the best, I think maybe Rose Namajunas is a good <b>[choice]</b><br /><br />If I had the chance I’d like to go up a weight class and fight the best and right now I think Valentina Shevchenko is one of the best female fighters</p>
