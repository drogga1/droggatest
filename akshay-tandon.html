  <p><b>[Mandar Rao Dessai signs for FC Goa]</b> We are delighted to have been able to agree terms with Laxmikanth Kattimani and Mandar Rao Dessai. Both of them have defended the club’s crest since its inception and we couldn’t be happier that they will continue to do so for a further three years. Both of them have been vital pieces of the jigsaw in the past seasons and we expect them to continue in the same vein.</p>

  <p><b>[Led by President Akshay Tandon, FC Goa laying a solid grassroots framework]</b> We already have the entire grassroots team up and running. We have 16 centres - eight in the north <b>[Goa]</b>, eight in the south <b>[Goa]</b>. We have about 12 full-time coaches who are a part of this and there are an additional 30-to-40 coaches working on a part-time basis who have other jobs like PE <b>[Physical Education]</b> teachers or other coaching jobs.<br /><br />This year is all about strengthening the existing programme, for which we are talking to a lot of schools and their Principals. Our primary focus for this year is to ensure that the kids who have signed up for our grassroots programme are attending on a regular basis, their coaching is regular and are not interrupted. That’s already happening from the age groups of six to 13<br /><br />To compliment the coaching from what is done elsewhere in India and also in Goa, while there are tournaments and leagues that exist for U-13 and above, there isn’t much for six to 13. So last year, we piloted two leagues - one U-10 and one U-12. They were very successful. We had engagements from over 64 schools.<br /><br />There was also a very good participation from the parents which is also very important. So this year we are planning on eight leagues which should kick-off by October. The idea is not to do numbers but to improve on the quality of coaching and the kind of competition we are giving the kids.<br /><br />We already have U-13, U-15 and U-18 squads who have professional coaches who conduct three sessions <b>[per week]</b>. Again, we want to ensure about the quality and that the sessions are more regular. We used to have a squad of 35 in these age bracket squads last year, but this year we are reducing that to 25 in order to focus on really developing those who are selected.<br /><br />Right now, we have taken the Chowgule University ground on lease for our entire youth program - from the U-13s till the U-23s. For the U-18s till the U-23s we have taken up three apartments very close to the grounds which is going to function as the residential for the outstation as well as the entire squad from morning till evening so that we can control their diet, rest and environment a little more.<br /><br />We have also created a makeshift residential facility for our developmental squad which was part of Derrick Pereira’s agenda but we are going to have the residential facility for our developmental squad only for this year depending on how our program and how our conversation with the government goes. We are going to make provisions for our own residential facilities in the next six months or so<br /><br />Right now, this entire training program is entirely free. We don’t charge anything for any of our grassroots programmes or even any of the leagues that we conduct.<br /><br />We are looking for brand partners to help in our existing programmes first and once we feel that we have a strong programme for the best football players across the state, we are also going to be looking at deploying paid programmes for coaching like the football school models that are held all over the world</p>
