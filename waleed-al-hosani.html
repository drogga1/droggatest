  <p><b>[Acting CEO of the UAE Pro League Committee, Mr. Waleed Al Hosani believes hosting the competition in Egypt for the second year in a row is a testament to the strong ties between the two countries, highlighting the fact that UAE have hosted the Egyptian Super Cup twice as well]</b> The PLC aims to achieve several objectives by holding the Arabian Gulf Super Cup outside the country. Expanding the fan base of UAE football abroad, providing a platform for Emirati teams and players to showcase their skills abroad to reflect the progress of UAE football. These matches also contribute to attracting larger numbers of football fans in Egypt to learn more about UAE football and follow the PLC competitions.</p>
