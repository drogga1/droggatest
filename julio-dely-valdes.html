<blockquote>
  <p><b>[England captain Harry Kane has been labelled a complete player]</b> In recent years he has been one of the strikers who has the most impressive statistics in Europe. He scored a lot, we know it. Kane is a reference point in his position in the world because his role was also very important in the game, in addition to scoring a lot of goals. He is a key player in England’s selection, and Panama will have to be vigilant against him. He is very efficient, realistic, powerful. Technically and physically, this is a complete player.<br /><br />I think England will be very competitive. But, paradoxically, the most difficult game to manage may be that of Tunisia because it will be the last. This game, we’ll have to play it! All these teams are strong with their different characteristics. They all have better experience than we do at a World Cup. But each game is a different story. In the end it is really necessary to approach each match individually, to do things in the right order and take it a match at a time<br /><br />Players from the current national team do not play in the major European countries, but there are players who play in smaller leagues. One player has an important role and who can be noticed in this World Cup is Jaime Penedo, the goalkeeper. He has a lot of experience, a big motivation, many games behind him with the national team. Then there is Roman Torres, defender and captain of the team. He will be a leader in this World Cup for Panama. We have experienced players. We must now find a complement with the youngest players</p>
