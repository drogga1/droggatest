  <p><b>[After five and a half years in the first team, <a href="davy-klaassen.html">Davy Klaassen</a> looks ready for a move away, and according to club legend Sjaak Swart, he should be aiming high]</b> He can play for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. At the moment, he would definitely succeed at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> as well. There are a lot of clubs suitable for <a href="davy-klaassen.html">Klaassen</a>, in Germany too. I think <b>[he would cost]</b> somewhere between €20-25 million</p>

  <p><b>[Sjaak Swart says Ajax midfielder Donny van de Beek will only leave the club for one of Europe’s top teams]</b> Donny fits a club where attacking footbal is played. Then he is at his best. At Ajax he has that. But eventually every top footballer wants to know where his ceiling his. I don’t see Donny leaving Ajax for just any club abroad. He is not the type who chooses based on money. Donny knows what he has in Amsterdam and he wouldn’t swap that for something less in a sporting sense. If he ever leaves Ajax, in my eyes it must be to go to an absolute top club.</p>

  <p><b>[Club legend Sjaak Swart says Luis Suarez will return to Ajax FC one day if he gets his way]</b> I think he really wants to go back to Ajax. Already? Well, maybe. He really will come back to Ajax, but I don’t know when. There are certain players who would like to return to Ajax. Think of Frank Rijkaard and Jari Litmanen.<br /><br /><b>[His is the place presumably most at risk from a potential return for Neymar. At Ajax, though, Swart thinks he could prove a top-class replacement for young forward Kasper Dolberg, who has been linked with Hoffenheim and Nice]</b> Dolberg is gone. I think he’s sold. I don’t know where he is going, but that’s what I’m told<br /><br /><b>[But with Real Madrid having their eyes on other targets as well - Neymar for one - Swart says the Spanish giants have cooled their interest in Van de Beek for now]</b> For now I think he will stay with Ajax, they want to keep him. Real Madrid wanted to get him for a certain date, but that is already over. Real was also busy with other things. Every day is different. One day you think something is going to happen and then you hear nothing again for three days</p>
