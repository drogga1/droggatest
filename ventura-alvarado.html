  <p><b>[Ventura Alvarado hoping breakout season captaining Necaxa can lead to USMNT return]</b> I’ve matured a lot. I’m thankful for everything that has happened, everything I’ve experienced in football and in life. I’ve matured, and now I’m captain and get to show that maturity. For me, it’s really important. I didn’t stay in the same place. I’ve kept getting better - on the field getting the details better - mentally and as a person as well. That’s why I earned the captain role. I’m in a good place that I have to take advantage of as well.<br /><br />Right now, I’m 100 percent focused on Necaxa. Maybe that’s why it’s been sort of good for me that they haven’t called me up. Sometimes they call you and you play and you don’t get any rest or anything. Now that I’ve solidified my place with Necaxa, it’d be really good to go to the national team, take advantage of the starting role I’ve had here. With the Liguilla ending (before the Gold Cup), I’d like another opportunity<br /><br /><b>[Rayados bring a host of problems for defenders, with players like forward Rogelio Funes Mori, attacking midfielder Rodolfo Pizarro, and wingers Dorlan Pabon and Aviles Hurtado who make life hell for defenders]</b> Obviously they have a lot of good players, a lot of names, a lot of really talented players. The best thing we can do is to play as a team. Defend as a team, attack as a team. I think our strength is that we have more hunger than them, more desire to get out of the tie. That’s going to help us. We’re always going to go out and play how we want to play. We’re not going to change if we play against whoever, Leon, Tigres, America, Cruz Azul, we’re going to play the same. It’s the only way we know how to play, I think, and it’s taken us to the Liguilla. We’re not going to change anything. If we win, it’s because we played as a team. That’s the only way<br /><br />It’s not easy to get to the Liguilla. It’s not easy to be here. A really difficult game is coming, and I have to keep taking advantage of that, getting rhythm. Playing against the champion of Concacaf is a chance to show what I’ve done. The season has been good. I’ve made some mistakes here and there but showing up and paying well, that shows the strength and attitude, the strong mentality. Any other player, or other people things like that happen to, they might fall down, but I’m ready for whatever challenge and whatever might come</p>
