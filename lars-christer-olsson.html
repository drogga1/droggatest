<blockquote>
  <p><b>[European Leagues boss: Top-four leagues should lose one automatic Champions League place]</b> Giving four fixed positions to top associations should be questioned because that closes the opportunities for others. It would be better to have three fixed places for the highest-ranked countries with the fourth having to qualify through a play-offs. I think the big leagues would be fine if they are all treated in the same way. They are prepared to participate in this discussion. Clubs should not have an advantage because of what they have done in the past. Neither do I think the big leagues - England, Spain, Italy and Germany - should have four teams who go straight into the group stages because it limits the opportunities for teams from other countries<br /><br />The historical coefficient should be scrapped completely, absolutely. It should be replaced. We need to look at financial distribution as a whole and our message is that the solidarity payments, to the smaller clubs and countries, has to increase. Up to 25 per cent of the money has to go to them</p>
