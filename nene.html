  <p><b>[Neymar can lead Paris Saint-Germain to Champions League success in his first season in France]</b> Neymar is a real buddy, and seeing him in my old team with my old jersey is fantastic. We talked a lot before he signed. I weighed the pros and cons, but I told him that Paris was the best choice for him. This is where he can become the best player in the world, where he can write the story. Paris has never won the Champions League and it is a challenge. Not much was missing from the last two or three years. Last season they beat Barca 4-0! With the contribution of Dani Alves and Neymar, it is quite doable. I even think they can win it this year. I’m really glad Neymar made that choice, he will not regret it<br /><br />I went back home on holiday to Angra dos Reis <b>[near Rio de Janeiro]</b>. He <b>[Neymar]</b> has a house by the sea. He can’t go out of his house, otherwise it is madness, so he has to stay locked up a bit. But we had fun, we played basketball, football, video games. It was at this time that he was in full doubt and that he was hesitating between Paris and Barca. Afterwards, when he returned to Barcelona, it was difficult. Lionel Messi, Gerard Pique, Luis Suarez, the leadership, everyone put pressure on him to stay<br /><br />It was not easy to manage, you have to put yourself in his place. He had doubts and that’s normal, but he was brave. I think he managed it well, thanks to his father. It was he who had a headache with this transfer. Neymar stayed cool with it. He has not lost his love of live or football<br /><br />It’s not Neymar’s fault that his transfer was so costly. I think every player is happy with the salary he is getting and no one is going to be jealous of Neymar’s salary. He deserves what he earns. He is the future best player in the world. In addition, he is cool with it, he is simple with everyone, so there will be no worry<br /><br /><b>[On Neymar taking the No. 10 jersey at PSG]</b> He did not know whether to ask the 10 or 11. But I said: ‘You’re crazy, you have to take 10!’ We played the video game Counter-Strike together and we talked about that. I wanted to see him in the No.10, not 11. We must also thank Javier Pastore for giving up his number</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar was stressed by his penalty argument with Edinson Cavani at Paris Saint-Germain but will see his patience rewarded]</b> Neymar has never told me that he is disappointed by the treatment he receives in France - he has never said anything like that to me. For sure, he perhaps expected a few things to be easier than they are in reality but this is football – we cannot predict everything. Everybody in his entourage knew that he was going to need to adapt. After all, it is a new challenge. At the start, patience is required. Of course, there have been a few moments that have been less than enjoyable.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether the Cavani incident had impacted on Neymar]</b> Yes, perhaps he was a little stressed because of that<br /><br />I gave him my opinion. I explained to him about the city, the club and the infrastructure. I told him that he would have nothing to regret in leaving Barcelona. With Barca, he had won everything, so I said: ‘Imagine you go to Paris for a new challenge, with the same structures that you have in Barcelona and maybe better. On top of that, you will have a great team, it is a beautiful city, you will have everything that you want and you will be their great player - the star of the team. If you win a Champions League with PSG, it will be worth 100 times more than if you do it again with Barca’</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar backed to rewrite PSG history by Nene]</b> It’s great to see a player like him here in Paris. In addition to being a great footballer, he’s also an incredible person. We’re very good friends him and I. He’s a man with heart, a great competitor. He wants to play every game, do his best each time, we’re similar in that way. He’s a player of unique potential. I’m really happy for him that he’s here to exploit that potential, and I hope he’ll mark the history of the club too.<br /><br />I’m proud to be part of this love story between Paris and Brazil. It’s like a marriage, an alliance between the two. The two countries are very different, the people, the relationships between people. But the fans here, especially in Paris, like good football and a show. They’re fans who love and know football. And we Brazilians like to put on a show. I think we’re made for each other</p>
