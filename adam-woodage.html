<blockquote>
  <p><b>[How British football coaches are being hit hard by coronavirus crisis]</b> GKs is an area where more private for-profit coaching is offered. There is an increase in outfield coaching doing the same but for goalkeeping, a lot of players don’t get this specific training in their grassroots environment so it has hit goalkeeping harder because of the number of GK coaches out there.<br /><br />It will be different for outfield coaching places too but they often have a large franchise behind them whereas these are small businesses. The coach of a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> goalkeeper is still working right now to ensure his club is in the best position to hit the ground running when the league returns.<br /><br />However, beneath that, these people might be on temporary contracts within an academy, or they are independent business people running training at the grassroots level or development level. They are going to be hit very hard by this because that’s the kind of income that is lost when activities cease.<br /><br />They also don’t have the backing and support of a big club to keep the income in. They are in a very difficult situation. The top professional goalkeepers might have lost some supplementary income with things they do on the side but that doesn’t compare to grassroots where people have lost almost all their income</p>
