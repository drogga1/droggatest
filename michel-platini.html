They have spent more than they have earned in the past and haven’t paid their debts. We don’t want to kill or hurt the clubs; on the contrary, we want to help them in the market. The teams who play in our tournaments have unanimously agreed to our principles … living within your means is the basis of accounting but it hasn’t been the basis of football for years now. The owners are asking for rules because they can’t implement them themselves - many of them have had it with shovelling money into clubs and the more money you put into clubs, the harder it is to sell at a profit.</p>

His counsel, Mr. William Bourdon, strongly affirms that this is in no way an arrest, but a hearing as a witness in the context desired by investigators, a framework that prevents all persons heard, then confronted, cannot confer outside the procedure.<br /><br />Michel Platini spoke calmly and precisely, answered all questions, including those about the bidding process of the Euro 2016, and provided useful explanations.

I created the EURO to happen in 13 different countries at once because that will allow a lot of teams to host it, to create stadia and win something, and then the Arabic world has lost bids 5 or 6 times for the tournament itself. And so at a certain point, for the development of football, it is fantastic for it to go to the Middle East. I asked for two things.
