<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Ghana’s Fabin Samuel - Miss chances and get punished]</b> I think the last time we trained; we had a good scoring session. Maybe we need to keep working. If you have seen this game, we could have won by a wider margin. We had so many chances. If you miss chances, you get punished.<br /><br /><b>[On Abdul Yusuf]</b> He has been sent to hospital because he lost consciousness. He has been sent for a proper medical check-up<br /><br /><b>[On being asked if the heat and humidity was a factor]</b> Maybe it has an effect but then we have trained physically. We are very strong except that you get the advantage and don’t take your chances, then you lose the match like we did.<br /><br />We have to beat India and qualify. Now it’s critical that we need to win to get the qualification ticket. We will work more on goal scoring. We create opportunities but don’t take them. Once we get it right, the goals will flow.</p>
