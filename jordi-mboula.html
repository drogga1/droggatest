<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Jordi Mboula looked around and saw nothing but space]</b> I think I play to have fun and maybe that makes me score goals like this. I don’t only want to play well, but also put on a show. I just did my job against St Polten. I found myself in a lot of space. I’m very confident with my pace. It was a great goal and thanks to social media it has been seen all over the world. If it had been a ‘normal goal’ it would have also counted, so I’m just happy to score<br /><br />I came here because it’s a club that relies on young players and is getting the most of each of them, as we have seen. It was simply the sporting project offered here that captivated me and also the coach, Leonardo Jardim, who I have heard very good things about and he can get the most out of youngsters<br /><br />I think I’m ready to play at a big European club and I think Monaco isn’t an ordinary one. It’s one that fits my characteristics, has shown that it relies on young players and helps them reach their maximum potential</p>
