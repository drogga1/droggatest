  <p><b>[Why Arsenal fans should be protesting against Kroenke]</b> Arsene Wenger is just an unbelievable manager. I think he’s a tremendous person and he is just as good as there is. You can’t judge a manager on one game or on one stretch of games. You judge him over time</p>

  <p><b>[Andrew Grant, a supporter of the Rams, told that Kroenke’s motivations should be questioned. He believes that the lies that saw the Rams move from St. Louis to LA in 2016 provide enough evidence to show that Kroenke doesn’t care for the team’s supporters]</b> I don’t know about much of the rest of the country but in St. Louis, we hate him. Right after he moved the Rams to LA people were chanting ‘Kroenke sucks’ when the owners of our other sports franchises made a public appearance together.<br /><br />Kroenke never talking to the media isn’t necessarily bad, but to not talk to the local media <b>[in St. Louis]</b> for four years and then move our team kind of sucks. I don’t think many fans actually care about seeing their team’s owner on TV. I think he knows that by being less visible, people end up blaming the managers and coaches for losing instead of him<br /><br />I think it’s pretty clear to see that Kroenke doesn’t care about winning. The Avalanche are having the worst season in NHL history, the Nuggets are consistently below .500 <b>[win percentage]</b>, and the Rams are a model franchise for futility. All of his teams have been bad for the last five-plus years and I don’t think that’s going to change. His only motive is profit, and the way he moved the Rams out of St. Louis shows that he is willing to go through the fans to get what he wants.<br /><br />At his first press conference after he became the majority owner of the Rams, he vowed to keep them in St. Louis, even though his plan to move them to LA was already in action. He lied to his hometown for years to make some extra money, which is pretty terrible, especially when you’re already a billionaire. My advice to Arsenal fans: hold on tight. I know he doesn’t talk to the public a lot, but whenever he does, remember his long history of lying to local markets. With his legendary mismanagement of on-field products, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Arsenal near the bottom of the table in a few years. But at least he can’t threaten to move them to California!</p>

  <p><b>[Former Rams cornerback Janoris Jenkins told that he was always discouraged from speaking to Kroenke and admitted that it influenced his decision to leave for the New York Giants]</b> It was always the coaches - not the owners - coming around to see the players. It was always, ‘Don’t speak to Stan Kroenke’ when I was in St. Louis. But here, in New York, everybody is everybody, everybody is treated the same. The owner just walks around and communicates with you and gives you a reason to play football. You know that you’re playing for someone that is always around and always cares, someone that you can communicate with.<br /><br />At the Rams, I felt I was just playing for my team-mates and my coaches. They said, ‘If you ever see Stan come around the facility, don’t speak to him’. Once I heard that during my rookie year, I just knew I wasn’t going to be comfortable because when he came around it was like everybody better be straightforward, nobody better look at him! It was kind of crazy</p>

  <p><b>[Arsene Wenger is the best man to win the Premier League title at Arsenal]</b> Our ambition is to win the Premier League and other major trophies in Europe. It’s what the fans, players, staff, manager and board expect and we won’t rest until that is achieved. Arsene is the best person to help us make that happen. He has a fantastic track record and has our full backing.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke faces a backlash from animal rights activists over a controversial new app launched in the United Kingdom. Simon Barr said]</b> MOTV will present ethical, fair chase hunting and as long as it’s legal it will be on there. I’m sure people won’t like all the content on MOTV, but it won’t be censored. On every film there’s an explanation of what hunting does for conservation and the local community.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke faces a backlash from animal rights activists over a controversial new app launched in the United Kingdom. Philippa King, CEO of the League Against Cruel Sports, hit back]</b> We’re living in a world now where most people can see how brutal and shameful trophy hunting is, yet the Arsenal boss is choosing to launch his sick TV channel in the UK. I’m not sure in what way an idiot with a gun against an elephant is a fair chase. Mr Kroenke could do the world a great favour by stopping peddling this kind of sickening TV and turning his focus on helping animals he apparently likes to see killed</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke has reacted to criticism of a controversial hunting channel by asking for all bloodsport content to be removed. Jim Liberatore said]</b> Outdoor Sportsman Group is dedicated to serving audiences around the world interested in the outdoors. In the past few days, there has been significant public attention to a small portion of programming on our MyOutdoorTV app that contains content associated with hunting certain big game animals. While many on both sides of this issue have made their voices heard, and this content is only available through paid subscriptions, Stan Kroenke has directed us to remove all content related to those animals in light of the public interest.</p>

  <p><b>[Jim Liberatore went on to distance the channel and its content from Arsenal]</b> Outdoor Sportsman Group properties operate independently from unrelated companies that our parent owns - as do all of the parent’s other business and sports interests.<br /><br />Arsenal Football Club has nothing to do with any of our media outlets. It has nothing to do with our content or the editorial decisions we make. We deserve no credit when an Arsenal striker scores a goal. Arsenal deserves no criticism when we offer a program with which some disagree.<br /><br />Second, we have made our content decisions independently of our parent company. Our parent had no input into these past decisions, and they have none now.<br /><br />All those who value the freedom of media outlets to set their own editorial courses should both recognize and respect this. We are grateful that our parent gives us this freedom.<br /><br />Even so, in this one instance, Mr. Kroenke directed us to make the changes explained above. He has a decades-long track record of environmental stewardship, working with conservationists, hydrologists, microbiologists, and others to responsibly manage habitat and enhance wildlife preservation.<br /><br />We also take conservation seriously, and dedicate programming to this issue and to anti-poaching efforts specifically.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke believes giving in to pressure to fire Arsene Wenger would have been an easy move to make]</b> Arsene is strong, he’s focused and I think he showed through all that. We always evaluate, and it’s fair to look at all the factors involved. But when you make decisions like that, you are weighing lots of different factors, but you hope that you weigh them correctly and come out with the right decision. I think we did.<br /><br />It’s easy to change coaches and people do it all the time. But the hardest thing is to replicate success and remain competitive. You have to approach it with clear-headedness, calmness, thinking for the long term rather than the short-term. An easy answer is it’s easy to do something. It’s harder not to do something<br /><br />I think both sides have to get comfortable as they move forward. It takes both sides, not just us. I’m sure he was thinking through if he wants to go on. If I see anything, then I think he is more focused than ever - when I’m around him. Focused on winning. I really think I do see that more than ever. He wants to win these things. He’s really focused and really smart, he wants to win the things we are talking about. We have dealt with this a lot in different organisations and we just think that Arsene is doing a great job and he’s the right guy. We have a lot of respect for Arsene - we are not going to be pushy about things. I think he treated us with respect as well and always has. We feel really strongly about Arsene</p>

  <p><b>[Arsene Wenger has announced that he will stand down as Arsenal manager at the end of the season]</b> This is one of the most difficult days we have ever had in all our years in sport. One of the main reasons we got involved with Arsenal was because of what Arsene has brought to the club on and off the pitch. His longevity and consistency over such a sustained period at the highest level of the game will never be matched. Arsene has unparalleled class and we will always be grateful to him. Everyone who loves Arsenal and everyone who loves football owes him a debt of gratitude. Three Premier League titles, including an entire season unbeaten, seven FA Cup triumphs and 20 successive years in the Champions League is an exceptional record. He has also transformed the identity of our club and of English football with his vision for how the game can be played.<br /><br />We have high ambitions to build on Arsene’s remarkable tenure and to honour his vision by ensuring that Arsenal competes for and wins the biggest and most important prizes in the game. We must now focus on making a strong finish to the season and ask our millions of fans around the world to join us in paying appropriate tribute to one of the greats of Arsenal’s history and one of the greats of the game</p>
