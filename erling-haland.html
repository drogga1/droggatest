  <p><b>[Haaland full of praise for ‘fascinating’ <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> team-mate Gio Reyna]</b> He’s 17-and-a-half soon, so at such a young age to be so calm on the ball and play for such a big team, it’s very fascinating to see how calm he is and he doesn’t care about anything, he just jumps right into it.

So, yeah, that’s what I try to do the most. I feel I’m improving every day and now that I play with even better teammates than what I played with in Salzburg - all respect to Salzburg - but yeah, they can find me in even better situations and this, so yeah it’s been good.

  <p><b>[Haaland unfazed by Bayern’s World Cup-winning defenders ahead of crucial Klassiker]</b> No <b>[pressure doesn’t bother me]</b>. I like to play these games and that’s what I like the most, to be honest. I’m looking forward to a game against a very good Bayern side. I try to be as calm as possible and not think too much about the game. They have World Cup winners, but we also have that. I know we have a good team, but Bayern also have a good team, so it will be an interesting game. I see every team-mate every day in training and I see how good they actually are and it’s all about getting that out as a team to achieve our goals, so I’m looking forward to the game.<br /><br />First of all is to try to play our best as a team because I know how much quality we have in the team. When we show that, we create chances and play like a fantastic team. For me, my job is to score goals, of course. You’ve seen in the last few games that not only I score, but so do the full-backs and midfielders. Everyone can score and that’s something good that we have in our team.</p>

We had some chances and they also had chances, so I don’t want to say we were lucky but three points is very nice.
