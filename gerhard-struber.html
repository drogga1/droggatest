  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> star’s ‘technical skills’ talked up by ex-Salzburg coach]</b> I think he’ll be a very, very big advantage for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. His style is very close to the style of what <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> play. The difficult thing is he’s top in one-on-one situations for dribbling and he’s also good in combinations. I think it’s a very big task for every defender. I think the only solution we had was to give him no space and no time. And maybe foul at the right time!<br /><br />He’s a human with a big heart. I think he also has very, very big technical skills. In the opponent’s box, he has a big nose for goals. He has the technical skills in both feet. He can break the rhythm in a game in the offence.<br /><br />He can lure the opponent and on the next step he can break the rhythm in the next level with the tempo of the pass and his speed<br /><br /><b>[The Japanese star will have the opportunity to add to his trophy haul with the reigning European and World champions, who are on course for more silverware come May]</b> It’s not a new world for him. I think now he plays with players that are the best in the world. For him, this is the moment to get the next step. This is a big motivation for him to work with these types of colleagues now.<br /><br />I think he’s a very calm person. He always will learn, he’s very straight with his individual aims. He works very hard every day. He had always questioned what can he do to grow up.</p>

  <p><b>[Barnsley slipped to the bottom of Championship table after a 0-0 draw with Millwall that did little to help their survival chances]</b> We have no influence over other results. We have seven games for our chance, if we bring the same performance like today and a good style in transition then it will be difficult for the next opponent. Seven games and we have to pick up points. There is no time to cry, we have created a good mood<br /><br />I am happy with the performance, I am happy with the point. Hopefully the results from the other teams are kind for us. It is not in our hands. We have many games for a chance. This gives everyone a good feeling. My boys did a very good job with a high focus but what we need is more control of the ball so we find more chances. Today was difficult, but we also had a big chance through Jacob Brown. It is 0-0, one point. I hope we can pick enough points in the future</p>

  <p><b>[Conor Chaplin answered Barnsley’s prayers as he came off the bench to score in a 2-0 win over <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> that does wonders for his side’s survival hopes]</b> It gives my boys a good feeling. But we have the same situation like before, we stay in the relegation zone. The only change is a very good mindset, now is the right time to climb out of the relegation zone. It is a very good situation, three games, three clean sheets and also points. It is a massive impact for my boys in our belief. We don’t always talk about our belief, in the end we can still stay in the league. We have a chance to stay in the league. It is what we need, today is the next step. I am happy at the moment. We stay in the relegation zone at the moment, we have to bring these performances in the next games and teams will find it difficult against us</p>

  <p><b>[Stoke climbed out of the relegation zone after a thumping 4-0 win over fellow strugglers Barnsley]</b> When they got the second goal we lost our plan and it affected the mindset of the players. Stoke had a big advantage and we were not clear and ready at this moment. We were not ready to fight against this massive opponent</p>

  <p><b>[A late goal by Barnsley substitute Aapo Halme saw the Tykes salvage an important point at Luton in the battle of the Championship’s bottom two teams]</b> I told my boys in the dressing room, we have to fight until the last game. We have to pick up points, today our big goal was three points, but we got one point and our next game is a difficult opposition, but if we have this performance, we can do it. I think the boys showed me, we never gave up, we had very good energy from everyone. The first half was completely in our hands and this is the right mood in this situation, never give up, fight until the last game. Today we’re disappointed that we didn’t use the best chances for us, but still it’s one point</p>

  <p><b>[A stalemate at Oakwell kept Barnsley at the foot of the Championship table on paper and Wigan effectively bottom once their 12-point penalty is applied]</b> A stalemate at Oakwell kept Barnsley at the foot of the Championship table on paper and Wigan effectively bottom once their 12-point penalty is applied. In our situation we need points and today it was possible to pick up three points. This is disappointing but we are looking forward and we will see until the last game if we will stay in the league</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> moved to within a point of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> after scraping past Barnsley 1-0 on Thursday]</b> The last few weeks we played very well in every game and have had a good spirit, attitude and created chances. But we can’t use our chances at the moment and it’s a frustrating and disappointing moment for me and my boys. The mood in the dressing room is down. We played very well against <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>, a big, big opponent, and in the second half we didn’t play like a relegated team. This is hard at the moment. It’s painful</p>
