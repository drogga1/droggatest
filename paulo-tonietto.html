  <p><b>[Paulo Tonietto says <a href="thiago-silva.html">Thiago Silva</a> could return to Milan from <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>]</b> In football everything is possible, but we have to wait to see what will happen because of the pandemic. He has a great admiration for Milan, the years he spent there marked his career. He knows about the great affection the fans have for him.<br /><br />I hope so. We will discuss it soon. The idea is to stay at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> and continue to grow the club. The eight years I have already spent can weigh in the balance. I think I have played a part in the development of the club. Today, after eight years here, with the passport in my pocket, I feel French. I’m proud of it. Paris is a part of my life. Paris is in my story. Nobody can take it away. I feel French, beyond the passport. Today, I’m Brazilian, born in Rio de Janeiro, but my second home is Paris. Nobody can change that. I’ll be Parisian for life<br /><br /><b>[However, two months after that, agent Tonietto confirmed that no contract offer had yet been made by <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>]</b> No, at the moment there are no negotiations with <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>. He has already received offers <b>[from outside the club]</b>, but I will not talk about other clubs because Thiago’s priority is to stay at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. Football is very dynamic. But at the moment the priority is <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. We will wait for <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>.
