  <p><b>[How many occasions has Guillermo Ochoa been there for Mexico now? El Tri needed him to get through, with Ochoa diving to deny a kick from the spot from Keysher Fuller. That gave Mexico the 5-4 win in penalties]</b> That’s how these types of games are. We’re playing against an opponent that also is a candidate to be in the final, that has grown a lot and that has good players. We knew it was going to be a very intense game. Always in the calculus, you think you’ll play Costa Rica later, not now.<br /><br />The credit goes to everyone. My teammates also took the kicks really well and at the end I was happy to save one and help the team</p>

  <p><b>[Guillermo Ochoa Santos believe Mexico can do better after the 4-0 loss to Argentina]</b> It’s a friendly. You have to keep going and lift your head. The work we’ve been doing has been good, but we have to correct a lot of things, stay together as a team. In moments like this, we have to move forward and stay united</p>

  <p><b>[The Mexico national team center back had a horrendous showing against Argentina where <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a> put three goals past El Tri in a 4-0 Argentina romp Tuesday night]</b> It’s difficult. I had to keep my mind clear after that first half. We started well, maybe in the first 10 minutes, after that there were the errors and the goals they scored against us. They had the fluidity they needed and we were a bit fragile in the defensive zone</p>
