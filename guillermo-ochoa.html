  <p><b>[Mexico expecting resolute Costa Rica]</b> The past Hex was as complicated as this one and the ones before that. There are no simple games or easy matches at home or on the road. In the past Hex, we let a lot of points go at home where opponents always play us in the same way, playing back, waiting for us looking for an error to counterattack.</p>

  <p><b>[Should Mexico get out of the group, a rematch with Chile or a contest with reigning world champion Germany could await]</b> These are opponents we’d like to face. Of course as a soccer player you’re always looking to have this type of clash every weekend with your clubs, but now with the national team having the chance to do it in official competition is great and we have to take advantage of it. The Confederations Cup is an important tournament for Mexico, ahead of the World Cup, and we’re here to try and win it.</p>

  <p><b>[How do you stop a player like Cristiano Ronaldo?]</b> We know the kind of player he is, but aside from him they also have other quality players who we have to neutralize. That’s what’s important, the key. It’s going to be a game of Mexico’s squad against Portugal. It’s going to be a great game with good players on both teams.</p>

  <p><b>[Fortune favors bold Mexico as Confederations Cup path gets easier with Portugal draw]</b> We knew their style was going to be on the counterattack. They were looking for the mistake. They’ve got dangerous players up top who have good timing in the area, but you can’t let them make you nervous. I think at the end of the day, it’s a deserved result because the team played our style, showed our characteristics and played our game.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico goalkeeper Ochoa deserves move to top European team]</b> As a Mexican, as a national team player, I feel proud of my team, of the national team that always showed its face, the way in which the people treated us, the reorganization they’ve given us when they’ve seen Mexico in Russia, and we go with a taste for revenge in our mouths for the World Cup, with the desire to return and do better.<br /><br />I feel in good form, I’m trying to be good every game, to help my teammates when I’m called on to be on the field. Sometimes there are games where things go well for you, others not as much, but that’s how goalkeeping is. You have to be consistent, try to stay regular. Today we leave with our heads high because I think we played a smart game, a game against a tough opponent</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa says Germany’s come-from-behind victory against Sweden on Saturday doesn’t change anything]</b> We hadn’t done any sort of mathematical calculations. We knew that we were going to pay for first place against Swede. This result wasn’t going to change anything.<br /><br />My dream, along with that of my team-mates, is for us to stay here until the very last day. It’s something that I believe in, that I feel, that I’m imagining and that I’m wishing for and nobody here or anywhere else is going to keep me from dreaming in that. It’s worth dreaming when you’re in a tournament like this. Everyone wants to be there on the last day, but I think this national team wants it more than the others</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico players say round of 16 qualification was deserved]</b> Well, we’re not going to forget about those first two games. It’s thanks to those two wins we achieved that we are going to the next round. Before the game, we were the first national team to not be qualified with six points and achieving that means something. In these tournaments, every national team plays for its life. Today wasn’t our best game, that’s clear, but we’re in the round of 16.</p>

  <p><b>[Getting the mentality right]</b> You’re in the World Cup. The mood is still high. The dream is still there. We’re not eliminated, we did advance so you have to be happy about that. Of course, you have to be clear, we’re not happy with today’s result, nobody is, but we’re also happy because we’re in the next round and like I said nobody gave us anything in the first two games. We beat Germany by playing good soccer, and we put the first strike against Germany. It turned out to be one of the toughest groups where anybody could beat anyone else. We’re still here.<br /><br />The mediocre people who never have achieved anything in life will say we passed because of a miracle. Those who have gotten something important in life, we say first goal completed and now it’s time to work and continue getting better to reach our next goal and objective</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa says he would like to return to Spain]</b> With Napoli, it wasn’t because of a personal thing or because I didn’t have the quality. I’m happy about that. The president didn’t want to let me go. He didn’t want to negotiate or respond to Napoli, but when the decision isn’t in your hands, it’s complicated. I’d love to return to the Spanish league, to play in the best leagues, and that’s the idea. Hopefully that change can be made soon.<br /><br />Apart from the result, I’m happy to play in these kinds of tournaments. It’s a challenge and a personal goal to do it, so I’m happy and trying to enjoy it. Hopefully I can enjoy it more going forward with a victory. Today, you face a team like Sevilla, who you know is the favorite, who you know is the one who has to go out to try and win the game. Coming to Spain, here to the Sanchez-Pizjuan always is special, and being in Andalucia as well</p>

  <p><b>[Guillermo Ochoa says he’s not planning on giving up the Mexico No.1 job any time soon]</b> I’m going to make it tough for the guys coming after me. My hope is to be at the next World Cup and to play in the next World Cup. There are young people who are doing well like Lajud and like Hugo that were just called up, and little by little they’ll have to get experience. For my part, of course I have to fight to be there like always, excited and playing and helping them too because you’re not going to be eternal.<br /><br />I think the project still hasn’t started. Despite that, it’s good for the young players to have games and start to understand what it means to play in the senior national team. Hopefully we’ll have a set coach soon and from there it’ll be obvious to see which people we’re going to count on in the future. With the players you have in Europe, plus the players that are in Mexico, you can put together a good national team and a good process from here to the next World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico’s lack of depth will be on display in second game vs. Argentina]</b> We don’t have players like the Argentines or Brazilians that have enough players to make up three national teams. We have, max, 15 or 20 players and you see the national teams of Colombia, Ecuador, Argentina, Brazil, Peru Venezuela, scattered around all over the world and we can’t get to those levels. Those of us in Europe are fighting, trying to make it, sacrificing things, but they say, ‘You don’t play.’ Would you rather they return to Mexico and play, or stay and fight to represent the country well? We all know where the best and most demanding football is and what we have to do to grow.</p>

The supporters are great and I gave everything here for two years. But as a professional football player you are always looking for new challenges at a higher level</p>

We’re playing against an opponent that also is a candidate to be in the final, that has grown a lot and that has good players. We knew it was going to be a very intense game. Always in the calculus, you think you’ll play Costa Rica later, not now.<br /><br />The credit goes to everyone. My teammates also took the kicks really well and at the end I was happy to save one and help the team</p>

I had to keep my mind clear after that first half. We started well, maybe in the first 10 minutes, after that there were the errors and the goals they scored against us. They had the fluidity they needed and we were a bit fragile in the defensive zone</p>
