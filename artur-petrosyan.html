  <p><b>[Meltdown at Anzhi - Eto’o, <a href="willian.html">Willian</a> and Denisov head football’s biggest firesale]</b> Signs of difficulty were building each day at Anzhi. Disappointing results and conflict inside the team affected Kerimov’s faith in the project. When he lost more than $500 million in the market it only got worse.<br /><br />The Uralkali loss did influence his decision but it was not the only factor. Infighting in the dressing room, combined with his recent health problems only further exacerbated the situation.<br /><br />Denisov couldn’t stand the fact Eto’o rules the party and that most foreign players accept this. They had some serious disputes, and the board supported Eto’o and co.<br /><br />Nothing good can come of this. All, or almost all, of Anzhi’s best players will depart during this transfer window. They’ll be building a new team and instead of fighting for the title will probably have to battle for survival in the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[Artur Petrosyan says <a href="henrikh-mkhitaryan.html">Henrikh Mkhitaryan</a> had a problem with <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> manager <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> and is better off at Arsenal]</b> I think Henrikh had a problem with the United coach and at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, it will be another thing and not the same situation. There will not be so much pressure on him defensively. Yes, he <b>[Arsene Wenger]</b> likes them to play better football. I think <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> is better for Henrikh. We are very happy with this transfer from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. His style of play will be better suited at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I only spoke with Miki and I cannot tell you about my talks with Miki because it was between us, but I told you about my impression that I was not happy with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>. I think Henrikh can do very well in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. He can continue in a good mood, in a good way. He is always one of the best players in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but under this manager – <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> – he will become even stronger.<br /><br /><b>[Petrosyan added on a testing period for Mkhitaryan at Old Trafford which saw him win three trophies but endure regular spells out of the team]</b> I think the <b>[Manchester United]</b> fans liked him. I think that means he did something for the club. I am not happy with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>’s decision not to play him, but it is his club, his team - he knows what he wants. It is good he has left.</p>

  <p><b>[The former Gunners playmaker has decided to hang up his boots at the age of 37 in the coming weeks after a rollercoaster career]</b> He was never the most ambitious person. That’s a problem with a lot of Russian players. It’s a problem with their mentality. When they achieve success and earn some good money, they just stop progressing and that’s it for them. That’s what happened with <a href="andrei-arshavin.html">Arshavin</a>.</p>
