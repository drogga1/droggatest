  <p><b>[Santos attacker Yeferson Soteldo ‘dreams’ of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> move]</b> I don’t like rumours, I have my whole family in Venezuela. I want to finish this stage at Santos by December, win the Copa Libertadores and whatever is possible and then take another step. I always dreamed of playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, the dream remains intact. There are many steps to get there, but I feel I can. I want to go to Europe, but not to go and come back. I want to go and pursue my career with greater success. I feel like I’m prepared and I have to wait for the right moment to do it. I’ve been following <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> since I was a child, I saw him at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and that’s why my love and desire to play at Old Trafford. I would choose them easy. I would make a lifetime contract</p>
