  <p><b>[South Melbourne claim terms were agreed with Didier Drogba before a delay in the bid process led the former Chelsea striker to walk away from discussions]</b> We were pretty close. Terms were agreed but where we had difficulty with keeping him interested during the period in which we could not play in the A-League, assuming we are successful in our bid. The bid process is unclear because FFA have not released the criteria for entry. Originally that was going to be in February but I don’t know when that is going to happen for sure. But if we were to get in we couldn’t play until the season after next. Drogba basically said: ‘I like it but what I am going to do in the interim for a year?’. We had everything in place, other than that. It’s a pity that we couldn’t bring him here to join us, but he is too much in demand to sit idly by for a period of time. Drogba’s still at an age where he can compete - and he would have been great at A-League level. And we are still very much in market for a marquee of that kind of stature</p>

  <p><b>[South Melbourne have called on Football Federation Australia not to delay releasing its A-League expansion criteria]</b> We were advised by <b>[FFA CEO David]</b> Gallop and <b>[Head of A-League Greg]</b> O’Rourke that we would have <b>[the expansion criteria]</b> in February. We’re hopeful that will be the case. We are ready. We hope it’s not delayed because we’d like to think that it’s pretty clear what the current lay of the land is, in terms of the clubs that are capable of putting in compelling bids and we think we’re at the top of that, and we don’t think a delay will change that scenario in any meaningful way.<br /><br />I don’t think any other bids coming into the A-League are sustainable unless you’ve got an appropriate stadium deal. We have that and we can make our bid work with 1,500 supporters<br /><br /><b>[Papastergiadis claims the club are continuing to exploit their partnership with Real Madrid]</b> We’re continuing to create the interest and the hype around the club in the absence of the bid criteria being released and the beauty of having a live club is that it’s not difficult to sustain interest in South Melbourne because things are happening continuously. We’re trying to bed down our senior coach in the A-League - Roberto Carlos - so we’ve continued those discussions with him. We’re bedding down the technical development role, the general management role with Chendo, the former games record holder at Real Madrid and the assistant coach there</p>

  <p><b>[Bill Papastergiadis claimed Eric Abrams’ statements are inappropriate and fail to appreciate the context NPL clubs find themselves in]</b> A second division would not reflect the current NPL teams nor the current structure. It would involve a different funding model and a different league with television and sponsorship deals.<br /><br />It’s like buying a car and told you can only drive it in a car park. The lack of promotion and relegation has destroyed the fabric of our football culture. There is no incentive for investment and development</p>

  <p><b>[Bill Papastergiadis conceded his club have made some bold predictions]</b> South is committed to being part of the A-League. As part of this, South is continuing to add to its credentials. Part of this is the continuing discussions South is having with Roberto Carlos to coach South’s A-League team.<br /><br />South has made some bold predictions and it is backing them up with solid facts. The Carlos tour of South is an example of this and our commitment to play in the A-League</p>
