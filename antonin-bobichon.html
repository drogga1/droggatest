<blockquote>
  <p>[Antonin Bobichon has enjoyed a remarkable start to the season with newly-promoted Ligue 1 side Nimes] We lost 4-2 and yet my goal had a lot of resonance. I didn’t think it would bring me so much coverage. The pressure it has brought is not crazy either, I’m not someone who lets everything go to my head. I’ve responded to the requests from the media as they have come.<br /><br />I only played two games as a starter, so the way I’ve started this season must have surprised a lot of people I think. Personally, I didn’t expect it. The absence of others has allowed to me to take my chance. I managed to be decisive and I’m enjoying it.<br /><br />I had a coach, Yannick Dumas, who loved this part of the game. We worked together, even if we didn’t have great facilities when I was younger. Now, we work one or two times a week with [club-mate] Teji Savanier on direct free kicks.</p>
