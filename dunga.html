  <p><b>[Dunga, the latest incumbent, views the whole discussion as a European plot to stop Brazil claiming a sixth world title]</b> If we’re going to start up that debate again over playing pretty football, we’ll probably go another 24 years without winning (the World Cup) which is what the others want. The Europeans will be having a party and we will end up suffering<br /><br /><b>[Dunga has argued it is impossible to play what the Brazilian media refer to as ‘futebol-arte’ (artful football) or ‘Jogo Bonito’ (the Beautiful Game) when other teams simply shut up shop and pack their defence]</b> When you play opponents who close ranks, you have to speed up the game, you misplace passes, you have to be persistent, it’s not easy to play against that sort of team.<br /><br /><b>[Asked about the huge expectations]</b> We always have to win but, even when we win, they (the fans) are not happy because we didn’t put on a show. If we put on a show, they are not happy because we didn’‘t score six or seven goals. If we score six or seven goals, then they say that the opposition was no good<br /><br /><b>[Dunga even believes the 1970 team has been flattered by television]</b> When they show highlights from 1970, all you see are the good parts. If we take the current Brazilian team and just show the best bits, fans will think it’s a spectacular team. But today, they show as many negative moments as good ones</p>

  <p><b>[Dunga on <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>]</b> <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is a benchmark in Brazilian and world football. It is logical that he likes to compete and he likes to win. He is a player who has to be demanded and motivated at all times - he likes that, to be challenged and provoked. He is similar in that way to Romario</p>

  <p><b>[Dunga explains <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>’s performance against Japan]</b> He had the flu, so we gave him more freedom. Usually he has to attack and come back into midfield and mark, but today he stayed up front. So the flu helped him score four goals!</p>

  <p><b>[Dunga on overlooking <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a>]</b> How many times did <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> go into attack at the World Cup? Twenty. How many goals did he score or create? None. How many times were we caught out with balls going over our defenders’ backs? Three or four. You don’t have to be a genius to see what went wrong</p>

  <p><b>[Dunga was asked to compare the pressure on his team in Chile with that of the side he captained to win the 1994 World Cup, Brazil’s first triumph in 24 years]</b> Everything we did was bad <b>[referring to criticism of his 1994 squad]</b> I even think I am an Afro-descendant because I get hit so much. People look at me and think: ‘I’ll have a go at him’<br /><br /><b>[The comments provoked anger on social media, with some calling them racist while others said they acknowledged reality. Dunga later said in a statement published on the website of the <a href="brazilian-fa.html">Brazilian Football Confederation</a>]</b> I want to apologise to all those who could have felt offended with my comment about Afro-descendants. The way I expressed myself does not reflect my feelings or opinions</p>

  <p><b>[Dunga on <a href="adriano.html">Adriano</a>]</b> He is a champion, but he must rediscover his motivation, the right spirit and focus. Inter is like a national team: there are 18 champions in the squad. Every day <a href="adriano.html">Adriano</a> must fight to keep his place</p>

He put <b>[me with him]</b> a true friend, who could speak frankly</p>

  <p><b>[Former Brazil boss Dunga says <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> needs to put wellness before wallet when it comes to choosing between <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>]</b> It’s important that he chooses where he’s going to be happy, where he will enjoy playing. People don’t understand that the Brazilian player is different from the European one. We like to play, to have fun, otherwise we get tense, sad… I hope that next season he can give us a lot of joy and demonstrate his full potential. It’s up to him. He has many qualities, technical quality. He does everything a player needs to do and has matured a lot. He wins fouls now and he likes more to score, and not only to dribble. I think he’s in a good moment</p>

  <p><b>[Dunga says <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> can’t expect 22-year-old <a href="lucas-paqueta.html">Lucas Paqueta</a> to solve their problems on his own]</b> He immediately showed his value in Brazil with <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a> and was brought to Italy. Everyone is expecting him to solve Milan’s problems. If he finds a team who is ready, he is a completely different player. He still needs to grow and understand how he can express himself in the best way. I think he could be a midfielder in the style of Nicola Berti</p>
