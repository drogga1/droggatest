  <p><b>[Craig Cathcart says <a href="odion-ighalo.html">Ighalo</a> tipped to be <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> success story]</b> I’m delighted for him, to be honest. I know it’s something that he’ll be really enthusiastic about, because he was an ambitious player. It’s an amazing opportunity for him and I’m sure he’ll do everything in his power to make the most of it. He can adapt. He’s got good link-up play if you do play with two strikers, and he can also hold the ball up if you want to go with the one striker. He can run the channels as well, because he’s got good pace and good strength and he’s always a threat in the box<br /><br /><b>[Cathcart went on to recall <a href="odion-ighalo.html">Ighalo</a>’s big-game mentality at Watford]</b> I remember when we first got into <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, the big occasions against the big clubs, he’d always look forward to them. And, if I remember correctly, he scored quite a lot of goals against the big clubs. So the fact that he’s going to be given the opportunity to play at United is just huge. He’s got every chance to have a successful spell there, because he’s a good player and he can score goals, definitely<br /><br />I haven’t spoken to him, but, as soon as he signed, I knew we were playing against United pretty soon. So I’ll be looking forward to seeing him and having a chat, and seeing how he’s getting on, because he’s a great lad and someone I really enjoyed playing with</p>

  <p><b>[Craig Cathcart says Fernandes has brought a cutting edge to Man Utd]</b> I think we were all very impressed. The thing that impressed me most was that he always looks forward. He always gets the ball and his first thought is to pass forward and create chances, which maybe they were missing before. He’s brought that bit of quality and cutting edge to the final third and since he’s come in their performances have been much better, from what I’ve seen<br /><br />Obviously since Sir Alex left, it’s been difficult for United, so I think this is a new way of looking at things. I can see this now being good for them, you can see young players now coming into the team and doing really well, so there’s no reason why they can’t progress and improve. They’ve obviously signed a few players as well, they’ve signed Fernandes who everyone’s raving about. He looks a quality player and that’s the mix you need, a good mix of experienced players and youth as well. I think things are looking up.</p>
