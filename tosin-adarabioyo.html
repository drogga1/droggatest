  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> centre-back Tosin Adarabioyo has set his sights on becoming the team’s captain in the next five years]</b> In five years’ time I’d like to be captain of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and have won <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and the Champions League. Definitely it can happen<br /><br />I just felt like I needed to go out there and get some more games and prove what I can do. My aim has always been to get back to City and be a main player in that team. I felt I needed to go out again because last season I was predominantly playing right-back. I didn’t actually get to show what I can do. <b>[The season with West Brom]</b> was up and down. I was playing out of position: right-back. I didn’t really enjoy that. That’s not where I play best but I learned a lot there<br /><br /><b>[Media coverage of Adarabioyo was used by <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> in 2018 as an example of racist reporting in the media, as he compared how he was viewed in headlines to the treatment fellow City player <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> received. But he feels there has not been much of a change since Sterling took a stance against racism in the British press]</b> I wouldn’t say it made any difference. I haven’t seen much of a change. If anything in recent months it’s got worse. You’ve just got to deal with it however you feel best. Some people want to speak out about it, which I think is the right way to go about it. You have to speak out and have your opinion, try to get rid of racism. Other <b>[players]</b> just want to get on with the game</p>
