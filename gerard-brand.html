  <p><b>[Is <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s new and improved defence already under their nose?]</b> Against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> there were still some scary moments that may have gone punished from a side with more confidence, but there are some positives emerging from the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> defence<br /><br /><a href="rob-holding.html">Rob Holding</a> was MOTM against Saints; he did the simple things simply, which may seem basic but is still an improvement, and what really impressed me was the way he commanded the defence and pushed them up when <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> attacked, which reduces that gap between midfield and defence we’ve seen so often. I also think he’s a decent passer into midfield and gets the game going quickly<br /><br /><a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> was also impressive against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, so the positives are there, but there is a long, long way to go. There’s no doubt there is plenty of work to be done</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil: What is going on with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> midfielder?]</b> My main feeling would just be confusion over <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>. That wouldn’t be a new feeling either. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans often seem quite split on <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>. There are those who want to know what on earth is going on, who want to know how <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> is going to use him, who want to know why he doesn’t always perform every week, those who don’t like his body language. And then there are those who hark back to moments of class he’s shown in an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> shirt and wonder whether he’ll do it again. <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> has been at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> for seven years. That’s longer than <a href="robert-pires.html">Robert Pires</a> was at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. It’s only one year less than <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a>’s main stint. When you think about it, that’s a long time to be waiting for <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> to really prove he can add to this <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> side every week, against any opposition, at any time. He’s at an age where I don’t think he can change his game, and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> won’t change their style at a time where they need to build from the back in blocks</p>

  <p><b>[Is this the best <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> team since <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> retired]</b> Is this the best United side since <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> left? Yes and no. Is this the most exciting United side to watch since <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> retired? Yes, I think it is. They can score all sorts of goals, and the entire midfield and front three are on form<br /><br />But the true test of a good team is how you react and get yourself off the canvas. The signs since the restart are good; they reacted well a few days after the shock late Saints equaliser, but the true test is to come again when things don’t go their way for a couple of games back-to-back. I think there are still question marks there, and no team has won a domestic trophy with four or six weeks of good form<br /><br />If we’re looking at United since <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> left, I do believe the best side they had on balance of both attack and defence sense was 2017/18 season under <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>, earning 81 points and conceding just 28 goals all season. But many would say they sacrificed entertaining football for results… it really does depend on what floats your boat!<br /><br /><b>[how important Champions League qualification is for the three sides battling it out for two places - <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and Manchester United]</b> I don’t think you can underestimate how important this is for all three sides. People say: ‘Well none of these sides will get past the last eight of the competition, what’s all the fuss and excitement about?’ But it’s not just about competing in next season’s Champions League, it’s about what calibre of player you can attract to the club. Many at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> point back to their top-four finish on the last day of the 2016/17 season; that summer they sign <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>, six months later they’re signing <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a>, another six months later they’re signing Alisson, a year after that they’re winning the Champions League, and a year after that they’re winning the title. It’s the ultimate springboard. Would they have done it without Champions League qualification? Probably not</p>
