It will never go away from him as a manager. It’s one of the reasons why he is respected like he is, but he has got that tender side as well. Not always, but he does have it and it’s one of the reasons I had the relationship with him over the years and that I have now. Without him I would never have achieved what I have done. After ‘98 without the manager I would have found it virtually impossible to cope with the attention I was getting and for this I will always be grateful to him</p>

I think that is what Man United definitely need to get back to and they need to get back to being feared again.

But the time when I really got to find out how great he was after a game against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> where I think I’d made a couple of mistakes.

I was trying to get into an academy and they said to me: ‘You are too small, you are not strong enough and you will never play for your country’. Thirty years on, I made 115 appearances for my country, I captained my country, I played in three World Cups and I had a pretty good career. So my message to young kids out there: there might be difficult times, there might be difficult moments, but believe in yourself, have fun, enjoy yourself and just love the game</p>

What is a Galactico? David Beckham followed Ronaldo in 2003 when he joined from Manchester United. While Beckham’s talent levels may not have come close to that of Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane or Ronaldo, he was a European champion and England captain</p>

On July 4, 2019, David Beckham and Victoria Beckham will celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary. The pair began dating in 1997, when it was Victoria Adams, known as a member of the Spice Girls, one of the biggest pop groups of the time, who was the more famous of the couple</p>

<p>: 2019 07 03b
David Beckham has four children, with the eldest, Brooklyn Joseph, born on March 4, 1999, exactly four months before the couple tied the knot. He was a ring bearer at the ceremony. According to People magazine, Brooklyn was named after the place where Victoria found out she was pregnant. His godparents are Elton John, David Furnish and Elizabeth Hurley</p>

<p>: 2019 07 03c
The second child of the Beckhams is Romeo James, who was born on September 1, 2002. Like his elder brother, he has been named as one of Britain’s best-dressed men and is employed as a model</p>

<p>: 2019 07 03d
Cruz David followed nearly three years later on February 20, 2005, while Harper Seven, the couple’s only daughter, was born on July 10, 2011</p>

Where do the Beckhams live? After marriage, they purchased a country house in Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire which was subsequently dubbed ‘Beckingham Palace’. The seven-bedroom property was reportedly bought for £2.5m and had renovation worth £3m completed, giving it a swimming pool, recording studio, gym, floodlight tennis courts, fake ancient ruins forming a playground, a lavish barbecue area and a professionally tended football pitch. In 2015, they sold the property to insurance entrepreneur Neil Utley for a reported £11.3m, while in 2018 they sold a lavish mansion in Beverly Hills for a reported £26.2m</p>

<p>: 2019 07 03f
The Beckhams now - aside from Brooklyn, who is attending Parsons School of Design in New York - stay in Holland Park, west London during term times. This property cost around £31.5m. Otherwise, they stay in a luxury barn in the Cotswolds worth an estimated £6m.</p>

We haven’t played too many games here. Our first game was against Palace then we played a few games more, some in the Champions League, now three in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> this season. Still it’s all new. I think it’s an amazing stadium. I was talking to David Beckham just now and he said, ‘I wish I could still play football and play now for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> because this stadium is amazing’. Yes, yes, yes, he said, ‘I wish I could play here and play for you! For us it’s so important to make our stadium our home and start to feel comfortable.

What can I tell you? 1-0, 2-0, 3-0, 4-0 and not score Harry? It’s okay. We need to keep the goals for when we need them<br /><br />I think it showed that the team was unsettled <b>[before]</b>. When the team is unsettled, when the squad is unsettled, it is so difficult to perform in the way you want to perform. I’m not complaining or blaming anyone, but it’s only that in football it’s so easy to describe situation and the focus wasn’t on playing football and it wasn’t on trying to improve. The focus wasn’t on the places we wanted it and it’s not easy to perform that way. Of course we have quality, enough to win games without focus, but when you are focused it showed, in that first half the performance of the team. The intensity, the concentration. We know what we need to do and when you are able to do that the quality we have appears. We have tremendous quality in our squad, unbelievable players. If we show that intensity in all our games for sure we are going to fight for big things. I am so happy to recover that feeling. We all needed it but now it’s to keep pushing. This is the first step of the season. With this match we have seven games in 21 days and all are going to have the possibility to play and we are going to rotate in different games. That is the most important thing. We are going to give the chance to all the players to play and show their quality and fight for their place</p>

I said ‘that wasn’t right, I don’t know anything about it’. I then flew back to London. I tried to speak to Peter Kenyon and tried to speak to the manager and he said ‘no’. I said ‘well I need to speak to him and understand what is going on’. He said ‘it’s true, we have agreed a deal’.

  <p><b>[Beckham reveals Inter Miami struggles ahead of <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> debut]</b> Without a doubt, I knew that it was always going to be a challenge because this was my first time stepping into this situation. I was excited. I knew that it was going to be a challenge, but I didn’t realize how big of a challenge. I’ve said it many times… that I thought that when I announced, seven years ago, two years will be up and we’ll be playing in our own stadium and own facility. So yes, it’s probably been the hardest thing I’ve done <b>[…]</b> but sometimes the hardest things in life are the most difficult to get going. And that’s how I look at this<br /><br />It’s very difficult to compare. When I first moved to LA in 2007, the excitement of me playing in a different league, playing in a different team in a league that had not been around for many years, that was a challenge and exciting for me. To be able to live in the U.S, it was exciting for me personally and for my family. To be welcomed the way we did was incredible<br /><br />The league, without doubt, has gone on to a whole different level from that moment to now, but that’s from the vision of the commissioner <b>[Don Garber]</b>, the vision of this team and the hard work that’s been done over those years. I also think that it’s the investment the other owners and other franchises have done as well to make this league what it is now, to be able to bring the players that have played in this league over last five to 10 years, to have the insight to be able to create something like that to grow this league<br /><br />I know that every moment where I doubted whether it was going to happen or not, this weekend is our reward for the perseverance, or the stubbornness as my wife calls it, and the tenacity to continue to know that this was the right thing to do</p>

  <p><b>[David Beckham’s Inter Miami: One of the most talked-about clubs in the world]</b> Do I think in the next 10 years it will challenge the European leagues? It’s what we all hope for. It’s what we all strive to commit to. I think that’s the biggest thing <b>[for]</b> owners of new franchises that keep coming into this league, keep growing this league and have insight into bringing great players here. This should never be a league where players from Europe come to retire. That’s not where you want to be, it’s not where we want to be as owners, it’s not where we want to be as investors. We want to bring the players here that actually want to be here to play and to further their careers. That’s what it’s got to be and that’s where we are. That’s where we’re very proud as owners to be part of this<br /><br />We’re very excited to have a talented young player in the prime of his career playing in our team. But we still want to continue to grow this club and grow this team. That’s one thing that I learned from Sir Alex Ferguson: it’s not sometimes all about bringing the biggest names, the biggest players to a club. They have to be the right players. They have to be the right players that fit into our culture, that fit into our team and integrate within the team that we’ve created already<br /><br />There’s also been a lot of talk over the years about other great names coming into this team and that was obviously not by myself but when asked the question, ‘What players would you like to come into this club?’, We always say we want the best players and the biggest names<br /><br />I think that we’ve always set our standards out to be different than the rest, but I also think that most owners probably feel exactly the same. Though most owners probably come into this league and think that they’re different from every team and they want to do things in a different way. We believe what we’ve obviously created with our club so far from the training facility to the stadium to the fan base that we have to the things that we do, we feel that we are doing things in a different way. We feel that we are creating attention for this club globally. And that’s what we’re excited about: to be, statistically, one of the most talked-about clubs in football at the moment without even kicking a football, that’s something that we’re very proud of</p>

  <p><b>[Beckham: Inter Miami have great opportunity to sign <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and Ronaldo]</b> Well you know what, we’ve got great opportunities down in Miami. We’ve been contacted by a lot of different players with possibly coming to join the team. As with any owner, you really want the best players and if we have the opportunity to bring in players like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> or Leo, I have such admiration for them as athletes, if we could bring those players in than great. But at the moment, we have a great roster. Young players, a couple of experienced players too, but a lot of young players who are just ready to play.<br /><br />One of the things I learnt from <b>[former United manager]</b> <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a>… he turned around to me and said whoever you bring in, they have to be the right fit for the club. It’s not about the biggest name or personality, it’s about who fits in best with the players. That’s what we’ll do. But, like I said, as an owner if you want to bring these players in then we have a great opportunity</p>

  <p><b>[David Beckham weighs in on <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> promotion/relegation debate]</b> On the relegation system, you know that’s one thing that I’ve thankfully never experienced: being relegated. Luckily I always was always fighting to win leagues and to win championships<br /><br />But it’s something that I’ve been used to, you know, over the years, being part of league being part of leagues where there is a relegation system within whatever league I played it. It makes it exciting, but when you’re talking about a league that’s only been around for 25 years there needs to be a real stability in the league before you get to that point, I think that the work that’s been done within the teams that come into this league<br /><br />It’s only growing, and that’s a great place to be in but I think the commissioner and his team have done an incredible job as the years. And that’s why we’re in the position that we are now. What the future holds, we’ll see, but I think the fact that, we’re at a stage now where more franchises and more teams coming into this league, more stadiums are being built specifically for the game. That’s a great place to be. Who knows what happens in the future but we’re excited about what’s happening right now</p>

  <p><b>[Beckham moved to the Liga giants in 2003, one year after <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> had transferred to the club from Inter]</b> One of the first people that I ever saw was you. When you walked into the changing room it made me comfortable to be in the club.<br /><br />I remember Roberto <b>[Carlos]</b> turning round to me, or you turning round to me and saying ‘we would always say in the Brazil team if there was any English player that could play in the Brazilian team it would be you’. I never believed you! But thank you!<br /><br /><b>[Since hanging up his boots, Beckham has become the owner of new <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> franchise Inter Miami]</b> It’s difficult times. You know, I think with Inter Miami, this was the first season. We played two games so far. We haven’t played a home game yet in our stadium. The first week of the lockdown was when we were going to go play our first game. So it’s difficult, but I think that the most important thing is that obviously, everybody stays healthy, stays safe, and then we can take the advice of the governments and the places where we’re going to be playing. But I think that that’s the most important thing. With Inter Miami, we’re excited…it’s a special place with special people and to have the team that we have, to have the players that we have, to have the ownership group and to have the stadium and the <b>[training]</b> facility that we have is really exciting for us. I tried to take things from Manchester to Madrid to Milan to <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, to the <b>[LA]</b> Galaxy. All the teams that I’ve played at, I tried to take a little bit from every team into this organisation. So we’re really excited. We’re really excited to be owners of the team. It’s something that feels different, but it’s special</p>
