He will work hard, play hard, that’s the way he is and he will lead by example. I never hid as captain and Wayne has never hidden either, even when he has had difficult times on the pitch by not scoring or not had a great game. You will never see him not working. That will be one of his strongest qualities. Rooney is the leader and Roy Hodgson has his plans with the players we have. Raheem Sterling is performing at Liverpool and so is Daniel Sturridge. Danny Welbeck is strong too.<br /><br />When you don’t beat Costa Rica, Uruguay and even the Italians at the World Cup it is disappointing. Roy Hodgson’s intention is to bring in young players. The more experienced players have stepped down. Steven Gerrard has gone and so has Frank Lampard. Wayne Rooney is the most experienced now and he is the captain, so there is something to build with</p>

It was bad timing as well as I was going to South Africa at the time with England and ended up meeting Nelson Mandela so that’s why I regret that one</p>

Everyone knows how much England means to him, so I believe he can play for another five years.<br /><br />I’m sure it’s up there with every trophy that he’s won because I know how much it means to Wayne to play for his country. And to reach the heights of this and be up there with the name of Sir Bobby Charlton means so much<br /><br />You talk about records, you talk about scoring goals. For Wayne, it’s all about winning things and if you win something with England it wouldn’t get any better than that</p>

He has got that aggression. It will never go away from him as a manager. It’s one of the reasons why he is respected like he is, but he has got that tender side as well. Not always, but he does have it and it’s one of the reasons I had the relationship with him over the years and that I have now. Without him I would never have achieved what I have done. After ‘98 without the manager I would have found it virtually impossible to cope with the attention I was getting and for this I will always be grateful to him</p>

I’ve always been struck by his humility. He’s respectful and wants to learn, which he proved when he arrived at Barcelona in 2013 to play alongside some of the game’s biggest stars. I suspect the recent Champions League game against Paris Saint-Germain, when Neymar helped his team to an unforgettable 6-1 win, will be remembered as the moment he stepped up to take on the mantle of best player in the world. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have a new rival to that claim-and Neymar is ready to make his move.</p>

I was at Stamford Bridge a few weeks back when United played Chelsea. He works hard, he can pass the ball, he can tackle, he can score goals like he did that night. When he was running into players, whether it be an accident or not an accident, he reacts in the right way, and that says a lot about him as a personality.

That was told to me by an England coach at that time of a lower level. I was trying to get into an academy and they said to me: ‘You are too small, you are not strong enough and you will never play for your country’. Thirty years on, I made 115 appearances for my country, I captained my country, I played in three World Cups and I had a pretty good career.

Your family, teachers, coaches, friends, work colleagues, boss and many others influence your outcome. At the age of 16 I was fortunate enough to join Manchester United full-time. I was young, naive and in the hands of the coach. It’s difficult to put into words what Eric did for me that would do it justice.<br /><br />He never let up from the minute we walked in to the minute we moved up. He grounded us everyday. He made me understand the importance of consistency and reliability. A boss wants to know what his players are going to do. Always be there, always give their best and achieve the standard you’ve set yourself. He pushed us in training to a point of stress to know how far mentally and physically we could take ourselves.

  <p><b>[Beckham reveals Inter Miami struggles ahead of <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> debut]</b> Without a doubt, I knew that it was always going to be a challenge because this was my first time stepping into this situation. I was excited. I knew that it was going to be a challenge, but I didn’t realize how big of a challenge. I’ve said it many times… that I thought that when I announced, seven years ago, two years will be up and we’ll be playing in our own stadium and own facility. So yes, it’s probably been the hardest thing I’ve done <b>[…]</b> but sometimes the hardest things in life are the most difficult to get going. And that’s how I look at this<br /><br />It’s very difficult to compare. When I first moved to LA in 2007, the excitement of me playing in a different league, playing in a different team in a league that had not been around for many years, that was a challenge and exciting for me. To be able to live in the U.S, it was exciting for me personally and for my family. To be welcomed the way we did was incredible<br /><br />The league, without doubt, has gone on to a whole different level from that moment to now, but that’s from the vision of the commissioner <b>[Don <a href="don-garber.html">Garber</a>]</b>, the vision of this team and the hard work that’s been done over those years. I also think that it’s the investment the other owners and other franchises have done as well to make this league what it is now, to be able to bring the players that have played in this league over last five to 10 years, to have the insight to be able to create something like that to grow this league<br /><br />I know that every moment where I doubted whether it was going to happen or not, this weekend is our reward for the perseverance, or the stubbornness as my wife calls it, and the tenacity to continue to know that this was the right thing to do</p>

  <p><b>[David Beckham’s Inter Miami: One of the most talked-about clubs in the world]</b> Do I think in the next 10 years it will challenge the European leagues? It’s what we all hope for. It’s what we all strive to commit to. I think that’s the biggest thing <b>[for]</b> owners of new franchises that keep coming into this league, keep growing this league and have insight into bringing great players here. This should never be a league where players from Europe come to retire. That’s not where you want to be, it’s not where we want to be as owners, it’s not where we want to be as investors. We want to bring the players here that actually want to be here to play and to further their careers. That’s what it’s got to be and that’s where we are. That’s where we’re very proud as owners to be part of this<br /><br />We’re very excited to have a talented young player in the prime of his career playing in our team. But we still want to continue to grow this club and grow this team. That’s one thing that I learned from Sir Alex Ferguson: it’s not sometimes all about bringing the biggest names, the biggest players to a club. They have to be the right players. They have to be the right players that fit into our culture, that fit into our team and integrate within the team that we’ve created already<br /><br />There’s also been a lot of talk over the years about other great names coming into this team and that was obviously not by myself but when asked the question, ‘What players would you like to come into this club?’, We always say we want the best players and the biggest names<br /><br />I think that we’ve always set our standards out to be different than the rest, but I also think that most owners probably feel exactly the same. Though most owners probably come into this league and think that they’re different from every team and they want to do things in a different way. We believe what we’ve obviously created with our club so far from the training facility to the stadium to the fan base that we have to the things that we do, we feel that we are doing things in a different way. We feel that we are creating attention for this club globally. And that’s what we’re excited about: to be, statistically, one of the most talked-about clubs in football at the moment without even kicking a football, that’s something that we’re very proud of</p>

  <p><b>[Beckham: Inter Miami have great opportunity to sign <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>]</b> Well you know what, we’ve got great opportunities down in Miami. We’ve been contacted by a lot of different players with possibly coming to join the team. As with any owner, you really want the best players and if we have the opportunity to bring in players like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> or Leo, I have such admiration for them as athletes, if we could bring those players in than great. But at the moment, we have a great roster. Young players, a couple of experienced players too, but a lot of young players who are just ready to play.<br /><br />One of the things I learnt from <b>[former United manager]</b> <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a>… he turned around to me and said whoever you bring in, they have to be the right fit for the club. It’s not about the biggest name or personality, it’s about who fits in best with the players. That’s what we’ll do. But, like I said, as an owner if you want to bring these players in then we have a great opportunity</p>

  <p><b>[David Beckham weighs in on <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> promotion/relegation debate]</b> On the relegation system, you know that’s one thing that I’ve thankfully never experienced: being relegated. Luckily I always was always fighting to win leagues and to win championships<br /><br />But it’s something that I’ve been used to, you know, over the years, being part of league being part of leagues where there is a relegation system within whatever league I played it. It makes it exciting, but when you’re talking about a league that’s only been around for 25 years there needs to be a real stability in the league before you get to that point, I think that the work that’s been done within the teams that come into this league<br /><br />It’s only growing, and that’s a great place to be in but I think the commissioner and his team have done an incredible job as the years. And that’s why we’re in the position that we are now. What the future holds, we’ll see, but I think the fact that, we’re at a stage now where more franchises and more teams coming into this league, more stadiums are being built specifically for the game. That’s a great place to be. Who knows what happens in the future but we’re excited about what’s happening right now</p>

  <p><b>[Beckham moved to the Liga giants in 2003, one year after <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> had transferred to the club from Inter]</b> One of the first people that I ever saw was you. When you walked into the changing room it made me comfortable to be in the club.<br /><br />I remember Roberto <b>[Carlos]</b> turning round to me, or you turning round to me and saying ‘we would always say in the Brazil team if there was any English player that could play in the Brazilian team it would be you’. I never believed you! But thank you!<br /><br /><b>[Since hanging up his boots, Beckham has become the owner of new <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> franchise Inter Miami]</b> It’s difficult times. You know, I think with Inter Miami, this was the first season. We played two games so far. We haven’t played a home game yet in our stadium. The first week of the lockdown was when we were going to go play our first game. So it’s difficult, but I think that the most important thing is that obviously, everybody stays healthy, stays safe, and then we can take the advice of the governments and the places where we’re going to be playing. But I think that that’s the most important thing. With Inter Miami, we’re excited…it’s a special place with special people and to have the team that we have, to have the players that we have, to have the ownership group and to have the stadium and the <b>[training]</b> facility that we have is really exciting for us. I tried to take things from Manchester to Madrid to Milan to <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, to the <b>[LA]</b> Galaxy. All the teams that I’ve played at, I tried to take a little bit from every team into this organisation. So we’re really excited. We’re really excited to be owners of the team.
