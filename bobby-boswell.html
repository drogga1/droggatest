<blockquote>
  <p>[Bobby Boswell believes the new CONCACAF Champions League still puts MLS teams at a disadvantage] Don’t get me wrong - I think people want to be in it. It’s not like we’re thrilled we’re not in CONCACAF. But it just allows us to focus more on our goal. Our goal is to lift trophies - mainly MLS Cup. But if you want to win a Supporters’ Shield or Open Cup, you need to have as much focus as you can from the get-go. One less thing to worry about maybe helps your vision of the end game.<br /><br />I think CONCACAF [Champions League] traditionally hurts MLS teams. I know it’s exciting and it’s glamorous to have that idea to be the first team to go out and win it, but it doesn’t really set us up for success, especially playing so early - and usually you’re playing a Mexican side that’s in form at that point. You spend most of your preseason preparing for a two-game series against a team that’s nothing like any MLS team you’re ever going to face, and there’s a bit of a hangover when you come out of that<br /><br />If you look at the way MLS teams perform midseason … you’re just in form, you’re in a better spot, as opposed to coming right out of a break and all of a sudden you’re expected to go out and beat Club America. [Liga MX clubs] have almost more incentive to beat us than they do to beat their own sides. The finals are different when they’re in it with each other than when they’re playing MLS opposition. They celebrated that game in Montreal like they had won the World Cup, and for good reason - they take a lot of pride in beating our league. We would do the same, and we will do the same, when it does happen - and I think it will happen sooner than later</p>
