  <p><b>[GERMANY 2-1 THE NETHERLANDS, JULY 7 1974]</b> I had been waiting for that moment for 14 years. Before the game, I remembered my feelings watching TV as a teenager, and that boosted my anger. I am happy to have been able to give this gift to the older generation, the ones who lived through the war</p>

  <p><b>[Dutch football association has confirmed the appointment of Dick Advocaat as Netherlands’ new national team coach for a third time]</b> I am very happy with the appointment of Advocaat and Gullit. We had two options. We either went for a long-term solution or we did everything within our powers to still make it to the World Cup. We went for the second option. We needed an experienced coach with authority. A foreigner was never an option. We considered Advocaat, Ten Cate and Huub Stevens.<br /><br />I never promised Ten Cate anything. I was still in talks with two candidates. I am surprised Henk thought he’d be the one. He knew I was still talking with Dick as well. When Fred Rutten pulled out as Henk’s assistant, it was clear for me that we would not go for Henk.<br /><br />I am thinking in couples. Advocaat does not have a clause in his contract this time. His departure as assistant last year? You have to ignore your emotions and go for quality. Advocaat will take charge once Fenerbahce are out of the Turkish cup.</p>
