  <p><b>[If Jill Scott wanted to play things cool with David Beckham in the stands at Le Havre’s Stade Oceane, Karen Carney had already blown her cover]</b> I ask Phil Neville every day, ‘Is he coming? Is he coming?’ He keeps telling me I need to calm down. I think Jill Scott is even more of a fan. She is obsessed with him. She’s said to Phil that if he does come out, don’t bring him in before a game as it would unnerve us.</p>

  <p><b>[Karen Carney has announced her decision to retire from football following England’s third-place play-off against Sweden in the Women’s World Cup]</b> I am incredibly proud to have achieved so much in the game but now is definitely the right time to retire. To have played for England was my ultimate ambition and to do so at four World Cups and represent Team GB at a home Olympics was beyond the wildest dreams I had when first starting out. I’d like to thank everyone who has made this all possible, from my family and friends, everyone I have played for and worked with and, of course, the England squad and staff. I owe everything I have to all of them.</p>

  <p><b>[The farewell appearance of Karen Carney, 31, thus seems likely to come from the bench. Having made her first-team debut for Birmingham at the age of just 14, the popular midfielder will depart as an icon of women’s football in England]</b> My mind can still do everything but I don’t think my body can. My mind wants to continue playing until I’m 100 but my body tells me enough’s enough. It’s the right decision; I don’t think I’ve anything more in the tank. I’ve given my heart and soul for my clubs and my country. So, no regrets</p>

  <p><b>[Midfielder Karen Carney echoed Phil Neville’s evaluation of the play-off, suggesting that England would benefit more from defeat]</b> It was tough. We’ve given everything and part of me is glad we haven’t won it. If we want to go and win the Olympics and the Euros, we have to have a fire in the belly. We have to dig deeper. We should not be afraid to say that we want to win the gold medal. No disrespect to Sweden or this game, but I’m kind of glad we didn’t win</p>

  <p><b>[Karen Carney thinks it is time that Megan Rapinoe wins FIFA Best Award due to her displays for the U.S. Women’s National team at the World Cup]</b> I am over the moon for Ellen White and Lucy Bronze. It is amazing to have two English players being recognised in the awards, but I think Megan Rapinoe will win it. I used to live with ‘Pinoe. I know her, she speaks from the heart. She is a top top player. She is smart, so I am sure she is doing what she can to put the game in a better place. All credit goes to her for that. She has always been a star, it is no surprise for me. She was the best player at the World Cup. She was the difference-maker, a game-changer and a winner. She is confident. I have known her for a while, she was always going to be a start and she was destined for amazing things<br /><br />Yes, I think I could feel myself declining if I am brutally honest. Someone once told me to end it on your own terms. I felt like I wanted to end it on my terms. I looked at it and it was like can I push and make the Olympic squad? It is tough going from 18 players including Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. I thought that might be a push too far for me. I had no Champions League with Chelsea. I lost my motivation. That’s no disrespect to the Women’s Super League, but I find a new challenge is needed to get myself up for it. Even though I am okay, I am struggling to get going physically to keep recovering for it. I have done everything I wanted to do. I don’t want to keep hanging on.<br /><br />I wanted to finish at the top of the game and on my own terms. I thought it was the perfect time at the World Cup and to go out at Chelsea. Chelsea and England were immense in how they have supported me in that transition. I will have some time off, do some media works and I think for 17 years I have given everything I could. When you have given all you can and no more then you should just stop. I am an all-in type of person so I will enjoy rest and family time. In saying that, it has been non-stop since retiring after France. That has been brilliant. I will eventually enjoy chilling out with family and friends</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Blues winger Karen Carney says she leaves the sport in a healthier state than when she started]</b> We need to get people to Women’s Super League games and supporting teams locally too. Getting behind them not just for major tournaments but week in, week out. Fans have got to get on board. That’s what we need to do and I think we can. We showed everyone in the last tournament that this is exciting. You can fall in love with the players, team and country. I am not saying every game should be at those major stadia but once in a while is good. For <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, it is Kingsmeadow. Get everyone there supporting the team. I think that’s doable. One-off games at the big stadiums is amazing but we want it filled every week</p>

  <p><b>[Karen Carney says Former USWNT boss <a href="jill-ellis.html">Ellis</a> would be ‘strong’ England hire]</b> I would probably go after <a href="jill-ellis.html">Jill Ellis</a> because she is the former U.S. manager, she’s proven. To be the American manager you’re getting things fired at you, left, right and centre, so you’ve got to have a strong personality so I think she could do it. To have a home Euros, you’re going to have a lot of things thrown at you. You’ve got to stand big and strong<br /><br />For England, if I was a player I’d probably want a bit of continuity now. <b>[The European Championship]</b> is on home soil, it’s an opportunity to really showcase the women’s game. It’s not a make-or-break situation, but it’s on home soil and all eyes will be on us. So we have to give the players the best opportunity and is that to get a manager in sooner rather than later? I don’t know. I’m sure there’s contract issues in that and also the climate we’re currently in</p>
