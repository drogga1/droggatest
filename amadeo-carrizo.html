<blockquote>
  <p><b>[The father of modern goalkeeping: How Amadeo Carrizo transformed the position during River’s golden age]</b> I always liked to play up front. Those up front are the ones who have fun. The goalkeeper stands there like a sap hoping he doesn’t concede. When he does everyone is already criticising him - ‘What did he do?’ ‘Why did he come out late?’<br /><br /><b>[The goalkeeper could have simply cleared the ball downfield, but instead he chose to drop the shoulder and dribble around his adversary before laying it off to a team-mate]</b> I was great friends with Borello, and he never felt hurt by that dribble. When I conceded a goal from a back-heel, a diving header or some trick I used to think ‘he did great, what a player!’ I liked it when my opponent accepted me for who I am and how I played. It was not something forced, I did it as a way out and because I had the ability to do it. Just imagine if I had cleared and smashed it into the guy next to me and it goes in the net, what a mess!<br /><br /><b>[He was also not above using football’s dark arts to gain an advantage]</b> Once I was up against Boca’s Pedro Mansilla who was right on the limit but still on. I shouted at him, ‘Offside!’ and I took the ball back off him</p>
