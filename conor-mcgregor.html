A little rat, a little weasel, a little hard man in groups. I’ve met many of them through my years. A man who grows in numbers but on his own when confronted in a similar situation cowers away. That’s what you saw with that little shite on the bus over there. He shit his jocks after doing something to his own coutryman that had nothing got to do with anything.

However, he returned to his stoic demeanour almost immediately]</b> You say ‘send location’. Here it is right in front of you. Did you not see me outside the bus, no? Did you not see me right in front of you outside the fucking bus?<br /><br /><b>[At this point, the Dagestani started giggling again]</b> I showed you my hands, no weapons. The first thing I did when I showed up at that bus, I showed him my hands to let him know I come here unarmed. No weapons. Step off the bus. You talked a big game, now I’m here. He done fucking nothing. He sat and took a shit on that bus, he hid and cowered behind fucking women and caused what happened to happen. Here’s my location, right here in front of you. Do something about it! Do something about it. Yeah, you’ll do nothing<br /><br /><b>[When McGregor offered Nurmagomedov a glass of his new whiskey, the Russian did appear to be a little annoyed. The devout Muslim reminded everyone that he doesn’t drink. McGregor wasn’t having it]</b> Why don’t you drink? I’d say you’re some buzz at parties, you mad backwards cunt! You’re dead when I get my hands on you, you hear me! You’re fucking dead!<br /><br /><b>[Then McGregor went after Khabib’s grappling-heavy fight-style]</b> This fool has been saying it’s going to be a long night. Trust me, mate, I’m ready for a long night. You hold on to legs for dear life. That’s how you fight. You talk chicken this, chicken that, you shit your jocks when shit came on top<br /><br /><b>[He remained composed as McGregor attacked how he acquired the lightweight belt, by beating Al Iaquinta on a day’s notice]</b> What kind of fighting is that? What kind of fighting is that? Your little fake belt over there, you beat the guy ranked No.11, a real estate agent. You bring that belt up on stage like it’s a real belt? You’re a phoney, a fake and I’m going to expose you. Now you’re up on the real shit, kid. You’re with the real dogs now, brother and you’re going to be smoked on October 6 and I am going to love every fucking second of it. I hope it’s a long night</p>

  <p><b>[Conor McGregor has explained a broken hand has been to blame for his absence from the UFC. He got the injury after sparring incident following an exhibition boxing bout with amateur Michael McGrane]</b> We scheduled a spar with another up-and-comer but the gloves are so small, the room for injury and damage is so high. We went into the spar and although it was scheduled to be a spar, it wasn’t, it was another bout on the record, there were crowds in attendance. I caught the guy with a right hand and he dropped and I went down on him with an emotional left hand and my whole hand went. I had to get surgery on it, it’s been a psychological battle with the famous left paw, but it was the right hand which put him down in the first place. I’ve been doing great work with the right hand. Originally I couldn’t grapple until September but I saw my surgeon and he said I can grapple now so I’m going to go back into that. I haven’t stopped kicking and I haven’t stopped with my conditioning, so lets get it going now - I’m excited<br /><br /><b>[Conor McGregor revealed he had held talks with the UFC about returning last month]</b> I was preparing for the end of July at Madison Square Garden, I was on such a good trajectory. I get to these great spots then, ‘boom’, a little slip and I have to build it up again; it’s just the life I’m in right now, I need to recognise it, understand it and take lessons from it and not let it happen again. Most certainly I’d have been back in July, we were getting there in conversations, there were opponents discussed; I didn’t mind the opponent but I wanted similarities to <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> to prepare me for that rematch. But I just want to compete now, lets get me back in the mix. Make no mistake, the skills are there for me and I know what I can bring to the table. I am very excited to show my fans what I can do. I do this for my fans and I look forward to my triumphant return. I have a great relationship with the UFC; there is no dispute, we are all eager to get this back on track<br /><br /><b>[TMZ posted a video where Conor McGregor appeared to get into an altercation with another man in Ireland]</b> … And as far as like the fans and seeing the fans disappointed in me, it hurts me so much, because … everything I’ve done is for the fans. I’m a fan-favorite fighter. My whole entire career has been based for the fans. Never pulling out, never turning down weights, sports, rules – anything.<br /><br />I’ve always done it all to light the game up for the fans and to create fanfare. And to see them disappointed in me, it hurts me to my soul more than you’ll ever know. So, like I said, retribution, redemption, respect. I will come and I will regain all of those<br /><br /><b>[Ariel Helwani ask about Conor McGregor’s incident in Miami and the heckler in Miami. Do you believe you have an anger problem? Is this something you need to fix?]</b> In that Miami trip, I was preparing for battle. I brought my mother out. It was her 60th birthday. I brought the whole family out. We went out and then the situation arose. I need to just stop reacting to the bait. People are trying to bait me into things. Am I the fish or am I the whale? I must be calm. I must be zen. I must lead by example. There’s so many people looking up to me. How can I react in this way?<br /><br /><b>[Ariel Helwani : I know you’re a historian, a fight game aficionado. You’ve seen this story before. You’ve seen the guy who rises up the ranks and gets himself in trouble repeatedly. Are you worried that the same thing is happening to you?]</b> Sometimes I feel like I feed into it and I give it fuel. I’m in a position that not many fighters, very few … I can make this generational. I can either be rich and spoiled and blow it all in this generation and leave it all behind in ruins or I can get my head together and build and make it generational – the children of my children’s children. So, if I have this opportunity before me, if I don’t execute this and get this right, make this happen for the children of my children’s children, all of my successes, all of everything I’ve achieved will be void, will be meaningless to me<br /><br />I study every single scenario that’s happened to me. I study every single scenario that’s happened in the game. I’m eager to come back here. We will see what will happen in the future. I’m going in confident with a lot of knowledge gained about myself, about my skill set, about my mindset. I look forward to implementing them and getting back on track.<br /><br />Look at Nate Diaz. Last fight three years ago, defeated by me. Came back and won. And it was a motivating experience for me. Look at Stipe Miocic, came back after a knockout loss. Won his title back against the man that knocked him out. There’s so many stories of this over and over again. And mine is gonna be the greatest one of all<br /><br />Like I said, I took great motivation from watching Nate Diaz go out and do his thing. And even looking at Nate, there’s many things that were amazing about that whole performance for me from Nate; but one of the ones … that stood out for me is the very first thing he said postfight was ‘The Nick Diaz Army’. He gave a shout out to his brother, and I hope his brother is doing well. I hope Nick is doing well, a soldier of the game, of the real fight game. And he gave him respect straight off the bat. That’s why the fans love Nate. That’s why I love and respect Nate, you know what I mean?<br /><br /><b>[Ariel Helwani : Why did you tweet out that you were retired ?]</b> You don’t understand the amount of things that go on behind the scenes, Ariel. Sometimes I just need distance. … I’ve done so much for the company back to back to back, nonstop. I built this house. Royce Gracie can say he built this house. I certainly laid bricks and blocks down myself for this game. And then when so many things are going on backstage and between my inner team and in the outer team and in the business side of it, sometimes you just need to take a back step.<br /><br />But retirement, I don’t think I will ever retire from this game, Ariel Helwani, never in my life. I’ll be fighting until the day I go out. There’s no doubt about it. I mean, it’s just the way it is. It’s in me. It’s bled in me, and I will take it with me to the grave<br /><br /><b>[Ariel Helwani : For that fight in July, did you have an opponent waiting for you?]</b> I believe it was leaning towards <a href="justin-gaethje.html">Justin Gaethje</a> at that time, but look, the game changes so quick. Everyone just comes and goes. It’s a forgetful business. It is a cruel, cruel business, Ariel. Only for the amount of history I’ve made, the amount of iconic moments that’s happened in my career – they would’ve loved to have thrown me away.<br /><br />… Think about the people that haven’t had what I’ve had, that’s gone through the trauma and the battles for the fans. That’s what we deal with for the fans and for our family and for the people. And then when it’s all said and done, they just discard you, and it’s a cruel business<br /><br /><a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> ran away for that first round, Ariel. He didn’t throw a punch. He shot for the legs before he threw a punch. … There wasn’t a whisper out of him until he ended up in a dominant position. The only reason he ended up in that dominant position was because I walked around with disrespect towards him because he was just running around the cage. I switched off for that millisecond. He got that lucky shot – even after he got that lucky shot, although it was a beautiful shot.<br /><br />Even after he got the shot, I bounced back up and engaged, and what did he do? He shot again. But whatever. There’s many great things that I can take from that and, and I can – I can come back and avenge that, but I’m not gonna wait around<br /><br /><b>[Ariel Helwani: When you do return, will John Kavanagh be by your side? What’s the relationship there?]</b> John Kavanagh is a genius at the game, and having him in my corner is essential. You know what I mean? I felt a little bit slighted with some of these interviews going on, Ariel, and one of the things was <b>[that he]</b> hadn’t watched the <b>[<a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>]</b> fight back yet. When I heard that, I was like, I watched the flight back 898 times before I even got back to the house – from the T-Mobile Arena to the house, I watched the fight about 800 times.<br /><br />And to hear that he hasn’t watched the fight back, I was a little bit taken back, and then I’ve got to ask him, I need a why. He has to coach me. … Maybe I need a why, but look, it’s – this is all, I understand. I understand that, that my half-commitment has led to these talks and this type of thing. So I’m just in the process of making it right, and we’ll get there. We’ll get there. But I need – John will be in my corner. No doubt<br /><br />Max Holloway is definitely up there, top of list. And you know who else is top of the list? Frankie Edgar is also up there right there at the top of the list because he has similarities with <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>. … I want these types of similar bouts.<br /><br />Also Frankie has been very respectful. He wanted to say, ‘I want to tell my grandkids that I fought Conor McGregor one day.’ And for me, when I heard that – this is going back many months – when he said that, I messaged <a href="dana-white.html">Dana White</a> straightaway and said that’s the fight to make. And even though he lost the bout to Max Holloway in a close bout, I don’t care about that. Wins and losses in this game don’t mean anything. It’s the stories we are all on, the journeys we are all on. That’s why sometimes when things get a little bit personal, the throws hit harder<br /><br /><b>[Ariel Helwani : Were you looking at the five-year anniversary of UFC Dublin with nostalgia? Did that fuel your return?]</b> Of course. What an iconic night for the sport – and for the sport in Ireland. It made the sport in Ireland, really. It catapulted it into the mainstream, and it had nothing but good effects. So to be a part of that and then to think of the people that I’ve done it with, I came on with, of course I was sitting there nostalgia and again using it as motivation</p>
