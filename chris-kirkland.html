  <p><b>[Chris Kirkland says The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title is already <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s to lose]</b> I honestly do think it is. Last year was so unlucky. People say losing by one point was devastating, I would rather have lost by one point than be 15, 16 points behind City still. I think with City’s injury problems they’ve got at the back, Aymeric <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Laporte</a> is a huge miss, <a href="vincent-kompany.html">Vincent Kompany</a> is a massive miss for them. At the back you can get at them. When we play them, if we can take points off them then all of a sudden you’re talking double figures. Can you see us losing four or five games this season? Not the way we’re playing<br /><br /><b>[Liverpool can put down another marker when they return to domestic action after the international break]</b> What a place to do it. You wouldn’t put it past them. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are going through a tough spell but Ole <b>[Gunnar Solskjaer]</b> will make sure they’re up for that game. The fans know what that means but I expect us to go there and get a result, I just don’t think they can stop us. The way we go forward, the way we defend, we’re solid all over the pitch. I think we’ll get the three points</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Kirkland says If <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> delivers a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title triumph this season then he will never have to do anything again in Liverpool]</b> Amazing. I’ve always been a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fan and my first game was when I was seven years old standing in the Kop. As a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fan, it’s brilliant. It’s exciting times. I think Jurgen deserves a lot of credit. Three or four years ago, there was a bit of negativity around the club, but he’s brought the whole club back together.<br /><br />I go down to Melwood quite a bit and am lucky enough to watch the training. No matter who’s down there, whether it’s the person taking the bins out, someone cooking the food or washing the kit, he treats everyone exactly the same way. He’s got so much time for everybody and has brought that feel-good factor back. The fans know that – they adore him and they won the Champions League last year.<br /><br />If he can get us the league title for the first time in 30 years, he’ll never have to do anything again in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> because he’ll be a hero. There’s a long way to go. Sunday (the win against Man City) was a huge game and nine points is a big gap. But it’s <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> you’re talking about – they pulled it back last year. But I’m hoping this is the year<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether he feels confident in the Reds’ quest]</b> Yeah, I am. It’s been bubbling for a couple of years, we won the Champions League last year for the first time since 2005. It’s been bubbling since he <b>[Klopp]</b> came to the club and he’s transformed it completely. They have some world-class players. If we can keep the big players fit … I think in the next two months they play Saturday-Tuesday-Sunday-Wednesday every week after the international break until Christmas, so that’s going to be a challenging period for them to keep everyone fit. But if they do that, I’m definitely backing them to win it</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Kirkland says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> will not let his <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> stars get ahead of themselves in their pursuit of a first league title in 30 years]</b> I said after a few games <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> would win it comfortably but there’s a long way to go. They’ve given themselves a great start and it’s in their hands, it’s theirs to lose, but there is a lot football left to be played. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> won’t let the players get ahead of themselves. The next game will be the only focus now, and then the next one, then the next one. I know it’s a cliche to always just focus on the next match but he really does do that, and it’s so important. If they can end that thirty-year wait for a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title then I think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will be on shutdown for about a month with all the celebrations!<br /><br />I don’t think the lack of clean sheets is a worry. They’ve not lost a game! They’re top of the league and unbeaten - they won’t be concerned about that. It’s not easy to keep clean sheets in this league!</p>

  <p><b>[All you need is Alisson! - <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> ace is the <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> of goalkeepers]</b> He makes the difficult things look easy. Everything he does is calm, in control. He’s the best in the world, for sure</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Kirkland says <a href="adrian.html">Adrian</a> still has a future at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> despite his costly mistake against Atletico Madrid]</b> There’s no hiding the fact that he has made mistakes. Alisson’s the undisputed No.1 and I think that puts extra pressure on him because of how well Alisson’s performed; people are waiting for the chance that, if the No.2 keeper comes in, doesn’t do as well, he’s under extra pressure, you’ve got to take a chance. <br /><br />And unfortunately he made a mistake at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> the other night and <b>[against Atletico]</b>, but he knows that he’s big enough, he’s got a big enough character. He’s been superb since he’s been at the club under difficult circumstances when he first came as well with Alisson getting injured, and obviously won the Super Cup with the team and helped them to do that.<br /><br />So listen, he’ll recover and he’s got to do quickly because it looks as though he’ll be playing at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> on Monday night. I’m not sure what the contract situation is with <a href="adrian.html">Adrian</a> but I’ll be amazed if he’s not at the club next year because of what he’s done and performed and not just on the pitch, but off the pitch. He’s in the dressing room, he’s very lively. The lads have took to him extremely well. So when you make mistakes in high-profile games, these are the questions that are always going to be asked</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Kirkland says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will look to bolster their attacking options over the summer]</b> Yes, definitely. I think I’ll be surprised if they don’t; the attacking department, the front three are incredible. When one of them is not performing, the other two do but you’re going to go through spells where the front three are not performing and you’re going to need replacements. I’d be amazed if they don’t go out and buy somebody else in the summer. It’s difficult to say because when you win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> by 20-plus points, people say, well, you’re mad. Winning the Champions League last year as well but you can’t stand still in football, you know that and I’m sure we’ll be making signings so it will be interesting what we’re doing this summer<br /><br />A lot has been made over the last few weeks. Obviously they’ve lost a few games but it’s nerves. Even though <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has been over for a couple of months, until you actually get over the line the players feel the pressure playing in front of the home fans. You know <b>[Liverpool]</b> know what’s at stake - <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. They win that, they’re going to be heroes and legends forever at the club. So you know your performances are going to dip slightly because of the pressure</p>

  <p><b>[Former Reds goalkeeper Chris Kirkland says Alisson a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> bargain &amp; worth way over £100m]</b> The recruitment to bring him here was perfect. For that amount of money, it is a bargain. At the time, you thought £65m was a lot of money, but now, he is worth way over £100m, way over<br /><br />I think all these awards tell you everything you need to know about him. He is getting greedy isn’t he! Listen, I am not biased, he is the world’s best and if you speak to anyone and ask which keeper do you want in your net, seven out of ten, at least, would say Alisson. Without a shadow of a doubt<br /><br />Technically, he is so good, my word! He has a calmness and you see that on the pitch and that helps the defenders. Trust me, some of the saves he makes are not easy, he just makes it look easier. Only goalkeepers will understand. Some will say some shots are straight at him but try catching a ball when it is travelling 80 miles an hour and it is dipping all over the place, trust me, it is not easy</p>
