  <p><b>[Montreal Impact team chef Mario Di Molfetta describes the challenges he faced while cooking on the road for the <a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a> side during the <a href="concacaf.html">CONCACAF</a> Champions League]</b> The worst experience was Pachuca. Mexico City was good. Costa Rica was fantastic. But in Pachuca, we were staying in the only hotel that didn’t belong to our opponents’ parent company. I was worried about food safety. I was there with one of my colleagues, and our job was to make sure that the food wasn’t spoiled. They would leave all sorts of things at room temperature when they should have been in the refrigerator. More than anything, I had to make sure that no one fell ill. We were there for four days and, fortunately, no one did. It was tough. Those conditions aren’t acceptable in any kitchen, anywhere. I didn’t feel like cooking anymore.</p>
