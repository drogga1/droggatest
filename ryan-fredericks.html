<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Ryan Sessegnon has already been linked with Manchester United and Tottenham]</b> I have no doubt about it, and everyone at the club will say the same thing, Ryan will go right to the top. He will be playing for a top four club in the next few years, if not I will be very, very surprised. The ability he has got and the understanding of the game at such a young age. The experience he is getting over the last two seasons and the level head he has got on his shoulders, no matter how high he goes he’s not going to forget where he has come from, forget his roots, and everyone around him.<br /><br /><b>[He deals with pressure]</b> really well to be fair, it’s crazy to think how young he is. He has a mature head on his shoulders. We’ve been with him in the last two years and not one of us have heard him talk about another club. He’s got great respect for Fulham and he loves it here. I’m sure one day he will be playing at a top, top level. But he knows at the moment he is here with us at Fulham. And he is doing everything he can to make sure we’re back up in the Premier League</p>
