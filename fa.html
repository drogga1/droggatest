Brave Young Lions undone by defensive mistakes and strange selections. England’s dramatic 4-2 loss to Romania on Friday may not mathematically spell the end of their European Under-21 Championship hopes - but it is only a matter of time, with France only needing a draw against Croatia later in the evening to confirm the Young Lions’s elimination</p>

The video assistant referee - VAR - will be introduced in the Premier League next season and is set to be one of the most significant and contentious changes to the game in England for some time. Football has generally been reluctant to embrace technology compared to other sports. The likes of tennis, rugby and cricket have used video replays or ‘hawk-eye’ technology for several years, yet football was always resistant</p>

The 2019 Community Shield will be contested by Liverpool and Manchester City. Pep Guardiola’s City, who won the 2018 edition, booked their place in the curtain-raiser event by virtue of winning the 2018-19 Premier League. Ordinarily, the other team in the Community Shield is the winner of the FA Cup, but since City won that too, the team which finished second in the league - in this case Liverpool - is drafted in.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge has been banned from football for six weeks - four of which are suspended - and fined £75,000 for breaching FA betting rules]</b> Mr Sturridge faced 11 charges. Nine of those charges (1a, 1b, 2, 5, 6a, 6b and 7-9) concerned alleged breaches of the inside information rule, in that, it was said, Mr Sturridge had provided inside information to friends and family about his possible transfer moves in January 2018, which information had then been used for, or in relation to, betting. Those charges were dismissed by the regulatory commission.<br /><br />The regulatory commission found proved charges 3 and 4, which alleged that, in that same transfer window, Mr Sturridge had instructed his brother, Leon, to bet on a possible move by him (Daniel) to Sevilla FC. In issuing that instruction, the regulatory commission found that, as a matter of fact, Mr Sturridge had provided his brother with inside information for that purpose.<br /><br />By way of sanction, the regulatory commission imposed on Mr Sturridge a six-week suspension from participation in any domestic football matches (including friendlies), such suspension being effective from 17 July 2019. Four weeks of that ban have been suspended until 31 August 2019, meaning that Mr Sturridge will be able to resume participating by 31 July 2019 in the event he commits no further breaches of FA Rule E8. In addition, the regulatory commission imposed a fine of £75,000 on Mr Sturridge. The FA respectfully disagrees with the regulatory commission’s findings and will be appealing against the charges which were dismissed and the sanction which was imposed</p>

  <p><b>[Bolton Wanderers face liquidation this week unless a deal to buy the club can be resurrected by 17:00 BST on Tuesday]</b> The EFL have made their position clear by insisting on a 17:00 BST deadline on Tuesday for a deal to be completed or give compelling reasons for an extension. They have also written to everybody concerned in the process to underline that sense of urgency. On Sunday evening, there was some tentative dialogue, but we are still some way from reaching a solution. Therefore, I am appealing to those parties whose position seems intractable to do everything to reach a compromise.<br /><br />In just over 24 hours, the club will have its membership of the EFL revoked. Over and above that, the club is currently not in a position to carry on trading and, as such, the process of closing down the company will commence on Wednesday. This will ultimately lead to its liquidation, the expulsion of the club from the EFL and the inevitable loss of over 150 jobs. More than that, it will devastate a community for whom the football club is a beacon of hope and expectation</p>

No one wanted to be in this position but following repeated missed deadlines, the suspension of five League fixtures, in addition to not receiving the evidence we required in regard to financial commitments and a possible takeover not materialising; the EFL Board has been forced to take the most difficult of decisions<br /><br /><b>[Meanwhile another League One side, Bolton Wanderers, are set to experience a similar fate as Bury should they not solve their financial crisis in the next 14 days]</b> Despite repeated assurances, we are extremely disappointed that we are still not in a position to reach a successful resolution with the sale of Bolton Wanderers and have therefore taken the decision to lift the suspension on the notice of withdrawal. I again urge all parties to finalise the proposed takeover. The reality of this action is that there are now 14 days to secure the Club’s long-term future, and I sincerely hope we can find a way through these challenging circumstances for the benefit of all those who have an association with the Club</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham midfielder <a href="dele-alli.html">Alli</a> banned for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> clash after mocking coronavirus in social media video]</b> <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a> has been suspended for one match with immediate effect, fined £50,000 and must undertake an education course following a breach of FA Rule E3. The <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham Hotspur</a> player denied that a social media post breached FA Rule E3(1), as it was insulting and/or improper and/or brought the game into disrepute, and constituted an ‘Aggravated Breach’, which is defined in FA Rule E3(2), as it included a reference, whether express or implied, to race and/or colour and/or ethnic origin and/or nationality. However, it was subsequently found proven by an independent Regulatory Commission.<br /><br />It was not the FA’s case that <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a> was a racist. The FA’s case was that ‘without sufficient thought’, the player shared a video that depicted an ‘unacceptable racist stereotype’ in a misguided attempt at humour<br /><br />He was selected, argued the FA for his appearance and not because there had been any coughing. That ‘targeting’ was said to be consistent with a racial stereotyping of persons of Asian appearance being connected with coronavirus</p>

  <p><b>[FA to support any player who wishes to take knee as anti-racism message ahead of FA Cup final]</b> We’re going to really use the final as a moment to promote good, positive mental health for everyone. It’s quite timely bearing in mind what we’ve all been through with this pandemic. I think there’s going to be, sadly, a lot of repercussions from this in society, not just in football, in terms of people’s mental health. Hopefully the FA Cup can be a bit of a pivot that people can rally around</p>
