  <p><b>[The FA have published the written reasons behind Arsene Wenger’s four-game touchline ban that he received for clashing with the officials]</b> In his report the Match Referee, Mr. J. Moss stated… ‘In the 92nd minute of the game, following the award of a penalty against Arsenal, I was informed by Mr Taylor that he had been confronted by Mr Wenger in the technical area. He informed me that despite being warned to consider his conduct, Mr Wenger stated to Mr Taylor ‘You are dishonest to your federation!’ Mr Taylor told me that he told Mr Wenger that this was not acceptable to which Mr Wenger replied ‘fuck off’. After the penalty kick was scored I walked over to the technical area and asked Mr Wenger to leave the area for inappropriate conduct. I restarted play as Mr Wenger reached the tunnel mouth. Mr Taylor will be adding his report which will include further misconduct following Mr Wenger’s dismissal, which I did not witness.<br /><br />Following the award of a penalty kick against his team in approx. 92nd min, Mr Wenger left his technical area to confront me in disagreement at the decision. Before he said anything I said ‘think carefully before you say anything’. He responded by saying ‘you are dishonest to your federation’. I considered this to be questioning both mine and the referee, Jon Moss’s integrity and impartiality. I stated to Mr. Wenger that such a comment was not acceptable and he told me to ‘fuck off’ on two separate occasions. Once Burnley had taken the penalty and before the game restarted I informed the referee, Jon Moss, what Mr Wenger had said and he subsequently dismissed Mr Wenger from the technical area.<br /><br />Initially Mr Wenger wanted to return to his technical area and I had to ask him again to leave the vicinity as required. He then chose to stand at the opening of the tunnel. I again approached him and asked him to go to the dressing room area. At this point Mr Wenger pushed me twice and I had to ask the security staff present to escort Mr Wenger to the dressing room area. At the conclusion of the match Mr Wenger visited the officials changing room and apologised to myself and Mr Moss for his earlier actions</p>

The period of this ban from 30 June 2018 onwards will be suspended for three years to be activated in the event of any similar breach by the club<br /><br />In each case, the academy player was conditionally registered with Manchester City while the Premier League’s investigation was ongoing. As a result of the club’s breaches, the players’ registrations will be terminated on a specified date, with no compensation rights retained by the club, and the club will not be permitted to re-register them as academy players.

On hearing this, Holgate followed correct procedures by immediately alerting the match referee of the allegation, along with other Everton players who were in close proximity.

None of these individuals directly heard the words alleged to have been said by Firmino. Firmino was formally interviewed by The FA and provided an alternative account to the words alleged by Holgate. Firmino stated that he had insulted Holgate in Portuguese, but denied categorically using any discriminatory language towards him. As part of the investigation, The FA sought the assistance of a Brazilian/Portuguese linguistic specialist on the words alleged. In addition to this, we also obtained multiple angles of video footage, including broadcast and unseen footage showing the incident, which was assessed by two independent Portuguese speaking lip reading experts. The evidence obtained from the experts did not support the allegation.<br /><br />We appreciate that this has been a difficult process for both parties, and would like to express our thanks to Mason Holgate and Roberto Firmino as well as both clubs for their assistance, professionalism and full cooperation during this investigation.</p>

The Derby County player was involved in an incident with Stoke City’s Joe Allen during Wednesday’s game <b>[28 November 2018]</b> which was not seen by the match officials but caught on camera. Johnson denied the charge of violent conduct with an Independent Regulatory Commission then considering The FA’s allegation that the three-match sanction should be increased.

  <p><b>[Women’s Super League abandoned due to coronavirus with season to be decided on ‘sporting merit’]</b> The FA Women’s Super League and Women’s Championship Board has today confirmed the decision to end the 2019/20 season, with immediate effect. Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, the board has been in regular consultation with clubs and key stakeholders from across both leagues to identify the most suitable and appropriate way to conclude the 2019/20 season, and to give clubs and players the clarity and support they need at this time. Following overwhelming feedback from the clubs, the decision to bring an end to the 2019/20 season was made in the best interest of the women’s game. This will also enable clubs, the board and the FA to plan, prepare and focus on next season when football returns for the 2020/21 campaign. Supporting the welfare of the clubs and players will continue to be our primary concern throughout this process, which also involved a robust and thorough examination of the logistical, operational and financial challenges that the game currently faces. The board has discussed various recommendations which will be sent to the FA to determine the most appropriate sporting outcome for the 2019/20 season. This will include identifying the entries for the 2020/21 <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Women’s Champions League, which would be based on sporting merit from the 2019/20 WSL season. We are not in a position to comment further until the FA board has had sufficient time to consider all of the recommendations and options.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> midfielder <a href="dele-alli.html">Alli</a> banned for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> clash after mocking coronavirus in social media video]</b> <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a> has been suspended for one match with immediate effect, fined £50,000 and must undertake an education course following a breach of FA Rule E3. The <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham Hotspur</a> player denied that a social media post breached FA Rule E3(1), as it was insulting and/or improper and/or brought the game into disrepute, and constituted an ‘Aggravated Breach’, which is defined in FA Rule E3(2), as it included a reference, whether express or implied, to race and/or colour and/or ethnic origin and/or nationality. However, it was subsequently found proven by an independent Regulatory Commission.<br /><br />It was not the FA’s case that <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a> was a racist. The FA’s case was that ‘without sufficient thought’, the player shared a video that depicted an ‘unacceptable racist stereotype’ in a misguided attempt at humour<br /><br />He was selected, argued the FA for his appearance and not because there had been any coughing. That ‘targeting’ was said to be consistent with a racial stereotyping of persons of Asian appearance being connected with coronavirus</p>

It’s quite timely bearing in mind what we’ve all been through with this pandemic. I think there’s going to be, sadly, a lot of repercussions from this in society, not just in football, in terms of people’s mental health. Hopefully the FA Cup can be a bit of a pivot that people can rally around</p>
