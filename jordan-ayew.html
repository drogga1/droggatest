  <p><b>[Ghana striker Jordan Ayew has defended his performance at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon]</b> I am always confident because I know the qualities I have. The coach and the players have confidence in me so there is no problem. Two of our stars - my brother Andre Ayew and Asamoah Gyan- were not hundred per cent fit ahead of the game against Mali so I had to run more and I did that with a good heart and good spirit. This is because I wanted to help my country to win</p>

  <p><b>[Crystal Palace have confirmed the signing of Jordan Ayew on a season-long loan from Swansea City]</b> I am very pleased to be here. It’s been a long transfer window but finally I got a move. The important thing for me now is to get fit and to be in good shape, and I know the manager wants to use me up front and make things happen. I chose to come to Palace to continue improving. It’s a step up for me and I’m ready for the challenge and to get to where I think I can get to</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>’s Jordan Ayew on father <a href="abedi-pele.html">Abedi Pele</a>’s support]</b> It was something that happened naturally; Dad never put pressure on us. I grew up with my grandparents in Ghana and my mum, dad and brother traveled around wherever my dad went. Then towards the end of his career, I followed him too. I was too young to see him in his prime, but I saw him play one or two games towards the end of his career. I’ve heard lots of positive things about him and he talked about his career a bit, but nothing more than that<br /><br />He kept protecting us and letting us do what we wanted to do to achieve our dreams. He supported us and the whole family, but I was never pressured into football. My brothers and friends in the area would play football like everyone does, and I started playing at school. Naturally, you begin to dream that you might become a footballer</p>

  <p><b>[Jordan Ayew reveals reason behind initial <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> struggles]</b> This season is different because last season when I came to the football club I didn’t have a pre-season. I was overweight so it was a difficult season for me but this season I had the chance to have a full pre-season and I’m feeling better. I’m feeling relaxed at this football club and I’m enjoying it. Everything is perfect for me to be good on the pitch. This football club has a lot of faith in me because with the season I had last season, people didn’t think they would sign me. The manager especially told me he wanted to keep me for this season and I told him straight away: ‘Yes’. I wanted to stay. Since I’ve been in England I’ve been moving around and now I have stability. My family is comfortable here in London and everything is perfect</p>

  <p><b>[Jordan Ayew have penned an emotional tribute to late Pape Diouf. The Senegalese, who was a former president of Olympique <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a>, passed away aged 68 on Tuesday due to complications from the coronavirus]</b> Rest in Peace Pape Diouf. My uncle, father, grandfather and godfather. My mentor, I can’t thank you enough for all you did for me, Andre, my father and my family. Today is one of the saddest days of my life to hear of your passing. Words are not enough.</p>

  <p><b>[Jordan Ayew interview: Finding form and aiming high at <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>]</b> I’m grateful to the whole club. They are the ones who trusted me and had the belief in me to sign me permanently. Since I came to this football club, they have been so supportive and so good to me. The only thing I could do was just try to go on the pitch, perform and do my best for the team. Thank God, things have changed a bit for me this season. I wanted to show the club that they didn’t make the wrong decision to sign me<br /><br />I’ve always thought that I was a good finisher, but sometimes you just need a bit of luck. This year, I’ve had quite a bit of luck, but luck doesn’t just come like that, you need to provoke it. I’ve been working really, really hard on that but there’s still room for improvement<br /><br />When I’m on the pitch, I always give 100 per cent. If I can track back, I will track back. Even if I had to play in goal, I would. I just want to make sure my teams wins, and I will do anything I can to help make that happen. If I do it and the team wins, I come home and I smile<br /><br />People tell me that I don’t have the killer instinct or aggressiveness in front of goal. But I am in a team where we need to work for each point. I can’t just stand up front and wait for the ball and try to take people on and shoot. There are other things I need to do and I enjoy doing them<br /><br /><b>[His latest goal, in Palace’s 2-0 win over <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> in their first game of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> restart, was his 25th overall in the competition, making him the top-scoring Ghanaian player in <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> history ahead of former <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> striker <a href="anthony-yeboah.html">Tony Yeboah</a>]</b> <a href="anthony-yeboah.html">Tony Yeboah</a> is massive, maybe the best striker of all-time in Ghana. so to beat his total and get to 25 goals in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is a great achievement for me and my family. My dad has given us so much, in everything, and not only to me, to the whole family. The only way we can say thank you is to perform week in, week out for him to be proud and that’s what we try to do.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="abedi-pele.html">Abedi Pele</a> certainly keeps Ayew on his toes]</b> He doesn’t watch the games live because he’s a bit too anxious, so they record them and he watches them afterwards. Then, when he’s finished, he briefs me a bit. If I’ve not done well, he tells me I’ve not done well. And if I have done well, he still tells me I’ve not done well. It drives me. I can’t give my dad enough praise, really. He’s unbelievable and I’m lucky to have a father who knows football</p>
