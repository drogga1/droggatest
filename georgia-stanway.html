  <p><b>[Georgia Stanway speaks about celebrating their qualification to the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> U-20 Women’s World Cup France 2018 semi-finals with the Atomic Kitten song ‘Whole Again’]</b> It was the victory song of the England fans at the World Cup in Russia. Qualifying for the semi-final gave us the perfect opportunity to sing it all together again</p>

  <p><b>[England women vs Cameroon women. England forward Georgia Stanway has backed manager Phil Neville’s selection policy]</b> Phil has the trust of everybody. Almost everyone has had the opportunity to get out on the pitch, there are some who haven’t had that yet but I am most certain that they’ll get their opportunity at some point and that shows the depth within our team. Whenever someone scores the whole bench leap up and everyone is celebrating together because we are one, whether you’re playing or not that is just the bond that we have within our team.<br /><br /><b>[The team selection is already likely to have been decided]</b> It gives you a few days to relax to settle into it, there’s nothing worse than being told hours before kick-off and getting worked up about it, thinking that you’re not prepared so it’s nicer to know in advance. I think as girls it can take longer to get over disappointment so you have a night to sleep on it and you’re fresher in the morning</p>

  <p><b>[England team-mate Georgia Stanway is excited at the emergence of a local rivalry and wants to put down an early marker that City are still the best women’s team in the city]</b> On a personal level, we’ve always had a rivalry with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> - every semi-final we go into we seem to end up with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. That’s our main rival and always has been. But with another team now in Manchester, there’s another kind of rivalry and it’s almost personal because we want Manchester to be our colour and all about us. All anyone talked about was <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> but now <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are on the scene and people will choose sides. We’ve got to make sure they choose Blue<br /><br /><b>[Stanway has played in front of more than 40,000 in last season’s FA Cup final at Wembley, as well as big crowds with England, but is thrilled to make her first appearance at the Etihad]</b> I knew it was going to be the first game of the season and couldn’t believe it was going to be at the Etihad. For it to be there, it’s massive, it’s just dead exciting. I’ve got so many family members coming and it’s one of them where all the support for training and the hard work, you can give back to your family. They’re going to be watching us on the biggest stage possible.</p>

  <p><b>[Georgia Stanway in Nick Cushing’s final game in charge winning her individual battle with one of the most talented wingers around, Beth Mead]</b> I’m quite enjoying it. I’m just doing a job for the team at the moment. I think, on a personal level, I’ve not done a bad job. I don’t think we could have <b>[said goodbye]</b> any better. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are an unbelievable side, as we found out on Wednesday, when we didn’t really get the result that we wanted. We made sure that today, we came out and we turned it around. It’s not a bad way to end his six years</p>
