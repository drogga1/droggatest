  <p><b>[<a href="danny-gabbidon.html">Danny Gabbidon</a> Comes Out Of International Retirement &amp; <a href="aaron-ramsey.html">Aaron Ramsey</a> Returns To Wales Fold]</b> Simon Davies said he was tempted but at the moment he wants to concentrate on his Fulham career and I respect that totally. Obviously Simon is a quality player but I totally respect his decision. I am sure everyone is aware of <a href="craig-bellamy.html">Craig Bellamy</a>’s situation and it would be wrong of me to ask him to play on Tuesday after playing on Sunday. The last thing we want is players going back to their clubs injured. I’m delighted Ramsey is available. He is really relishing the challenge and the Ireland game might come at the right time for him. He is hopefully one of the cogs in the wheel that will make us successful. He’s one of those players who can change a game</p>
