  <p><b>[Simon Chadwick, Professor of Sports Enterprise at Salford University, outlines the case against FFP]</b> FFP emerged as a solution for moderating the behaviour of bigger clubs. However, it was simply a voluntary agreement reached between members of an industry almost a decade ago. Over that decade, the world has changed considerably, and some clubs may feel that FFP is no longer acceptable to them, especially those clubs whose owners were not party to the original agreement that was reached.<br /><br />As such, all it would take is for one club to say ‘we don’t agree, we won’t comply’, and FFP could collapse in its current form. Indeed, under European Union law such clubs would find themselves in a strong position, as in other industries there are no such examples of financial performance being regulated in the same way by an external body.<br /><br />And this is the very essence of the challenge now facing European football. Nobody tells IKEA, BMW or Air France how much they can spend, how much they can borrow and how much their staff costs should be. Instead, this is dictated by markets, which is what some big European football clubs will point to as a basis for defending their actions</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>’s Disney-esque quest for world domination in football and beyond]</b> What is now becoming clearer about the CFG strategy is that it is intended to simultaneously deliver a multiplicity of goals. In the likes of China and India, the intention is to build fan engagement and secure the benefits of a growing middle-class and their desire for entertainment products. In Spain and Uruguay, talent identification, acquisition and development would appear to be the goals. The franchise model is obviously one that has been used before, for example, ENIC, <b>[who bought stakes in <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, Rangers, FC Basel, Vicenza and Slavia Prague) and is now being employed by rivals, such as Red Bull.<br /><br />However, it is what CFG symbolises that is most striking: the intersection of football, entertainment, digital and, perhaps crucially, politics. There is no doubt that Abu Dhabi’s wealth, allied to its political and diplomatic aspirations, has put CFG in a unique position. Whilst this position is not unassailable, for the time being at least, it is dominant.<br /><br />Personally, I don’t think ‘sportswashing’ has been a primary motivation for Abu Dhabi or CFG, although the incidental reputational and image benefits are obviously an advantage for the business’ owners. Instead, acquiring <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and then using it as the basis for building a bigger business that forms part of an extended network has been the main intent.<br /><br />For instance, many people noticed when CFG invested into Sichuan Jiuniu in Chengdu, China. However, fewer people noticed that the day before Etihad made a strategic commitment to fly into Chengdu’s airport. It is this kind of commercial and political nexus that has been the hallmark of CFG’s activities thus far<br /><br />It is simply localised turbulence in the operating environment of a business unit within a global multi-product business. An alternative view is that CFG is seeking to challenge existing governance structures in football and is confident of doing this, given the diversified and global nature of its activities</b></p>
