  <p><b>[Frank Arnesen says <a href="vincent-kompany.html">Vincent Kompany</a> was chosen as the new player-coach of Anderlecht after one six-hour meeting with the club]</b> We went to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and we had a meeting with <b>[Kompany]</b> for six hours. I was really amazed and when we went home after this meeting I fully agreed. There are so many ups and so few downs. Anderlecht is on the floor at the moment. That is why I came in four months ago. Vincent as a player will not bring us one step ahead, <b>[but]</b> maybe three, four steps ahead. We have no leaders. Everything football-wise is fantastic <b>[with his appointment]</b>. I was very impressed with his explanation about the philosophy, how we will do and what he is doing. Vincent said I will do it about four weeks ago</p>
