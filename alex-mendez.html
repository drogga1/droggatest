  <p>[Alex Mendez shines as U.S. Under-20s continue Concacaf domination] It was important because we let them know from the start that we were going to be all over them. I think we sent out a good message and from the first half it was dominance from us and we kept it going and that’s why we kept scoring.<br /><br />It’s going to be a good game because we have history with them. We played them in Honduras and unluckily we didn’t get the result we wanted in the first game, but the second game we came out and we won. This game they’re not just going to roll over for us, so it’ll be a good game</p>

  <p>[Beating Mexico the ultimate prize for USMNT U-20s] I want to play [Mexico] so bad. I want to beat them. Diego Lainez, he’s a good player, and he plays for my favorite club in Mexico. I want to give him a little hit and let him know he’s in for a game.</p>

  <p>[USMNT U-20s dominate Concacaf field and give fans hope for the future] My mentality coming into this game was this is against Mexico, it’s a great rivalry, and it’s a final, so what more do the players want to motivate them. It gives that extra cherry on top [to beat Mexico] because it’s where my roots are, so beating them now means a lot to me.</p>

  <p>[Alex Mendez has been recognized as 2018 Young Male Player of the Year] It’s a very proud moment. First, I want to thank U.S. Soccer for the nomination. I also want to thank my family, my teammates and the U-20 squad that won the Concacaf Championship. Obviously, this is an individual award, but none of this would be possible without them pushing me to be a better player.</p>

  <p>[When Alex Mendez made the decision to leave the United States to pursue his dream of European glory, it wasn’t an easy one, but it was one he knew he had to make] Every kid’s dream is to go to Europe and play with the biggest clubs, and I thought why not now when the door is open. It’ll be great for me as a person to grow there<br /><br />[The move from Los Angeles to the Southwestern corner of Germany] I went on trial with other clubs and it didn’t feel the same, not like it did at Freiburg. Looking back, they really treated me well and they took me in as if I was one of their own, so it made me feel like that was the place for me. When I got there, I was like ‘what are these guys saying?’. On the field it was more I know I can play with these guys, but it was the language barrier that stood out. But I know learning the language can come with time<br /><br />It helped a lot because you see Gio and Jona, those are big-time players who have a lot of experience, and you train with them. They helped me out and gave me tips on what I can do and can’t do on and off the field. It’s just little things that I learned and now I know for the future anywhere I go<br /><br />[Mendez made six appearances with the Galaxy’s USL affiliate, <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a> II, earning five starts as a 17-year-old at a time when many of his peers were still playing academy soccer] There’s a lot of things that you get away with in the academy that you can’t get away with at the USL level with Los Dos. When I went back to the academy after a couple of months with Los Dos I felt a difference in the DA games. Things that I was doing were just better<br /><br />When I was younger I didn’t have the mental side of the game, and that’s the biggest part of the game. I didn’t have it, and (Kleiban) would be hard on me, telling me off. After developing that for years and years that’s something you want to have. It makes you tougher<br /><br />[Though he grew up a <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> fan who counts <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> as his favorite player and <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> and <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a> as inspirations, Mendez names a former <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> star he has only watched in YouTube videos as the player he would like people to compare him to] <a href="guti.html">Guti</a>. The way he saw the game. He was playing some crazy passes. Sometimes during games I feel like I see things that other players don’t. I feel like I have the same style of play as him<br /><br />[His performance in the <a href="concacaf.html">CONCACAF</a> U20 final against Mexico was particularly memorable for Mendez] I wouldn’t say I’ve closed the door (on Mexico), but I’m happy where I’m at right now. It would mean a lot to play Mexico. I want to play them so bad. I want to beat them</p>
