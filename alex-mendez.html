<blockquote>
  <p>[When Alex Mendez made the decision to leave the United States to pursue his dream of European glory, it wasn’t an easy one, but it was one he knew he had to make] Every kid’s dream is to go to Europe and play with the biggest clubs, and I thought why not now when the door is open. It’ll be great for me as a person to grow there<br /><br />[The move from Los Angeles to the Southwestern corner of Germany] I went on trial with other clubs and it didn’t feel the same, not like it did at Freiburg. Looking back, they really treated me well and they took me in as if I was one of their own, so it made me feel like that was the place for me. When I got there, I was like ‘what are these guys saying?’. On the field it was more I know I can play with these guys, but it was the language barrier that stood out. But I know learning the language can come with time<br /><br />It helped a lot because you see Gio and Jona, those are big-time players who have a lot of experience, and you train with them. They helped me out and gave me tips on what I can do and can’t do on and off the field. It’s just little things that I learned and now I know for the future anywhere I go<br /><br />[Mendez made six appearances with the Galaxy’s USL affiliate, LA Galaxy II, earning five starts as a 17-year-old at a time when many of his peers were still playing academy soccer] There’s a lot of things that you get away with in the academy that you can’t get away with at the USL level with Los Dos. When I went back to the academy after a couple of months with Los Dos I felt a difference in the DA games. Things that I was doing were just better<br /><br />When I was younger I didn’t have the mental side of the game, and that’s the biggest part of the game. I didn’t have it, and (Kleiban) would be hard on me, telling me off. After developing that for years and years that’s something you want to have. It makes you tougher<br /><br />[Though he grew up a Barcelona fan who counts Iniesta as his favorite player and Xavi and Ronaldinho as inspirations, Mendez names a former Real Madrid star he has only watched in YouTube videos as the player he would like people to compare him to] Guti. The way he saw the game. He was playing some crazy passes. Sometimes during games I feel like I see things that other players don’t. I feel like I have the same style of play as him<br /><br />[His performance in the CONCACAF U20 final against Mexico was particularly memorable for Mendez] I wouldn’t say I’ve closed the door (on Mexico), but I’m happy where I’m at right now. It would mean a lot to play Mexico. I want to play them so bad. I want to beat them</p>
