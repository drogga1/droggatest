  <p><b>[Aleksandar Jovanovic relishing Jeju United return]</b> I love life in Korea, it’s really grown on me. From friends, to the best attractions and restaurants, especially in Jeju, it really is an amazing country.<br /><br /><b>[He said of his year in China]</b> It had its good moments and its bad moments. If I didn’t go then I wouldn’t ever have gone just simply because of the new ruling in China. So I’m pleased I went when I did, to get more experience in Asia and putting it on my CV I think it’s a good<br /><br />It’s still developing. They’re bringing in these big name players, but I think the reliance on these three big players to carry the whole team is something I feel is not enough, you need the whole eleven players to be doing their job. The gap between the big players and the Chinese players is still too far. I think the Chinese players need to develop, and they’re going in the right direction, so I feel in time it will be a lot stronger league<br /><br />I have a good relationship with the captain of Jeju <b>[Oh Ban-suk]</b>, and we’d been in contact and he was telling me that this is the strongest that he’s seen Jeju since he’s played there, which gave me a bit of motivation to come back. We could be fighting for the K League title, the FA Cup and with the <b>[AFC]</b> Champions League I’m hoping that we pass the group stage, and we’ll see what happens from there<br /><br />At training everybody is under pressure to perform, if they don’t perform the coach will change the player in that position and he’ll do a good job, if not better job than the player who was there. So everyone is always on their toes and putting in 110 per cent, everyone knows they have to perform because everyone is fighting for position<br /><br />I arrived very late on February 8 and I didn’t do any pre-season with the team, and with my Chinese team I didn’t do any pre-season <b>[either]</b>, so I didn’t do anything practically for three months. So the coach knew about that and he said ‘you need a bit of time to get back into the team,’ which is fair enough, so I’m just training hard and waiting for my chance. I feel like I don’t need to prove myself to anyone in Jeju, I’ve played there already for two years, I still know all the coaches, all the players, and everyone knows who I am<br /><br />I’m hoping, simply because my family is down from Sydney. But if I don’t, I won’t be upset, I’ll just put my head down and keep training hard and my time will come</p>
