  <p><b>[Martin O’Neill Refutes CSKA Moscow Boss <a href="zico.html">Zico</a>’s <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> Allegation]</b> Funnily enough, <a href="ashley-young.html">Ashley Young</a> didn’t play against Wigan recently and someone said then that all we did was get it out wide for <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a> to lob in a couple of hopeful balls.<br /><br />I knew the way CSKA were going to play. But I wouldn’t be running around telling them whether how they play is good, bad or indifferent. When I was at <a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a>, we won the league championship and two European Cups - which I don’t think CSKA Moscow have won - by getting the ball out wide to a world-class winger <b>[John Robertson]</b>. He beat a couple of players, whipped it in and then Gary Birtles or <a href="tony-woodcock.html">Tony Woodcock</a> headed it into the net. I am sure <a href="zico.html">Zico</a> would also have played in a side that can also get the ball out wide and beat players. I thought it was part of the game.<br /><br />I don’t know whether what <a href="zico.html">Zico</a> said was a criticism. The fact they were unable to stop a world-class player like Young from doing what is allowed on the pitch might tell me something. I don’t accept <a href="zico.html">Zico</a>’s point because one of the outstanding players the other night was a central midfielder for us called Stiliyan Petrov. He got the ball down and played through them, took it off them and ran past them. He did all of those things. It is a cop-out. I don’t accept what he has said. If getting it wide and someone beating three or four players exhilarates the crowd, I don’t see a great deal wrong with it.<br /><br /><b>[O’Neill also countered the criticism that the Villans’ style of play is predictable]</b> We are not one-dimensional. Far from it - and I wouldn’t go and tell Moscow how to play</p>

  <p><b>[Martin O’Neill has rejected accusations that he prostituted himself in trying to convince Aston Villa midfielder Jack Grealish to represent Republic of Ireland rather than England]</b> I never prostituted myself in any way, shape or form trying to get Jack Grealish. I never chased him at all and I think Jack Grealish and his father would readily admit that. In fact, actually I was accused of the other thing, of not chasing it up. Jack Grealish had a decision to make. He was born in England, his father was born in England and therefore he made a decision to play in England, so that is it. It is absolutely and utterly his and his father’s decision to do that, so it is fine. Jack has really good talent - a really fine player and of course it is a disappointment to lose out on that, but hopefully it’s not the end of the world.</p>

  <p><b>[O’Neill confident ahead of Euro 2016 qualifying play-offs]</b> After finishing third in a difficult qualifying group, we enter into the play-offs against a very good team in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I think they are strong and are coming good at the right time, but we’re going in with confidence. Our fate is in our own hands and we will be doing all that we can to qualify for next summer’s finals. We will play the second leg at the Aviva Stadium and that is a big plus for us because the Irish supporters were fantastic in our last game there against Germany and we know that there will be a similar atmosphere for this play-off.</p>

  <p><b>[Republic of Ireland manager Martin O’Neill refused to get carried away in the wake of his side’s impressive 1-1 draw against Bosnia-Herzegovina in Zenica]</b> The tie is still alive and the goal we scored helped greatly, but conceding the goal at the end has just put a bit of a dampener on things. The pitch was very lively tonight and we tried to cope with it as best we could and cope with the opposition at the same time. And we are still fighting. We’ve still got a battle to come on Monday night.<br /><br /><b>[O’Neill went on to admit that he failed to get a decent view of Brady’s opening goal due to the thick fog that blanketed the stadium]</b> I didn’t see a great deal of the goal. I was concerned at one stage in the second half that the game might be called off because of the fog. But the assistant referee on our side said that he could see things pretty clearly which was news to me at the time! Robbie has done brilliantly to score the goal<br /><br />The most important thing is that we are still in the tie. There’s another battle to come and I think the players are ready for it</p>

  <p><b>[John O’Shea and Shane Long remain in contention for the second leg of Republic of Ireland’s Euro 2016 play-off against Bosnia-Herzegovina]</b> John has done a significant amount of work during the week, Shane perhaps less so. The very fact that they’re here is good news for us and we’ll see how they feel. I think both are upbeat. I have to keep in mind that they haven’t played in the last couple of weeks, but of course, I have to also keep in mind players being fresh again and a few other considerations as well.<br /><br />I think that we have to try and win the game. That’s it. That has to be in our mind. I think Bosnia are capable of scoring. I think any team is capable of getting a goal. The ultimate goal doesn’t change - trying to get to France. For ourselves and Bosnia it remains the same. They’ll have been delighted with the equalising goal and the game is finely balanced</p>

  <p><b>[Republic of Ireland manager Martin O’Neill says appointing Roy Keane as his assistant ranks among his best decisions after seeing his team qualify for Euro 2016]</b> Talking about big decisions, bringing Roy Keane in is as good a decision I’ve made in some time. He’s been enormous for us. He’s not taking many of the accolades, but he’s been fantastic for me, the backroom staff, and of course the players.<br /><br />I couldn’t be more proud of them they’ve been fantastic from the start way. I’m thinking way back in Georgia from Aiden McGeady’s late winner. I always felt those points might be important so they proved. The points against Germany were fantastic. I hold my players in the highest esteem. They might lack some things, but fight and courage until the end they possess in abundance</p>

They haven’t dropped down the rankings that much so you’re talking about them, the top-ranked team in the world and Sweden. It’s very difficult. They are games to look forward to for the fans but it’s tough for us. I thought I was going to enjoy the draw but I am not so sure I have done.<br /><br />Now you know what you’re up against, you can take the time to study players individually. By the time you get there you should know everything about them. It’s a maze but we’ll get down to plotting something<br /><br />No I don’t think so. I watched some of their games in the play-offs and they were quite strong. And Ibahimovic is a top-class player</p>

  <p><b>[Martin O’Neill has insisted that the Republic of Ireland’s upcoming friendly games against Switzerland and Slovakia present an opportunity for fringe players to stake a claim for a place in his squad for Euro 2016]</b> Some of the players might think it’s their first chance. Some of the players who have been in and around the squad who have not had much playing time. In fact, players like Alan Judge for instance, who has had no playing time. He’s done exceptionally well. There’s one or two players i’d like to start. If they don’t start against Switzerland, they’ll start against Slovakia. It is an opportunity. It’s an experimental time I feel, but at the same time I don’t want to waste these opportunities.<br /><br />I feel that the players, they’ll want to belong to it, they’ll want to get there. And that’ll be one of the hardest jobs, actually picking the 23. Now, you may say to me, and I may well agree, that there are a number of players who are absolutely nailed on, injury apart, <b>[players]</b> who have been a massive part of this journey and who have done brilliantly and there is no reason not to select them. But there are still places up for grabs and perhaps this is an opportunity here. And at least it’s international football, it’s against good calibre opposition and why not take that chance?</p>

It’s not ideal, and of course people will at this stage have paid a lot of money to get tickets and get sorted out, so if it comes to that it’s going to be very difficult to deal with. But if that’s the only solution then we may have to go with it. I’ll see, it’s obviously been sprung on us now at this moment and there might be different thoughts getting closer to the next few weeks</p>

  <p><b>[Ireland can draw inspiration from Leicester City at Euro 2016]</b> I think they are the standard bearers for the smaller side, as it were, and I just think that they’ve given people hope now that you can compete. In order to compete, you have to actually be successful but does that mean that just because they go on and win the league, does a smaller nation go on and win the European Championship? I’m not terribly sure about that.<br /><br />When the draw was made we had an opportunity at one stage, or we were in line to be drawn with lesser lights. But as I said before, I think with Italy, with what they’ve done in world football, I’m not so sure as if they feel as if they’re a Pot Two team as it were, so effectively you’re looking at Italy and Belgium as Pot One teams. With that said, we’ve had our moments and it’s over now so we’ll just get ready for it. I think after <b>[beating<b>[Germany the players feel as if they’re capable of dealing with that. Do we want to go in as underdogs? I think we will naturally anyway but I don’t think it’ll bother us<br /><br />I don’t think they will <b>[underestimate Ireland]</b>.

He’s had some scans which proved to be negative which is good, and Ciaran Clark is not completely right but improving. They may not play in the game <b>[on Friday]</b>. I think that both in normal circumstances would like to get some training done before they step in to the game, but if they haven’t trained by tomorrow, I think I’m more or less likely not to put them into that game.<br /><br />Obviously there’s a couple of players that haven’t played an awful lot in centre midfield and that might be an area where we would certainly be having a look, and maybe wait until the second game <b>[before naming the final squad.]</b>. We may have to take one forward out but we’ve got some time as well too but we’ll have a look. With these players here at international level, they give up their time and energy and want to be involved, and it certainly wouldn’t be for the money, it’s for the glory.<br /><br />I’ve a few decisions to make, whether it’s at the weekend or whether we wait until the last couple of hours after the Belarus game, there will be disappointment and it certainly wouldn’t be easy for that reason, because these are international players who want to play for their country</p>

Naturally if you want to trace it back, I think the goal against Germany in October was a massive boost. It is something special when you score the winning goal against the world champions, you would walk back to the club on a natural high. He’s taken hold of his game, obviously got a bit of confidence from somewhere and he’s trying to play how a centre forward would play.

It has been an absolute privilege to have been in charge of the Republic of Ireland national team, these last 30 months, and we go to France tomorrow in good spirits, with a strong desire to do well in the next few weeks. The players have done brilliantly in the campaign so far and they are ready for the big challenges ahead.</p>

  <p><b>[Martin O’Neill says that he is happy to trust Football Association of Ireland <b>[FAI]</b> chief John Delaney over his new contract]</b> We’ve agreed new deals - it’s a done deal - and we want to stay on now. When I was speaking to John Delaney, John felt just for clarification really as much as anything else so that we could go <b>[to Euro 2016]</b> with a free mind. And <b>[I’m]</b> happy to do so. I’ve been mulling it over for some time and just wanted to do it.<br /><br />The very fact that we haven’t put pen to paper is no intrusion whatsoever. If memory serves me correctly, two and a half years ago when John asked me to sign up we did so on the shaking of one’s hand and I think we actually might have signed to contract about six or seven weeks later.<br /><br />It was something like that, but it certainly wasn’t in the day that I agreed to do it and here we are two and a half years later. I will have to assume that the same thing will apply to both parties..<br /><br />That was really nice actually. Because when you have an open training session outside your own country you would wonder at how well it might be attended and it was great.</p>

  <p><b>[Martin O’Neill says Republic of Ireland must take inspiration from their extraordinary win over Germany as they prepare for a pivotal Euro 2016 clash with Italy]</b> We’ve got our own recent memories to inspire us, none more so than when we beat the world champions on a night that we had to win. It was an extraordinary result. It was inspirational enough for us to go to beat Bosnia over two games in the play-offs. It’s that set of players that gave us the opportunity to come here, and as much as we’ve enjoyed these few days, we want to stay here a bit longer.<br /><br />I think the most important thing is to be really positive. We started rather tentatively against Belgium and we felt we gave the ball away too easily, which was a disappointment coming off the brilliant performance against Sweden. We want to start on the front foot and I think everything else will fall into place.<br /><br />I have to take into consideration the fitness and freshness of the players who have played a lot. Energy is very important to the team. Eventually you need creativity as well, we have a number of players capable of going past players. I take all that into consideration.<br /><br />We don’t want the game to run away from us early on, but I’m sure it won’t. We just have to try to get back the momentum from the Sweden game and take one or two more chances. Italy will be very dangerous, regardless of any changes. The players coming in are from Roma, AC Milan - big places. We have to be ready for that. I think that we are.<br /><br />If you narrow it down to the rudiments of things, when we set out we felt we had to win a game and maybe get another point. So we have to win the match. There’s good confidence about the team. They have to fight for everything and cut out the mistakes made against Belgium, not be caught out when attacking.<br /><br />I looked at it from a distance over the last 20 years but the fans have always come in big numbers and been brilliantly behaved. We had a full house in the Stade de France, 80,000, and people walking together in green and yellow shirts.<br /><br />Hopefully these are not famous last words but the Irish fans have been great and they’re welcome at most tournaments. The players did a lot of good in the Sweden game and we have to return to that because these fans have spent money to support the side. We want to do something to reward them. They’re terrific, always have been</p>

With some of the bigger nations, it is a bit like it the FA when top sides didn’t want to travel to non-league sides in case they were embarrassed.<br /><br />We’re in a difficult group and we don’t want to go out of the competition before it starts in that sense.
