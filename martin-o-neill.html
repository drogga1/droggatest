  <p><b>[Martin O’Neill Refutes CSKA Moscow Boss <a href="zico.html">Zico</a>’s <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> Allegation]</b> Funnily enough, <a href="ashley-young.html">Ashley Young</a> didn’t play against Wigan recently and someone said then that all we did was get it out wide for <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a> to lob in a couple of hopeful balls.<br /><br />I knew the way CSKA were going to play. But I wouldn’t be running around telling them whether how they play is good, bad or indifferent. When I was at <a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a>, we won the league championship and two European Cups - which I don’t think CSKA Moscow have won - by getting the ball out wide to a world-class winger <b>[John Robertson]</b>. He beat a couple of players, whipped it in and then Gary Birtles or <a href="tony-woodcock.html">Tony Woodcock</a> headed it into the net. I am sure <a href="zico.html">Zico</a> would also have played in a side that can also get the ball out wide and beat players. I thought it was part of the game.<br /><br />I don’t know whether what <a href="zico.html">Zico</a> said was a criticism. The fact they were unable to stop a world-class player like Young from doing what is allowed on the pitch might tell me something. I don’t accept <a href="zico.html">Zico</a>’s point because one of the outstanding players the other night was a central midfielder for us called Stiliyan Petrov. He got the ball down and played through them, took it off them and ran past them. He did all of those things. It is a cop-out. I don’t accept what he has said. If getting it wide and someone beating three or four players exhilarates the crowd, I don’t see a great deal wrong with it.<br /><br /><b>[O’Neill also countered the criticism that the Villans’ style of play is predictable]</b> We are not one-dimensional. Far from it - and I wouldn’t go and tell Moscow how to play</p>

  <p><b>[Martin O’Neill has rejected accusations that he prostituted himself in trying to convince Aston Villa midfielder Jack Grealish to represent Republic of Ireland rather than England]</b> I never prostituted myself in any way, shape or form trying to get Jack Grealish. I never chased him at all and I think Jack Grealish and his father would readily admit that. In fact, actually I was accused of the other thing, of not chasing it up. Jack Grealish had a decision to make. He was born in England, his father was born in England and therefore he made a decision to play in England, so that is it. It is absolutely and utterly his and his father’s decision to do that, so it is fine. Jack has really good talent - a really fine player and of course it is a disappointment to lose out on that, but hopefully it’s not the end of the world.</p>

  <p><b>[O’Neill confident ahead of Euro 2016 qualifying play-offs]</b> After finishing third in a difficult qualifying group, we enter into the play-offs against a very good team in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I think they are strong and are coming good at the right time, but we’re going in with confidence. Our fate is in our own hands and we will be doing all that we can to qualify for next summer’s finals. We will play the second leg at the Aviva Stadium and that is a big plus for us because the Irish supporters were fantastic in our last game there against Germany and we know that there will be a similar atmosphere for this play-off.</p>

  <p><b>[Republic of Ireland manager Martin O’Neill refused to get carried away in the wake of his side’s impressive 1-1 draw against Bosnia-Herzegovina in Zenica]</b> The tie is still alive and the goal we scored helped greatly, but conceding the goal at the end has just put a bit of a dampener on things. The pitch was very lively tonight and we tried to cope with it as best we could and cope with the opposition at the same time. And we are still fighting. We’ve still got a battle to come on Monday night.<br /><br /><b>[O’Neill went on to admit that he failed to get a decent view of Brady’s opening goal due to the thick fog that blanketed the stadium]</b> I didn’t see a great deal of the goal. I was concerned at one stage in the second half that the game might be called off because of the fog. But the assistant referee on our side said that he could see things pretty clearly which was news to me at the time! Robbie has done brilliantly to score the goal<br /><br />The most important thing is that we are still in the tie. There’s another battle to come and I think the players are ready for it</p>

The very fact that they’re here is good news for us and we’ll see how they feel. I think both are upbeat. I have to keep in mind that they haven’t played in the last couple of weeks, but of course, I have to also keep in mind players being fresh again and a few other considerations as well.<br /><br />I think that we have to try and win the game. That’s it. That has to be in our mind. I think Bosnia are capable of scoring. I think any team is capable of getting a goal. The ultimate goal doesn’t change - trying to get to France. For ourselves and Bosnia it remains the same. They’ll have been delighted with the equalising goal and the game is finely balanced</p>

He’s been enormous for us. He’s not taking many of the accolades, but he’s been fantastic for me, the backroom staff, and of course the players.<br /><br />I couldn’t be more proud of them they’ve been fantastic from the start way. I’m thinking way back in Georgia from Aiden McGeady’s late winner. I always felt those points might be important so they proved. The points against Germany were fantastic. I hold my players in the highest esteem. They might lack some things, but fight and courage until the end they possess in abundance</p>

They are games to look forward to for the fans but it’s tough for us. I thought I was going to enjoy the draw but I am not so sure I have done.<br /><br />Now you know what you’re up against, you can take the time to study players individually. By the time you get there you should know everything about them. It’s a maze but we’ll get down to plotting something<br /><br />No I don’t think so. I watched some of their games in the play-offs and they were quite strong. And Ibahimovic is a top-class player</p>

  <p><b>[Martin O’Neill has insisted that the Republic of Ireland’s upcoming friendly games against Switzerland and Slovakia present an opportunity for fringe players to stake a claim for a place in his squad for Euro 2016]</b> Some of the players might think it’s their first chance. Some of the players who have been in and around the squad who have not had much playing time. In fact, players like Alan Judge for instance, who has had no playing time. He’s done exceptionally well. There’s one or two players i’d like to start. If they don’t start against Switzerland, they’ll start against Slovakia. It is an opportunity. It’s an experimental time I feel, but at the same time I don’t want to waste these opportunities.<br /><br />I feel that the players, they’ll want to belong to it, they’ll want to get there. And that’ll be one of the hardest jobs, actually picking the 23. Now, you may say to me, and I may well agree, that there are a number of players who are absolutely nailed on, injury apart, <b>[players]</b> who have been a massive part of this journey and who have done brilliantly and there is no reason not to select them. But there are still places up for grabs and perhaps this is an opportunity here. And at least it’s international football, it’s against good calibre opposition and why not take that chance?</p>

It’s not ideal, and of course people will at this stage have paid a lot of money to get tickets and get sorted out, so if it comes to that it’s going to be very difficult to deal with. But if that’s the only solution then we may have to go with it. I’ll see, it’s obviously been sprung on us now at this moment and there might be different thoughts getting closer to the next few weeks</p>

  <p><b>[Ireland can draw inspiration from Leicester City at Euro 2016]</b> I think they are the standard bearers for the smaller side, as it were, and I just think that they’ve given people hope now that you can compete. In order to compete, you have to actually be successful but does that mean that just because they go on and win the league, does a smaller nation go on and win the European Championship? I’m not terribly sure about that.<br /><br />When the draw was made we had an opportunity at one stage, or we were in line to be drawn with lesser lights. But as I said before, I think with Italy, with what they’ve done in world football, I’m not so sure as if they feel as if they’re a Pot Two team as it were, so effectively you’re looking at Italy and Belgium as Pot One teams. With that said, we’ve had our moments and it’s over now so we’ll just get ready for it. I think after <b>[beating<b>[Germany the players feel as if they’re capable of dealing with that.

He’s very strong; he’s much stronger than he was five years ago, a quality player, hard to rob. You would hope that, at the end, Villa would have enough to pull themselves around and see it through. Of course, if you’re depending on one player, which they have been over the past couple of months, that can cause a problem</p>

  <p><b>[Martin O’Neill has praised <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a>’s progress under <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a>]</b> Do I think that <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> can make the Champions League? Oh, very much so. They are in a terrific position. They have played very, very well, they have played a nice brand of football as well. So, good credit to the manager, Brendan, he’s done very well there. Their season when they won the league was absolutely and utterly incredible. I suppose it takes the shine away from our particular years there, finishing in the top 10 for about four consecutive seasons and winning a couple of EFL Cups. But overall, <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> are a very fine footballing team. They are competing. They are competing financially in the market as well. They are pretty astute, they got a lot of money from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> for the centre-back <b>[<a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a>]</b> and then used it accordingly. Of course, winning the league a couple of seasons ago has escalated into some sort of stardom anyway, if not super-stardom. They are a team to be reckoned with, no question about that</p>

  <p><b>[Martin O’Neill says Any manager would take 11 James Milners in their side]</b> Perhaps I took it too personally when he wanted to leave because we were getting a lot of money for him from <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. At the end of the day he was consistently excellent for us. We were doubling our money but he was irreplaceable for me. James was going there to further his career and certainly further his future financially. But to me, we were trying to compete with the likes of City and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> at that particular point in time. Maybe another season and we might have done it. It was disappointing. But I’ve got to say, I could not be more pleased for him for getting the career and the medals he so thoroughly deserves<br /><br />James just covered so much ground. He is like the identikit pro. He doesn’t drink. He puts everything into his training and his game. He’s put football at the top of his list of priorities so it’s certainly no coincidence he’s still going strong. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s played him in virtually every position at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. You’d take 11 James Milners in your side if that were possible. I tried to get him first and on deadline day he was less than three miles from Villa’s training ground and he was told to go back. He would have been very cheap then - about £4m, if I recall. I chased him again and kept going and when things weren’t working out for him at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> we paid £12m for him. Not bad business</p>

  <p><b>[O’Neill fears Villa are running out of games]</b> With that victory the other day if they had maybe another six or seven games left then I think that could be a massive turning point, a big victory. Any victory is big and the three points but it’s just the number of games left that makes it fraught with difficulty. Villa know what they have to do to get out, they have to win their matches, they really have to win their games. They were on the front foot against <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>, they avoided the possibility of a goal against them early on, they had a bit of luck with VAR. They came through that game and won the match. That first victory is very, very important and they have definitely given themselves a chance. It’s just the running out of games is something that is naturally a problem</p>
