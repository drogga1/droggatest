  <p><b>[Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour has promised supporters there is much more to come following the 10th anniversary of his takeover, adamant they are still only half way up our Everest]</b> So, what do the next ten years hold? I know you all remain ambitious and so do I. It feels that we are only half way up our Everest. There is much more to do and there is much more to win. That is why you will continue to see us strive to recruit the very best talent into this club and its sister organisations in all functions and at all levels. Khaldoon <b>[Al Mubarak, City chairman]</b> and I know that we will not get everything right all the time. As we continue on this journey I would ask you to please always bear with us and please be assured that, even when we stumble, we will try to remain true to our values and to make you proud of what we do and how we do it on your behalf</p>
