  <p><b>[Nasser Al Khelaifi has hailed Paris Saint-Germain’s 4-0 victory over Barcelona]</b> We are not here to send a message to anyone. But it was very important to win this match and it was a fantastic win. To beat the best, with the best player in the world, Barcelona 4-0, it’s very difficult - almost impossible. We had a fantastic match. The coach, the players, the staff, the fans - they were amazing. The first half has finished but there is another half. There are another 95 minutes to play which will be much more difficult than tonight, so we have to be ready. Tonight we’re going to celebrate a little bit but then we are going to be ready.</p>

Edi feels great in Paris and has a veritable love affair with the club, the fans and the city.

As well as being a fantastic player, Marquinhos is an extremely nice guy and always has a great attitude. Since he arrived in Paris, Marquinhos has developed a very strong relationship with our club, the fans and the city whose colours we proudly wear. In four years, he has continually grown in our team and we have seen him become, little by little, one of the best defenders in the world, even though he is still very young. Marquinhos deeply believes in Paris Saint-Germain’s ability to satisfy his ambitions and take him to the summit of international football.</p>

I’m sure we’ll make more money than we’ve paid.<br /><br />For people worrying about FFP, go and have a coffee, there are no problems. We have been very transparent from day one on FFP.

  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has claimed that the club fought off fierce competition for the signature of Kylian Mbappe but eventually landed the wonderkid for less than their rivals offered]</b> It was very competitive, trust me. Some other clubs offered him more than us. Every big club wanted him. But we explained to him our project and the ambition of the club and he’s French, he’s a Parisian and he had the club in his heart. He wanted to stay in France and defends the French colours in the Champions League. It’s deep inside him. He wants to write history here and he has history here already - you saw the pictures of him <b>[at his unveiling]</b> when he was here 10 years ago? A picture does not lie. He loves the club and it’s his dream to play for Paris Saint-Germain.<br /><br />There is pressure from other clubs <b>[to investigate]</b> but I don’t think Uefa will be influenced by the pressure because they are very professional and very serious. Today we have a good problem to solve - we don’t have enough jerseys! This is huge for us. I was in the US last week and I saw the jersey of Paris Saint-Germain everywhere. It is the same in Asia and Latin America, the Middle East.<br /><br />Neymar is an international superstar. An international brand. Everybody is asking ‘What’s going on in France and in the French league? Neymar is playing for Paris Saint-Germain!’ Even people who are not interested in football are saying that.<br /><br />Neymar’s first match in Guingamp was broadcast to 183 countries. It was amazing for France and the French league. It is good also for the Champions League because you will have another club competing - I am not saying by any means we are there yet - but it’s important to have new clubs coming and clubs with ambition</p>

Last year it was against Barcelona, ​​this year it’s against Real. Ok, Real Madrid are a great team, but that’s enough now, UEFA must do something. The referee was more <b>[in favour of]</b> Real than us. I’m not saying that we lost because of the referee, because things were clear, but there are small details that change a lot, especially Adrien Rabiot’s yellow card. It’s not a yellow card, that’s for sure, UEFA must do something, it’s not possible for football to continue like this. We will appeal <b>[Rabiot’s suspension]</b>. Kylian Mbappe was called offside incorrectly as well. The result was not fair, I think we played better in the second half and we had our chances to score, but made mistakes<br /><br />I don’t think it was a bad match for us. We finished 90 minutes, but there are still 90 minutes at home to be played. We still have a lot of chances to qualify. When it was 1-1, we could have scored the second goal. I believe in my players and my coach, we will qualify. We had a very good second period. We’ll do everything to trace and reach the quarter-finals. It will be very hard for Madrid</p>

They know where our money comes from, we don’t have any debts and we’ve given them guarantees. Other clubs in other leagues have debts. If you go to Spain, for example, there are many clubs in debt.

  <p><b>[<a href="psg.html">PSG</a> president Al-Khelaifi confident name will be cleared in latest bribery case]</b> After an exhaustive three-year investigation, where I have fully and openly cooperated with the Public Prosecutor in Switzerland, I am pleased that all charges of bribery in connection with the 2026 and 2030 World Cups have been dropped<br /><br />As I have said vehemently and repeatedly for three years, the charges have not - and have never had - any basis whatsoever, either in fact or law. It is now - finally - indisputable fact that the 2026 and 2030 agreements were negotiated at arms lengths and without any improper influence in any form.<br /><br />After the most forensic public, private, lawful and unlawful scrutiny of all my dealings, I have been cleared of all suspicions of bribery and the case has been dismissed definitively and conclusively. While a secondary technical charge remains outstanding, I have every expectation that this will be proven completely groundless and without any substance whatsoever, in the same way as the primary case.<br /><br />While I have cooperated with all authorities during the legal process, the three-year investigation has been characterised by constant leaks, misinformation and a seemingly relentless agenda to smear my reputation in the media - completely irrespective of the facts and the notion of due process.<br /><br />For that reason, I have requested the relevant Swiss authorities to open a criminal enquiry into the conduct of the investigation. I also reserve the right to take action against certain media who for three years have repeatedly published factually-unsupported and highly damaging articles, often based on illegally-sourced and - quite remarkably in some cases - faked and fabricated materials, to satisfy their narrative of my supposed guilt</p>
