For a year now, Thomas has been bringing fantastic energy to the daily life of the club, not only for the players, but for the whole of Paris Saint-Germain. Our supporters immediately took to this coach who is always keen to share his analysis and emotions with as many people as possible. Thomas is a huge football fan and a very demanding manager who also listens to others.

  <p><b>[Leonardo returns to PSG to replace Antero Henrique as sporting director]</b> It is always a special moment to see Leonardo return to Paris Saint-Germain. ‘Leo’ has a place in our club’s history and we all know the role he played as sporting director at the start of our project. Paris Saint-Germain has always remained his family and we are delighted to welcome him back. His return, with his enthusiasm and talent, will bring the club into a new ambitious cycle and I am sure that this reunion will bring happiness to the Parc des Princes, which has always kept’Leo’ in its heart.<br /><br />Paris Saint-Germain and Antero Henrique have decided to terminate their agreement by mutual consent. In his two seasons as sporting director since joining Paris Saint-Germain on 2 June 2017, the Portuguese helped the men’s senior team to the Ligue 1 title in 2018 and 2019, the Coupe de France and Coupe de la Ligue wins in 2018 as well as the Trophee des Champions in 2017 and 2018. The club thanks Antero Henrique for his professionalism and commitment over the past two years and wishes him all the best for his future projects</p>

Now it’s official: PSG’s Project Neymar has failed. Paris Saint-Germain’s investment in Neymar is unprecedented in the history of the sport - some €222 million paid in a transfer fee to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> plus a reported €700,000 per week contract. And while PSG won the French Ligue 1 title yet again, the season overall cannot be said to have been a success for the club or for the world’s most expensive player ever</p>

Under Nasser Al-Khelaifi’s guidance, which has been bankrolled to a lavish degree, PSG have been able to establish unprecedented dominance over the French domestic game but have persistently fallen short in continental competition. one unnamed source close to the case told ‘In Doha, they are not worried. They are 1000% in support of Nasser and believe he will come out of it untouched’</p>

  <p><b>[PSG president Al-Khelaifi confident name will be cleared in latest bribery case]</b> After an exhaustive three-year investigation, where I have fully and openly cooperated with the Public Prosecutor in Switzerland, I am pleased that all charges of bribery in connection with the 2026 and 2030 World Cups have been dropped<br /><br />As I have said vehemently and repeatedly for three years, the charges have not - and have never had - any basis whatsoever, either in fact or law. It is now - finally - indisputable fact that the 2026 and 2030 agreements were negotiated at arms lengths and without any improper influence in any form.<br /><br />After the most forensic public, private, lawful and unlawful scrutiny of all my dealings, I have been cleared of all suspicions of bribery and the case has been dismissed definitively and conclusively. While a secondary technical charge remains outstanding, I have every expectation that this will be proven completely groundless and without any substance whatsoever, in the same way as the primary case.<br /><br />While I have cooperated with all authorities during the legal process, the three-year investigation has been characterised by constant leaks, misinformation and a seemingly relentless agenda to smear my reputation in the media - completely irrespective of the facts and the notion of due process.<br /><br />For that reason, I have requested the relevant Swiss authorities to open a criminal enquiry into the conduct of the investigation. I also reserve the right to take action against certain media who for three years have repeatedly published factually-unsupported and highly damaging articles, often based on illegally-sourced and - quite remarkably in some cases - faked and fabricated materials, to satisfy their narrative of my supposed guilt</p>

Although he was only at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> for a short time, he had a transformative effect on our club. His investment in training, his concern for applying every detail at every moment, his determination to succeed, his taste for teamwork and his natural aura were extremely precious assets</p>
