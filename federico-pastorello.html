  <p><b>[Patrice Evra would have done anything to return to Manchester United]</b> There was contact between the player and Jose Mourinho. If there had been an opportunity to return, he would have done everything to go back to Manchester United. The key to part of the transfer to Marseille was the meeting with sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta.</p>

If they finish in the top four, I think he’ll be happy to remain and finally play in the Champions League.</p>

  <p><b>[Romelu Lukaku’s future is very open]</b> At the moment he is very focused on finishing the season. The competition for a third and fourth place in England is very tight so let’s see what will happen in the future at the end the season. It’s his second season here and he will still have three years on his contract until the end. Let’s see. He’s someone who loves to know a different culture, a different football. He sees a way to have a career playing in different countries because he would like to win some trophies and prove himself and say to his children ‘I won there and I won there and I won there’ and ‘I was a very good player in all the top championships’ so let’s see, the future is really very open but, at the moment, we don’t discuss that because really the season is in a big moment.<br /><br />He likes Italy. When he was a child he followed a lot the Italian league. Everybody agrees today the Premier League is the best but years ago Italy was the best and they were the dreams for the younger footballer players. Teams like Real Madrid and Barcelona, of course, attract any champion so he sees also in La Liga one day. Bundesliga for sure is a very good championship<br /><br />In this period what he appreciates a lot about the manager is he was keeping him involved with a lot of attention. That is normal with the level of the player but sometimes managers are not so used to doing it anyway. Once he had the opportunity he scored goals so he was important when not starting and when he got the opportunity to start, he scored <b>[three games in a row]</b>. He was amazing in the victory against Paris Saint-Germain so now we think he’s back on his place</p>

  <p><b>[Romelu Lukaku’s agent Federico Pastorello says Manchester United will be able to convince top players]</b> I think Manchester United will have a lot of success in the summer bringing in players. There will be a lot of work for Mr <b>[Ed]</b> Woodward but they will be able to convince the top players to come because the brand is amazing, one of the best in the world.<br /><br />One of the top movers, in my opinion, will be Real Madrid. For two summers they did not spend much but they have called back <b>[Zinedine]</b> Zidane and there will be a big revolution. The team needs to be younger so there will be a domino effect from that. I expect a very interesting market<br /><br />The Neymar case is one I understand more because he is like a cash machine with image rights and sponsors. I was more shocked about the fee paid for <b>[Ousmane]</b> Dembele. This shocked me more than Neymar. Chelsea paid 80 million for a goalkeeper <b>[Kepa Arrizabalaga]</b> who was at Bilbao and not at Madrid! I think this is the trend for the next four or five years. After that, if you ask me if it will keep going, I have my personal doubts but there has to be a limit to everything. It’s like the stock exchange, like a wave going up and down</p>

  <p><b>[Romelu <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>’s agent, Federico Pastorello, has admitted to being ashamed of Italian football in the wake of Corriere dello Sport’s ‘Black Friday’ headline]</b> Being Italian I’m really ashamed to read a title like that but I really don’t want to talk about a single episode. At the end of the day the racist problem is a big problem. Unfortunately we are living in 1920. It’s really a culture problem. Being an agent we are trying to protect our clients from this huge problem because it’s not only a newspaper but it’s a problem you can breathe in the stadium, in social media, on the street. I think it’s a problem that is a culture problem. What I would like and wish for the future is institutions could take it more serious. There were some episodes in Champions League recently, also in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> games and the institution did not take so seriously the problem<br /><br /><b>[On <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>’s reaction to the headline]</b> He is very sensitive on this problem. I like his attitude because he’s facing it every time with strength and power. Not for him but the other players who are weaker than him and can’t (impact on the issue). For sure he is not happy about that but he’s strong enough to face it</p>

  <p><b>[Federico Pastorello says <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> deserves to play for a top club]</b> I think he really deserves a new challenge and a top club, because he is really a top player. It is surprising me because I read about a possible move in the summer but he stayed again. But this season he is proving that he is very focused and concentrated, so think he could be another good opportunity in the January market. The January market can <b>[usually]</b> be really calm. As the number of transfers there is about one third as many than in the summer. But there are some very good and interesting opportunities for the clubs that sell, because maybe a club really needs that player and is ready to pay a little bit more because of emergency.<br /><br />There have been a lot of changes in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> in terms of managers.

I think a player like that, out of contract is an amazing opportunity, even maybe for January. Every player really wants to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at least once.

He liked the fans a lot. For sure, Man United is, I don’t want to see most important, but in the top three clubs in the world. He was happy about that. But I think he wanted to prove himself in another championship. He needed another challenge. The relationship with Ole at the end was good. There were maybe some issues tactically because he’s a No.9 striker and maybe sometimes in that position the coach preferred another amazing player that was <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>.
