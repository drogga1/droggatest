  <p><b>[Romelu Lukaku’s agent Federico Pastorello insists that Inter are serious about signing the Manchester United striker. After meeting Nerazzurri officials regarding Lukaku on Wednesday]</b> Nothing new <b>[to report]</b>. We met each other to understand better the situation. We will see what <b>[Inter]</b> is going to decide. It is not on us. If the player wants to move <b>[to Inter]</b> they need to hurry. He <b>[Lukaku]</b> is a true target. It doesn’t mean it will be official. I think that the deal is not simple to reach, anyway.</p>

  <p><b>[Romelu Lukaku has hinted at an update on his situation at Manchester United, with the Belgian striker continuing to be heavily linked with a move to Intermilan]</b> We’ve improved our selection of forwards and reached the apex with Lukaku, who is one of the three-four best strikers in the world<br /><br /><b>[Back in April, when exit rumours first surfaced, Pastorello]</b> It’s his second season here and he will still have three years on his contract until the end. Let’s see. He’s someone who loves to know a different culture, a different football. He sees a way to have a career playing in different countries because he would like to win some trophies and prove himself and say to his children ‘I won there and I won there and I won there’ and ‘I was a very good player in all the top championships’ so let’s see, the future is really very open</p>

  <p><b>[Romelu <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>’s agent, Federico Pastorello, has admitted to being ashamed of Italian football in the wake of Corriere dello Sport’s ‘Black Friday’ headline]</b> Being Italian I’m really ashamed to read a title like that but I really don’t want to talk about a single episode. At the end of the day the racist problem is a big problem. Unfortunately we are living in 1920. It’s really a culture problem. Being an agent we are trying to protect our clients from this huge problem because it’s not only a newspaper but it’s a problem you can breathe in the stadium, in social media, on the street. I think it’s a problem that is a culture problem. What I would like and wish for the future is institutions could take it more serious. There were some episodes in Champions League recently, also in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> games and the institution did not take so seriously the problem<br /><br /><b>[On <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>’s reaction to the headline]</b> He is very sensitive on this problem. I like his attitude because he’s facing it every time with strength and power. Not for him but the other players who are weaker than him and can’t (impact on the issue). For sure he is not happy about that but he’s strong enough to face it</p>

  <p><b>[Federico Pastorello says <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> deserves to play for a top club]</b> I think he really deserves a new challenge and a top club, because he is really a top player. It is surprising me because I read about a possible move in the summer but he stayed again. But this season he is proving that he is very focused and concentrated, so think he could be another good opportunity in the January market. The January market can <b>[usually]</b> be really calm. As the number of transfers there is about one third as many than in the summer. But there are some very good and interesting opportunities for the clubs that sell, because maybe a club really needs that player and is ready to pay a little bit more because of emergency.<br /><br />There have been a lot of changes in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> in terms of managers. Sometimes when you do that you need to face his needs tactically. So expect maybe <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> being a bit more protagonist in the market, maybe <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> too. Let’s see what happens in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> too, because the ban is not sure. If they remove that they may need to do something.

He is out of contract <b>[in the summer]</b>. He is an amazing player. I think he will be soon the best scorer in the history of the club. He has proven himself in the Champions League because he scored in that competition and the national team. I think a player like that, out of contract is an amazing opportunity, even maybe for January. Every player really wants to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at least once. So I think he would be very happy to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I know him very well tactically and technically and I think he can be successful player for the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[Lukaku’s agent admits <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> contributed to Belgian’s <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> departure]</b> He was happy at Man United. He liked the fans a lot. For sure, Man United is, I don’t want to see most important, but in the top three clubs in the world. He was happy about that. But I think he wanted to prove himself in another championship. He needed another challenge. The relationship with Ole at the end was good. There were maybe some issues tactically because he’s a No.9 striker and maybe sometimes in that position the coach preferred another amazing player that was <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>. So the fact he moved was not down to some particular issue with Man United, he wanted to try a new experience</p>
