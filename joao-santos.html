  <p><b>[Manchester United have yet to make any contact regarding a mooted move for Jorginho]</b> As a player for one of the most important national teams, and a club fighting for the Scudetto, it’s clear he’ll be looked at by these clubs. I’ve spoken with <b>[Napoli sporting director Cristiano]</b> Giuntoli three times in recent months, he hasn’t told me anything, but I haven’t had any contact with United. He <b>[Jorginho]</b> has two years on his contract and negotiations <b>[for a renewal]</b> will begin for that reason, because it becomes dangerous and then expires. We’re not thinking about it right now, but we will do later<br /><br />If a player like <b>[Lucas]</b> Torreira arrives from Sampdoria, then that will require an important investment and Jorginho could be sacrificed to make way</p>

  <p><b>[Jorginho’s agent confirms interest from ‘several clubs’ as Man Utd &amp; City circle]</b> I’ll talk with the club because Jorginho has another two years on his contract. But there are also several clubs interested in him, and we have to understand if Napoli want to move forward with their starters or not. At the moment all we know is that <b>[Pepe]</b> Reina will leave.</p>

  <p><b>[The agent of in-demand Napoli midfielder Jorginho claims he has yet to receive any offer from Manchester United]</b> Jorginho has done very well with Napoli, he plays for the Italian national team, he is unique in his characteristics and for those reasons he’s probably being followed by many teams. At the moment though there are a lot of rumours flying about. The Napoli coach and players are being approached by first one team then another, but there’s nothing official. The last thing I read is that Manchester United made a proposal through <b>[Jose]</b> Mourinho’s representative <b>[Jorge Mendes]</b>, but no-one called me.<br /><br />Everyone asks for information, but nobody has made any official offers so I can’t say which track is hotter. I’ve already been to all the English clubs because that’s my job, I get information. If he were to leave Napoli I can say that Jorginho wouldn’t play for any other team, even if he didn’t have any release clause<br /><br /><b>[a links to La Liga giants Barcelona played down]</b> That’s very difficult because they’ve signed Arthur from Gremio and he plays in the same role as Jorginho. I haven’t been to Barcelona.</p>

  <p><b>[Jorginho will make a summer move to Manchester City if the Premier League champions can agree a transfer fee with Napoli]</b> Jorginho is still under contract, but if Napoli find an agreement with City then he goes to Manchester. Finding an agreement with the English won’t be a problem, considering their importance, but I repeat it depends on Napoli as the player is tied to the Azzurri for two more years. City are champions of England and among Europe’s top clubs. Now we must stay calm. If Napoli and City find a solution, we can talk about it, otherwise the player will be happy to stay at Napoli. For now, I haven’t heard from anyone at Napoli because I imagine they’re busy planning for next season. I hope to hear from their director, and maybe he’ll be in Naples in the next few days to talk about Jorginho.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City have already seen a €50 million bid for Jorginho rejected]</b> If Napoli find an agreement with City, we will assess everything. Obviously, Manchester City would be very welcome, an opportunity not to be turned down. The coach is one of the best in Europe.</p>

  <p><b>[Jorginho ‘won’t be happy’ if Man City move falls through]</b> Jorginho is a Napoli player. Napoli and Manchester City have not yet reached an agreement, as there is around €10m distance between the demand and the offer. Now City are working on Plan B. The player is waiting for Napoli’s decision. He has another two years on his contract and we will not renew it. Jorginho’s contract is owned by De Laurentiis and, as of today, he remains a Napoli player. We won’t be hypocrites here, any player would love to go and play under Pep Guardiola. I don’t have to say anything to the president, as if he is convinced that it’s a good deal to sell, then he will. If he feels Jorge can continue to do a good job with Napoli, then he’ll aim to keep him. Jorginho is a professional, but this is the opportunity of a lifetime for him and his family. If he doesn’t go to Manchester City, he won’t be very happy.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City have a five-year contract waiting for Jorginho]</b> Jorginho is obviously willing to go to City, we’re waiting for the agreement between the clubs. There’s a five-year contract ready for the lad. If the agreement doesn’t arrive then obviously he’ll make himself available for Napoli. With the World Cup negotiations slow down a bit, but we hope the deal can be defined soon.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea have completed a deal to take Napoli’s Jorginho to Stamford Bridge]</b> Jorginho is good at Napoli, but there are negotiations with Manchester City and this is why we do not talk about a renewal. We are talking about a lad for whom Manchester City represents the opportunity of a lifetime</p>

  <p><b>[Jorginho’s impressive start at Chelsea has come as no surprise to his agent]</b> Jorginho has started his adventure at Chelsea very well. He’s already integrated himself, plus he also speaks English well, so he’s not having any problems settling. When a player is good, he can play in any League. Stereotypes matter little. If a player has quality, they can make the grade anywhere.<br /><br /><b>[Blues edge out Arsenal 3-2 in a London derby]</b> He’s very happy with how the match against Arsenal went. There were 50 Neapolitans who cheered him on and asked for photos and autographs. This is why we love Naples and we’ll continue to. Their support has continued in London. Jorginho has many friends in Naples, like <b>[Dries]</b> Mertens and <b>[Lorenzo]</b> Insigne. He heard from them after Napoli’s win against Lazio and complimented the team</p>

His debut with <b>[former Italy boss Giampiero]</b> Ventura surely wasn’t positive, but he slowly secured a spot in the starting eleven.
