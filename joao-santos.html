  <p><b>[Jorginho’s agent Joao Santos says his client previous spell at Napoli will not stop him from reuniting with <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a> at Serie A rivals Juventus]</b> Chelsea have a four-year contract with the lad. We’ll wait a few days to figure out whether there is any truth in this interest mentioned in the papers. His past at Napoli won’t be an issue, because Jorginho is a professional. Right now, Jorginho is happy at Chelsea. He found a great atmosphere and we can’t really say that he’d like to go elsewhere, but anything can happen in the transfer market. We’ll wait and see….<br /><br /><a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> already showed at Napoli and Chelsea that he is a top-level coach. At a club like Juve, who have been so well-organised for years, he can only improve and continue to win. I’ve been tracking <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> for five years and his style of football is very entertaining. Juventus will change, because before they would win without being convincing. Now they’ll convince too</p>

There are five years left on his contract and let’s say he’d like to stay for at least another four years</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea midfielder’s agent Joao Santos claims <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a> will ‘always have the desire’ to return to Serie A]</b> Anything is possible in football, he will always have the desire to come back. He acquired valuable experience in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and he would give a big contribution in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>. He could play for two or three sides that fight for the title<br /><br /><b>[Jorginho was, unsurprisingly, a favoured option for <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> during his debut campaign in west London]</b> It’s been a positive year for him. He’s doing well in the national team and can play the Euros. He always scores from a penalty, I’m very happy for him as he works hard and seriously every day. His debut with <b>[former Italy boss Giampiero]</b> Ventura surely wasn’t positive, but he slowly secured a spot in the starting eleven. Playing at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> counts for a lot, it’s a very intense type of football and he learned a lot with <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> and <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>. I think <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a> will do very well in the Euros and why not, in the following World Cup as well. Besides, there are not many chances in the national team and you need to be ready to star in each game</p>

He’s a professional, so if an important team gives him a call, well, why not?<br /><br /><b>[Many big clubs are expected to struggle financially because of the suspension, but Santos feels that it will simply mean that reasonable bids for players are liable to be accepted]</b> I believe that the sale of the most important players will be considered in the case of a sizeable bid. Faced with big offers, it would be appropriate to sell your players. It will just last a year. Then slowly the system will recover. This crisis is a global one but it will affect countries where there is no great competitiveness anymore. For example, in Portugal, or in Italy’s Serie B and Serie C, where they are missing gate receipts and probably also some sponsorship. It will be difficult for them</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus need to contact <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> if they want Jorginho]</b> I only hear about these rumours from the newspapers, because nobody from <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> has contacted me. <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a> appreciates him very much as a person and a player, they worked very well together, but that’s all there is to it right now. The player is focused only on <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, he’s resumed training and is preparing for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> restart. In my view, it would be difficult for the <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a> to buy him today, because the transfer market has changed with the pandemic and <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a> has a contract with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> until 2023. He is the vice-captain and considered an important player for the squad. I don’t just mean <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, but all the biggest European clubs would struggle to pay that much for one player right now<br /><br />If it should happen <b>[a proposal from Juve]</b>, I say that anyone who wants <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a> has to talk to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and Marina <b>[<a href="marina-granovskaia.html">Granovskaia</a>]</b>.

  <p><b>[Jorginho is unlikely to leave <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> this summer, according to his agent, because the price tag has gone up]</b> His price-tag has certainly gone up over the last two years, as he has done well in London and become a regular for Italy. He is now the vice-captain at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and has amassed a great deal of experience playing in the Champions League and Europa League. I think it’s very unlikely an offer will come in for <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a>, because nobody can afford to make that kind of investment in the market right now. Because of the pandemic, nobody knows when we can return to normal or even play with fans in the stadium, so that’s a big problem for the transfer market</p>
