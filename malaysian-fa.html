  <p><b>[Malaysian FA has refuted Kelantan advisor Tan Sri Annuar Musa’s claim that the association owes Kelantan around RM2 million - around 370,000 British Pound - in grants and prize money]</b> Firstly, the association on December 30, 2016 has credited the prize money for the 2016 Super League and the Premier League to the winning teams, an amount totalling RM2.025 million.<br /><br />Secondly, annual grants are not paid to the teams anymore beginning from the 2016 season, when the Malaysian League was privatised. The teams have been made partners in the league and get a share of the 40 per cent of revenue in broadcasting and commercial rights, described as broadcasting and commercial rights distribution for their participation in the league.<br /><br />For the 2016 season, about RM41 million has been received from broadcast and commercial rights and 40 per cent of this should be shared with the teams; approximately RM16.4 million. But all clubs have been given a total of RM18 million, RM1 million per Super League team <b>[12 teams]</b> and RM500,000 for each Premier League team <b>[12 teams]</b>, and an additional RM2.025 million for prize money. As 40 per cent of the RM41 million only comes up to RM16.4 million when the teams should be receiving RM20.025 million, FAM has paid the remaining RM3.625 million to the teams first, on behalf of Football Malaysia LLP <b>[FMLLP]</b>. However the previous practice of providing teams with bigger shares of the broadcast and commercial rights depending on their league position <b>[up until 2014]</b> could not be continued, as the broadcast and commercial rights revenues only came up to RM41 million, and not RM70 million as targeted earlier. However this practice may be resumed again in the future, if the RM70 million target is achieved.<br /><br />Please take note that broadcasting and commercial rights revenue awarded to Super League teams has been increased by 100 per cent beginning in 2016 as compared to the annual grants provided by FAM previously, from RM500,000 to RM1 million, and an increase of about 67 per cent from RM300,000 to RM500,000 for Premier League teams. On the matter of the share of broadcast and commercial rights revenue for teams in the 2017 season, the FAM executive committee in a previous meeting has agreed that the first 50 percent <b>[RM500,000 for Super League teams and RM250,000 for Premier League teams]</b> will be paid in January 2017, while the remaining 50 percent will be paid when the league has kicked off.<br /><br />Thirdly, the practice of paying the home and the visiting teams for live telecast of Super League and Premier League matches has already been discontinued beginning from the 2015 season, after the sponsorship from Astro ended, as has been noted by all the teams.<br /><br /><b>[More embarrassingly, it is Kelantan FA that still owes FAM money, to the tune of RM430,000]</b> The association has reviewed this matter and it must be known that it is KAFA which actually owes FAM and FMLLP a sum of about RM430,000. The amount owed by KAFA to FAM and FMLLP includes unpaid wages of the side’s former foreign players which were settled by FAM in 2016 after KAFA requested FAM’s assistance in providing an advance payment, fines for disciplinary cases as well as outstanding ticket levy debt still owed by KAFA to FMLLP. Based on all the above, KAFA will only receive about RM70,000 from the RM500,000 broadcast and commercial rights first payment they should be receiving from FAM and FMLLP, after their debt of RM430,000 is cleared,</p>

  <p><b>[A former Malaysian FA <b>[FAM]</b> employee has claimed that corruption is rampant in the association]</b> There is no subtle way to say it, but corruption is rampant in FAM. To send a strong message I would advise an independent financial audit of FAMs expenditure for the past 3 years. You will quite easily find the many instances of abuse of power in awarding contracts, overpaying for services, unnecessary and excessive expenditure. The fact is that the culture of corruption has been so rampant that the attempt to cover up is only done in a ‘Semi-Pro’ manner<br /><br />FAM has been hiding behind the threat of a FIFA suspension should there be government intervention in the form of a MACC investigation. What the general public doesn’t know is that FIFA would welcome an investigation by MACC if a Member Association <b>[MA]</b> is suspected of corruption and will not suspend the MA as it views it as a move towards good governance.<br /><br />So please Sir, commission an Audit and once you find the holes do call in the MACC. FIFA will not suspend us. This move would send out a strong message to all that the future of Malaysian football is one that is free of corruption</p>

  <p><b>[The Pahang FA allegedly refused to let JDT fans with tickets enter the Darulmakmur Stadium for their FA Cup quarter-final tie on Saturday]</b> FMLLP will obtain a full report from the match commissioner and the officials involved and will investigate the matter. If the allegations are proven true, FMLLP will take the appropriate action. There is no place in the new era of M-League for those who do not practice sportsmanship to the away teams and fans.</p>

  <p><b>[Foreign players can now be transferred between teams the second transfer window according to the new rules set by FMLLP]</b> FMLLP also hopes that this will allow teams more options and encourage teams to negotiate with each other with regards to transfers thus allowing them to benefit from this initiative. It is our hope that teams use this opportunity for strategic planning and see it as an opportunity to transfer players professionally instead of terminate them if possible.</p>

  <p><b>[FMLLP has slammed Pahang for denying the official television broadcaster of the match from broadcasting its first leg semi-final FA Cup tie against Negeri Sembilan at home on Sunday]</b> A partnership agreement signed between Football Association of Malaysia <b>[FAM]</b> and all teams to be part of Football Malaysia LLP <b>[FMLLP]</b> is the basis of everyone collectively working together to drive Malaysian football forward. This cooperation would also mean more income for each team via their participation in the Malaysian league.<br /><br />When teams do not adhere to the terms of this agreement the effect is felt by all stakeholders. Not just the team that does not comply. This is because whatever effects the league effects all components of it, including the other teams. We are all bound to each other to progress or fail as one.<br /><br />In not allowing a broadcast to be made of a match, especially one of such great significance as a cup semifinal, the effects are aplenty. Broadcast and commercial agreements may be affected as there will be lesser value to both.<br /><br />Team sponsors are affected as they do not get the exposure and eyeballs that a semifinal should bring. Fans are affected as not all fans of the teams involved are able to make it to the stadium. There are also elements of neutral fans who want to watch on with interest and the list goes on. What each team must realize is that a game, home or away, is not just about them. It involves everyone. This mindset must change for us to progress.<br /><br />We are on the right track. But these are the things that could derail it all. And when it doesn’t happen, shall we blame FMLLP or are we going to look at things objectively and realize that these things are what is holding us back?</p>

  <p><b>[PFAM hails FMLLP’s latest decision to punish errant teams]</b> PFAM welcomes this decision and we fully support the action. Delayed salary payments have been a constant thorn in local football and PFAM believes that through these actions - it is a strong message from FAM <b>[Football Association of Malaysia]</b> and FMLLP that the failure to manage players salary is a serious offence.<br /><br />PFAM hopes that this punishment will serve as a lesson to those teams involved as well as a reminder to the other teams. At the same time, PFAM urges those related teams to quickly sort out the delayed salary payments to ensure that the integrity of the local football industry isn’t affected<br /><br />PFAM would also like to thank Tunku Ismail, the President of FAM, for this swift action against the issue of delayed salary payments. Hopefully there can be a positive change that sees the professionalism of the game being brough to the next level</p>
