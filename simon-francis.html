  <p><b>[Bournemouth captain Simon Francis claims his side do not fear Manchester United]</b> There is certainly no fear factor. The form book would say we might be favourites going into the game. I don’t think we see it as a free hit anymore, these kinds of games, because we believe we can beat them. With the points we have accumulated so far even if we lose to Man United, people might think, it’s OK they have had a good start to the season, but we don’t see it like that. Even in our first season when we played the big teams nobody would back us to get any points, but this is our fourth season and we have come a long way. These games are the ones we can grab by the scruff of the neck and take to Man United. The lads will be raring to go, are looking forward to every Premier League game and why not? We are on good form. We will be at it from the start, pressing high and trying to win the ball back to give the fans something to get excited about.<br /><br />{on Romelu Lukaku]&lt;/b&gt; I am sure he will be champing at the bit to play. He has been a bit out of form, but you cannot underestimate these players or these teams</p>
