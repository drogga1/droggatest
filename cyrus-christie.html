  <p><b>[Fulham are investigating after defender Cyrus Christie claimed his sister was assaulted and racially abused by fans following his side’s 1-0 defeat at Barnsley]</b> Fulham Football Club is investigating an incident which took place in the away end at the Barnsley v Fulham fixture this afternoon. Should the perpetrators be identified, the Club will be taking the strongest possible action</p>

  <p><b>[Former team-mate Cyrus Christie says <a href="adama-traore.html">Adama Traore</a> doesn’t even run at full pace]</b> Adama. There’s no competition. Everyone knows he’s the quickest man in football - 100 per cent. He doesn’t run at full pace either! That’s just taking the piss! When I was at Middlesbrough we had to do this sprint test. I knew Adama was quick and I said: ‘Come on Adama, let’s sprint’. I was going my hardest and he just drove past me. And he was laughing as well, it was demoralising. I had the second quickest time, but he was a different level. I didn’t see him sprint properly. I maybe saw him sprint properly once and that was when he ran the whole length of the pitch in less than 10 seconds.<br /><br />From what we’re hearing it’ll continue. Obviously we don’t know to what extent or how they are going to do things. It’s just waiting around to see what’s going to happen. Health is definitely going to come first for people. Once we see how Germany pans out then I’m sure we can make plans</p>

  <p><b>[Fulham’s Cyrus Christie wins Championship Goal of the Month award for June]</b> I probably won’t ever hit another one as clean! I do it quite a lot in training, I’m always working on it, so it was nice that it came off for once! It was nice to get on the scoresheet, especially as it was the winner in a west London derby. It would have been nice if there were some fans there, though! That’s the end the away fans would have been at as well so it would have been good, but it was more important to win the game</p>
