<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Joel Campbell is due back at Arsenal this summer with his agent eager to point out that the forward is working hard for game time. Joaquim Batica said]</b> At Olympiakos, Joel had important success and the club tried several times to buy him. He was the centrepiece of a club who are regularly champions and make the Champions League - where he scored against Manchester United and they were eliminated. Arsenal have lent him several times, but I emphasise that last year he played about 30 matches in all.<br /><br />At Sporting, I think that overall it has been a difficult season for the club and at the end of the season we saw less game time as a loan player. It is normal that the club favours the players that belong to it.<br /><br />I think that as a 24-year-old player who has played in the Champions League, played a quarter-final of the World Cup, took part in championships in Spain, France, England, Greece, Portugal, he has a very important background. He continues to work every day to accumulate a significant number of games each year</p>
