<blockquote>
  <p>[Scott Guyett was delighted to see the opportunity to join United come Wan-Bissaka’s way despite his disappointment at the defender’s departure from <a href="crystal-palace.html">Selhurst Park</a>] I didn’t work directly with Aaron until he came to train with the first team a couple of seasons ago and if you’d told me five years ago that this guy would move to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> for £50m at the age of 21, I’d have laughed. But Aaron did so well as soon as he came into the first team and took everything in his stride. He’s an incredible athlete - that was apparent as soon as he came to train with the first team - and was the only player I’d seen who could consistently beat <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> in a one-on-one. He’s quick, I wouldn’t say lightning, but is also very powerful, agile and has exceptional timing<br /><br />Some of the things he’d do in training - which people don’t see - you’d be shaking your head and saying ‘how did he just make that tackle?’. It couldn’t have happened to a nicer kid, because Aaron is a really genuine and dedicated lad. What an opportunity for him</p>
