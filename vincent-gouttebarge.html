<blockquote>
  <p><b>[World’s leading concussion expert warns football must change or face extinction]</b> The topic has been more under scrutiny in the USA because brain injuries are by far more common in the typical USA collision sports (NFL, ice hockey) than in football.<br /><br />But the public awareness about the potential effect of sport-related brain injury is growing in Europe and, consequently, research and support measures. FIFPro has a clear position: the health and safety of professional players both in the short and long term should prevail on any other matters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[FIFPro, the footballers’ union, confirmed that it is perturbed by the frequency of fixtures at this time of year in England]</b> We have, of course, some concerns about the number of matches played in the festive period in the Premier League, which can have some negative consequences for the performances and health of our players. Congested fixture periods are associated with increased rates of injury, especially in the hamstrings. This scientific evidence shows that a short period of recovery between matches <b>[less than three days]</b> is associated with more matches lost. <b>[The]</b> injury rate is increased in league matches with less than four days compared with more than six days’ recovery. Playing two matches per week with a recovery time of 72-96 hours between these matches leads to a significant higher risk for injury by comparison to one match per week. Muscle injury rates during matches are lower when players are given at least six recovery days between matches.<br /><br />The in-season break is important to recover physically and mentally from the first half of the season <b>[eight to 10 days]</b></p>
