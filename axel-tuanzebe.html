I appreciate the trust that the club has in me and I want to repay that with my performances on the pitch. I know I have a lot of hard work and learning ahead of me but the experience I gained throughout last season puts me in good stead for the future ahead. I am determined to give everything and show everyone the player that I can be.</p>

  <p><b>[Axel Tuanzebe also gets a start in defence after spending last season on loan at <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> in the Championship]</b> It’s always a great opportunity to play for the club. We’ve had a good two weeks of training and now let’s get it out on the pitch. Manchester’s always been my home, to be amongst the lads again is great. It’s time to push on and show everyone I’m ready for it. Every pre-season is the same for every player to demonstrate they’re ready, I’ve worked hard in the off-season to be in this position now so let’s go out all guns blazing</p>

  <p><b>[Axel Tuanzebe says he’s ready to make an impact in <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s first team]</b> The manager puts faith in young players and I’m ready to play. I got another 60 <b>[minutes]</b> under my belt and I’m going to keep going. My season last year showed that I am a much better player than a year ago. Having a good coach to support me as a player and a person helped. I’m more mature, my decision making is better, my physicality, building myself in the game and being a senior player. I’m ready to play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> - definitely<br /><br />Today was a test, we know he can play at <b>[Championship]</b> level, and that’s why he didn’t play against <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>. He showed he is very capable at this level. Axel is going to be the future of this club.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Wan-Bissaka</a> joined United in a £50 million ($63m) move in June, and Tuanzebe revealed he has already received a nickname from his new team-mates]</b> You can see why we paid so much money for him. He’s a great defender with great feet. He’s been solid, he’s been made welcome. He’s quiet but we’ll get him out of his shell. We call him ‘The Spider’ because nobody can get past him</p>

  <p><b>[Axel Tuanzebe is determined to prove he has what it takes to become a first-choice defender at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> this season]</b> I probably would have liked to have been in the starting XI for <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> games. We’ve had a process with the manager, that process has been put in place. The game against Astana was again an opportunity to get my practice in to show people what I’m capable of, that I’m good enough to play for the club. And hopefully, Rochdale will be another opportunity to demonstrate that again. The manager tries to pick a side that he believes is best suited to win games. Pre-season, I tried to demonstrate what I was capable of. <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> a great player, an experienced player, he comes in and takes the number one choice. But, for me, it doesn’t change my task, it doesn’t change my mission, where or what I want to be. And I know it’s a process, I know it can take a long time. I know in time my opportunities will come and when they come it’s really down to me to grasp it and take that first-team role<br /><br /><b>[The centre-back also revealed his long-held aspirations to captain United one day]</b> It’s a personal ambition of mine. I’ve captained every age group of my <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> career. I started from Under-11s… maybe even younger, actually. Under-9s. So to captain one last team would be a great personal achievement for myself. <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> has always been there as well, in terms of he has a different way to lead and different types of leadership. He sets an example by playing well every game. I had a different type of leadership, I’d always speak to people and bring the best out of them with simple words and I would also try and demonstrate on the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Axel Tuanzebe has described his first experience of captaining <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> as remarkable after a penalty shootout victory over Rochdale]</b> Dreams do come true. I had goosebumps as I was walking out. It is something I have been working on for a long time and the moment finally came. I am just grateful to the manager and grateful to the club and the players I am playing with for sharing this moment with me. It was a nice surprise. I was literally getting ready to stretch and loosen up and <a href="mike-phelan.html">Mike Phelan</a> just came to me and said ‘are you ready to go and see the referee’. I said ‘what do you mean?’ and he said, ‘Come on you are captain’. So I said ‘alright, let’s get it’.<br /><br /><b>[Tuanzebe went on to add that the occasion was made all the more special due to his upbringing in Rochdale]</b> It made it that bit more sweeter, a bit more special. I had a lot of family and friends who came to watch the game so to have my first game as captain in front of them was remarkable<br /><br /><b>[Tuanzebe was relieved that United managed to progress to the next round]</b> They defended well first and foremost. Big respect to them, they came out here and battled all the way. They had confidence. It is a hard place to come to, <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>, and play. But they did and all respect to them and good luck to them for the season. We had a lot of chances that we weren’t able to execute, but we always find a way to win and we are through to the next round, and that is important<br /><br /><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">The Red Devils</a> will travel to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> to face <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> on October 29, with Tuanzebe relishing the prospect of such a huge tie]</b> These are the kind of games you want to be playing. People dismiss the Carabao Cup and say it is a nothing kind of trophy. But you respect the teams who are in it and you respect the competition. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> will be a big game and we want to win it and march on</p>

  <p><b>[Axel Tuanzebe sees Red Devils going back to the drawing board]</b> It’s always a big game. Through my academy stages, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is a must-win. It’s a brutal game. It wasn’t a tippy-tappy game; no matter what age group. Obviously coming here to the first team, I expect more of the same. It will be a game where we need to grind it out and stick together and produce a result<br /><br /><b>[Tuanzebe concedes that United are going through a tough phase at present]</b> Yeah, you can see we shut them out for a long period of time. The only way they were able to score was a counter when we weren’t really there. The goal, it is what it is: a 20-yard shot, it wasn’t like they played through us or anything like that. We go back to the drawing board, the international break <b>[is]</b> now time for us to regroup. We believe in what we’re doing, in time it will come. Now it’s just that tough phase. Next game we look forward to is <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. <b>[We]</b> definitely want to get a result in that game<br /><br /><b>[The highly-rated defender added, with United hoping to have the likes of <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> and <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a> back at their disposal in the near future]</b> Obviously, we’re waiting for players to come back <b>[from injury]</b> and that will be a positive to strengthen the squad again. <b>[It]</b> gives us time to reflect and build on our game because again we’re having a lot of possession but we need to have that final kind of penetration in the final third <b>[to]</b> give us chances to win games</p>

  <p><b>[Axel Tuanzebe says <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> has made a massive impact at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and deserves to have taken the captain’s armband]</b> Massive respect to him for getting the captaincy. For me, I don’t think it is ever about how long you have been somewhere. It is the impact you give and the time you spend with the lads. He’s had a massive impact on the club, he has been a real example and has managed to lead the team. We are improving. We are a young side and given time, I think we will be very strong and contending for real titles. But I just want to send massive congratulations to Harry, because I think he deserves it with the impact that he’s given to the club<br /><br /><a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> has been a nice guy, very calm and collected, he has represented himself well in the short time he has been here, he is very respectful and I wish him a good career at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. I am very excited to see him on the pitch. I have obviously seen clips of him at Sporting and he seemed to be a very integral player for them. Hopefully, he can be that for us as well<br /><br />Yeah, most definitely, because that is how you learn and that is how to improve. I remember my time at Villa. Me and <a href="yannick-bolasie.html">Yannick Bolasie</a>, in every training session we were at it! That is the only way you improve, when you have really honest people challenging every day. I am very excited to see what he brings to the table. I am sure he is strong and powerful. That can only develop me in finding ways to deal with that. I will be very grateful to have somebody like that on the team.</p>

  <p><b>[Axel Tuanzebe has made it clear he wants to be a key leader in <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>’s plans]</b> I wouldn’t say necessarily <b>[I want to]</b> just be captain, just be a leader for the team. Just be someone the team is going to turn to. There are other problems in football as well that people do not see. I always say to the lads if you need anyone or want to talk or anything, just call me out. Especially in the youth age groups with lads I’ve grown up with. If a player is affected off the pitch, it affects his performance on the pitch. If we have everyone operating at 100 per cent we’re a much better team<br /><br />For me, going out on loan at <b>[Aston]</b> Villa, I experienced that first-hand. I never took it personally. I was demanding better from my players. It’s missed a lot in football now. People take it personally but as soon as you cross the white line it’s done. When you come on the pitch, it’s application, professionalism, it’s doing your job right. If you’re not doing your job right, you need to be told<br /><br />Changing rooms change a lot, you have players coming and going. You get advised not to ever be too close to anyone just because it’s a common goal situation, the business of football. I think if you’re close to someone you can always maintain your relationship off the field. I still have contact with a lot of players from the youth team. I always reach out to them, I always like to see where people are going and how they’re doing because they’ve played a part in my life. Rashy, Timo and Scott we’ve all come through the same system, relatively at the same time, we’ve experienced similar things, so we’re close</p>

It’s something that’s been the club’s identity for many, many years and I’m sure there’ll be more players to come through.</p>

  <p><b>[Axel Tuanzebe says <a href="dean-henderson.html">Dean Henderson</a> will ‘slot right back in’ when he returns to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> I think that’s down to the culture of the club. At other teams there are a lot of talented players that don’t quite make it and that’s not the culture of their club. We’re fortunate to have such a club that promotes youth and wants their youth to be big players and big stars in the first-team. Obviously we have players with the talent to do so, which we’ve witnessed many times this season. It’s a combination of the two which breed a career. Dean’s a big character and I’m sure when he comes back he’ll just slot right back in and continue from where he left off. He’s doing very well at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> and it just shows, coming from the academy, he’s demonstrating what he’s learnt and practising it week in, week out</p>
