  <p>[Captain Mile Jedinak has confirmed a consistent approach for the Socceroos ahead of tonight’s AFC World Cup qualifier against Iraq in Tehran] We’ll be going at it like it’s our last game as we’re always told to do. We go into every game to get three points. It’s why we play the game, but we all know football doesn’t work that way. [Tonight] is going to be no different in terms of our approach.<br /><br />We’ll be going at it like it’s our last game as we’re always told to do. Where that gets us at the end of 90 minutes remains to be seen, but we all know if we can do our thing, hopefully that means three points and a good victory<br /><br />We’re all very happy to be back in qualifying mode. It’s been a little while since our last game, so there’s been a lot of football played at different levels in different countries. We’ve been well received here in Iran and we’re really looking forward to the game. We know it’s going to be quite difficult, but our preparations have been going well and we really look forward to the challenge ahead</p>

  <p>[Socceroos skipper Mile Jedinak remains ultra-calm, saying it’s business as usual for Australia as they prepare for Tuesday night’s crunch World Cup qualifier against United Arab Emirates] We’ve done some analysis on them and played them quite regularly. We know that they don’t change an awful lot in their style of play, and even the players in their squad have been together for quite a number of years. Growing up through the generations of [age national teams in UAE] and we know they’re always giving us a good contest. And we’ll have to assert ourselves on the game, as we always do. And hopefully we can do that early doors and see where that gets us.<br /><br />We give it a good go as long as we’re out on that pitch, and I expect no different tomorrow night. You demand no different tomorrow. What each individual is thinking I can’t tell you but from a personal perspective it’s business as usual. It’s the way you’ve got to focus on the game and put on a performance and give everything you can to the cause. Hopefully a big, packed crowd and they get right behind us</p>
