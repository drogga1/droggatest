  <p><b>[Former Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler says Harry Maguire and David Luiz are the two best transfers of the summer window]</b> For me, it’s no coincidence that, in the past couple of years, first Pep Guardiola at Manchester City then Liverpool’s Jurgen Klopp, splashed a huge amount of cash on defenders. Pep seems to be hoarding full-backs like they’ll be discontinued. It has worked. He transformed City from a side that could score for fun, but couldn’t defend, into one that still scores for fun, but now doesn’t concede many. In fact, last season the only team which conceded fewer was Liverpool - and, given they spent £150m on a keeper and centre-back, then that was no surprise to me.<br /><br />This time around, a couple of clubs have followed that lead and that makes me believe they may just have done the best individual deals in the window. Harry Maguire will come as no surprise as my top pick for the best buy. I know it was a crazy amount of money, but I don’t go with the idea Manchester United ­overpaid. What does that even mean? If you need a player, you pay what you can and what it takes to get him. United desperately needed a top ­centre-back … and they’ve got him. So the money doesn’t matter, getting the player does. The same was said about Liverpool and Virgil van Dijk last season. Doesn’t look like silly money now, though, does it? United had to pay whatever it took to get Maguire and, for me, he can transform their ­defence in the same way.<br /><br />My other ‘best buy’ of the window comes in the bargain section and the plaudits go to Arsenal for signing David Luiz. Yes, I know there are detractors, I know so many people don’t rate him. But £8m for a Brazil international ­defender who’s won the ­Premier League, Champions League, two Europa Leagues and two French leagues along with a Confederations Cup? That’s a steal for that sort of experience. I think Arsenal may just have got the best of this window. They’ve got some exciting ­attacking players and also brought in Kieran Tierney for a decent price. Again, they ­desperately needed defenders and now they have two with pedigree.</p>

  <p><b>[Reds legend Robbie Fowler says <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> will continue to show a selfish streak at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and should make no apologies for it]</b> I’ve ­honestly never heard such nonsense as the stuff that has surrounded this so-called spat between <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> and <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>. Everyone commenting and talking nonsense about being ‘greedy’ or destroying team spirit, have they never watched football before? Because you can’t be a ­top-class goalscorer without total belief you will score. That’s what goalscorers do. They train for it, their whole week on the ­training ground is spent practising, visualising, working out how to score for every position and the best always believe they can score - from five yards, from 20, from 40. Wherever. Even if it’s easier to pass for a tap-in.<br /><br />I look at Salah’s record and it tells me he’s going to keep doing it. You don’t score that many goals without being what people say is selfish. But what the hell do people want? Do they want him to be a goalscorer or do they want him to be someone who’s always looking to pass? You can’t really have both. And the other ­nonsense I’ve heard is people saying he’s not passing ­because he’s ­jealous, he doesn’t want Mane to score.<br /><br />If anyone can slow down the game so much they have time to think, ‘Oh, I’m not passing to him because he’s scored more than me’, well they’re the best who’s ever played. Yes, Salah can be ­selfish when he sees the goal, but, to me, that makes him a great goalscorer. And it’s not as if he doesn’t create chances for others. Mane knows that, and what he did was just frustration at being taken off</p>

  <p><b>[Robbie Fowler says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> turned down <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> because he believed the club was too commercially motivated]</b> I did an interview with him a couple of years ago and he told me he turned down a couple of super-rich clubs after <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> - one of them was definitely ­Manchester United, the other probably <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> - because he hated how they were focused solely on ­commercial influences.

He also said he backed himself to make <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> great again, even without the riches of the super-elite in world football - that he could do it another way. He’s not there yet, but he has certainly given <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans their ­belief back - and their pride, too. I have witnessed that<br /><br /><b>[Klopp has led <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to the top of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> table this season]</b> He gets what <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is about. He gets what the ­people of the city are. Most importantly, he gets what it means to people to have that joy in their life. I’m not saying he’s not a disciplinarian. That image of him laughing all the time is not true - I’ve seen him deal with players in the past and he’s as tough as they come. But he has heart, too. He does all the tactical stuff, is hugely sophisticated in game plans, science, analysis, but his man-­management sets him apart. I’ve been in and around that club and I can see that <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is liked by everyone there</p>

I think everyone assumed he would do seven years and then take a break in 2022. So to get him for another two years after that is massive. It’s big for many reasons.<br /><br />For a start, what a season to get such a lift in. It’s like the club signing one of the best players in the world - because he’s right up there at the very top. He is also a competitor. He inherited a pretty poor team at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> - there are only a handful of them left. But he got to two finals in his first season, in the top four in the second, then a ­Champions League final. Every year they get better and there’s no sign of it stopping. That’s a real competitor. The two extra years, though, are a massive bonus for the club because it offers continuity. This team is so exciting, there’s a reason they’re huge favourites for the title.<br /><br />Yet there will come a time when it needs to be refreshed and rebuilt a little. They’re all at peak age - or heading ­towards their peak - but, in two or three years’ time, some will move on.

Of course he’ll have the players believing in themselves, they’ll have that confidence instilled in them and they’ll believe they can. Will they? I hope they will but it doesn’t matter if they don’t. They’re still the best team</p>

I watched how Rangers played against Braga in the last round of the Europa League and I could see a team that has got every ounce of belief in what the ­boss is doing.

And I don’t think there are many - even the most bitter of rival fans - who would argue that, if the football season were to end now, they shouldn’t be given the trophy as clear winners of the competition.

They’ve dropped five points all season. FIVE. Hell, I once scored 16 goals in a game for a schoolboy team I played in - got more than 100 goals in total if I remember correctly - and yet I’m pretty sure we dropped more than five points that season. They are the worthiest of champions. It’s the greatest ­season ever in top-flight English ­football history. They are record-breakers, and they are arguably the best team to have won <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. And, yep, I’m saying they’ve won it. They need two more wins to ­confirm it, but the reality is that, if City were to lose two more between now and the theoretical end of the season, the points <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have now would be enough</p>

Everyone loves to play the blame game and one-upmanship has become a way of life, but I hope people realise that there is no handbook to turn to during this kind of crisis. There is no one at any football club in the world able to call on experience of how to deal with an issue that affects both health, mental and economic well-being. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> should have been aware that the furlough and job retention measures were designed to help small firms come through the crisis.

But conversations have to take place now about what the future will bring - and that includes how we eventually get back to playing and watching.<br /><br />Voiding the season would lead to all kinds of legal challenges - and so would any attempt to rule that league tables should stand from the date the lockdown came<br /><br />I hope that everyone ­accepts when a decision is made it has the best interests of football at heart.

We need to remember what’s really important.<br /><br /><b>[Fowler has warned fans, however, not to expect to be able to cheer on their sides in a live environment for a long time to come]</b> What I am sure of is that football cannot afford to wait for when it’s safe for fans to return to stadiums. Mass gatherings will be the last thing the government ­allows once lockdown ­measures begin to be lifted. So it’s increasingly likely games must be played behind closed doors.<br /><br />Is that ideal? Of course not. It goes against all my natural instincts. But it is the lesser of all the evils. Not least because I think watching football again will give millions of people something to look forward to in the months ahead.<br /><br />Sports, hobbies and pastimes help us to stay sane. For many, they are a way of life. We can’t visit our families or friends, go to the cinema, shopping centre, gym or the pub. So, once the authorities believe it’s safe for players and officials to cross the white line again, it will give all who love the world’s most popular game a massive lift</p>

  <p><b>[Fowler ‘not playing around’ in Brisbane coaching hotseat]</b> I wouldn’t say it was make-or-breakbut it wasn’t far off! I think people had a certain impression of me. And it wasn’t the right one<br /><br />That was all I wanted - a chance. I feel like I was getting rid of a stigma, if you like. I was showing people how passionate and dedicated I am to my coaching career. If you go overseas for your first job like I have, you’re not playing around are you? I don’t want to sound egotistical, but I think it showed a bit of bollocks<br /><br /><b>[Fifteen new players were recruited, with a focus on attitude and mentality]</b> It was a fresh start for everyone, not just us. We knew there were a lot of issues to sort out. We had to bring that winning mentality, get people pulling together and believing in what they were doing. We only played our fifth home game on January 11. When you’re trying to bed in a new team and new ideas, that’s far from ideal!<br /><br />I knew we needed to build from the back. Which may have surprised a few people given I’m a striker. Since Christmas, our mentality has shone through. We’ve shot up the table, and we’ve handled the pressure. With only 11 teams in the league, it means that you play a lot of games against teams in and around you, so you know a defeat can see you fall down the table. That puts extra pressure on each game, but the lads have responded to that superbly.<br /><br />Any time I asked the lads to deliver when there was a bit of pressure on us, they pulled it out. That tells me something about the character of this team.<br /><br />My goalkeeper, Jamie Young, is another I would mention. His attitude is as good as anyone I’ve seen. I never played him at the start of the season. But what I loved was that he went away, worked on all the things I’d spoken to him about, and he became a better keeper. In the end, he got his chance six or seven games into the season, and he’s been absolutely outstanding. If I’m looking for an example to show to the players of what you need to do, how you need to train, your attitude, all that, then the likes of him, the likes of Tom, Scott, they’re the ones to look up to<br /><br /><b>[He admits that reading comments from Phil Moss, the president of Football Coaches Australia, stating he shouldn’t be appointed]</b> What was laughable about that is that he’s an English fella who went over to Australia at a young age and got a job.

And I’ve always used that in terms of ‘I’m going to prove you wrong, I’m going to show you’. It’s no different as a manager to when I was a player</p>

  <p><b>[Robbie Fowler on the art of goalscoring]</b> Do you know what the best sound in football is? It’s the noise when the ball hits the back of the net. That sound, it’s just sheer satisfaction. That’s what I lived for. I absolutely love it. I can barely walk now, let alone run! But if I see a ball lying around, I can’t help myself. I have to smash it into the goal, I just have to. I need it. I need that sound. That’s what I wanted - to be the hero. It was always the buzz for me. It was why I wanted to play. I talk about the sound of the ball hitting the back of the net, that can be on the park or on the training field or in the back garden, but when it’s in a proper game and you see the goalkeeper scrambling across, trying to get there, and you know he can’t. That’s as good as it gets.<br /><br /><b>[How does Fowler himself see it?]</b> You know, it used to be a bugbear of mine. They’d call me ‘natural’ as if I’d never had to work hard. But when you sit down and analyse it, it’s a massive, massive compliment, isn’t it? It’s natural, or it looks natural, because of the hours and hours and hours, the monotony of doing the same thing over and over again, the same drills, the same exercises. That’s what you’re trying to do, make it natural, so it comes easy and you don’t have to think about it. When people say I was a natural goalscorer now, I take it as a big compliment. I worked very hard to be ‘natural’<br /><br />There was this metal gate around the field. And what I’d do, I’d drop-kick the ball with my right foot, over and over again until it felt comfortable. Then I’d put the ball on the floor, run up and strike it off my right, over and over again. It sounds boring doesn’t it? It was never boring for me. I wanted to do it. I wanted to get better. I love the saying ‘repetition, repetition’ repetition’ because it’s true. If you want to master something, you’ve got to work at it<br /><br />I look at the goals I scored with my right foot, particularly early in my career, and it shows the benefits of hard work. The same with heading. I am only 5’9, but I scored a lot of headers. That came from the simplest of drills, throwing a ball up and jumping, throwing it against a wall and directing it. Working on timing and bravery, keeping your eyes open to meet it. Sometimes the old drills are the best ones!<br /><br />I count myself very lucky. With <a href="ian-rush.html">Ian Rush</a>, I saw what was needed to be a real top-class centre forward. It wasn’t a case of him taking me aside and teaching me the game. I’d see it on the training field every day. I’d see his runs, the way he anticipated things, the way he’d alter his finishes depending on the situation. To watch and learn from one of the best ever, it was a privilege. He would give me pointers, but it was usually the simplest of things. He’d talk about how to time your run, how to bend a run, how to get yourself out of the defender’s eyeline, shooting across the goalkeeper, through a defender’s legs so the keeper is unsighted. It sounds ridiculously simple, doesn’t it? But it’s not. People talk about goalscorers as selfish, and it’s true that you have to be in some situations, but so much of a centre-forward’s work is about creating space for others, dragging defenders out of position, making runs, stretching the game, always being on the move. Rushie was the master of that. I’d have been mad not to listen and take it in. If you can’t take advice from him, then you shouldn’t be in the game<br /><br /><b>[Alan Shearer, <a href="les-ferdinand.html">Les Ferdinand</a>, <a href="teddy-sheringham.html">Teddy Sheringham</a>, <a href="andy-cole.html">Andy Cole</a>, <a href="ian-wright.html">Ian Wright</a>, <a href="stan-collymore.html">Stan Collymore</a> - his star shone as bright as any]</b> It gives me pride to have been classed alongside those kind of players. I was a baby compared to them, wasn’t I? But I’ve always had this belief. I know what I can and can’t do, and I always had confidence. Let’s be honest, I wasn’t the same player throughout my career, but I always believed I could do it. I always felt I could score in any game<br /><br /><b>[Goal asks him to name his favourite strike]</b> It’s a good question! I scored a lot of important goals in my career, goals which gave me an awful lot of satisfaction, but my best goal, people might not agree, was at Charlton in the last game of the 2000-01 season. It was the importance which made it. Everything we achieved that year, winning three cups, it just capped it all off by helping us get into the Champions League. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> hadn’t been there for a few years, so it was a really big game for us. We’d won <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup on the Saturday, the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Cup on the Wednesday and we needed to win down at the Valley to get third place. We were poor in the first half and it was 0-0. Then after half time one dropped to me in the box off a corner, and I just sort of helped it over my shoulder and in. It was maybe not as spectacular as some others I scored, but it was a clever finish. After that we were comfortable. When I look back, I always love that goal.<br /><br /><b>[Does Fowler, a man with whom the No.9 shirt will forever be associated, lament this change in emphasis?]</b> No, not at all. Formations and tactics may change, but some things never will. There will always be a place for players who can put the ball in the net. Who are the two best players in the world? And why? It’s because they score incredible amounts of goals, as much as anything else. <b>[Robert]</b> <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a>, <b>[Harry]</b> <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a>, the same. No matter how the game changes, young kids will always want to be like those players, scoring goals and being the hero. That’s all I ever wanted, anyway!</p>

And those tests will be stepped up. They are young and fit too, so not in the highly dangerous over-75 category. And when people speak about the risk of having vulnerable family members at home, again, the testing programme could help. If they are checked and there are signs of the virus, then they can isolate, away from those family members. Straight away</p>

  <p><b>[Brisbane had finished the previous season second from bottom but Fowler guided the club into fourth place in the 11-team A-League table, with 10 wins from 22 games, when the league was suspended]</b> On behalf of myself and Tony, I would like to thank the club for the opportunity, and the Brisbane Roar fans for the warm welcome and support for me and the team. We are very proud of what we achieved</p>
