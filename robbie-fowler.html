  <p><b>[Liverpool drew a rare blank in a Merseyside derby date with Everton]</b> Jurgen Klopp will be seriously concerned by Liverpool’s lack of cutting-edge depth ahead of ­Tuesday’s season-defining clash with Manchester City. Without Mo Salah or Roberto Firmino, Liverpool were ­nowhere near sharp enough in the final third of the pitch. In fact, they were about as sharp as a Primark suit. It is, though, understandable. Danny Ings and Dominic Solanke have had hardly any game time this season, and have never really played ­together, certainly not in a game with this intensity. It was always going to be a big ask for them to reproduce ­Liverpool’s first-choice counter-attacking verve. Yet Klopp knows this lack of options is a real worry. All the top teams have strength in depth up front - I sometimes think Jose Mourinho at ­Manchester United is collecting forwards for his World Cup sticker album! Liverpool have a front three… and then nothing too obvious beyond that, with both Divock Origi and Daniel Sturridge out on loan.<br /><br />Obviously, Salah will be the key on Tuesday in the ­quarter-final second leg. If he’s fit, then that is a ­massive weapon. If he’s not, then we saw in the derby how Klopp’s team will struggle to find any pace or penetration on the break</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah is a serious contender for the Ballon d’Or and FIFA Best prizes]</b> I’m putting on the tin hat before suggesting this but Mo Salah surely deserves to be in the ­running for the Ballon d’Or. I’m not saying he’s going to win it, in fact I’m pretty sure he won’t the way the whole thing is structured. But I am saying - passionately - that it’s time to look beyond the almost knee-jerk leaning towards Ronaldo or Messi. Don’t get me wrong, they are two of the greatest players the game has ever seen. People get misty eyed over the pair of them, and quite rightly. They have both had good years, and with a World Cup, both have the chance for an ­outstanding one. Yet so far, Salah has matched them, no doubt. He’s probably got more chance of ­winning the Best FIFA Men’s Player award, ­because that is ­in part selected by ­international coaches. The Ballon d’Or votes are by journalists. Even if you put what Mo has done at Liverpool to one side, he’s been astonishing. He has gone from being an ­exciting, quality player, to a truly world-class one for Jurgen Klopp.<br /><br />Salah has been out of this world. That’s not me just being a rose-tinted Liverpool idiot <b>[though yeah, I’m that too]</b>, that’s a striker recognising class in front of goal. You can see exactly how good he is in the goals he scores. Look at the two City games. He was relatively quiet in both, yet in both matches, he scored the goal that turned the whole tie on its head. That’s what truly great players do. That’s why they are great players. They do nothing for 80 minutes, and then produce something ­sublime at the most suffocating pressure moment of the entire game. Consistently. Salah has done that<br /><br />People questioned his fee, for someone who was dumped by ­Chelsea. Perhaps that made him anxious, snatching at chances? The fee doesn’t seem so much now, does it? Remember his goal against Porto, where he flicked it up then volleyed it in? The truly great strikers can slow things down to read what will happen around them. See all the angles quicker, better than anyone else. It’s a gift. And a very rare one. So why shouldn’t he be named in the same golden breath as Ronaldo and Messi for this season?</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney is an innocent victim of goings on at Everton]</b> I followed a similar route to Australia, which had a similar level of football back then to the MLS. I was a couple of years older than he is now, though, and I think that would be a major difference. I enjoyed my time in Australia in North Queensland and Perth, but it’s tough. Without any disrespect to any team-mates, of course, it’s a different level and it’s quite tough mentally to get used to that. You are stepping down a level, but you are still going as a pro and you still want to be as professional as possible. But, of course, you can only be as good as your team. With Rooney, after a decade at ­Manchester United, that will be tough. I’ve spoken to Steven Gerrard about his time in the States, and he says ­anyone going there for an easy life is in for a shock, because, even if the quality is not there, the fitness levels, the competitiveness is and you are targeted too. I’m not sure whether, at 32, Wayne is ready for all that. Ideally, he would do another year at Everton and bring his experience to what surely has to be a season of rebuilding. But that all depends what is going on behind the scenes.<br /><br />I honestly don’t know what is ­happening there, but, as an ex-player, I can tell you a lot of what happens at football clubs depends on what is going on behind the scenes. If it’s not right, then it does affect what happens on the pitch. Rooney seems to be a fairly innocent victim of that. In a better team, I think he would still offer something. I hope Everton can sort out their problems and allow him the dignity his position as one of the best of his ­generation deserves</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool have been told that Alisson will make mistakes]</b> Alisson is undoubtedly a world class player, but the Premier League is tough. There will be times when he will make mistakes. David De Gea took time to settle at Manchester United before becoming recognised as a great goalkeeper. Alisson’s signing was urgently needed. Liverpool have stood by <b>[Loris]</b> Karius over the ­summer and pre-season, but the new ­campaign was always going to be brutal for the German. He would have got huge stick and that not only places extra pressure on him, but on the whole club. So to go out and spend big on a star keeper is great for everyone connected with ­Anfield, the fans included.<br /><br />Like everyone at Liverpool, I’m excited at the club paying out a world-record fee for a goalkeeper - but let’s not get carried away believing the long wait to win the title is over. Yes, Alisson is world class. It’s a strong statement of ­intent and Reds fans are buzzing. But Manchester City are still the team to catch. I’m thrilled at Liverpool’s spending during the summer, bringing in Alisson, Fabinho, and Naby Keita. But City finished 25 points clear of ­Liverpool when they won the Premier League title in May. It would take a huge swing to turn that round. So I don’t think anyone associated with Liverpool can come out and say: ‘Yes, we’re going to win the Premier League’ with any great confidence. I believe they will put more pressure on City, but Liverpool are still playing catch-up. It’s the same for every other team in the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah made some dodgy decisions against Tottenham]</b> I’m not going to start condemning the forwards after such a good win. Yes, Salah was probably the worst culprit, and he not only missed a few chances, but also made a couple of dodgy decisions in possession. But he’s a goalscorer. He is used to scoring now and he wants to find the net. I know what that’s like, and I can’t criticise him for that. You can’t be moaning at him when the Liverpool forward line took Spurs apart so easily<br /><br />It was a performance from Liverpool that had a bit of everything, with very few weaknesses. I noticed Graeme Souness said afterwards he thought it was my old club’s best team since Kenny Dalglish last won the league. I’m not going to argue with Souey, because he’s Souey…but you definitely can’t say that unless they win the league<br /><br /><b>[Pep]</b> Guardiola has great quality at his disposal, he has the knowledge of how to get to Champions’ League finals and he will believe this is the season he can bring the trophy to the club. I wouldn’t argue with that, of course, but it’s no formality. It’s so tough to win the Premier League and Champions’ League - I think Manchester United were the last to do it in 2008, so a decade ago. I don’t want to echo Gary Neville - no chance of that - but it is actually tough to do both, because teams in different leagues get a much easier ride during the season. But if any club can do it, then it’s this City squad</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler has backed Mohamed Salah to get back amongst the goals]</b> I think he’ll still score goals, I think he’ll still score a lot of goals. What I like about Mo Salah is that his work ethic is brilliant, he doesn’t shy away from anything. What I would be more worried about is if he wasn’t getting chances.<br /><br />He will bang the goals in. I’m not sure he’ll hit the heights he did last year but he is still a magnificent player. He will still be a danger throughout the Premier League <b>[season]</b>. I’m not saying he’s having a bad year so far. He’s still a good player, he’s still an excellent player but to replicate what he did last year will be unbelievable</p>

  <p><b>[Top-four finishes are no longer good enough for Liverpool]</b> A gauge is getting as high up in the league as they can. As much as we talk about Liverpool being this unbelievable side who are easy on the eye and great to watch, there comes a time when you need to start winning stuff. I think Jurgen Klopp’s getting together a great, great squad but I think one of the problems we have is Manchester City are brilliant. That’s one of the big problems. You can get a wonderful side put together but you’ve got to try and catch them and then hang onto their coattails.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether a top-four finish and no silverware would be enough for Klopp in 2018-19]</b> For me, no. It really isn’t it because I’m not one of these fans that think you should be celebrating finishing fourth. I think a chairman or the owners should be the ones celebrating. For me, that’s celebrating mediocrity. I’ve always wanted to win stuff. I wanted to be remembered for what trophies I won as opposed to where I finished in the league. I understand why clubs are happy finishing in the top four but I think a club the size of Liverpool’s stature should be finishing in the top four all the time anyway. As I said before, there comes a time when you need to win a trophy. I don’t care if it’s a League Cup. People will belittle that but I’ve won one, it’s a brilliant trophy. When you think of football in terms of what you can win there’s an FA Cup, a League Cup, the Premier League and the Champions League. There are only four trophies so it’s tough</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah is capable of becoming a Liverpool legend]</b> I’m not shy in saying that I believe if Mo Salah stays with the club long term, then he has already shown the qualities to suggest he has a real shot of joining those ranks of the true legends. I’ve played with the best at Liverpool, the likes of <b>[Ian]</b> Rush and <b>[John]</b> Barnes, <b>[Steven]</b> Gerrard and <b>[Steve]</b> McManaman, so I reckon I know a thing or two about what it takes. Salah has similar qualities, no doubt. You saw this last season and you’ve seen it again this time around. Napoli was a brilliant example where he was the difference. So often he scores the first goal in a tight game, or the winning goal. It’s not a coincidence. People have asked what he is… but he is just a real player.<br /><br />Salah has shown already that he’s not a one-season wonder. But I’m something of a stickler for longevity when it comes to greatness. People go on about Luis Suarez, and no doubt he was a top player for the club, but one of their all-time best? Not a chance - because he was only there for three and a bit seasons. It also leaves a bad taste in the mouth the way he left the club, by so obviously engineering a move, not once but twice. I don’t think he qualifies at all. Which is my way of saying Salah has to stay for a lot longer and keep producing the form and goals he’s got so far, if he is ever going to be considered on a par with the likes of Rushie, who for me is the best striker of them all. I’m not even going to remotely compare him to Rush or the others in the top six goal-scorers. Why? Not because I don’t rate him, but because I’m waiting. For at least another five years, I reckon. He’s already got almost 60 goals for Liverpool and there’s a good chance he’ll go past Suarez and Fernando Torres this season on the all-time list. Those two got 82 and 81 respectively, and that’s not enough in terms of years or numbers</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah has been hailed as incredible by Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler]</b> His record’s brilliant, it really is. When you watch him play you just know that you’re more or less guaranteed to get chances and obviously if he keeps getting chances he’s going to continue to score goals. So him getting to 50 Premier League goals, I think he was quicker than anyone in Liverpool’s history - and that in itself, when you think of the quality of the strikers and players we’ve had at the club, is incredible. The way he’s played up there hasn’t surprised me because I think you just knew that he was a good player regardless of where he played and you knew he was going to get chances. At times he does look a little bit unorthodox with the way he strikes the ball. I mean, he’s not as fluent as some strikers have been in the past in the way he strikes it, but that doesn’t really matter - he’s effective. I’m not surprised because you look at some of the goals last year and this year, he scores goals out of nothing. I think he’s a good player and, regardless, whatever era you look at, the good players can play anywhere. Clever players can play anywhere and he epitomises a clever player.<br /><br />It might be a case of other players or other staff like the manager saying: ‘You take the pens and we’ll help you score more goals, we’ll help you become a more rounded player’. He’s not unbelievably greedy or unbelievably selfish so I wouldn’t read much into it in that way, but I think his game has changed and he does look a little bit focused or a little bit more direct in terms of wanting to score goals and to be a great goalscorer. I think at times you do need to have a little bit of selfishness about you and he has got that. I’m not saying that’s a good or a bad thing, but if you look at all the great strikers of yesteryear - whether they played for Liverpool or not - they’ve always had that little bit of greed in them, so it’s good for him and it’s certainly good for us</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City’s class of 2019 could be considered the finest side in Premier League history]</b> This­ Manchester City squad is quite possibly the best I’ve ever seen in English football in terms of depth of quality. Better than Manchester United in ‘99, better than the Arsenal squad of 2003-04? ­Definitely there is a case to be made. They could be the best of all time. After the 100 points of last season, they could still get 98 points this time. Yet Liverpool have matched them stride for stride. They tore Bournemouth apart ­<b>[on Saturday]</b>, knowing victory would put them back on top of the table. To me, that’s not bottling, that’s ­showing immense ­quality and courage to take the fight to an unbelievable side and ­keeping it going for so long. Same with Spurs, too. I can’t even begin to quantify the amount of credit they deserve.<br /><br />In a season where their ­opponents just don’t lose, they have lost six… and yet after each defeat showed ­the character to bounce back and stay in the race. I don’t care what anyone says, that is ­bottle. City won the title at a canter last season, because no other team was anywhere near good enough to be spoken of in the same breath. At least we have a race this time, a three-way race for the first time in years and a proper fight. So, next time you want to call a side bottlers, just think about what you’re saying. And here’s a couple of stats to help.<br /><br />In 2003-04, the ­invincible ­Arsenal team drew 12 matches, or dropped 24 points. That wouldn’t win them the title this season. In 1998-99, United’s treble-winning side drew 13 in the Premier League and lost three for 79 points… which may not even be enough for the top four this time. Things have changed. The gap between the top six and the rest has widened, meaning you have to win more matches. That is the level these sides are at - and we should all rejoice in it - not succumb to the ­insanity which is making football a scary place to be with a tide of racism and abuse around the game</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool are a match for anyone in football]</b> When it comes to Liverpool, I’m always quietly confident. We are a great team, we’ve got great players and I’m not sitting here saying teams should be worrying about us because I think you’ve got to give them respect, but we’ll get the respect we deserve off them. You look and you analyse where they <b>[Bayern]</b> are this season, and I don’t mean this in a disrespectful way, but they’re probably not the Bayern of old in terms of getting unbelievably great results in their league. But there’s no denying that they’re still a great team, they’re still great players. As much as it’s an incredibly, incredibly tough game, I think the way we’re playing, we’re a match for anyone in football. We’ve proven that this year. The group was maybe a little bit tough, there were some good teams in it and we got out of it. We’re here now and I don’t think it matters really who you play in the second round or the final 16, you’re always going to be playing good teams anyway. It so happens that we’re playing Bayern Munich, who have been the top team in Germany for years and years and obviously we’re looking forward to it as a Liverpool team and Liverpool fans. And I’m sure there will be players for Bayern who are looking forward to playing us and coming to Anfield to play in an unbelievable stadium.<br /><br />I don’t think anyone envisaged that we’d do as well as we did last year and the more the competition went, I think the more we grew and hopefully that’ll be the case again. I think we’ve proven to a lot of teams and a lot of people in European football that we can hold our own with the best teams in Europe, and obviously we’ve got aspirations to get to where we think we should be again. To be playing teams like Bayern, teams like Real Madrid in finals, that tells you the progress that we’ve made as a club over the last couple of years. I think it’s first class and we more than deserve to be where we are because of the way we’re playing</p>

In fact, last season the only team which conceded fewer was <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - and, given they spent £150m on a keeper and centre-back, then that was no surprise to me.<br /><br />This time around, a couple of clubs have followed that lead and that makes me believe they may just have done the best individual deals in the window. <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> will come as no surprise as my top pick for the best buy. I know it was a crazy amount of money, but I don’t go with the idea <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> ­overpaid. What does that even mean? If you need a player, you pay what you can and what it takes to get him. United desperately needed a top ­centre-back … and they’ve got him. So the money doesn’t matter, getting the player does. The same was said about <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> last season. Doesn’t look like silly money now, though, does it? United had to pay whatever it took to get Maguire and, for me, he can transform their ­defence in the same way.<br /><br />My other ‘best buy’ of the window comes in the bargain section and the plaudits go to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> for signing <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a>. Yes, I know there are detractors, I know so many people don’t rate him. But £8m for a Brazil international ­defender who’s won the ­Premier League, Champions League, two Europa Leagues and two French leagues along with a Confederations Cup? That’s a steal for that sort of experience. I think <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> may just have got the best of this window. They’ve got some exciting ­attacking players and also brought in <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> for a decent price. Again, they ­desperately needed defenders and now they have two with pedigree.</p>

It isn’t supposed to be personal, but it’s a rotten experience when someone is calling you out in front of millions of people. Like it or not, it comes with the territory of the game. I can assure <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> that when Graeme is assessing his performances in the TV studio he will be doing it through cold, calculating eyes. He will see a player who is hugely talented, a player who has lifted football’s ultimate prize, but, ultimately, a footballer who hasn’t been fulfilling his potential when wearing a United shirt. And that will frustrate the hell out of <a href="graeme-souness.html">Graeme Souness</a>. What is encouraging is that <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> is obviously aware from his comments that he has something to prove. Hopefully, when we return to some kind of normality, he will show us all what he can do</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> legend Robbie Fowler has said that football must not turn on itself when the coronavirus crisis ends]</b> There are no black-and-white decisions, only shades of what’s right and wrong. I even feel guilty for just thinking about sport during the current health crisis. But conversations have to take place now about what the future will bring - and that includes how we eventually get back to playing and watching.<br /><br />Voiding the season would lead to all kinds of legal challenges - and so would any attempt to rule that league tables should stand from the date the lockdown came<br /><br />I hope that everyone ­accepts when a decision is made it has the best interests of football at heart. The last thing we need once the health crisis is over is for football to be plunged into a civil war that will take the game into the courts. We need to remember what’s really important.<br /><br /><b>[Fowler has warned fans, however, not to expect to be able to cheer on their sides in a live environment for a long time to come]</b> What I am sure of is that football cannot afford to wait for when it’s safe for fans to return to stadiums. Mass gatherings will be the last thing the government ­allows once lockdown ­measures begin to be lifted. So it’s increasingly likely games must be played behind closed doors.<br /><br />Is that ideal? Of course not. It goes against all my natural instincts. But it is the lesser of all the evils. Not least because I think watching football again will give millions of people something to look forward to in the months ahead.<br /><br />Sports, hobbies and pastimes help us to stay sane. For many, they are a way of life. We can’t visit our families or friends, go to the cinema, shopping centre, gym or the pub. So, once the authorities believe it’s safe for players and officials to cross the white line again, it will give all who love the world’s most popular game a massive lift</p>

  <p><b>[Fowler ‘not playing around’ in Brisbane coaching hotseat]</b> I wouldn’t say it was make-or-breakbut it wasn’t far off! I think people had a certain impression of me. And it wasn’t the right one<br /><br />That was all I wanted - a chance. I feel like I was getting rid of a stigma, if you like. I was showing people how passionate and dedicated I am to my coaching career. If you go overseas for your first job like I have, you’re not playing around are you? I don’t want to sound egotistical, but I think it showed a bit of bollocks<br /><br /><b>[Fifteen new players were recruited, with a focus on attitude and mentality]</b> It was a fresh start for everyone, not just us. We knew there were a lot of issues to sort out. We had to bring that winning mentality, get people pulling together and believing in what they were doing. We only played our fifth home game on January 11. When you’re trying to bed in a new team and new ideas, that’s far from ideal!<br /><br />I knew we needed to build from the back. Which may have surprised a few people given I’m a striker. Since Christmas, our mentality has shone through. We’ve shot up the table, and we’ve handled the pressure. With only 11 teams in the league, it means that you play a lot of games against teams in and around you, so you know a defeat can see you fall down the table. That puts extra pressure on each game, but the lads have responded to that superbly.<br /><br />Any time I asked the lads to deliver when there was a bit of pressure on us, they pulled it out. That tells me something about the character of this team.<br /><br />My goalkeeper, Jamie Young, is another I would mention. His attitude is as good as anyone I’ve seen. I never played him at the start of the season. But what I loved was that he went away, worked on all the things I’d spoken to him about, and he became a better keeper. In the end, he got his chance six or seven games into the season, and he’s been absolutely outstanding. If I’m looking for an example to show to the players of what you need to do, how you need to train, your attitude, all that, then the likes of him, the likes of Tom, Scott, they’re the ones to look up to<br /><br /><b>[He admits that reading comments from Phil Moss, the president of Football Coaches Australia, stating he shouldn’t be appointed]</b> What was laughable about that is that he’s an English fella who went over to Australia at a young age and got a job. Now he’s saying that clubs shouldn’t be appointing foreign coaches! But I’ve always had that. I’ve always had people writing things about me, all through my career. And I’ve always used that in terms of ‘I’m going to prove you wrong, I’m going to show you’. It’s no different as a manager to when I was a player</p>

  <p><b>[Robbie Fowler on the art of goalscoring]</b> Do you know what the best sound in football is? It’s the noise when the ball hits the back of the net. That sound, it’s just sheer satisfaction. That’s what I lived for. I absolutely love it. I can barely walk now, let alone run! But if I see a ball lying around, I can’t help myself. I have to smash it into the goal, I just have to. I need it. I need that sound. That’s what I wanted - to be the hero. It was always the buzz for me. It was why I wanted to play. I talk about the sound of the ball hitting the back of the net, that can be on the park or on the training field or in the back garden, but when it’s in a proper game and you see the goalkeeper scrambling across, trying to get there, and you know he can’t. That’s as good as it gets.<br /><br /><b>[How does Fowler himself see it?]</b> You know, it used to be a bugbear of mine. They’d call me ‘natural’ as if I’d never had to work hard. But when you sit down and analyse it, it’s a massive, massive compliment, isn’t it? It’s natural, or it looks natural, because of the hours and hours and hours, the monotony of doing the same thing over and over again, the same drills, the same exercises. That’s what you’re trying to do, make it natural, so it comes easy and you don’t have to think about it. When people say I was a natural goalscorer now, I take it as a big compliment. I worked very hard to be ‘natural’<br /><br />There was this metal gate around the field. And what I’d do, I’d drop-kick the ball with my right foot, over and over again until it felt comfortable. Then I’d put the ball on the floor, run up and strike it off my right, over and over again. It sounds boring doesn’t it? It was never boring for me. I wanted to do it. I wanted to get better. I love the saying ‘repetition, repetition’ repetition’ because it’s true. If you want to master something, you’ve got to work at it<br /><br />I look at the goals I scored with my right foot, particularly early in my career, and it shows the benefits of hard work. The same with heading. I am only 5’9, but I scored a lot of headers. That came from the simplest of drills, throwing a ball up and jumping, throwing it against a wall and directing it. Working on timing and bravery, keeping your eyes open to meet it. Sometimes the old drills are the best ones!<br /><br />I count myself very lucky. With <a href="ian-rush.html">Ian Rush</a>, I saw what was needed to be a real top-class centre forward. It wasn’t a case of him taking me aside and teaching me the game. I’d see it on the training field every day. I’d see his runs, the way he anticipated things, the way he’d alter his finishes depending on the situation. To watch and learn from one of the best ever, it was a privilege. He would give me pointers, but it was usually the simplest of things. He’d talk about how to time your run, how to bend a run, how to get yourself out of the defender’s eyeline, shooting across the goalkeeper, through a defender’s legs so the keeper is unsighted. It sounds ridiculously simple, doesn’t it? But it’s not. People talk about goalscorers as selfish, and it’s true that you have to be in some situations, but so much of a centre-forward’s work is about creating space for others, dragging defenders out of position, making runs, stretching the game, always being on the move. Rushie was the master of that. I’d have been mad not to listen and take it in. If you can’t take advice from him, then you shouldn’t be in the game<br /><br /><b>[<a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a>, <a href="les-ferdinand.html">Les Ferdinand</a>, <a href="teddy-sheringham.html">Teddy Sheringham</a>, <a href="andy-cole.html">Andy Cole</a>, <a href="ian-wright.html">Ian Wright</a>, <a href="stan-collymore.html">Stan Collymore</a> - his star shone as bright as any]</b> It gives me pride to have been classed alongside those kind of players. I was a baby compared to them, wasn’t I? But I’ve always had this belief. I know what I can and can’t do, and I always had confidence. Let’s be honest, I wasn’t the same player throughout my career, but I always believed I could do it. I always felt I could score in any game<br /><br /><b>[Goal asks him to name his favourite strike]</b> It’s a good question! I scored a lot of important goals in my career, goals which gave me an awful lot of satisfaction, but my best goal, people might not agree, was at Charlton in the last game of the 2000-01 season. It was the importance which made it. Everything we achieved that year, winning three cups, it just capped it all off by helping us get into the Champions League. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> hadn’t been there for a few years, so it was a really big game for us. We’d won <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup on the Saturday, the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Cup on the Wednesday and we needed to win down at the Valley to get third place. We were poor in the first half and it was 0-0. Then after half time one dropped to me in the box off a corner, and I just sort of helped it over my shoulder and in. It was maybe not as spectacular as some others I scored, but it was a clever finish. After that we were comfortable. When I look back, I always love that goal.<br /><br /><b>[Does Fowler, a man with whom the No.9 shirt will forever be associated, lament this change in emphasis?]</b> No, not at all. Formations and tactics may change, but some things never will. There will always be a place for players who can put the ball in the net. Who are the two best players in the world? And why? It’s because they score incredible amounts of goals, as much as anything else. <b>[Robert]</b> <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a>, <b>[Harry]</b> <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a>, the same. No matter how the game changes, young kids will always want to be like those players, scoring goals and being the hero. That’s all I ever wanted, anyway!</p>

  <p><b>[Fowler: I’d be amazed if any <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> footballers don’t want to play when competition resumes]</b> I’ve been thinking about this ­question for some time. As a player, would I want to return when <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> resumes in June? As a manager, my choice is clear. When they say it is safe to resume with Brisbane Roar, I won’t have a second thought about leading the team. As a player, though, with the ­contact, the sweat and the closeness, would I be prepared to go out there? The answer is a resounding yes. Absolutely. And I’d go further - I’d ­genuinely be amazed if there are any <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> ­footballers who don’t want to play. I’m not diminishing any fears because I have said all along they should only return when it feels safe to do so.

But, on top of that, players already have regular blood tests to check their fitness markers. They wear heart monitors in training, they are weighed, they are examined, they have their ­oxygen levels, VO2 max levels, every level you can think of, tested all the time. And those tests will be stepped up. They are young and fit too, so not in the highly dangerous over-75 category. And when people speak about the risk of having vulnerable family members at home, again, the testing programme could help. If they are checked and there are signs of the virus, then they can isolate, away from those family members. Straight away</p>

For a start, there’s the quarantine the UK Government wants to introduce. If people have to self-isolate when they come back from abroad, then that would mean teams not being able to play for at least a fortnight following any European trips. There are ways around it, I suspect. I reckon the only sensible thing to do with the Champions League is make it a tournament, in a neutral city, with a straight knock-out after the remaining games of the round of 16 are finished. You could finish it in 10 days, with the final at the end of it. The German league will have finished a little earlier, but <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> and <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> will all finish sometime in July.

I realise he’s a talented player, he has moments of real brilliance in matches that underline his quality, but I stand by this: is Werner up to the standard of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s current front three? Not for me. Obviously my opinion will be put to the test next season if he does complete a move to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. There has been so much rumour around his intended destination for months now, with my former club at the heart of that, but most of the other big names in European football have been linked to him. I’ve also seen the meltdown from some <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans when they ­realised he’s probably not leaving <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> after all. It makes it seem as though he’s a <a href="marco-van-basten.html">Marco van Basten</a>, a world-class player who would walk into any side. For the life of me, I don’t know why.

Does he match up to the players you are signing him to challenge and replace? Not at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Maybe at Chelsea<br /><br /><b>[Fowler added on <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s reluctance to meet Werner’s price tag]</b> I’ve heard so many people ­complaining about <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> owners not splashing the cash, not diving in on ­Werner when he’s a ‘steal’ at £52m. Is he really, though?

How do we know that? Because otherwise, they would have activated it. To be honest, I see a situation where <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> saw perhaps the only circumstance in which they would sign Werner. That they had to pay the ­release fee to get him - because other clubs wouldn’t. In short, they had to pay a massive premium to make him come to their club. We’ve seen it before with clubs struggling a tiny bit - they pay over the odds to get players. City had to do that for a while, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> themselves too. At times, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have done that over the past two decades. It rarely worked for them</p>
