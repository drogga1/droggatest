<blockquote>
  <p><b>[<a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a> went against the advice of a former coach at <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> when making a €126 million move to <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>, with Renato Paiva having urged him to join <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> Yes. I said <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. I said City because of <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>, or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> because of the way they play. I think the characteristics of Joao are better in that kind of game. I respect… for God’s sake, I respect <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> a lot. But the idea of City I think was better for Joao, especially with Pep<br /><br /><b>[Paiva admits to having closely monitored Felix’s progress since he was 10 years old]</b> He came and was not so excited to play, but <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> was very important and gave him a new life. Joao though, did his work and is responsible for everything that is happening now. In the first week of training, I was watching him working and exercising. I said to my assistant: ‘What do we have here? Are you seeing the same thing I am seeing now? ‘What we have here is a diamond. How is it possible that this guy cannot play for <a href="porto-fc.html">Porto</a>?’. He did amazing things you never ever see - that’s what I miss. Every training session he did things that you didn’t expect, an unpredictable player, with lots of great attributes, both the technical and tactical. Even physically he’s very smart, the way he avoids contact. Joao is a complete player</p>
