  <p><b>[On himself]</b> He helped me understand what the coach wanted from a full-back. The Italian league is very tactical, the teams are extremely compact. You have very little time to think with the ball at your feet. I wasn’t expecting that but it’s helped me improve so much.<br /><br /><b>[he stopped playing football games online with Real Madrid duo Danilo and Casemiro because he was ending up on the wrong end of too many beatings]</b> I used to get too annoyed! Frosinone, Napoli, Bayern Munich - it doesn’t make a difference. The Juve mentality is simple and I like it: you must only follow the straight line that leads to victory</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Sandro claims to have ignored links to Chelsea]</b> I have always remained focused on my work and my only thought has always been Juventus, with whom I still have two years of contract. I feel really good and I am satisfied with my condition today. My goal is first of all to win everything with Juventus. Then, the World Cup will come and I hope to deserve a call from the Selecao by doing well here.</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus defender Alex Sandro has revealed he wants to play in the Premier League in the future]</b> I think, one day, who knows what will happen? I have a desire to play in the Premier League but right now I am very happy where I am at, the club I am at <b>[Juventus]</b>, the league I am playing in. So today my only thought is to continue where I am because that’s where I feel happy</p>
