  <p><b>[Barcelona transfer target Luka Jovic has similar attributes to potential new team-mate Luis Suarez]</b> All I can say is that of course, I wish him all the best and the greatest possible success, and it is clear that he has enormous potential. He can achieve great things. I might compare him to Barcelona’s Luis Suarez. He is a classic goalscorer, with very good ball handling and a great understanding of the game. He is courageous and at any time dangerous because he always lurking for his chance, and he can explout the smallest mistake of his opponent. Sometimes he seems listless, but that deceives the defenders and makes him even more dangerous<br /><br /><b>[Frankfurt duo Mijat Gacinovic and Filip Kostic were also named in Krstajic’s latest squad alongside Jovic]</b> All three have fitted really well into the system Frankfurt play. Their individual qualities were, for me, never in question. They are showing there that three footballers from the Balkans can play together in one team. And with Croatia’s Ante Rebic there are even four. Jovic has adapted much faster to the football of the Bundesliga than many expected. But also Gacinovic and Kostic contribute a lot to the team’s harmony</p>

  <p><b>[Nemanja Matic is the latest Manchester United player to withdraw from his national team’s upcoming]</b> Nemanja Matic will not play in Wolfsburg, nor in Lisbon. He played the last match for his club but did not stay on the field until the end</p>

  <p><b>[Why Madrid and Barcelona are ‘fighting over’ Frankfurt sensation Luka Jovic]</b> I wish him all the best and the greatest possible success, and it is clear that he has enormous potential. He can achieve great things. I would compare him to Luis Suarez, a classic striker with a good ball handling and a good understanding of the game. Dangerous at any time because he is always on the lookout for his chance. He takes advantage of even the slightest carelessness of his opponents.</p>
