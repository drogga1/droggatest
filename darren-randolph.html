  <p><b>[Darren Randolph praised the team effort as West Ham earned themselves a point against Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday]</b> <b>[It was]</b> busy, we had to dig deep to get something. And we did - we rode our luck a little bit and we had to defend for lives at times, but we got that luck and the break of the ball. We are satisfied with the point.<br /><br />It was important to have a good performance after last week and show we can compete against big teams. We wanted to put in a shift today and we believed could get something out of the game. It was not just me that had to stay switched on, it was the whole team, which they were and got a point.</p>

  <p><b>[Slaven Bilic reiterated his faith in West Ham goalkeeper Darren Randolph, despite a costly error in their 2-2 Premier League draw at Liverpool]</b> The lads worked hard and we managed to get ourselves ahead in the game, but I’m upset with the equaliser. It’s one of those things, it happens. I move on. It’s the nature of his job <b>[mistakes being punished]</b>. Apart from the mistake he was solid and made some great saves. I am happy with him.</p>
