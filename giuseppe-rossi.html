  <p><b>[Giuseppe Rossi on turning down the chance to play for his country of birth]</b> In 2005, when I was 18, <a href="bruce-arena.html">Bruce Arena</a> asked me to come to camp and train with the United States team in Scotland if I wanted to be part of it. It was flattering and amazing to get called up, but my dreams were to be a part of the Italian national team. It was how I was brought up. All my family, except me and my sister, were born in Italy. Growing up I used to watch the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> every Sunday morning. When I thanked them and said no, I knew I was turning down a big national team. But Italy was where I wanted to be. I made my decision, it’s where I love to play</p>

  <p><b>[Giuseppe Rossi is hoping for an opportunity to restart his career with either the New York Red Bulls or New York City FC]</b> This year, since I’ve been a free agent for longer than I expected, I asked if I could train with them just to have the possibility to be on the field with a very good team like the Red Bulls. I can keep fit and keep playing and have fun, which is exactly what I’m having - a lot of fun with those guys.<br /><br /><b>[Rossi admitted he is rooting for the Red Bulls as they face Atlanta United]</b> I’m happy they are doing really good. They deserve it. It’s a great group of guys and I’m really pulling for them to take the title back home<br /><br />These are all possibilities I am keeping open, obviously. Coming home and playing home would be something amazing. It would be something amazing because this area in New Jersey is in my blood. I would love to be a part of the soccer culture that is around this area - the New Jersey/New York area - obviously, it takes two to tango, am I right? I would love to sit down to talk<br /><br />My family, they’re all Italians. My parents came here when they were 15 or 16 years old. Obviously, my first language when I was born was Italian. I grew up in a household speaking a lot of Italian. When it came to soccer, I used to watch Milan. I used to watch Serie A. I used to watch the Italian national team because that’s what I grew up watching - that’s what I grew up falling in love with. My mind was made up already when I was 2 years old - it wasn’t something I made up when I was 18 years old. I just hope people understand that. I know there’s a lot of people that don’t want to understand it. Everything I did was the Italian way - it’s the way I was brought up</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Manchester United attacker Giuseppe Rossi has praised Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for his immediate impact]</b> It’s not an easy task to come to Manchester United, taking over in such a very critical part of the season and he’s been doing amazing. He brought back the Manchester United way, he brought back the tranquillity that maybe this environment needed. You’ve just got to tip your hat off to him and his coaching staff that have done just an amazing job.<br /><br /><b>[Rossi praised Sir Alex Ferguson as the best manager who ever lived]</b> I had breakfast with him at Carrington the other day. We were talking and talking and he still remembers the transfer fee when I got sold. Just think about it: It was 11 years ago and in that 11-year span there have been hundreds of transfer fees and he still remembered my transfer fee when I went to Villarreal. It’s great to see him in high spirits and great to see him just being about here on the football field</p>

  <p><b>[Giuseppe Rossi is determined to use his time back at Manchester United as a window to the world]</b> Of course! I’ve been ready for a while. Unfortunately, it’s been four or five months when I haven’t had a team but I’m just eager to get back<br /><br />I’m just waiting and seeing, taking it day by day and enjoying my training sessions with the guys. Like I said, I’ll take it day by day and see what happens but hopefully something good comes along. I’m still young, I’m still young! I’ve got a lot of quality football in me and I came here to show it.<br /><br />I don’t know if there are a lot of teams that need strikers but this is a moment when many transfers happen, obviously in January, and we’ll just see. I’m still focused on what I’ve got to do and that’s playing football.<br /><br />I mean I had a long career. I’ve had a lot of ups and a few downs, unfortunately, with these injuries. Whatever I can give back to the game to the young ones is always something I like to do. Whether I will always be available to do that, as I’m obviously focused on my game and trying to be better in my game. Hopefully, I’ll be good enough for any team I will be playing for in the future.</p>

  <p><b>[Giuseppe Rossi is humbled and grateful to have been given the opportunity to spend time back at Manchester United]</b> I’m very humbled and grateful for the opportunity. It’s a great gesture. I’ve had a rough few years with injuries, and that takes a lot away from you - but I’ve always been able to bounce back and come back stronger. I’m here, I’m ready for any challenge and I’m training with the best players in the world, with the best team in the world. I cannot ask for more.<br /><br /><b>[Sir Alex Ferguson among those to have been impressed by Rossi’s contribution to training at United]</b> It’s always great to hear that. I saw the boss <b>[Ferguson]</b> a week ago and chatted with him about old times, and it’s great to see him around the football field in high spirits.<br /><br />It’s very hard to come in mid-season and have these results, especially at United with a million eyes on you. In training I’m seeing the spirits are very high.</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> forward Giuseppe Rossi says <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>’s close relationships with his players made him unique as a manager]</b> It’s hard to compare <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> to anyone. He was very unique in the way that he is able to protect his players off the field, he treats you as if you’re his own kid. He protects you. He is someone that really cares for his players. On the field he makes his voice heard if he doesn’t like what he sees. It was a pleasure for me and I’m sure it was a pleasure for all the players that were under him to have him on your side<br /><br /><b>[Rossi said of meeting up with <a href="santi-cazorla.html">Santi Cazorla</a> again]</b> It’s crazy. When we were playing years ago we never thought we would have these situations in our careers. But it happens. It’s all part of sport and it’s how you come <b>[back]</b> and it’s the fight you put in to the recovery, to wanting to get back to your levels. I’ve been down and I came back up, particularly with Santi - he’s back to playing at these high levels, playing with the national team also so he’s definitely an inspiration to me and also to all the young players and to other players on this team. It’s crazy the parallels we have. It’s always great to see him back and to see him playing at those levels</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player Giuseppe Rossi says he is ready to find another club having spent the autumn training with former side <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a>]</b> I am having a difficult time because after the experience in Genoa where I could not feel important and I was forced to face the doping problem. The trial went on for a long time and the negotiations <b>[with other clubs]</b> that had opened in the meantime waned. Now, I train with <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a>. I don’t understand why I’m not part of a team yet. I think I’m a good player. I am recovered physically and mentally, I am ready to return to the player I used to be. The worst days were the two or three after the injuries, when I had to phone my mom to tell her that I had hurt myself. Certainly the most traumatic injury was when I was at <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> in 2014. I broke the cruciate ligament of the right knee when I was, at that stage, top scorer in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>.</p>

I can’t wait to step onto the pitch and help RSL achieve all the goals we’ve set this year. For me, <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> has been growing every year and has produced an exciting product. I’m lucky enough to have RSL be my first contact in the league during this process. The club’s respect and kindness towards me is something I appreciate immensely. I can’t wait to see and meet the fans and immerse myself in the RSL culture. Along with the rest of the team, I can’t wait to begin this season and enjoy the journey together</p>
