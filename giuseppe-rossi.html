  <p><b>[Giuseppe Rossi on turning down the chance to play for his country of birth]</b> In 2005, when I was 18, <a href="bruce-arena.html">Bruce Arena</a> asked me to come to camp and train with the United States team in Scotland if I wanted to be part of it. It was flattering and amazing to get called up, but my dreams were to be a part of the Italian national team. It was how I was brought up. All my family, except me and my sister, were born in Italy. Growing up I used to watch the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> every Sunday morning. When I thanked them and said no, I knew I was turning down a big national team. But Italy was where I wanted to be. I made my decision, it’s where I love to play</p>

Our objectives are to improve and to get as high up the table as possible. We can improve, and we’re doing so</p>

On the contrary, I get a headache from being angry that I am not playing. I want to show these people that I can return to the levels that everyone knows I am capable of. I want to and can still play in Serie A</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> forward Giuseppe Rossi says <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>’s close relationships with his players made him unique as a manager]</b> It’s hard to compare <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> to anyone. He was very unique in the way that he is able to protect his players off the field, he treats you as if you’re his own kid. He protects you. He is someone that really cares for his players. On the field he makes his voice heard if he doesn’t like what he sees. It was a pleasure for me and I’m sure it was a pleasure for all the players that were under him to have him on your side<br /><br /><b>[Rossi said of meeting up with <a href="santi-cazorla.html">Santi Cazorla</a> again]</b> It’s crazy. When we were playing years ago we never thought we would have these situations in our careers. But it happens. It’s all part of sport and it’s how you come <b>[back]</b> and it’s the fight you put in to the recovery, to wanting to get back to your levels. I’ve been down and I came back up, particularly with Santi - he’s back to playing at these high levels, playing with the national team also so he’s definitely an inspiration to me and also to all the young players and to other players on this team. It’s crazy the parallels we have. It’s always great to see him back and to see him playing at those levels</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player Giuseppe Rossi says he is ready to find another club having spent the autumn training with former side <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a>]</b> I am having a difficult time because after the experience in Genoa where I could not feel important and I was forced to face the doping problem. The trial went on for a long time and the negotiations <b>[with other clubs]</b> that had opened in the meantime waned. Now, I train with <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a>. I don’t understand why I’m not part of a team yet. I think I’m a good player. I am recovered physically and mentally, I am ready to return to the player I used to be. The worst days were the two or three after the injuries, when I had to phone my mom to tell her that I had hurt myself. Certainly the most traumatic injury was when I was at <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> in 2014. I broke the cruciate ligament of the right knee when I was, at that stage, top scorer in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[Real Salt Lake have announced the signing of Giuseppe Rossi]</b> It feels great to now be a part of Real Salt Lake. I can’t wait to step onto the pitch and help RSL achieve all the goals we’ve set this year. For me, <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> has been growing every year and has produced an exciting product. I’m lucky enough to have RSL be my first contact in the league during this process. The club’s respect and kindness towards me is something I appreciate immensely. I can’t wait to see and meet the fans and immerse myself in the RSL culture. Along with the rest of the team, I can’t wait to begin this season and enjoy the journey together</p>
