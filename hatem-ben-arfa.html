  <p><b>[Nice midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa has not given up hope of returning to the France team in time for next year’s Uefa Euro 2016]</b> It’s still far but why not. The France team has many good players. It is already a very solid group that has been together for a long time, there is a base. It is difficult to enter. But it’s up to me to prove to the field to try to be there.</p>

The Europa League was one of the criteria, but the important thing was the setting and Stade Rennes has changed in size. There was Nice too but it’s hard to go back with your ex.</p>

That’s what was in my head. But I did see the same Emery, as agitated as ever. I looked over at him a few times and that made me laugh a little. He hasn’t changed. I told some friends before the match that my prediction was that we would win 3-1 or 4-1. We didn’t manage to get the fourth but my prediction was right</p>

  <p><b>[Hatem Ben Arfa is contemplating his future at Rennes]</b> Guingamp deserved to win. In the game, they were much more ambitious than us. These last games have given me the opportunity to know better what I am going to do next season. I am oriented by the game. I do not take pleasure and we need to be guided by this. What we are offering is limited, so it guides my choice.<br /><br />The whistles from the fans? After what we’ve done this season, I can only say thanks to them. The group has shown a lot of things this year, it had been 48 years since they had won a Cup I think, they had never experienced a European adventure like this, I can only say thank you. In the end, when you get whistled at (when he was replaced by Jeremy Gelin in the 81st minute), it also plays a part.<br /><br /><b>[Ben Arfa is out of contract at the end of June]</b> When you take a decision, you need to take the context into account.

  <p><b>[Following a disappointing 1-1 draw against Guingamp in the league last month, Hatem Ben Arfa spoke out and appeared to confirm his imminent departure]</b> Guingamp deserved to win. In the game, they were much more ambitious than us. These last matches have allowed me to see my path for next season. My decisions are based on the game. I am not enjoying it and I must be guided by that. What I am offered here is limited, so that directs my choice. The whistles of the public? After what we did this season, I can just say thank you. The group showed a lot of things this year, it was 48 years since they had won a cup, I think, they had never lived a European epic like the Europa League run. I can just say thank you. At the end, when we get whistled, it plays too. When we make a decision, we must take into account the context. There are lots of things that will make me see what I will do next season.</p>
