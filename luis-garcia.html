<blockquote>
  <p><b>[on <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, Suarez, and Neymar]</b> They are the best three in the history of football when you are talking about forwards. You see them playing, they are always happy, they are not selfish when they have to score. When one wins the penalty, another one takes it. It is very difficult to find that in a striker because normally strikers are selfish because they want to score and you see <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, probably the best player in the history of football, and he knows that Suarez can fight for the Golden Boot ‘okay go for it, get the penalty’ - it is very weird to find that</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Garcia says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have the power &amp; quality to beat Atletico]</b> <b>[I think it will be]</b> tough for both sides, to be honest. Here in Spain and in Madrid the feeling is a little bit the same - they know <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> is a tough stadium and not many teams get out alive, the crowd always helps the home team. <b>[But]</b> actually, they know <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a> knows how to deal with these kinds of situations.<br /><br />After what we saw in the Metropolitano, where they were working the way they normally do - defending very well, waiting for the chance and the fast transitions and counterattacks they do so well - they still think they can make it.<br /><br />And then the other way around, knowing <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and after being there many times in many situations where <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> needed to score goals and managed it, they know what <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> can be if they need to score one, two or three goals.<br /><br />I’m quite positive, to be honest. I think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have the power, quality and talent to overcome the situation and go through to the next round</p>
