  <p><b>[on <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, Suarez, and <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>]</b> They are the best three in the history of football when you are talking about forwards. You see them playing, they are always happy, they are not selfish when they have to score. When one wins the penalty, another one takes it. It is very difficult to find that in a striker because normally strikers are selfish because they want to score and you see <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, probably the best player in the history of football, and he knows that Suarez can fight for the Golden Boot ‘okay go for it, get the penalty’ - it is very weird to find that</p>

If he finishes the way he does with <b>[Cesc]</b> Fabregas, the way he does right now at Chelsea, then he’s going to be our striker with <b>[Paco]</b> Alcacer and maybe <b>[Fernando]</b> Torres, or maybe another player who is coming through right now.<br /><br />I think Isco is going to be one of our main men; with <b>[Andres]</b> Iniesta, with Santi Cazorla - hopefully he gets fit - <b>[David]</b> Silva of course, another player <b>[Sergio]</b> Busquets, the midfield is going to be very strong. And for me one of the most important players is going to be Isco for the national team because he’s got something different. It’s not about passing, or it’s not about pace, it’s about having something different and he’s going to probably be the key player to break some of the defenders of the other national teams<br /><br />We can win it, definitely, yes. It’s about the approach you have. I think they have been doing well. They’ve been winning games and then the confidence came back again after what happened during the last World Cup. Of course everybody was expecting Spain to be there for the semi-finals and then the final but they were so consistent for the last eight years, so it was difficult. No-one had done it before to stay there for so long. Spain, I think, are ready. The team Vicente del Bosque has got, I think that confidence was missing during the last World Cup and hopefully, like I said, the approach goes well and they can fight for the trophy</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool’s slump in form has come after a drop in intensity]</b> The intensity of the team was always high and that has been lacking the past couple of games. The pressure and pressing is not the same as it was a month ago. When the team goes forward it breaks a little bit, leaving a lot of spaces like we saw against Wolves. It leaves just three at the back and we now struggle against counterattacks. Teams know that and wait for the chances. The players are tired because of so many games. It is true that they have to change - but not that much because the players would be asking why after only a few bad results. They need to keep going the same way but maybe find someone who can help in the middle of the park because they are struggling there with all the injuries<br /><br /><b>[On the challenge posed by Chelsea in midweek]</b> It is a difficult, difficult game especially how it has been these past few weeks but we cannot be worried about the title race because that was only possible for a short period of time. The target at the beginning of the season was to finish inside the top four. For that we need to worry because teams around Liverpool are only getting better</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Garcia expects Steven Gerrard’s coaching career to carry him into the managerial hot-seat at Liverpool]</b> Having Stevie around the academy will be a big boost because he is a very important character for Liverpool. I’m sure everyone at the club is very happy to have him there and I cannot see why he will not be the manager one day. He’s getting his badges with young players. Why not? We will see in a couple of years, first as an assistant coach and then manager. We’ve seen it before.<br /><br /><b>[On Jordan Henderson]</b> Even though they didn’t play the same position, with Stevie more of a box to box player, right now I can see Henderson dictating the tempo and that’s what he took from Stevie. How to move a team with his passes - and he has a fantastic pass - and be the second line and score important goals</p>

  <p><b>[Philippe Coutinho is considered to be a natural successor to Andres Iniesta at Barcelona]</b> It is not the first time he has been linked to Barcelona and it would be a tough call for him, but hopefully he decides to stay at Liverpool. Coutinho is a very important player for Liverpool and, as a former player from both teams and the love I have for both of them, I would like to see Coutinho for a few more years in a red shirt. Coutinho is still a very young player. Iniesta is maybe going to be in the first team for two of three more years and with the quality and technique that Coutinho has got it would be a brilliant time for the team <b>[for him to join]</b>.</p>

Like Coutinho, he is a special player who can do everything - from nowhere they can score a brilliant goal or play a brilliant pass. He is good with the right and the left, he is fast and he has got the ability to dribble past players. This year we have seen his best, but I think he can continue growing. He is one of those players that in the next couple of years we’re going to see as even more of a top player for the team.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Liverpool star Luis Garcia says Roberto Firmino, Mo Salah and Sadio Mane are the stars his side never had]</b> The difference is that in our team there were no star individuals. We knew that we did not have players like Firminho, Mane and Salah, who can create a chance or goal from nothing. We did not have that, but we also created chances and everything we did was built on teamwork. It was very difficult to score against us. This current Liverpool side is different - they are a team that always wants to attack and generates many chances and score many goals because they know they are strongest in their front line.<br /><br />Benítez was much more strategic. Klopp has an offensive style and is very close to his players on a personal level. Both achieved something that is not easy, and they established a link with the fans and that is very good<br /><br /><b>[On Philippe Coutinho]</b> Maybe you can think they won’t miss Coutinho because it seems that the team is doing very well and they are scoring goals. But I think in the long term they will miss him. He was a key player for Liverpool creating chances from midfield</p>

Since his arrival, he has scored goals and has given a new character to the team. When he is playing, anything can happen thanks to his determination and effort.<br /><br />Atletico have a good chance to win the Europa League. They may well have the strongest squad in the competition. Anything can happen, but if we remember how well Simeone does in the knockout stage, I think they have the chance of taking the trophy<br /><br />There are other big teams: Borussia Dortmund, Milan, Arsenal, Olympique Marseille. They can all make things difficult for Atletico, though I think Atleti are the most powerful of all</p>

  <p><b>[Surprise package Liverpool like 2005 Champions League winners]</b> I can’t wait! There’s nothing like a big European night at Anfield. I’m really looking forward to it.<br /><br />Yes, I see the similarities. Like in 2005, I don’t think people expected Liverpool to be here. Obviously they had to battle really hard just to get into the top four last season, and so to now be in the semi finals and having a great chance to go further, I think they’ve surprised a lot of people. It’s not been lucky though. They’ve shown the team spirit and the quality that they have, and with the likes of Salah and co, they have given belief to their supporters. Having beaten Manchester City in the last round, they will not be afraid of any challenge now, that’s for sure<br /><br />I think when the draw was made Liverpool were happy. That is not me saying that Roma are an easy team to play against or anything, but when you consider that the alternatives were Bayern Munich and Real Madrid, you can see why you would feel this gives the team a better chance to progress. Roma showed how strong they are in the last round against Barcelona, but if we are talking about the chance to reach the final, I think this is the game which gives Liverpool the best possible opportunity<br /><br />He wasn’t the only one! I think after the way Barcelona performed in the first leg, we all thought they were going to the semi-finals. But this is football, and things can happen. Results like that can happen even to the great sides, it’s why we love the game and why we all watch it with such passion. Barcelona were the ones who made a miracle happen last year against Paris Saint-Germain, but they were on the other end of things this time. That’s the beauty of football, no matter how long you are watching it, it can still come and surprise you like that. Obviously I am sad as a former Barcelona man that they are not in the last four, but they’ll be back I’m sure. They always are!<br /><br /><b>[On Jurgen Klopp]</b> I think he’s doing a great job. He is making progress with the club and you can see that in the way the team is playing. The supporters have a team that is very strong, very consistent and plays in a way that can make them proud. I think that is important for Liverpool fans. They love to see their team win, but they love to see them playing with aggression and passion, and with Klopp they get that. Anfield is a great place to watch football at any time, but this season it has gone up a level<br /><br />Playing at Anfield is special. But playing at Anfield in the Champions League is even more so. There are few places like it. The supporters know that they can make a difference. They know that by being loud and supporting the team, they can affect the result. I was lucky enough to witness that in the last round against Manchester City - anyone who tells me the fans do not have any effect should watch that game and think again! As a player, a Liverpool player, it lifts you because you feel this power at your back. As an opponent, I can only imagine what it does! For me, the most important moments are the ones where things are maybe not going for you, where you are under pressure or you are struggling. That is when you feel the fans the most, you feel them encourage you and lift you from the floor. Until I came to Liverpool, I don’t think I realised the importance of fans in a football match<br /><br />It’s been a remarkable season. When you think that teams of the strength of Barcelona, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus, Chelsea, Manchester United are all out. Any of those teams could have thought about winning the competition I am sure. But here we are. Liverpool and Roma are the surprise teams, if you like. They are the ones that probably nobody expected to be there, but they deserve to be there. And well, one of them will be in the final. I hope it’s Liverpool!</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Garcia sees Van Dijk bringing the kind of presence vital for a team with title aspirations]</b> It’s so important because at the end, in the back, it’s the one who rules or consults what is happening in front of you. So, having someone who you respect, who is talking always in a positive way, and a constructive way, and also perform the way that, for example right now, Van Dijk is doing. He plays in the air, does well with the ball. I think it was very important and necessary because of the lack of personalities on the pitch, only with Milner and Henderson in the last couple of years, they’ve been the players to become our Gerrards or Carraghers or Hyypias<br /><br />I think the balance right now is very good. It was very important to work on that. Jurgen knew it from the very beginning of the season. But at the end bringing in Van Dijk I think gave a lot of confidence to the players around him. I think it was very, very important for the club to organise at the back because you know how much talent we have up front</p>

  <p><b>[Can Coutinho be Barcelona’s new Neymar?]</b> It was hard to sign Philippe and to get him was a real bonus as he was an idol at Liverpool. The people there loved him but everything calmed down when their team reached the Champions League final. It’s true they had the attack covered with <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane, <b>[Mohamed]</b> Salah and <b>[Roberto]</b> Firmino, but it was still a shock when we were able to sign him. Coutinho brings a lot to Barca. We are going to miss <b>[Andres]</b> Iniesta a lot because we won’t see a special player like him for many years, but Philippe is similar to Iniesta and gives you goals, which you need from midfield. At times we rely too much on Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez and to have a player who can change a game with one shot is something we were not accustomed to seeing.<br /><br />Coutinho is different to Neymar but he can have the same impact at Barca because he can score more goals, or at least the same Neymar is eye-catching as he plays a lot with the ball, his runs are 50 metres, but when it comes to effectiveness they are similar. We still have to see how good he is from free-kicks. He was a bit lost in his first few games but he ended up dominating. People are going to see how good he is.</p>

Of course, it has to be the aim, but focussing on each game at a time will help to achieve the all-important goals.<br /><br />We have lots of really great players at the moment and it’s exciting to watch our strikers - Salah, Mane, Firmino and now Keita all look very skilful and I love to see them play<br /><br />I’ve always liked the goal against Chelsea in the 2005 Champions League semi-finals, because of what it meant for us. But, I’d probably say the goal against Juventus was the nicest one. Playing against Chelsea in the semi-finals was a great moment, but winning the Champions League final in 2005 and lifting the Cup was definitely the best moment</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah sits just behind Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in the global pecking order]</b> If Liverpool win trophies then I think it will be much easier for the club to keep Mo Salah. We know that Barcelona and Real Madrid will be in the market for the best players in the summer. And if you talk about the best players in the world right now then Mo Salah must be included. I have seen the talk that Barca and Madrid are interested in him and we have seen in the past with <b>[Luis]</b> Suarez and <b>[Philippe]</b> Coutinho how difficult it is for players to say ‘no’ when they get the chance to sign for one of those clubs. At this moment, though, I think Liverpool are a different club than what they were. Last year they reached the Champions League final. This time they are challenging for the Premier League and the Champions League. They are now a club with the potential to win the big trophies<br /><br />If Barcelona or Real Madrid come you will be flattered. They are probably the only two teams that a Liverpool player would think about signing for. As a player you want to win trophies. If you sign for Real Madrid or Barcelona you know you are going to win trophies. At this moment, Liverpool are also a club that gives you the chance to win trophies - and they will now want to take that final step. There is no doubt that Salah would be a star at Real Madrid or Barcelona because he has such fantastic quality. I have heard people compare him to Messi. For me, that is a little too much, but he does have that speed and skill and he could perform for any team in the world. In my opinion, he is just behind Messi and Ronaldo - at the same level as <b>[Eden]</b> Hazard and <b>[Raheem]</b> Sterling.</p>
