  <p><b>[Christian Ziege can definitely see if <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> I can definitely see it. You always have to be careful since you don’t know what is just being discussed in the media and what is true. But <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> proved what he is capable of last year. They did not buy a single player and went to the Champions League final. He developed the team incredibly and always finished amongst the top four in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. This was not always the case at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. That’s why I have a lot of confidence in this coach, even the biggest challenges. But, from what I’ve understood, in how he’s talked in the past, it’s that he feels very much at home where he is right now</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Ziege believes <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> boss <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> can rightly be considered the best coach in world football]</b> I think you have to be careful with that. To rate the best coach in the world you have to count in all coaches, even the ones working in low-class leagues. The conditions that <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>, <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> or <a href="niko-kovac.html">Niko Kovac</a> are having, many coaches don’t. So you need to be careful with that title. If you take those who everybody talks about, there is no one who did better than <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>. I’m a big fan of his because he started at Mainz and finished fourth three times in a row in the second division.<br /><br />He made Mainz a club who finally got promoted and developed to an incredible club. Then he went to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. He took this club to German champions and a Champions League title candidate. He elevated this club to a level which they are still today. He went to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, the club who has been talking about becoming <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> champions or being more successful for years and has been achieving the same there. He won the Champions League and finished second in the league with 97 points, which is mayhem. Now he’s leading the league again, even though it is still early in the campaign. This proves to me that he has to be an exceptional coach, because all of this can’t happen by accident<br /><br /><b>[Ziege insists <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> cannot yet be considered favourites to clinch the title]</b> They have to face <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> twice, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> twice, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> twice, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> once and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> once. You can always lose those games and the most difficult part is to win against those teams that are in the bottom of the table. However, the other teams need to overcome the same difficulties in order to catch <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. <b>[The start]</b> boosts your confidence, but it can all be gone within two games. It is way to early for a decision, much can happen</p>
