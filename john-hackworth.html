  <p><b>[USA U-17s top Brazil 3-0 to win Nike Friendlies championship]</b> I was in this job previously in my career and I’ve talked about it a lot, our soccer and tactical understanding are getting better. The players are technical enough now that we can play against the best teams in the world and in some cases, not only compete with them on a technical and tactical side, but be successful like we were this week. I don’t like to put results and development together as one, but it is an important part of the process that you learn how to be successful, in these games and tournaments.</p>

  <p><b>[Josh Sargent and Timothy Weah were two of the 21 players named to the United States U-17 World Cup roster on Thursday]</b> This cycle of players is unique in terms of the quality, depth and work ethic of the group. The biggest challenge in selecting this roster was the competition for spots at almost every position. Our team is looking forward to this opportunity to compete for the U-17 World Cup and are motivated to prove themselves on the world stage</p>

  <p><b>[John Hackworth heaped praise on India Under-17 team ahead of their clash on October 6th in the Under-17 World Cup]</b> It wasn’t a 4-0 game. I think India are a quality team. I thought they are the hardest working team we have faced in these two years. I think they have developed and got better. At the same time, I think we too have got better. But I do know that the Indian team will be absolutely up for this game at home in front of a hopefully packed stadium. They will be tough opponents.<br /><br />It’s been nice. We hear stories and things, but we have been here since Sunday and we were in Dubai before that. Dubai was hard to be in. It’s hot and humid. But the climate here has been nice. You could see there’s no pollution in the air</p>

  <p><b>[John Hackworth says we should probably be the favourite against India]</b> It’s not easy to play the host nation in the opener.

  <p><b>[USMNT’s John Hackworth says We will have to contain Aniket Jadhav]</b> I think that’s really interesting. I will approach differently. Our defence plays well and that initiates our attack to be where we want it to be. This is a dangerous Indian team. Their number nine is a good player. We have to contain him otherwise it will be a difficult game for us. So it starts with defence for us as well.<br /><br />They are one of the hardest working teams. We played them last year. The score wasn’t indicative of how they compete. Our assumption without having seen them lately is that they have improved, they have used and seen as many players as possible. We have to come with a lot of respect. The environment will be on their side. We have to fight against them and the setting<br /><br /><b>[On being asked about the problems of plenty which he faces especially in attack]</b> It’s more of a problem before we get to the stage. We have a plan. Scout, pick a team and pick our eleven who have the best chance to be successful against India. We do have a deep roster of attacking players. It’s been a difficult selection process. 24 hours from the game, we hope we are ready and prepared and we will try to do that<br /><br />It’s a tough group when I look across. Playing the hosts in the opening game on home soil is a huge challenge. Obviously, Ghana and Colombia are world powers with the former especially in the Under-17 level. This is a difficult group. Tomorrow will set the tone for how things play out<br /><br />We have thankful of the resources USA has sent - from coming here a year before and also learning about the culture. It’s not a surprise here that the hotel is great. FIFA has done has a great job to make it even as possible. Many teams who are not this region will have a bit of a challenge and difficult adjustment to India</p>

  <p><b>[Josh Sargent-led U.S. U-17s look to break trend of disappointing World Cup performances]</b> Our team, relative to all the teams I’ve had in the past, this team has been - on a pure level of soccer - as good or better than so many of our opponents.<br /><br />Our reality used to be if we played a top team, a Brazil or Argentina or France or whoever it was, we probably weren’t standing toe-to-toe with them in terms of soccer regards. That was just the reality of it. Now, you see in our build-up, we have quality technically and tactically, and depth at several positions<br /><br />I don’t want to be overly confident, but I believe that now we can play with anybody. Now it’s more a matter of us executing<br /><br />There is a big difference when you get guys that can go in and play on a senior level, like Josh <b>[Sargent]</b> has and Andrew Carleton and Chris Goslin have. There is a speed and a physicality to the game that you can’t replicate in residency, or the youth level. You have to be up there with men doing it, and now that we have so many guys doing that it’s a huge plus for us<br /><br />There was a lesson, yes. We set out to accomplish something, and we thought we had it, and literally in the last second we lost it. That stings. I know the players talk about it, our staff talks about it, and we see this <b>[World Cup]</b> as our opportunity to right that wrong, if you will. I don’t think we need to talk about it as motivation. It just is <b>[motivation]</b>. We want to go prove ourselves again<br /><br />It’s not easy to play the host nation in the opener. They’re talking about the prime minister being there, and it being a full stadium. The preparation and investment that they’ve put into the U-17 team is impressive. We played them before, and had a fairly easy result in terms of the scoreline, but it was one of the hardest-working teams we’ve ever played against<br /><br />We should probably be the favorite against India, but anything can happens in an opening game.

  <p><b>[USMNT’s John Hackworth says Dheeraj Singh was exceptional for India]</b> Plan to kill the game in the first 20 minutes? Not at all. That’s credit to India for making it hard to get behind them. They were a tough opponent. We didn’t play great. We can play much better. You have to break down an opponent and our execution wasn’t great on the final play.<br /><br />We opted to play long diagonal balls. The idea was that the opposition had five defenders and nine players behind the ball. There was no space to play through. The long diagonal though didn’t get us that goal in the first 20 minutes. I think both their centre-backs <b>[Anwar Ali and Jitendra Singh]</b> played well. None of the balls that we put into the box especially in the opening 20 minutes, we didn’t think they would win as many balls<br /><br />The goalkeeper <b>[Dheeraj Singh]</b> made several saves in the opening 20 minutes. He was exceptional on the night. If he wouldn’t have made those saves, the game would have opened up. One save was off Josh Sargent and he doesn’t miss many. In the second half, we made some tactical adjustment which allowed us more space to play. Durkin finished from a corner-kick and I must say that he doesn’t usually finish as well as he did today<br /><br />Look before I give a rating to them, I thought they played really well. I would give them tons of credit. This was one of the best atmospheres for an Under-17 World Cup I have experienced. The Indians and FIFA must be proud for everything that tonight was. I think India exceeded our expectations. They were hard to break down. They were difficult to contain on the counter. I was impressed with their team</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT coach John Hackworth praised the performance of midfielder Christopher Gostlin who grabbed an assist for Ayo Akinola’s goal]</b> Goslin was an absolute warrior tonight. I told him that kind of performance was exceptional. In the last game, I played him as a defensive midfielder, time as an attacking midfielder. He also provided an assist. After this game, he has taken a huge step towards his growth.<br /><br />I don’t think it’s risky to do what we did. We believe we can compete with any team and that’s why we are here. We played the game in the manner that we have trained for the last three years. It was an excellent contest, more like a chess game<br /><br /><b>[On Ayo Akinola]</b> He has been a starter for us in every game at this level. I made the decision not to start him and he took it well. His actions, more importantly, were very good</p>

  <p><b>[USA U-17s relishing underdog role against familiar foe England]</b> For sure England is the favorite, and are worthy of that. They’ve been a good team, have a great record, and have been great in this tournament. But just like with Paraguay <b>[which was unbeaten before the U.S. delivered a 5-0 thumping]</b>, I didn’t get why people made us a big underdog against Paraguay. We beat Ghana, one of the best teams in this tournament, and I don’t think we were getting much respect.<br /><br />Obviously the Paraguay game gave us a little bit, but that being said, we role into this game and nobody’s giving us a chance and you wouldn’t think we had a chance in hell to win. So we’re going to use that to our advantage<br /><br />There’s no question we think they’ve been the best team we’ve played throughout this cycle. There’s a lot of mutual respect between the players. We stayed at the same hotels together in England and they played games together, ping-pong and foosball and all that kind of stuff. We’re at the same hotel now in Goa and it’s the same way. They give each other high fives walking through the common area. It’s interesting but there’s a mutual respect there because we play similar styles, and we’re both kind of stubborn in trying to concentrate on ourselves instead of our opponents. It’s going to make for an interesting chess match<br /><br /><b>[England team that plays free-flowing, attacking soccer]</b> They look to always find the free player on the field. Their movement off the ball is excellent. They do want their players to be comfortable dribbling out of pressure, and they’re good at it, but it’s also risky in a World Cup and it’s something we’re going to try and capitalize on<br /><br /><b>[The U.S. will go into the match without starting defensive midfielder Chris Goslin, who is suspended due to yellow card accumulation. His absence will force Hackworth to insert a new face in central midfield, be it Akil Watts or Indiana Vassilev]</b> Any time you go deep into a tournament like this, you need a deep squad. Guys are going to have to step up in moments. Akil Watts is a guy who can potentially step in.​ He played 90 against Paraguay and played very well against a player I thought had been one of the best in the tournament. Durkin would be a great option <b>[in the defensive midfield role]</b>, and that’s a natural position for him. It’s a natural position for James as well, but we will probably go with a new face there<br /><br />Sargent]&lt;/b&gt; does the work even when he doesn’t get the goals. That’s the part that I really like about him. He creates the opportunities for his teammates by making unselfish runs off the balls. Our team is a little different than how he was with the U-20s. With the 20s, he was expected to let everyone else do the work and provide him the ball. On our team, we ask him to do a lot of those things<br /><br />If you’re going to win the really big games, your star players have to lead the way. <b>[Sargent’s]</b> done that with his work ethic, and his ability on both sides of the ball. It would be great if he had one of those breakout moments <b>[against England]</b> because he’s the leader of this group. Both with his talent, his work ethic and the qualities he brings</p>

  <p><b>[USA U-17s pay the price for flat showing in World Cup loss to England]</b> I thought our team was ready to step up to the challenge, but in the first 20 minutes we were just so tentative. I thought we fought back, to be fair. If we got one when it was 2-0, I thought it would have been a different game.<br /><br />We played some really good football. We came against one of the best teams in the world tonight. We had some good moments. At the same time, the goalkeeper <b>[Curtis Anderson]</b> for England was up to the task. We also didn’t start the game in the right way.</p>
