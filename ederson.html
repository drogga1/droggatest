Any player who wears the Brazilian national team shirt is happy. I can’t talk about this summer market because I don’t know what happened. I didn’t follow the news very much. So I don’t know how to answer you about that. but I know that here, in the Brazilian team, he is happy. Of course <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is happy. I don’t know if he will play. This is a question that <b>[head coach]</b> <a href="tite.html">Tite</a> must answer. Because he’s the only person who can answer if he <b>[Neymar]</b> plays or if he does not play. We had just one training. And it was yesterday. It was a training session with the ball, so I cannot answer about it.</p>

And I’m having a good time too. Of course, these are opportunities. As a player you must be prepared for everything. I train as if I am always playing, which makes it easier for me to be used. I hope to make the best of the opportunities I have here and I’ll give my best</p>

  <p><b>[Ederson has revealed that he left manager <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> p<em>ssed off after comments he made about penalty-taking duties back in 2018]&lt;/b&gt; I heard them (the fans) chanting my name, asking me to take the penalty, but Gabriel went there. Unfortunately he missed it and Bernardo, fortunately, scored, but if the manager had asked me to go there, I would have definitely scored. I’m not sure if I would be able to do set-pieces, but I’m good at penalties, either using power or technique when I’m shooting. City have their regular penalty takers and we have good options, but if Pep asks me to take it, I’m there. Hopefully it will happen <b>[before the end of the season]</b>. I’d like to score<br /><br />One time we won 5-1 - I think - and the crowd was asking for me to take the penalty. In the mixed zone I was asked about it and I said that I had wanted to take it. <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> was p</em>ssed off!</b></p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> goalkeeper Ederson insists his rivalry with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> counterpart Alisson exists only on the pitch]</b> I think it’s a good sign for all the goalkeepers in Brazil and for the country. You look at Europe and you find two great goalkeepers playing at a high level in two of the best clubs. I have a good relationship, not only with Alisson, but also with <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> and <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a>. When we have a day off on the same day, we sometimes gather, we have a barbecue.

Our rivalry is only on the pitch<br /><br /><b>[The reigning champions are 11 points worse off than the Reds after playing a game more this time around]</b> We know the gap is big, but we need to carry on with our job. We need to keep giving our best on the pitch, trying to win game by game. We know it’s going to be very difficult. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are having a great season, but in football anything can happen. We need to be ready for any outcome</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> star Ederson inspired by Rogerio Ceni]</b> Rogerio Ceni has always been my inspiration. When I started to play in school, I didn’t have an idol as such, I didn’t really like football in my nursery days. I used to go three times a week due to my brother’s influence and also because our friends used to go as well. So, I began to attend and started playing and after that I moved to the goal and from the moment that I started playing as a goalkeeper, I started following Rogerio Ceni. From that moment onwards, he became my inspiration and idol<br /><br />It was a huge sacrifice; I remember training in Sao Paulo in the mornings. My father used to wake up at 5am to go to work and we’d leave the house at the same time, so I could go to the training sessions. I needed to get two buses, followed by the club’s bus and the same thing on the way back. Sometimes I wouldn’t even have time for lunch because I needed to go straight to school. This is what my routine looked like: training-school or school-training. I’d come back from school just to have dinner and go to sleep because the next day I had to do it all over again</p>

  <p><b>[Ederson insists that taking risks is something that is expected of him under <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>]</b> The role of a goalkeeper in Pep’s team is like the 11th outfield player on the pitch, in terms of the build-up, the pressing. I think it’s more difficult. There is a bigger responsibility because you can’t afford to make any mistakes. If you do, it probably ends in an opposition goal. Pep is a great manager who sees football in another way. He lives football and breathes football. The way he thinks about the game is completely different to other managers. He has helped me a lot, but not only me, the rest of my team-mates too. You can tell he implanted a style of play in all of us and in the club, so we don’t need much time to practice our football style because we have been playing it for a long time now<br /><br /><b>[Ederson has been compared to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> legend <a href="ronald-koeman.html">Ronald Koeman</a> in terms of his ball-playing ability from the back, something that the former <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> stopper believes comes naturally to him]</b> I don’t practice it that much, maybe two or three times a week. It’s a natural skill that I have, to hit long balls, so I don’t need to practice it every day. I think futsal helped me a lot when I was 11 or 12 years old. It helped me to think quicker and look for the passing lines. I think I managed to move those lessons to 11-a-side.<br /><br /><b>[Ederson has previously suggested that he is interested in playing outfield in the future]</b> When I play with my friends, I always play as a midfielder. I could do it, but not here at City. We already have lots of good midfielders in the team. It’s only jokes, but if one day there is an opportunity, who knows?</p>
