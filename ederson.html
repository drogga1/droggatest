  <p><b>[Ederson reveals the secret behind stopping Aubameyang’s penalty]</b> We study the shooters of the opponents - the team, the goalkeeping coach and the other goalkeepers. It helps us a lot when it comes to make the decision at the right time.<br /><br />We knew how important this game was. We needed the win. We entered the game really focused. We controlled and dominated and got a positive result. We deserved to win. It’s our third win of the season against Arsenal, which is very good for us</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson has described his debut season at the club as almost perfect]</b> I am very happy. Everything happened very quickly. My two first years at Benfica, I was able to play, and now being a regular for City in the Premier League is a dream for me. And to win the title, be shortlisted for the Young Player of the Year and be able to be part of the team that conceded the least number of goals this season, I can assure with that this has been almost a perfect year! I am extremely happy at the club. My family is also very happy and is growing as well. We are over the moon.<br /><br />We must focus on the future, finish the season with five wins. I believe going out of the Champions League can be a good lesson for the next season, and I am sure we will learn from that</p>

Unfortunately he missed it and Bernardo <b>[Silva]</b>, fortunately, scored, but if the manager had asked me to go there, I would have definitely scored. I’m not sure if I would be able to do set-pieces, but I’m good at penalties, either using power or technique when I’m shooting. City have their regular penalty takers and we have good options, but if Pep asks me to take it, I’m there. Hopefully it will happen <b>[before the end of the season]</b>, I’d like to score.<br /><br />I am very happy to be a champion, because I have always dreamed of playing in the Premier League and I had the opportunity to make this wish this year. I arrived with a heavy weight because my transfer was very expensive and there were a lot of doubts in some English newspapers, but I was able to show my value</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson claims he and his team-mates are to blame for their surprise defeat to Lyon]</b> The team didn’t perform at the level it had been playing in the last few games. Unfortunately, we ended up being punished by our own mistakes. It was our own fault, but we also played against a very difficult opponent who played good football and created us lots of problems. It’s a defeat, it’s part of football. We just need to put our heads up and focus on the next game.<br /><br />We know that our team has the ability to salvage the situation. Of course, we would have liked to start the competition on the right foot. We need to show our level and try to get the win</p>

There was contact between us but I don’t know if it was enough for a penalty. It’s a quick decision in a moment of the game. I tried to hit the ball, it happens. When a goalkeeper makes a mistake, there is no one to save the goal. A striker can miss three or four chances and still score the fifth. It’s different for a goalkeeper.</p>

Pep’s in his third season here, it’s my second and I can see the team has a deeper understanding of his ideas.

  <p><b>[Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson is confident of achieving his dream of winning a quadruple of trophies]</b> I think it is a possible dream as a final goal. Personally, it would be a dream for me and I think we can achieve it, obviously knowing that it is going to be extremely difficult and complicated. But the team is in good shape and as long as we focus on every game, I think we will have the chance to do it.<br /><br />It is the most difficult month of the season and most crucial as well. We have a lot of important games ahead but I think the team is ready. The international break has been very good for the team to recover some players, so we are ready and focused on what we have ahead. We know what we have to do and we need to win every single game from now until the end if we want to achieve our goals. We need to win no matter what, if we play before or after them. Any of the teams can’t afford to drop points at this point of the season so I think both teams feel the pressure no matter if we play before or after<br /><br />We know that in the Champions League and the knockout competitions, you can’t make any mistakes. In the first game against Liverpool, we made some and it cost us the tie. But now I think we are more experienced, we are more mature and we know that we can’t afford to make any mistakes in those crucial games. I think <b>[the Champions League]</b> is a dream we can achieve. Obviously there are some big teams that have been knocked out, but that means the teams in their place were better than them. It is a goal for us to win the competition but first we need to go through in the next round - the quarter-finals, reach the final and hopefully win the title. But again, we are aware how difficult it is going to be. The team is ready and obviously we will be very happy if we manage to win the competition</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> star Ederson inspired by Rogerio Ceni]</b> Rogerio Ceni has always been my inspiration. When I started to play in school, I didn’t have an idol as such, I didn’t really like football in my nursery days. I used to go three times a week due to my brother’s influence and also because our friends used to go as well. So, I began to attend and started playing and after that I moved to the goal and from the moment that I started playing as a goalkeeper, I started following Rogerio Ceni. From that moment onwards, he became my inspiration and idol<br /><br />It was a huge sacrifice; I remember training in Sao Paulo in the mornings. My father used to wake up at 5am to go to work and we’d leave the house at the same time, so I could go to the training sessions. I needed to get two buses, followed by the club’s bus and the same thing on the way back. Sometimes I wouldn’t even have time for lunch because I needed to go straight to school. This is what my routine looked like: training-school or school-training. I’d come back from school just to have dinner and go to sleep because the next day I had to do it all over again</p>

  <p><b>[Ederson insists that taking risks is something that is expected of him under <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>]</b> The role of a goalkeeper in Pep’s team is like the 11th outfield player on the pitch, in terms of the build-up, the pressing. I think it’s more difficult. There is a bigger responsibility because you can’t afford to make any mistakes. If you do, it probably ends in an opposition goal. Pep is a great manager who sees football in another way. He lives football and breathes football. The way he thinks about the game is completely different to other managers. He has helped me a lot, but not only me, the rest of my team-mates too. You can tell he implanted a style of play in all of us and in the club, so we don’t need much time to practice our football style because we have been playing it for a long time now<br /><br /><b>[Ederson has been compared to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> legend <a href="ronald-koeman.html">Ronald Koeman</a> in terms of his ball-playing ability from the back, something that the former <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> stopper believes comes naturally to him]</b> I don’t practice it that much, maybe two or three times a week. It’s a natural skill that I have, to hit long balls, so I don’t need to practice it every day. I think futsal helped me a lot when I was 11 or 12 years old. It helped me to think quicker and look for the passing lines. I think I managed to move those lessons to 11-a-side.<br /><br /><b>[Ederson has previously suggested that he is interested in playing outfield in the future]</b> When I play with my friends, I always play as a midfielder. I could do it, but not here at City. We already have lots of good midfielders in the team. It’s only jokes, but if one day there is an opportunity, who knows?</p>
