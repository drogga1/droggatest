  <p><b>[USWNT equal pay dispute sees U.S. Soccer miss the mark with misleading claims]</b> From 2010 through 2018, U.S. Soccer paid our women $34.1m in salaries and game bonuses and we paid our men $26.4m - not counting the significant additional value of various benefits that our women’s players receive but which our men do not</p>

  <p><b>[Jill Ellis to step down as USWNT head coach]</b> The U.S. Soccer Federation and the sport in general owes Jill a debt of gratitude. Jill was always extremely passionate about this team, analytical, tremendously focused and not afraid to make tough decisions while giving her players the freedom to play to their strengths<br /><br />She helped raise the bar for women’s soccer in the USA and the world, and given the history of this program, the level of success she achieved is even more remarkable</p>

  <p><b>[Stewart promoted to U.S. Soccer sporting director, Kate Markgraf named first USWNT general manager]</b> This is a great day for the federation and for soccer in America. In Earnie Stewart and Kate Markgraf, we’re keeping our commitment to ensure that soccer operations are run by soccer experts</p>

  <p><b>[Carlos Cordeiro on Jay Berhalter’s resignation]</b> Jay has played an invaluable role in the growth of our Federation and the evolution of the game in our country. His deep understanding of all the technical, commercial, and business aspects of the sport will have a lasting impact on the game across America</p>

  <p><b>[Cordeiro issued an apology during the USWNT’s 3-1 win over Japan]</b> On behalf of U.S. Soccer, I sincerely apologize for the offense and pain caused by language in this week’s court filing, which did not reflect the values of our Federation or our tremendous admiration of our Women’s National Team. Our WNT players are incredibly talented and work tirelessly, as they have demonstrated time and again from their Olympic Gold medals to their World Cup titles<br /><br />Even as we continue to defend the Federation in court, we are making immediate changes. I have asked the firm of Latham &amp; Watkins to join and guide our legal strategy going forward. I have made it clear to our legal team that even as we debate facts and figures in the course of this case, we must do so with the utmost respect not only for our Women’s National Team players but for all female athletes around the world. As we do, we will continue to work to resolve this suit in the best interest of everyone involved</p>

  <p><b>[U.S. Soccer president Cordeiro resigns in wake of USWNT controversy]</b> My one and only mission has always been to do what is best for our Federation, and it has become clear to me that what is best right now is a new direction. The arguments and language contained in this week’s legal filing caused great offense and pain, especially to our extraordinary Women’s National Team players who deserve better<br /><br />It was unacceptable and inexcusable. I did not have the opportunity to fully review the filin in its entirety before it was submirred, and I take repsonsibility for not doing so. Had I done so, I would have objected to the language that did not reflect my personal admiration for our women’s players or our values as an organization<br /><br />I will always treasure the many weeks I spent with our Women’s National Team players during the World Cup in France, and I’m thankful for their friendship. AS U.S. Soccer moves ahead with its defense against the lawsuit by the team, I hope that our remarkable women’s players are always treated fairly and with the dignity, respect and admiration they truly deserve</p>
