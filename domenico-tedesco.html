  <p><b>[Domenico Tedesco says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> wasn’t immune to his old coach’s jokes on the training ground]</b> <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> is a very charismatic coach. I really liked the way he deals with the team. He ran a lot in training, played a lot of football and has a good, dry sense of humour. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> didn’t get the ball to shoot, he also had the p*iss taken out of him. It was very interesting to see<br /><br /><b>[Tedesco went on to discuss the progress Leon Goretzka]</b> I am extremely proud of Leon. But I am by no means surprised by his development. Anyone who has conversations with Leon quickly realises what makes the boy so special. First of all, he’s a great person. He is intelligent, highly professional, he thinks outside the box and he is extremely sensitive from a social point of view. As a coach, you will notice this immediately when you see how he deals with his team-mates. And he wants to win every game - that’s his mentality, which he transfers to everyone else. Leon is the prototype of a modern central midfielder. Every club can wish for such a player because he simply brings everything a player needs in this position. He is strong, technically great in tight spaces, he can play the final pass and he is also dangerous in the box. He is also always there for headers.</p>
