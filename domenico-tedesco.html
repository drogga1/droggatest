  <p><b>[Schalke are keen on securing a deal for Chelsea defender Baba Rahman in the January transfer window]</b> One more player would be good for us, I’m thinking about Abdul Rahman Baba for the left wing above all. He still has a flat here in Gelsenkirchen, he knows Schalke and Schalke knows him. If we could get him on loan from Chelsea for a longer spell we wouldn’t be averse. We are clarifying now how good his fitness is at the moment.</p>

  <p><b>[Meet future US superstar Weston McKennie]</b> He can play anywhere in midfield, in front of the defence or behind the attack; at centre-back in a back three or a back four.</p>

  <p><b>[Schalke star Max Meyer has contradicted a club statement and claimed that he was not injured for the weekend’s 1-1 draw with Borussia Monchengladbach]</b> He broke off training on Wednesday for a foot injury. Now he seems to be feeling better, but he has not trained for two days. That’s a fact. That’s why he was not in the squad</p>

  <p><b>[Max Meyer has been suspended by Schalke in the wake of bullying accusations levelled at the club]</b> My impression was for a very long time that Max felt very comfortable here. That’s what he said in personal talks with the coaching team. I am disappointed with his personal attacks and cannot understand them because they just do not make sense</p>

  <p><b>[Max Meyer was determined to force himself into the side was looked to prove himself in training]</b> When the reaction is like Max’s, you think as a coach and say to yourself, ‘Man, I have to reward him’. It can’t be that he runs four or five miles in training and then misses the games.’ Then, as a coach, you’re forced to be creative.<br /><br /><b>[Meyer was reborn under Tedesco, with the Schalke coach claiming]</b> I don’t believe he’s ever played as well as he currently is</p>

  <p><b>[Schalke vs Manchester City]</b> There is nothing like a knockout match in the Champions League against a team that is one of the best in the world. We’ve worked a lot to be able to play such a game and have fun. Logically, we see a chance of winning, but, of course, we aren’t the favourites. Manchester City are a very strong team, we will need a red-letter day and have to give it our all</p>

  <p><b>[Domenico Tedesco says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> wasn’t immune to his old coach’s jokes on the training ground]</b> <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> is a very charismatic coach. I really liked the way he deals with the team. He ran a lot in training, played a lot of football and has a good, dry sense of humour. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> didn’t get the ball to shoot, he also had the p*iss taken out of him. It was very interesting to see<br /><br /><b>[Tedesco went on to discuss the progress <a href="leon-goretzka.html">Leon Goretzka</a>]</b> I am extremely proud of Leon. But I am by no means surprised by his development. Anyone who has conversations with Leon quickly realises what makes the boy so special. First of all, he’s a great person. He is intelligent, highly professional, he thinks outside the box and he is extremely sensitive from a social point of view. As a coach, you will notice this immediately when you see how he deals with his team-mates. And he wants to win every game - that’s his mentality, which he transfers to everyone else. Leon is the prototype of a modern central midfielder. Every club can wish for such a player because he simply brings everything a player needs in this position. He is strong, technically great in tight spaces, he can play the final pass and he is also dangerous in the box. He is also always there for headers.</p>
