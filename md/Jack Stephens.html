<blockquote>
  <p>[Jack Stephens has eased the departure of Van Dijk] We are playing with a consistent squad now, so we are not changing it around too much anymore. That’s nice, it’s brings up habits and relationships. Everybody knows what to do and that’s good. There’s still 12 more finals to go, we’re not out of danger yet. There are still a lot of improvements to be done.</p>
