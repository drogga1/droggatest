> <b>[Pulau Pinang head coach, Ashley Westwood believes that luck was not on their side after their 2-0 defeat to Selangor]</b> I thought we were unlucky. On another day we might have scored, but tonight we didn't get the rebounds and the luck didn't go with us. We were strong in the second half, I think we had 72% possession and the stats showed a positive sight on us, but we didn't create clear cut opportunities even though we have plenty of possession in the box. Two defensive mistakes cost us the goals. The first one we didn't react, they reacted quicker than us and the second one, it was a bit of pressure on the goalkeeper as he didn't clear the ball correctly and it fell straight to the other team.<br><br>I think they players must push through <b>[the defeat]</b>. The game wasn't being controlled they way it should have been in the match officials' perspective. Many tackles were flying in and people were unpunished. At the end of the day, we were very strong, and we kept pushing. Players do make mistakes and that's football. We are a young side and we will take this positively. This is the direction we want to go and we will improve our local players<br><br><b>[On Faiz Subri]</b> He missed a little bit of training and he is not where I want him to be in terms of match fitness but he is a good player, he will get there

> <b>[Burnley have completed the signing of Aston Villa midfielder Ashley Westwood for a reported fee of Â£5 million]</b> I'm delighted to be here. It's happened fast but I've been made to feel very welcome and I can't wait to get going. It feels like a proper football club and homely and that's what I like. I like to be appreciated and I think I will definitely get that here. The manager at Villa said I could speak to Burnley and for me that was perfect - a fresh start because things had got a bit stale at Villa. It's a fresh start and I want to show people what I can really do.

> <b>[Ashley Westwood believed that his team's luck will change when their Nigel Dabinyaba returns from injury]</b> We miss our centre forward. Without Nigel, we are relying on young players to score the goals. Nigel will make a difference when he is fit, I'm sure he will score a lot of goals for us. He is not too far away from recovery.

> <b>[Ashley Westwood happy to see winning mentality starting to creep into his Penang squad]</b> The performance speaks for itself. We played quite well. I thought that we were the dominant side. It was a hot day but we looked like we had a bit more energy than them. We played at a 100% but if we could have dug in and found a little bit more, we might have found the win. We haven't lost for two games, so that's got to be an improvement.<br><br>The players are feeling a little disappointment. Which shows you that we've suddenly got a few winners in the side. They are disappointment because they feel that they could've probably won that<br><br>I think we just have to keep going and keep trying. The confidence is slowly coming back. Just believe in what we're doing, keep working hard and recover when we have the chance. We've got one more game to come in the cup and we won't play until the 31st. So we got a bit of time there to do a bit of hard work, get more organised and just keep looking forward<br><br>We are <b>[happy with them]</b>. They are still learning. They've probably made careless mistakes at times with misplaced passes but they've got energy and desire. We're brave to play them. Not many clubs play many youngster but we do. We try to improve players. We're taking a few chances but if we stick with our work ethics and beliefs, these players will keep improving and we'll get stronger. It looks like we've weathered the storm. So we'll stick to what we do and keep giving trust to the youth players.

> <b>[On his role]</b> I am just here to advise. I will share my knowledge of Indian football. The head coach is the main man who answers the questions. The Indian players' fitness is always a major concern especially compared to the foreign recruits who are way ahead.
