> <b>[Pulau Pinang head coach, Ashley Westwood believes that luck was not on their side after their 2-0 defeat to Selangor]</b> I thought we were unlucky. On another day we might have scored, but tonight we didn't get the rebounds and the luck didn't go with us. We were strong in the second half, I think we had 72% possession and the stats showed a positive sight on us, but we didn't create clear cut opportunities even though we have plenty of possession in the box. Two defensive mistakes cost us the goals. The first one we didn't react, they reacted quicker than us and the second one, it was a bit of pressure on the goalkeeper as he didn't clear the ball correctly and it fell straight to the other team.<br><br>I think they players must push through <b>[the defeat]</b>. The game wasn't being controlled they way it should have been in the match officials' perspective. Many tackles were flying in and people were unpunished. At the end of the day, we were very strong, and we kept pushing. Players do make mistakes and that's football. We are a young side and we will take this positively. This is the direction we want to go and we will improve our local players<br><br><b>[On Faiz Subri]</b> He missed a little bit of training and he is not where I want him to be in terms of match fitness but he is a good player, he will get there

> <b>[Burnley have completed the signing of Aston Villa midfielder Ashley Westwood for a reported fee of Â£5 million]</b> I'm delighted to be here. It's happened fast but I've been made to feel very welcome and I can't wait to get going. It feels like a proper football club and homely and that's what I like. I like to be appreciated and I think I will definitely get that here. The manager at Villa said I could speak to Burnley and for me that was perfect - a fresh start because things had got a bit stale at Villa. It's a fresh start and I want to show people what I can really do.
