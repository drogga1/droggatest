<blockquote>
  <p>[Northern Ireland free to play Romania at Windsor Park] Naturally it is sad that we are having to resolve the West Stand issues in this manner, however the project team has worked tirelessly over the past three weeks to develop a plan which will enable us to play Romania in our own home in eight weeks’ time. Now the decision has been made, the focus turns to delivery. We will keep in close touch with UEFA and the relevant safety authorities to ensure that they are fully aware of, and in agreement with, our plans.</p>
