  <p><b>[Manchester City’s former kitman Les Chapman, speaking after Marc-Vivien Foe’s death from a heart attack in 2003, described him thus]</b> He became known as a player unaffected by his fame, a family-orientated person with a mild, likeable manner. He was very humble, nothing flash about him, very down to earth, very quietly spoken, always had a smile on his face but wasn’t over-flamboyant. He just had a pleasant manner and lovely disposition</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> kitman Les Chapman gives insight into Mario Balotelli]</b> He was a complete one-off, the most unpredictable man on the planet. When he got sent off at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> he threw his boot through the plasma TV in the dressing-room! But he was bright, he wasn’t stupid, and he was very generous. He would go into a garage and pay for everyone’s petrol or give a homeless guy a wad of cash. Then he used to wonder why his car was impounded 27 times … because it was painted in camouflage and he parked it on double yellows outside San Carlo restaurant in the middle of Manchester every day. I opened his locker after he left and all his parking tickets just fell out!</p>
