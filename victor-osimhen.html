  <p><b>[The new <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a>? <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a>’s Nigerian ace Victor Osimhen sets sights on <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> It was survival. Sometimes you found yourself with a right-footed Nike boot then you’d have to look for the other foot… Finally, you find a left boot and it’s a Reebok! My brother sold sports newspapers, my sister, oranges in the street, and me, bottled water in Lagos in the middle of the traffic. Part of my life has been a struggle to survive. But that’s what made me all I am today. Each event created my personality</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a> striker Victor Osimhen reveals he rejected <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in 2015 but opens door to future move]</b> I spoke with <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> after the tournament ended and he wanted me to come to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I had a lot of options. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, Inter, <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and the rest. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> was a good option but it wasn’t the best at the time. I wanted to start playing as soon as I turned 18. I wanted to go to a place where I had time to invest in my game and improve physically. Wolfsburg showed me that possibility.<br /><br />Of course, one day I’d like to play for a big club in England. I’ve spoken to Odion <b>[<a href="odion-ighalo.html">Ighalo</a>]</b> about it. He gave me very good advice, he’s a legend and a big brother. My goal is to play at one of the biggest clubs in the world but now I’m very happy in <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a>. My priority is to play a lot of games. Signing for a big club and being on the bench is not exciting for me</p>

I am surprised by these journalists who claim to be professionals. Ignore this fake news on my account, when there is an agreement for my transfer you will know it directly from me.</p>

They were like fathers, I received great demonstrations of affection from all the <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> fans. I was convinced I would accept a move to <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> when I talked to the coach and the President. They are giving me a lot of advice. It’s incredible to receive this affection, for a you player, motivation is fundamental<br /><br /> define myself as a player who loves the team play. Passion is fundamental for me, my mentality is based on the idea of never giving up. The game is always open. Being here is a big step for me, I have great teammates here. I don’t care about the money, what matters to me is doing great things as a footballer. Being here, is a dream come true for me<br /><br /><b>[The new forward revealed he prefers to play in the middle, but would be open to play anywhere at <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>]</b> I like to play as a centre-forward, but I can play in any position. I’m happy to be at <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> and I have fantastic teammates<br /><br />I admit to being sceptical about the situation of racism in this country. Then, however, I went to Naples and I saw it with my own eyes. At that point, my vision changed, even after meeting the President and with the coach. I’m sure that racism will not be a problem for my career, with the affection of my fans, I will overcome any difficulty</p>
