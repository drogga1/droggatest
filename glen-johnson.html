  <p><b>[Glen Johnson says his former team-mate Frank Lampard has to deliver a top-six finish in difficult circumstances]</b> The transfer ban doesn’t make life easy for Lamps at Chelsea, but given his affiliation with the club, he was surely the best candidate to take the job. When playing with him, he always gave the impression he’d do a good job as a manager. He did everything to detail and always took note of what the manager and coaches were doing. He’s been managed by some of the best around, so will have picked up plenty of traits which should really help him this season, especially when it gets tough. If he can somehow get them into the Champions League, I think it will be an amazing season. However, I think a Europa League spot is much more realistic, though if they finish worse than sixth, it’s got to go down as a disaster. They’ve got still got fantastic players and even though they’ve lost their best, they should still have enough quality to be competing with the better teams in the division<br /><br /><b>[Lampard is set to be handed a baptism of fire in a top-flight dugout on Sunday when Chelsea open their new Premier League season away at Manchester United]</b> I think Frank might have wanted an easier game to start his career at Chelsea, but in some ways it might be a good thing he’s playing a top-six side like United so early on. When you play the big teams, it can be a bit of a shot to nothing, so if they lose he won’t get anywhere near the criticism he might have got had he failed to get a result against a newly-promoted team. I never really minded when we played a big side, though it’s always nice to play one of your major rivals after a few games when you’re in full-throttle. The first game of the season can quite often be a bit scrappy as everyone isn’t quite up to speed. You want to play the better sides when you’re at full fitness with a few games under your belt</p>

  <p><b>[Glen Johnson says Finishing sixth would be a good season for Chelsea]</b> The way they can’t sign anyone, they lost their best player and can’t replace him. They’ve got to give kids a chance and some of them have never played in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> before. I think sixth would be a good season for them<br /><br />I didn’t know <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> was capable of this last season. So it’s great to see.

  <p><b>[Glen Johnson says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s transfer ban has been a blessing in disguise]</b> If <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> can keep going as they are, they could easily break into the top four. I’ve always said if <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> could get them into the top six he’s done a fantastic job and with the way United and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> are going, he could do even better than that. Everything he’s doing this season is building bridges for the next couple of years, especially as they haven’t been able to add to their squad. If he can keep improving his players, this <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> side will be in a very good spot once the new faces are able to be brought in.<br /><br />The whole transfer ban could turn out to be a bit of a blessing in disguise as it’s forced the club to bring the likes of <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> and <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> through and, providing they keep going as they are, they look to have some potential stars on their hands. I’ve been really impressed with Abraham. I really didn’t think he could translate his form from the Championship to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, but he’s shown he’s more than up to it. There is such a huge difference between the two leagues, so to do what he’s done so soon into his <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> career is very impressive</p>

  <p><b>[Glen Johnson says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s transfer ban has allowed them to discover talent they probably didn’t know they had six months ago]</b> When I was there it was totally different, it was when Roman Abramovich was buying all the best players in the world, the younger players didn’t really get a look in. It was a totally different era, every big name came through the door but I’m pleasantly surprised to see how well the kids are doing now. They’ve had to give the kids a chance, though, because they lost their best player and the transfer situation. They’ve all stood up and have performed brilliantly and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> had talent they probably didn’t know they had six months ago<br /><br /><b>[He admits that he did not expect to see the Blues legend back in west London this early in his coaching career]</b> Yeah he always had that coaching instinct, after games, talking to coaches, speaking tactics so I always thought he’d be a manager one day, definitely. I was surprised he was given the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> job so soon but I thought he was definitely destined for it in the future. Having said that, it was the perfect time for him because of the transfer ban and they would have to give somebody time anyway, so it’s great to see him getting the job done</p>

  <p><b>[Glen Johnson says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>’s arrival at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> should have the club’s youngsters feeling nervous]</b> When Jose first came to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, I remember a squad meeting and meeting him for the first time. Back then, nobody knew a great deal about him. It was a whirlwind but I’ve never really heard a manager speak to a group of players like that before - it was just his confidence and the way he wanted to take the club forward. I think he felt he needed to let people know how good he was. Now he’s proved himself<br /><br />He’s very passionate, a born winner, and he gives players the energy boost they need. Usually when a new manager comes in players do respond quickly. The fact is, <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> will get a reaction even quicker and for longer. So I expect an immediate turnaround at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>.<br /><br />He turned up and wanted to win stuff in the first few years and then disappear. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> has never been at a club long enough to bring through the youth. He normally walks through the door, signs who he wants, has an instant impact and moves on, which is obviously fantastic for him and he’s done very well doing that. Hopefully he stays around at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> long enough so he can use the youth and help grow the club, as well as the business. If I was a young <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> player, and <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> is only going to be there for two years, I would be nervous. If he’s going to be there for six years, I would be excited. In the last 15 years, he’s only been at two clubs for longer than two-and-a-half years. But records are there to be broken I guess</p>

  <p><b>[Glen Johnson says <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> told joining <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> would be wrong decision as he’s urged to consider <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or Chelsea]</b> Pretty much everyone that can afford his transfer fee are going to want him, so he can take his time to choose his next club. But I think it would be the wrong decision to sign for Man United. If he goes to a team like United at the moment, of course it’s a fantastic club and it would look great on his CV, but the team are not where they should be and I think as a young kid they would put too much pressure on him from day one.<br /><br />A young lad like that shouldn’t have to fly the flag for a club like United. I think he’d feel the pressure coming to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> anywhere, so to carry that with him as well would be tough. <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> is flying the flag for them now and his body is feeling the punishment. With young kids you’ve got to be careful because some of them are still growing.<br /><br />If he was to go to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> or <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or maybe a club in Spain, because he won’t be needed to come straight in and impress, they would bleed him into the team over time which would help his development. He might not be guaranteed to start every week, but he’d be doing it in the right way. Whereas if he went to United, yes he’d start every week but the team are struggling so it would be hard for him to find his feet<br /><br /><b>[Pressed further on why <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> or <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> would be better destinations for Sancho]</b> It <b>[a move to Liverpool]</b> might not be the best decision for him today, at the moment they’ve got the perfect side, but in two years’ time he could be well amongst it. He’d still only be 21. I’m not suggesting he’d stall his career for two years, I’d expect him to be knocking on the door and obviously it just takes one injury <b>[for him to get a chance]</b>. But <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s foundations are set in stone and I just think they’d bleed him into the team in the right manner.<br /><br />Lamps would definitely look after him at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, and then there’s the attraction of London. While <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are sliding down, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are on their way up with loads of young players and I could see that being a perfect fit for him. To have too many youngsters when the team is going down is not a good thing, but put the youngsters into a team that’s flourishing, on its way up and positive, then it’s going to be easier for them to perform. There would be pressure on Jadon from day one if he goes to United</p>

  <p><b>[Glen Johnson says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> would’ve happily traded cups for title triumph]</b> What has surprised me is the manner they’ve lost a certain amount of games in recent weeks, for how good they were and are. But let’s not forget that in pre-season, if they had a board meeting and a chat to say we’re going to get knocked out of all the cups but win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, every single one of them would have voted for that. They would have all accepted it, so it’s not a bad season at all.

The first goal is a terrible error from the keeper <b>[Adrian]</b> and it is what it is, but the defending afterwards was terrible. It was on the other two goals as well. It’s like they’ve thought ‘we’ll let them shoot because they aren’t going to score anyway’. That was the surprising bit.

  <p><b>[Glen Johnson says Cancelling the 2019-20 campaign is now a very realistic prospect]</b> With football being delayed for an unknown amount of time, plenty think we won’t get this season done. But what does that mean in terms of the title, European qualification and relegation? At the top of the table, we all know <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are going to win the league, but the major issue is will there be time for them to be crowned? If the season is cancelled and the title is awarded to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, every person on the planet, except <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans, is going to say they didn’t win the league<br /><br />As things stand, <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s side are in a no-win situation because there is no way the players will want to win the league in that manner. It’s incredibly harsh on them as they’ve been streets ahead of their rivals this season, but the way things are going it might all be for nothing<br /><br />In my opinion, if things don’t change pretty swiftly, we’ll have to cancel the season. It’s a pretty extreme measure, but if you look at the other end of the table, you can’t just relegate clubs based on their position in the table after 28 or 29 matches.<br /><br />It’s pretty likely that at least one of the current bottom-three will get out of it with the amount of time left in the season. The difference between survival and relegation is life-changing and whether or not a team stays up makes a difference in so many areas. Staff might get sacked and budgets might get cut if a club goes down, whereas it could be the polar opposite if they stay up.<br /><br />It’s the same in the Championship and the other leagues. Imagine if you’re sat in third place, just a point off automatic promotion and you miss out on going up.<br /><br />Every side is going to throw punches from their corner and almost all of them are going to feel hard done if the season is stopped now, so I think in order to be as fair as possible, we have to say this season didn’t happen. You can’t just give <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> the league and say to the others; you’re not as important.<br /><br />In short, you have to give <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> the league and relegate those currently in the bottom-three or cancel the season altogether.<br /><br />Before football was postponed, the majority of matches were played behind closed doors and I can imagine it’s a pretty weird experience for the players. It was never something I had to do in a competitive match and I’m not sure it would have been much fun. I did play in a few during pre-season and at the training ground and it was quite hard to get motivated for them, which is one of the huge benefits of playing at packed-out stadiums around the world. The fans make it such an amazing atmosphere and the adrenaline is there before you even start, so having no fans around in a big, competitive game would be odd that’s for sure</p>

That’s why I guess when he walks into a new dressing room it will take a bit of time for the lads to get to know him, but he’s a really nice lad. I think it would be great for him and his family to be in London and Lamps could be the man that puts his arm around him and makes him feel he is a key part of their plans, and I think that could force the best out of him. There is no doubt about it, the boy can play. He’s a proper footballer. He’s not the quickest lad and he’s clearly not the biggest lad, but his brain, his sharpness and speed of his football brain <b>[…]</b> he just picks that pass and he’s got that technique and perfect mobility in short spaces that opens up defences, and that’s something you can’t teach. And if <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> get the chance to sign him, they should be signing him. He’s unbelievable</p>

  <p><b>[Despite all of Salah’s brilliance, former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> defender Glen Johnson said recently that he feels the 27-year-old still doesn’t get the credit he deserves]</b> All of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s front three could have made my team <b>[of 2019-20]</b>, but I’ve chosen Salah because I still don’t think he gets the credit he deserves. He’s already scored 91 goals for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and although he can be wasteful in front of goal sometimes, he’s still incredibly dangerous</p>

  <p><b>[Glen Johnson says <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> should pick <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> over Man Utd]</b> <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> has been linked with almost all of Europe’s top clubs, but from my perspective he’ll surely find it very hard to turn down <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> if they come knocking. I know exactly what it means to put on the shirt and for any young English footballer playing at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> it is what you dream of. They’ve got one of the best managers in the world in <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, they’re European champions and are going to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, so it would be very tough to not be seriously tempted if they were after <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a>’s signature. If he wants to play in England, no club is able to offer him the success that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are currently enjoying and that will surely be a big sway towards him going there. If he were to go to a club like <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, there would be so much pressure on him to perform as soon as he walked through the door and for someone so young that’s a lot of responsibility to take on. He’ll be expected to improve the team overnight and that simply doesn’t happen, whereas at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> he’d be under so much less pressure to perform. They wouldn’t need to put him into the team every week and instead they’d make him earn his stripes. I think that would actually develop him more than just sticking him in from the get-go. We all know that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have an established front three at the moment with <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a>, <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> and <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, but as we know things change incredibly fast in football and who knows where they’ll be in two or three years? I’m not saying they’ll move on during that time, but you never know what might happen and if nothing else, adding another top-class player to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s attacking ranks might actually spur them on to play better. An improved <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>, Salah and Mane alongside a more experienced <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> would be a pretty terrifying thought for opposition defences.</p>

  <p><b>[Former England defender Glen Johnson has slammed the way some politicians have treated <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players]</b> I think it’s a disgrace - how can politicians say that? You can’t make your cake and eat it. Most people enjoy watching sport whenever it’s on and obviously football is a massive part of that. <b>[But]</b> I think it’s bang out of order. You can’t shoot from the hip asking them to take pay cuts and then shoot from the other hip saying, ‘We want you to get back as soon as possible.’ You can’t have it both ways. Everyone wants sport to come back but we’re talking about people dying here. We’re not talking about sitting on the sofa watching regular sport<br /><br />We’re in a crisis at the moment and that’s much more important than sport itself. So if the players don’t feel safe then 100 per cent they shouldn’t go back. Some people are going to be more sceptical than others and I think everyone has the right to … there are some lads who will be living at home on their own and others who are older with young babies. So I totally respect anyone’s decision if they want to go back or don’t want to go back</p>

  <p><b>[Glen Johnson says <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> is on course to become a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> legend]</b> When <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Hendo</a> turned up he was a young kid and at the start it was a bit like he was in awe of a few of the faces that were in the dressing room. Because he was such a hard-working kid and so eager to please, certain things weren’t coming off. It takes a bit of time to understand - no disrespect to Sunderland - that to go into <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is a big step up and a big standard change. There were times in training when <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Hendo</a> would make a minor mistake, maybe deliver a pass how somebody didn’t want it, and there would be a handful of players that would look at him as if, not actually roll their eyes at him, but have that body language as if to say ‘Oh, God, what’s he done again’. You could see it getting to him. I remember speaking to him and saying ‘You’re here for a reason so just keep doing what got you here in the first place’. I just told him to relax, it will happen and to let it come out rather than forcing it. There were a few people looking at <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Hendo</a> in the wrong sort of way - this pass I can picture didn’t come off for Luis, so Luis was throwing his arms up and expecting more, so that is when <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Hendo</a> snapped. I remember watching it and thinking ‘great, it’s good’. You can’t let people run all over you or think that they can, and he’s carried on with the same attitude in terms of how hard he works and the effort he wants to put in to improve.<br /><br />It was just a little warning, but I think Luis respected it and a few of the others that were around Luis at the time respected it and they gave him a bit of a break. There was no doubt about it, you could see the boy could play. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> aren’t silly and they didn’t buy him to walk into the team on that day. They bought him because they knew Stevie <b>[Gerrard]</b> wasn’t going to be around forever and they were tactically buying for a couple of years down the line. It’s tough when you get brought into a top team, young kids are going to struggle at first because it takes times to adapt<br /><br />There are no signs of him going anywhere so I think if he stays there long enough, 100 per cent. He’s won pretty much everything you can win and if he maintains this level for a few more years, then there’s no doubt about it</p>

  <p><b>[Glen Johnson urge fans to trust Jurgen Klopp]</b> It looks as if <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> won’t be signing Werner which is obviously disappointing for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans, but I wouldn’t worry too much about it. They’ve shown in the past that when they recruit they more often than not get it right, so I think you’ve just got to let them find the right players. Everyone thought <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> was pricey when they signed him and look how much he’s worth now, so I’m sure there are players they’re looking at besides Werner. At the end of the day, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have plenty of pulling power nowadays and if they really wanted Werner, I think they would have gone out and got him, so for whatever reason they’ve decided against that. They have been far and away the best side in the league this season and while you don’t need to fix something that isn’t broken, successful teams should always be looking to strengthen and rebuild again. It might not be the players who are going to be in the first team straight away, but you’ve always got to be looking ahead and the players who are brought in should be chosen with that in mind<br /><br /><b>[Johnson believes a switch to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> for Wener may end up being beneficial to all concerned]</b> He’s got an eye for goal and is quick, both of which are attributes that are very useful in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. However, playing in England is a totally different kettle of fish to playing in Germany. Every game is tough and there aren’t any freebies which he’ll have to get used to, but he’s clearly a classy footballer and looks to have lots going for him. If he’s as good as people say he is then £50 million looks like a very good deal for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. From <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s point of view, it’s good they are competing with the players that the top teams want. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were obviously linked with Werner too, so it shows that <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>’s side are still able to attract the best</p>

  <p><b>[It will cost £20m-plus to replace <a href="willian.html">Willian</a>, so keep him!]</b> I still think he’s a top player. Those sort of players, those players with that level of professionalism, they are hard to replace. Financially, business-wise, trying to replace <a href="willian.html">Willian</a> - how much is that going to cost? You are going to let a top player walk out of the door for nothing. It’s going to cost you a good £20m to replace him. I’d definitely like to see him stay there for another year</p>
