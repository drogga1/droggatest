  <p><b>[West Ham midfielder Robert Snodgrass has sought to shed some light on reports suggesting that he once turned down the opportunity to take in a trial at Barcelona]</b> You’d have to be insane to reject a trial at Barcelona. No-one would turn down a chance like that but I don’t think about what might have been because it never happened. Everyone is intrigued by this story. It comes up all the time. But I don’t know how to even begin to explain it. I was 17-years-old and playing for Livingston when it was reported that I’d refused to go to the Nou Camp for a trial. I’ve been told that various clubs and agents were involved but I honestly don’t know anything about it.</p>

  <p><b>[Robert Snodgrass could miss the encounter, after admitting that he played through the pain barrier against Bournemouth]</b> I twisted my ankle and stretched my ligaments but we only had defenders and a centre midfielder on the bench so you have to try to push through that pain barrier for your team-mates. But I couldn’t really push off with any force.</p>
