Opposite number Danny Cowley is similarly looking forward to the match]</b> It’s great for the players to be able to pit their wits against world-class players and it’s great for us to do the same against their vastly experienced management team. And it’ll be a brilliant spectacle for the people of Lincoln and hopefully a great way for them to finish their summer</p>

Emile is a player that we know well. We’ve got some good relationships with the club and we’re very appreciative of them loaning us one of their very best young players. Emile will give us the creative link that we’ve been missing. He can play in a range of attacking positions and he can speed up our play. We’re really looking forward to working with him</p>

  <p><b>[Huddersfield Town and <a href="aaron-mooy.html">Aaron Mooy</a> deal to Brighton]</b> Everyone knows the quality <a href="aaron-mooy.html">Aaron Mooy</a> possesses. His understandable preference is to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, and he’s been doing very well at Brighton. I think the club did good business in the summer to protect the investment made in Aaron and now we wish him all the best for the future</p>

  <p><b>[Town fans were left frustrated that both <a href="aaron-mooy.html">Mooy</a>’s loan fee and his permanent transfer fee were kept undisclosed under the terms of the deal. Danny Cowley expressed his sympathy for that, but said]</b> A deal was done in the summer <b>[with Mooy]</b>.<br /><br />It was done in the interests of all parties. <a href="aaron-mooy.html">Aaron Mooy</a> didn’t have to sign a deal at that point, he only had a year left on his contract; he did because he wanted to do the right thing by <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield Town</a> and I think we really respect that.<br /><br />Obviously for him to sign a new deal there would have been certain clauses in place. As a consequence Brighton have triggered that clause and have signed him.<br /><br />I think Phil did a really good piece of business on the deadline day of the summer window to put us in a position where we got good money for him. I think you always want more money, of course, but we take the money we’ve got for him, we wish him well, we wish Brighton well, and we move on as a football club</p>

  <p><b>[Lewis Grabban scored twice as Nottingham Forest bolstered their position in play-off places with a 3-1 over <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a> on Sunday]</b> Goals always change games and we felt we were in a good place in a game <b>[before the opener]</b>. The second goal is so soft from our point of view. In that moment we lost the ball from the throw-in then our defensive line was all over the place<br /><br />While there was a lot of good in our performance we ultimately had a soft underbelly, and when you have that and concede soft goals you’re going to find it hard to win games<br /><br />In 13 years of football management it’s the first time I’ve lost three games on the trot, so it’s a hard one for me to take and for the group to take. We’re down but we’re not out, and we’ll get ourselves back up and dust ourselves off to fight again, because over my dead body am I getting relegated</p>

  <p><b>[Dominant <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a> grabbed a huge survival lifeline after an impressive 3-0 win at Birmingham]</b> To be a good team you have to do it consistently, that is the challenge now. We will work really hard to do that. We’re not going to over celebrate. We’re pleased to perform well, we’ve taken a lot of criticism and most of it has been fair, but when you’re in a difficult moment you learn a lot about yourself<br /><br />You are defined by the difficult moments and how you respond. We have to take the confidence from it and the focus now goes to the game on Saturday against Preston. We’re <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield Town</a>, we’re a working-class club and working-class town and we have to compete. We did that and did the fundamentals well</p>

  <p><b>[Huddersfield and Preston played out a goalless draw that did little to enhance their positions at either end of the table]</b> Our focus is just on us. I feel terribly sorry for the people of Wigan, the staff, the players and particularly the supporters. I love football. I’m a football supporter myself and I don’t like to see what’s happening to them happen in football. We want to do it on our own merit. I’ll take no pride or feeling of content if we stay up by virtue of another team going into administration. I want to do it on merit because that’s what I set out to do when I came in. It wasn’t one for the purists. But when you don’t play well you have to keep the back door closed and we did that very well</p>

  <p><b>[Huddersfield gained what could prove a vital point in their battle against Championship relegation with a 0-0 draw at Reading]</b> I thought it was a really good performance. We showed a lot more energy than we did on Saturday. We also showed much more attacking intent than we did on Saturday. But I was disappointed that we didn’t take our chances. We lacked that little bit of coolness and that ruthless edge.<br /><br />We’re now in touching distance of reaching 50 points, but we still don’t know if that’s going to be enough. We’ll try to get to that mark as quick as we can and then we’ll try to get to 51 and then 52 - and so on and so forth. We’re just going to try to get the necessary amount of points to stay in this division</p>

  <p><b>[Luton moved off the bottom of the Championship table and to within two points of safety after a 2-0 win at Huddersfield]</b> We’re disappointed we didn’t get to our levels. The first goal was always going to be important and it’s a really soft one from our point of view. He’s three or four yards out and he gets a free header - it’s unacceptable. We can’t concede those goals and when you do, you make it very difficult for yourself<br /><br />We’ve had disappointments before this season and when we have, we’ve always responded well. We go to Sheffield Wednesday now, we get an extra day’s recovery which will definitely help the group and we have to respond to tonight’s performance.</p>

I felt that we had the best chances in the game and their best chances were all from distance. It is a point gained. We tried to win the game and wanted to win the game, but just lacked the little bit of quality in the final action.<br /><br />The performance was good tonight on the whole. We will be criticised for not getting the goal, which will be fair.</p>
