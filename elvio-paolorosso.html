<blockquote>
  <p>[Lionel Messi was found crying like a kid who had lost his mother after enduring Copa America final heartache with Argentina in 2016] The dressing room after the Copa America was very painful, but the worst was to come. At two in the morning, more or less, I went to the store room and found Leo completely alone, crying like a kid who had lost his mother. He was distraught and nobody could console him. I gave him a hug and we had a little whine together. I had Messi with Barcelona and Argentina, and all I have for him are words of gratitude. He always cooperated well and even noticed if the pitch was hard or soft.</p>
