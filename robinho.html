  <p><b>[Robinho claims a proposed move to Chelsea failed to materialise because Real Madrid ‘didn’t like them selling shirts with my name on before the deal had been done’]</b> My goal was to move to Chelsea - Big Phil said I could make the difference for him as his squad, according to him, was not creative enough. But Real Madrid had fallen out with Chelsea - they didn’t like them selling shirts with my name on before the deal had been done. I’m pretty sure that this error was one of the main reasons why the transfer failed, as it was a matter of pride for Real Madrid.<br /><br /><b>[January 2009 when he had been assured by Mark Hughes that he was fine to leave a winter training camp in Tenerife]</b> The truth is that Hughes didn’t honour his word to me. When I arrived at City, I hadn’t had any vacation time and he promised me he’d give me one week to get some rest. I believed what he told me so when I travelled to Tenerife, I went to him and said, ‘Mister, can I have my vacation now?’. He said, ‘OK.’ I packed my things, let the club know that I was leaving and enjoyed a week back home because he had allowed me to go - he had given me his word</p>

Phwoar, what a player - strong, fast, a big hope for Brazil</p>

  <p><b>[On Lionel Messi]</b> Each one of us had our own style and our own way of playing. It was really good to see how Messi grew as a footballer.<br /><br /><b>[Brazilian ultimately forced his way out of Real Madrid as he pushed for a transfer to Chelsea, signing in the end for Manchester City for €42m]</b> On my part, it was really controversial. I was young and explosive. I didn’t behave well</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar to Real Madrid is possible]</b> Neymar is a very important player for the Brazilian team. I think he could play at Madrid, but it will be quite difficult, because he has a five-year contract with PSG. It’s a possibility.<br /><br /><b>[On 2017-18 campaign]</b> I think it’s just a moment, sometimes you can go through a bad time, but Real Madrid is Real Madrid. They still have opportunities to improve. People want Madrid to win all year long. I am a Madridista and I always want the team to go well<br /><br /><b>[On Zidane]</b> I think he has to remain the team’s technician. He is one of the best coaches in the world<br /><br /><b>[On third successive continental crown]</b> Yes, it is the only option. They are going to play two tough matches against PSG, but why not? There’s a chance. Madrid can win the title for a third consecutive year. You have to try to win it. It is hard, but it is possible</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar joining Real Madrid this summer would be win-win for both parties]</b> Real Madrid’s place in world football is the top place. They can still be the top team without Neymar but if they sign Neymar, then it’s a win-win for both parties.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether he expects a move to happen]</b> I know nothing more about Neymar than you do. Which means, I know nothing. I only want him to play football and be happy by playing football. There’s no need for me to want anything else for him<br /><br /><b>[A tricky forward now on the books of Turkish side Sivasspor]</b> These things happen in football. Frankly, my situation and Neymar’s situation aren’t exactly the same. I consider these things as part of the process in football. Professional decisions<br /><br /><b>[On Vinicius Junior]</b> He is very talented. Everyone will see how important he’ll become in the future</p>

  <p><b>[Robinho says he planned on joining Chelsea from Real Madrid in 2008]</b> My main goal was to move to Chelsea - Big Phil <b>[Scolari]</b> had said I could make the difference for him as his squad, according to him, was not creative enough. But Real Madrid had fallen out with Chelsea - they didn’t like them selling shirts with my name on before the deal had been done. I am pretty sure that this error was one of the main reasons why the transfer failed, as it was a matter of pride for Real Madrid. And they were also reluctant to let me move to a club that was playing in the Champions League the same season - Chelsea were, but City weren’t. I moved to a great club and they welcomed me in the best way. I had one-and-a-half years of joy in Manchester, despite the city being a lot colder than Madrid!<br /><br />From the day I arrived, I could see City’s project was destined to be a success and the club would grow - but I didn’t think it would be quite so fast. I didn’t know much about the club before I got there, but I always felt very honoured to have been the first marquee signing. I started well, but unfortunately there weren’t as many great names as there are these days. Man City are the only side I’ve left without winning a title<br /><br />I don’t think I had much to prove to Man City or anyone in England. I had played well during my time there, but I just didn’t play there as long I wanted - there were some issues. If you want to become a bigger club, then you need more than one or two star names - you need a strong group and substitutes. Milan, I was surrounded by great players; it wasn’t the same at City</p>
