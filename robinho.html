  <p><b>[Neymar joining Real Madrid this summer would be win-win for both parties]</b> Real Madrid’s place in world football is the top place. They can still be the top team without Neymar but if they sign Neymar, then it’s a win-win for both parties.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether he expects a move to happen]</b> I know nothing more about Neymar than you do. Which means, I know nothing. I only want him to play football and be happy by playing football. There’s no need for me to want anything else for him<br /><br /><b>[A tricky forward now on the books of Turkish side Sivasspor]</b> These things happen in football. Frankly, my situation and Neymar’s situation aren’t exactly the same. I consider these things as part of the process in football. Professional decisions<br /><br /><b>[On Vinicius Junior]</b> He is very talented. Everyone will see how important he’ll become in the future</p>

  <p><b>[Robinho says he planned on joining Chelsea from Real Madrid in 2008]</b> My main goal was to move to Chelsea - Big Phil <b>[Scolari]</b> had said I could make the difference for him as his squad, according to him, was not creative enough. But Real Madrid had fallen out with Chelsea - they didn’t like them selling shirts with my name on before the deal had been done. I am pretty sure that this error was one of the main reasons why the transfer failed, as it was a matter of pride for Real Madrid. And they were also reluctant to let me move to a club that was playing in the Champions League the same season - Chelsea were, but City weren’t. I moved to a great club and they welcomed me in the best way. I had one-and-a-half years of joy in Manchester, despite the city being a lot colder than Madrid!<br /><br />From the day I arrived, I could see City’s project was destined to be a success and the club would grow - but I didn’t think it would be quite so fast. I didn’t know much about the club before I got there, but I always felt very honoured to have been the first marquee signing. I started well, but unfortunately there weren’t as many great names as there are these days. Man City are the only side I’ve left without winning a title<br /><br />I don’t think I had much to prove to Man City or anyone in England. I had played well during my time there, but I just didn’t play there as long I wanted - there were some issues. If you want to become a bigger club, then you need more than one or two star names - you need a strong group and substitutes. Milan, I was surrounded by great players; it wasn’t the same at City</p>
