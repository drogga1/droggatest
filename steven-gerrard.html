  <p><b>[Gerrard prepared to surrender captaincy]</b> It would have broken my heart to have lost the captaincy but I thought it was right to make the offer because I know some of the players have been frustrated with what has gone on<br /><br /><b>[With the television and mobile phone switched off, Gerrard sat in a room with his girlfriend and agent Struan Marshall and realised he was on the brink of the biggest mistake of his life]</b> I was just thinking ‘how have we got into this mess and what is the best way out of it? I knew I had to do what I had intended to do all along and sign a new contract. I love <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> so much. This is my club. My heart is with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Everyone who knows me can see how I feel. The last thing I wanted to do was leave, I just could not do it<br /><br /><b>[What <a href="rick-parry.html">Parry</a> took to be standard negotiating practice, Gerrard interpreted as further proof he was no longer wanted, triggering a tumultuous series of events that appeared certain to see him sign for Chelsea]</b> I felt I was being backed into a corner. I know it looked as though I wanted to go but at one stage I thought I had no choice. If I blame anyone, it’s myself. I wanted my future sorted out as soon as possible after the Champions League final but the longer it went on, the more misunderstandings there were. I admitted I have made some mistakes and that the club has acknowledged they have made some as well. I have now apologised to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and they have apologised to me, which is important. But now we have sorted it out and I am doing what I wanted to do all along, which is stay at Liverpool</p>

  <p><b>[Steven Gerrard Disappointed By <a href="sami-hyypia.html">Sami Hyypia</a>’s Decision To Leave <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I understand the reasons behind Sami’s decision to go because he’s got a two-year deal, so good luck to him. But for selfish reasons I wish he would stay for another season here because he’s such a fantastic player and great to have around the place. He’s been here for the whole time I’ve been in the first team and has been a great influence and magnificent servant - an absolute legend.<br /><br /><b>[Hyypia has already stated his intent to return to the club in a coaching capacity some day]</b> I sincerely hope he comes back as a coach one day, because he can bring so much with him and impart so much knowledge. He knows how <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club works. He’s a great character and I could see him playing a big role in developing the youngsters, the reserves and even the first team in time. I took over from him as captain in 2003 and there was some controversy at the time, but not from Sami, who was incredibly supportive of me from the very start. That is a measure of the man. He should be regarded as a one of the greats of this club and I don’t say that lightly. He has certainly helped transform <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and got us back to where we should be</p>

I’ve gone from not being able to walk down a street without being stopped every five minutes to being a Z-lister out here, and that’s cool. I love it. I’ve become a cool dad all of a sudden because I can take the kids out and no-one interferes. We can take them to the park, the beach, fairgrounds, water parks and be there for six hours and I might hear one person say my name - and they’re not even sure if it’s me, so I just smile.

  <p><b>[on <a href="francesco-totti.html">Francesco Totti</a>]</b> <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> is a fantastic technician; he’s a wonderful footballer. The reason I’ve got so much respect for him is because he’s got all the pressure on his shoulders in Rome. He’s the king of Rome. Having played for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, a big club, I understand the responsibility and the pressure he’s got to deliver for the supporters. I’ve been there and I’ve seen it with my own eyes. They idolise him over there and that comes with its own pressure. So to perform consistently for Roma, for such a long time and stay loyal, I’ve got an awful lot of respect for him. He’s certainly a legend over in Italy<br /><br />I think when you get close to him, you realise how strong he is on the ball. He picks up some wonderful positions between the lines. I remember playing the holding role against him one time and he was always out of sight. He always picked up clever positions in the number 10 role and the ball was like Velcro to his boot. He was very skillful and maneuvered the ball very well. And his vision, he could see things on the pitch that other players couldn’t really see. As a player, I’ve got unbelievable respect for him. I’ve managed to meet him a couple times along the way as well and he seems like a good guy as well.<br /><br />He’s shown incredible loyalty to his club and his badge and he deserves all the plaudits and merits he gets. I can only add to that. It’s been a pleasure to compete against him a couple of times and I certainly would’ve loved to have played in the same team as him. He’s certainly the type of player that would be on the wavelength that I’d be looking for. He would’ve been a joy to play with. I remember we signed Alberto Aquilani and I was saying to him, ‘What’s <a href="daniele-de-rossi.html">De Rossi</a> like and what’s <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> like?’ and he spoke volumes about them. And that’s when you get a flavour for what people are really like. He was saying that basically those two have carried Roma for so many years. They deserve all the plaudits they get</p>

It will be extremely difficult in the short term because of where we are in the league. And we all know that we’ve punched above our weight in Europe so far.

Go back to the beginning and strip it back like a car. Get your pitch confidence and get used to tactics and different formations. Try things, make mistakes and get it horribly, wildly wrong. Experiment and do all these things away from the camera but before you test yourself in the Europa League, before you test yourself in front of thousands and thousands of fans - put yourself in a better position before you go in there.<br /><br />Because I’ve seen tons of footballers with their names on their backs go in there and it doesn’t work’. That was the best bit of advice. I don’t think I will ever get a better piece of advice than that. Strip it right back and go back to the beginning. I have made mistakes over the last couple of years as Rangers manager but the trick is to learn from them.

It’s their job to continue to represent Rangers in that way. But from afar the SPFL looks an absolute mess. I’m watching ex-players and pundits, I’m reading media and it’s getting absolutely battered from pillar to post. All I ask is for the main leader of the SPFL to show some real leadership at this time. What he has to do now - because there are so many doubts, questions and accusations about this institution - is he needs to allow an independent investigation into the setup up there, to prove everything wrong and show there is transparency across the board<br /><br />The SPFL have said they’re open to an internal investigation. I don’t agree with that because you shouldn’t be allowed to mark your own homework. You mark your own homework, you’re always going to finish top of the class and there’s not going to be any questions asked. So, for me, there needs to be an expert investigator who should come in and look at everything across the board with the SPFL. I’ve watched the SPFL - an organisation that I’m a big part of now - get absolutely slaughtered and I’m waiting for the leader Murdoch MacLennan to come out and show leadership and allow an outside investigator to come in, go right across the whole situation and show everything is clean<br /><br />Ideally, I’d like to see everyone back playing and to finish the season off and that’s how everyone wants to see it.

I think he’s got better and better from a football point of view but, as a person, I think what he’s done over the last couple of weeks sums the human being up. He’s a fantastic man and he’s become a top-class midfielder. Everything he earns in the game and every accolade he gets he absolutely deserves it. He’s a role model to a lot of young kids</p>

  <p><b>[Coronavirus: Gerrard slams ‘almighty rush’ to end Scottish Premiership season]</b> For myself - and I think everyone at Rangers was on the same page - what we wanted was to give it the best chance we can. There was a different view from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and the EFL that they wanted to wait and give this season every single chance to be played. We all know and respect the fact that there might become a stage where that is impossible to happen. But there seemed to be an almighty rush from where we were to finish it and get the boats in as soon as possible. That didn’t sit well at all. At Rangers, we want to get back playing and get the season done when it’s physically safe to do that, with all respect to the situation that we’re in. Across Scotland, top to bottom, there was so much football to be played. Now, of course, I’m always going to be biased because I’m the Rangers manager and there’s a 13-point gap, but I want to put as much pressure on to the end. In other leagues, so many clubs had so much to play for and we felt there was a rush to finish it instead of giving it the best chances to be finished.<br /><br />We came extremely close to success this year in the League Cup, we have had success in the Europa League but the league has been disappointing.It is my job to come up with answers and solutions as quick as we can to hopefully finish this season as strong as we can and then move on to next</p>

He just works for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. He has come and taken the club to the next level<br /><br />Knowing Jurgen, he won’t want to be put in that bracket. I know what he’s like, he’s humble and respectful. When you look at the scale of the job he’s done, for sure he deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as those iconic managers. What you need to take into consideration is that when Jurgen took over <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> they weren’t close to being the best team in the country, they weren’t even in the top four. To come to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> when he did, get to the amount of finals that he has, deliver the sixth European Cup and then deliver the first league title after 30 years <b>[…]</b> For me, someone like Jurgen should be rewarded now.

I’m a fan now and I always will be until the day I go into a grave. When they get it done and they lift that trophy, it will be 100 per cent happiness for me. I can’t wait for it.

It was a really good workout. I thought Hamilton very professional and made us work for the win.

get your kits on and see the referee, pre-season gets parked up and its for real. I’m pleased with a lot of it but there is still a lot of work to do.
