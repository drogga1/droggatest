I know it looked as though I wanted to go but at one stage I thought I had no choice. If I blame anyone, it’s myself. I wanted my future sorted out as soon as possible after the Champions League final but the longer it went on, the more misunderstandings there were. I admitted I have made some mistakes and that the club has acknowledged they have made some as well. I have now apologised to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and they have apologised to me, which is important. But now we have sorted it out and I am doing what I wanted to do all along, which is stay at Liverpool</p>

But for selfish reasons I wish he would stay for another season here because he’s such a fantastic player and great to have around the place. He’s been here for the whole time I’ve been in the first team and has been a great influence and magnificent servant - an absolute legend.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="sami-hyypia.html">Hyypia</a> has already stated his intent to return to the club in a coaching capacity some day]</b> I sincerely hope he comes back as a coach one day, because he can bring so much with him and impart so much knowledge. He knows how <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club works. He’s a great character and I could see him playing a big role in developing the youngsters, the reserves and even the first team in time. I took over from him as captain in 2003 and there was some controversy at the time, but not from Sami, who was incredibly supportive of me from the very start. That is a measure of the man. He should be regarded as a one of the greats of this club and I don’t say that lightly. He has certainly helped transform <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and got us back to where we should be</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="francesco-totti.html">Francesco Totti</a>]</b> <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> is a fantastic technician; he’s a wonderful footballer. The reason I’ve got so much respect for him is because he’s got all the pressure on his shoulders in Rome. He’s the king of Rome. Having played for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, a big club, I understand the responsibility and the pressure he’s got to deliver for the supporters. I’ve been there and I’ve seen it with my own eyes. They idolise him over there and that comes with its own pressure. So to perform consistently for Roma, for such a long time and stay loyal, I’ve got an awful lot of respect for him. He’s certainly a legend over in Italy<br /><br />I think when you get close to him, you realise how strong he is on the ball. He picks up some wonderful positions between the lines. I remember playing the holding role against him one time and he was always out of sight. He always picked up clever positions in the number 10 role and the ball was like Velcro to his boot. He was very skillful and maneuvered the ball very well. And his vision, he could see things on the pitch that other players couldn’t really see. As a player, I’ve got unbelievable respect for him. I’ve managed to meet him a couple times along the way as well and he seems like a good guy as well.<br /><br />He’s shown incredible loyalty to his club and his badge and he deserves all the plaudits and merits he gets. I can only add to that. It’s been a pleasure to compete against him a couple of times and I certainly would’ve loved to have played in the same team as him. He’s certainly the type of player that would be on the wavelength that I’d be looking for. He would’ve been a joy to play with. I remember we signed Alberto Aquilani and I was saying to him, ‘What’s <a href="daniele-de-rossi.html">De Rossi</a> like and what’s <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> like?’ and he spoke volumes about them. And that’s when you get a flavour for what people are really like. He was saying that basically those two have carried Roma for so many years. They deserve all the plaudits they get</p>

And Simon’s just in no man’s land, he’s concentrating on something he shouldn’t really be concentrating on.

Graeme has had to contend with difficult and challenging circumstances but conducted himself in a thoroughly professional manner.

Go and reward yourselves for the journey you have taken this club on. You’ve got to go in with the belief and confidence; you have come this far. You’ve got to handle the responsibility of being a Liverpool player and you’ve got to go and deliver. You’ll get plaudits and praise for getting where you are but not many people remember it if you don’t get over the line and deliver. I’m still really good friends with ex-team-mates in that team that I played with and I know what it would mean for them. I just hope they go and do it. It’s important that they try to blank it <b>[the hype around the game]</b> out if they can. It’s difficult but just make sure your preparation is spot-on, you get your sleep and the right food, and everything goes well. It’s tough, because of the magnitude of the game: it’s the biggest game you’ll play in as a Liverpool player.<br /><br /><b>[When asked what had impressed him post about the run to the final]</b> The style they have done it in - the amount of goals they have scored, the quality of the goals, the movement. When we did it under Rafa <b>[Benitez]</b>, with all due respect some games we had to grind, a lot of games we had to suffer in and just get over the line. Our strength was mental strength, we never felt we were beaten and you had to work extremely hard to get anything out of us. This team still has the mental toughness but on the eye they look superb. Everyone is thinking: ‘Liverpool deserve this’. They have looked the best, they have done it in style and, being a Liverpool fan, it has been brilliant to be part of.</p>

What happened was just pure bad luck but, when you do a book or film, especially with people who have won Oscars and made films such as Amy <b>[Winehouse]</b> and Senna, you must be as honest and open as you can<br /><br />Winning as a player is fantastic, winning as a manager now is a great buzz. Losing? There is no difference in the hurt. Winning a trophy as a player? Now that’s special, incredible. And I would love to be in a position where I experience that as a manager. That is what I want. I want to win a trophy - achieve something special. So I’d like to come back to that - what you just asked me - I can’t answer it, not at the minute.

  <p><b>[Steven Gerrard believes Jurgen Klopp will deliver Premier League title success at Liverpool]</b> Anything is possible. Do I want to be the Liverpool manager right now? No, I want to be the Rangers manager. I want to be successful at Rangers. It’s a silly question if you ask do I want to be Liverpool manager one day. I think everyone on the planet knows the answer to that. But I love Jurgen Klopp and I believe he can help Liverpool win the Premier League. I know what it will mean to the fans because they suffered so much in 2014. So we’re in a great place - and I say ‘we’ because I’m a fan and always will be. But I’ve got two teams in my heart now. Rangers and Liverpool<br /><br /><b>[Gerrard should be well placed to step into Klopp’s shoes if that opportunity ever presents itself]</b> I was like a sponge, watching and learning. I watch him on TV and see how he handles situations. I could never be Jurgen with his charisma and energy. But if I can take a few things from him it will be such a help. And if I text, call or see him, Jurgen’s always got time for me. Jurgen’s really good at switching off. When the game is on he’s very emotional but once it’s over he can park the emotion. That’s why he’s so good at handling the pressure. After cup finals and a big setback, he’ll be the one to start the party. Tomorrow is a different day and that’s a big lesson I have to learn. I have to live my life outside football while still being a manager. It is difficult but I’m trying</p>

We have to make the players aware of the knock-on effect. Players have to work hard in those minutes, they do more sprints, more accelerations and decelerations, so it has more strain on the body.

There might be other stuff going on in his life that I’m not aware of yet<br /><br />The reality is he’s a Liverpool player and Liverpool have almost got to take charge of this. Yes, we’ve got a loan situation with Ovie but we wouldn’t keep a kid who was unhappy. I wouldn’t stand in any kid’s way whether he was signed with us or on loan. I want players here who are committed and want to help and want to play here<br /><br />I don’t think we need drastic changes in the next window. I think it’s more important to get some help in terms of quality. We need to add more quality to the current players. They need help in the dressing room in certain areas of the pitch. January is a complicated window. A lot of teams don’t want to let players go, inflation comes to prices because they know what you are looking for and they own it. It’s very difficult.

They could have went away with more, Wes <b>[Foderingham]</b> has helped us get a point really. Across the board today, nowhere near good enough. I think I’ve been seduced in this week because the players have looked like they were looking forward to playing in front of Ibrox. We knew Tommy and how he was going to set up. That didn’t disappoint us. They were organised, mid to low block and they offer you a challenge of: ‘Come on then what you got? Come and beat us’ and we didn’t have enough today all over the pitch to find the answers to the challenge and that’s very concerning for me. We lacked leadership, I’m struggling to find any positives from it really. That’s where we are. I think right now, forget titles, forget closing gaps. The reality is if you perform like that across the board in front of 50k people, there’s your evidence. You don’t need me to say this that and the other. If you’ve got a group of lads out there and they give you that when they’ve got a chance to close to three points and you’ve got Aberdeen, Kilmarnock and the rest breathing down your neck, that is not what is required at Rangers when you’ve got the chance to close the gap.

It’s moments like tonight that make me feel so proud and make it feel worthwhile. I’m glad I signed up to it. I wanted nights like this from a personal point of view. But to see my players celebrating with the 47000 fans at the end, it was an emotional time. I was so proud to be the manager of this club out there</p>

  <p><b>[Rangers vs <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>.

I think over the course of the 12 months we’ve proved that is no longer the case and on our day we’re a good match for <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>. It was always going to take time to close that gap but I think the fixture last year, the Christmas one where we beat them 1-0, lifted a lot of fear and gave us a lot of confidence and belief that, if we find the right level of performance, we are a match for anyone, certainly at Ibrox. That’s what gives us confidence going into this fixture</p>

Experiment and do all these things away from the camera but before you test yourself in the Europa League, before you test yourself in front of thousands and thousands of fans - put yourself in a better position before you go in there.<br /><br />Because I’ve seen tons of footballers with their names on their backs go in there and it doesn’t work’. That was the best bit of advice. I don’t think I will ever get a better piece of advice than that. Strip it right back and go back to the beginning. I have made mistakes over the last couple of years as Rangers manager but the trick is to learn from them. But this is a job where it’s impossible not to make them because you’re up against so many other good coaches</p>

  <p><b>[Rangers boss Gerrard calls SPFL ‘an absolute mess’]</b> I think Rangers’ stance on it, and certainly my stance on it, is to let the suits carry on doing what they’re doing at the moment. It’s their job to continue to represent Rangers in that way. But from afar the SPFL looks an absolute mess. I’m watching ex-players and pundits, I’m reading media and it’s getting absolutely battered from pillar to post. All I ask is for the main leader of the SPFL to show some real leadership at this time. What he has to do now - because there are so many doubts, questions and accusations about this institution - is he needs to allow an independent investigation into the setup up there, to prove everything wrong and show there is transparency across the board<br /><br />The SPFL have said they’re open to an internal investigation. I don’t agree with that because you shouldn’t be allowed to mark your own homework. You mark your own homework, you’re always going to finish top of the class and there’s not going to be any questions asked. So, for me, there needs to be an expert investigator who should come in and look at everything across the board with the SPFL. I’ve watched the SPFL - an organisation that I’m a big part of now - get absolutely slaughtered and I’m waiting for the leader Murdoch MacLennan to come out and show leadership and allow an outside investigator to come in, go right across the whole situation and show everything is clean<br /><br />Ideally, I’d like to see everyone back playing and to finish the season off and that’s how everyone wants to see it. But where we are right now, the main priority is everyone’s health. Football is certainly secondary</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> legend Gerrard in awe of ‘phenomenal’ Reds]</b> They just seem to be getting better and stronger every single year. I think the one key thing that has blown me away from when I played, what they seem to have now is mental strength across the board. We used to have some really good professionals and mentally strong players in our squad but now it seems that from No.1 in the squad to player 26, mentally they’re all monsters and are all on the same page. To have a squad that has that mentality, I’m really excited to watch them in the coming years because I think they have a fantastic opportunity to become a really successful <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team, and that’s what we all want as <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans.

He’s a very selfless person, on and off the pitch. He was a dream to play with because of his energy. I’m certainly one who’s always sung his praises because I appreciate the job he did in the team. I think he’s got better and better from a football point of view but, as a person, I think what he’s done over the last couple of weeks sums the human being up. He’s a fantastic man and he’s become a top-class midfielder. Everything he earns in the game and every accolade he gets he absolutely deserves it. He’s a role model to a lot of young kids</p>

  <p><b>[Coronavirus: Gerrard slams ‘almighty rush’ to end Scottish Premiership season]</b> For myself - and I think everyone at Rangers was on the same page - what we wanted was to give it the best chance we can. There was a different view from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and the EFL that they wanted to wait and give this season every single chance to be played. We all know and respect the fact that there might become a stage where that is impossible to happen. But there seemed to be an almighty rush from where we were to finish it and get the boats in as soon as possible. That didn’t sit well at all. At Rangers, we want to get back playing and get the season done when it’s physically safe to do that, with all respect to the situation that we’re in. Across Scotland, top to bottom, there was so much football to be played. Now, of course, I’m always going to be biased because I’m the Rangers manager and there’s a 13-point gap, but I want to put as much pressure on to the end. In other leagues, so many clubs had so much to play for and we felt there was a rush to finish it instead of giving it the best chances to be finished.<br /><br />We came extremely close to success this year in the League Cup, we have had success in the Europa League but the league has been disappointing.It is my job to come up with answers and solutions as quick as we can to hopefully finish this season as strong as we can and then move on to next</p>

It’s the way he goes about his work, the quality he has shown consistently and his leadership skills. With these individual awards, I just think sometimes they have to be about more than what just happens on the pitch. I think Jordan is certainly deserving to be in the running for both. If he got both I’d be very pleased for him</p>

  <p><b>[Steven Gerrard says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> should already be starting work on a statue of <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> ahead of their title coronation]</b> Let’s cut to the chase, sitting here, doing this interview right now, I think <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> is the best manager in the world. I know there are a lot of successful managers about. <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> is exceptional. <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> is exceptional too and I think <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> are really lucky to have him with his CV. I could name many more. Having had the experience of being a manager for the past two years, you realise how difficult and challenging the job is. I have nothing but respect for Jurgen. The way the man handles himself, the way he’s been with myself, the way he goes about his business, the way he comes across. I think he’s got a heart and I think he’s got a head. He just works for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. He has come and taken the club to the next level<br /><br />Knowing Jurgen, he won’t want to be put in that bracket. I know what he’s like, he’s humble and respectful. When you look at the scale of the job he’s done, for sure he deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as those iconic managers. What you need to take into consideration is that when Jurgen took over <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> they weren’t close to being the best team in the country, they weren’t even in the top four. To come to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> when he did, get to the amount of finals that he has, deliver the sixth European Cup and then deliver the first league title after 30 years <b>[…]</b> For me, someone like Jurgen should be rewarded now. It seems like in football we often wait until people get older before their achievements are fully recognised. But I know the owners of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> won’t let that happen. When Jurgen delivers the league they should already be starting work on a statue of him.<br /><br />You don’t want to count your chickens until it’s certain but I think we all know that it’s inevitable. For me, there will be a lot of relief. Being a fan for a lot of those years and being a player and coming ever so close, you know that this is the one that people have craved. This is the bread and butter of the club. I grew up watching all the successful <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> teams winning leagues. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to do it myself. I’m a fan now and I always will be until the day I go into a grave. When they get it done and they lift that trophy, it will be 100 per cent happiness for me. I can’t wait for it. I’ll be the proudest man on the planet</p>

  <p><b>[Steven Gerrard was pleased to see his Rangers players blow off the cobwebs with a behind-closed-doors win over Hamilton]</b> It is a long time not to play football, so the first game back you are always looking at what you got out of it and we got some real valuable minutes into the players’ legs. It was a really good workout. I thought Hamilton very professional and made us work for the win. But the win is not important, it’s more about getting players through the first game, getting the cobwebs off and getting them a feel for real football, because it doesn’t matter how much you rehearse on the training pitch, until you
get your kits on and see the referee, pre-season gets parked up and its for real. I’m pleased with a lot of it but there is still a lot of work to do. I thought we were slow out the blocks, that can be normal. Players are a little bit rusty and the cobwebs are on there. We conceded a sloppy goal but we showed character and courage to get back into the game and we should have won it with more goals.<br /><br /><b>[Gerrard is happy to be back in a more normal pre-season environment following restrictions imposed on the squad through the lockdown]</b> The first two weeks were quite frustrating because we had to work in small groups, had to do three and four sessions a day and non-contact. That is not normality. But it was nice to see the players, get back into the routine at the training ground and get that step closer back to playing football. The last couple of weeks have been better because we have been able to train properly, do a lot of tactical stuff, 11 versus 11, and you can see signs of how we want it to look when it comes to that first game. We are a lot more content and happy now, working for real</p>

So they won’t be around me.
