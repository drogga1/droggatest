  <p><b>[Florenzi explains goal celebration with grandmother]</b> She is 82 and had never been to the stadium before. This goal is for her. After I played for Italy, she told me that she’d come to the stadium and I would score. My family gave me this passion for football, I want to share my joy with everyone</p>

  <p><b>[Alessandro Florenzi’s remarkable long-range strike from on the right touchline and just inside the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> half caught out Ter Stegen and helped Roma to a 1-1 group-stage draw]</b> I haven’t changed since that goal. These things are rare. Maybe the goal made me a bit stronger because of what was said about me but it certainly didn’t change my game. Maybe I am a little more cautious of shots from the halfway line <b>[…]</b> but it’s part of life, part of football. Things happen that you don’t expect, like that great goal</p>

  <p><b>[Roma overturned a 4-1 first leg lead in shocking fashion, beating the Catalan side 3-0 at the Stadio Olimpico]</b> If Barcelona don’t get to play the ball to feet and pass it around comfortably, they really struggle.<br /><br />To be honest, we never really felt it was at risk tonight, as Barcelona did nothing to cause us problems. We put in the perfect performance. Tactically, we were a step above them</p>

  <p><b>[Alessandro Florenzi believes Roma outclassed <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> tactically]</b> To be honest, we never really felt it was at risk tonight, as <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> did nothing to cause us problems. We played perfectly and performed right from the start to the last minute. Tactically, we were a level above them. If <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> can’t play the ball to feet and pass it around comfortably, they really struggle. At half-time, the coach <b>[<a href="eusebio.html">Eusebio</a> <a href="eusebio-di-francesco.html">Di Francesco</a>]</b> said to keep doing what we were doing and to stay calm - we knew we could create something magical here. Gradually it happened and we secured a result that will go down in Roma’s history</p>

  <p><b>[Florenzi signs new long-term Roma contract]</b> Today is definitely a happy day for me. It’s an important day, too - I am very proud, very pleased to be able to continue to wear this shirt and represent this city. I want to be, above all, an example for the players that we have, now and in the future. You have to weigh everything up. Here it is not just about the money for me. There is the pride, there is the passion and the emotion of representing this club and wearing this shirt. Staying here was always the aim for me</p>
