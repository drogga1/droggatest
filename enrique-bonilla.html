  <p><b>[Liga MX president Enrique Bonilla clarified that the league did not broker the deal but said the rest of the league’s owners did unanimously agree to sanction the move after being satisfied that Juarez’s ownership is financially viable]</b> FC Juarez is going to participate in the next Liga MX tournament, substituting Lobos BUAP and that is done. It is an agreement in the assembly and we’re working on the calendars so Club Juarez is included in the 19 members of Liga MX.</p>

Chivas’ve once again put profit before points, sending their players barnstorming through the U.S. while other teams have preseasons that actually serve to get them ready for the Apertura. It’d be one thing if this were all a misunderstanding, but <a href="chivas-fc.html">Chivas</a> clearly thought they could throw their weight around and get the league to postpone its opener]</b> We have to prioritize our tournament, and a friendly match can’t be above our league. They were informed of this before they signed the contract. They wanted to do it like that. It’s their decision, but the calendar has been previously announced</p>

  <p><b>[Liga MX president Enrique Bonilla said the campaign is not only designed to get rid of ‘goalkeeper chant’ but also to keep all types of discrimination out of Mexican soccer]</b> What we’re looking for is to eradicate any type of racist expression or any type of discriminatory expression. We’re confident in the humanity of our fans and with that what we’re starting today is an awareness campaign for our fans that we’ll implement from Jornada 11-14</p>

Also, it represents another step in the partnership that we have established between two of the best leagues in the world. I know that this game being played in a spectacular setting and a magnificent stadium will be exciting for our fans, in a city that is special to us.
