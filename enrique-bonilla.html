  <p><b>[Enrique Bonilla as the league handed down penalties for the fracas that broke out between Veracruz fans and visiting Tigres supporters after a 3-0 road victory]</b> Every party needs to be self-critical, and when I say this I’m referring to the league, to the clubs and the authorities. For Liga MX, we should realized that we didn’t apply the established protocols. We didn’t act in a preventative way in the stands, and we were overtaken by the acts at the end of the match. The clubs didn’t take the necessary measures to develop the game in this way. The home team didn’t take the necessary measures for a game with 25,000 fans. There weren’t enough security guards, who are responsible for taking care of public integrity, in the building.</p>

  <p><b>[Weak penalty for stadium brawl more evidence Liga MX isn’t serious about change]</b> For us, it’s very difficult to take into account if the number of police officers is what’s needed to make sure things don’t spread. We can’t have a say in the authorities’ decision. In this cause we couldn’t influence the decision<br /><br />The reality is that from the league’s perspective, we don’t look on them well. We’re looking for them to disappear, that our game would a be 100 percent family atmosphere</p>

  <p><b>[Liga MX president Enrique Bonilla announced the decision to suspend the round at a news conference in Toulca]</b> I want to announce to you that the Mexican Football Federation and the Liga MX informs that Round 10 of the 2017 Clausura tournament has been suspended because the referees designated for the said round have denied to loan their services. This decision was taken unilaterally. The matches will be rescheduled and we will inform you at a later date the date in which they will be played.</p>

  <p><b>[FMF president Enrique Bonilla has proposed a combined league of the best United States, Canada and Mexico teams after the 2026 World Cup]</b> It’s a possibility, a North American league. We have to determine how and see the pros and cons but I think that’s a way to grow and to compete again. If we can make a World Cup then we can make a North American league or a North American Cup. The main idea is that we have to grow together to compete. If not, there is only going to be the rich guys in Europe and the rest of the world. We think this opportunity with the World Cup in 2026 opens the door for us to make a lot of things different and better.</p>

It is an agreement in the assembly and we’re working on the calendars so Club Juarez is included in the 19 members of Liga MX.</p>
