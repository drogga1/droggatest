  <p><b>[Back in October 2016, Miles Jacobson, head of Sports Interactive, explained in an interview with The Telegraph that they did not feel right about the idea of leaving such a seismic event out of the game]</b> We usually try and keep politics out of the game because nobody wants it rammed down their throat. But we were left with an interesting situation this year when the people of Britain voted to leave the EU and it wouldn’t have felt right to leave that out. It’s something we had to reflect in the game.</p>

  <p><b>[One of the potential outcomes arising from Brexit in the game, though Jacobson says that it is the slimmest of all possibilities, is the creation of a united Ireland - an amalgamation of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - which did not sit well with Democratic Unionist Party politician Gary Middleton]</b> I will be interested to see what happens to the Northern Ireland team. Is there going to be just one team for all of Ireland in this scenario?.<br /><br />I know this game is very popular so I wouldn’t be telling people not to be buying it or anything like that, but these are sensitive issues, especially when it comes to Northern Ireland and our place within the United Kingdom. They need to be sensitive of that.<br /><br />They have to be mindful of the political situation and not be seen to be trying to stir people up. Sometimes with these games that is their purpose - to encourage discussion - and I wouldn’t want to be taking away from that but I don’t think that’s the case here and I do think they need to be careful around this whole issue.</p>

  <p><b>[On FMdB]</b> FMdB is the ultimate football knowledge app, essential for the info that you need ahead of what promises to be a fantastic summer of football and beyond. If you’re unsure how good the player is playing at right-back, or who the midfielder is your team is looking at in the transfer window, FMdB gives you that info at the press of a button - it’s time to be properly ITK.</p>

  <p><b>[Will women’s football feature?]</b> it’s only a matter of time until someone gives a female coach the chance to manage a team in the UK - it’s already thankfully happened in many other countries.</p>

  <p><b>[According to Sports Interactive studio director Miles Jacobson, cricketers, other athletes and even NBA players have been indulging in FM since the outbreak began and boasting about their accomplishments on social media]</b> People have been regularly sending me messages about how the game has been helping with their mental health during this difficult time<br /><br />It obviously makes me happy that we’re helping people. But let’s be frank - it’s the doctors and nurses that are really helping people at this time. We’re just providing a way for people to escape the horrific situation for a few hours a day</p>
