  <p><b>[Chicago Fire coach Veljko Paunovic wasn’t expecting to win the league in his first season leading the team]</b> I think taking it day-by-day is the secret right now. I’ve never played on the same team with these guys before, but I know each of them has potential. I know the Chicago Fire have struggled during the past few years and haven’t been to the playoffs the last few years.<br /><br />My decision was very clear. I spoke to the coach, Pauno, before I signed and I knew what he wanted. As a group, we’re trying to build up the chemistry, get to know players inside the field and outside the field, trying to get chemistry right away. I know it’ll take a little time, but we don’t have another choice. We have to do it that way</p>

  <p><b>[Chivas, Tigres seeking repeat titles in Liga MX final]</b> <b>[It’s going to be]</b> very tough, very hard fought. Chivas have been growing each season, they’ve got a really good playing style and they have very dynamic players and a great coach. We have to do everything possible to win</p>

  <p><b>[Tigres’ defense is living on luck and reputation right now, though they don’t necessarily see it that way]</b> I know my skills. I like to look at the numbers and we’re always in the best defenses, so I think I’m still playing at a good level. I do feel like I have to improve, obviously, but I’m still at a good level.</p>
