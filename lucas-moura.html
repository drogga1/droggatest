  <p><b>[Lucas Moura on <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> team-mate <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> Ibrahimovic]</b> He treats everyone really well, but he has a profile that everyone knows about. He says what he thinks - if he does not like someone he lets them know. He is not trying to be popular. On the field, he has that explosive behaviour. He complains, insults and all of that, but I think it’s almost normal for a striker</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham forward Lucas Moura says he thinks Virgil van Dijk was one of the top three players in the world last season]</b> Dude, now this question there I don’t know if it’s true. They say he hasn’t been dribbled past since … whatever. If the guy is past him, it’s already a dribble. I don’t know, but the guys must have gone past him now. I know I scored a goal against Liverpool, we lost, but I scored against Liverpool and he was left behind. But he’s great. He is.<br /><br /><b>[26-year-old Moura was the hero of Spurs’ stunning Champions League semi-final comeback against Ajax, scoring a hat-trick in Amsterdam, but had to settle for a place on the bench in the final against Van Dijk and Liverpool. He came on as a second-half substitute for midfielder Harry Winks but was unable to turn the tide as Van Dijk’s man-of-the-match performance helped Jurgen Klopp’s side to their sixth European title]</b> Hey, the guy’s good. He’s two metres tall, strong, and the Liverpool team is a very good fit, with a lot of chemistry. So he had an excellent season. He was elected the best in the Premier League, I think. In the world … there are a lot of people there. But for the season, I think he’s among the top three. Among the top three!<br /><br /><b>[Moura admitted to being upset at having to start on the bench, but it was nothing compared to the pain of defeat]</b> Of course I got upset. I wish I had started. But I got so much more upset that we lost. We really believed that we could be champions. And man, it was difficult. I cried a lot after the game. Because it was so close, so close</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Moura has ‘no problem’ with Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino despite being dropped for a Champions League final clash with Liverpool]</b> It was difficult because every player wants to play. But even more difficult was to lose the game because I really think we could do better - we could win this trophy. We had the quality for this, so it was the most difficult. I need to respect the decision of the coach, respect my team-mates, so no problem. I’m looking forward now to next season and win a trophy - that’s my objective here.<br /><br /><b>[Lucas is determined to help the club get back on the trophy trail]</b> I think it’s a new era for us. We’ve got more confidence. I think we are on another level now, with the Champions League final, with the new stadium. I think people believe more in us now, and it’s time to confirm this. Confirm that we are a big team, a big club and we have a great squad. It’s time to dream with a trophy - that is our objective now. We will do our best for this</p>

He is an incredible person; he is very smart. I am sure he will do good things for the club<br /><br /><b>[On Neymar]</b> I don’t know, it’s difficult. He is a great player. I’m sure PSG want to keep Neymar. But I don’t know what will happen. We will see in the next days<br /><br /><b>[Lucas was speaking after Tottenham beat Juventus 3-2 in an International Champions Cup meeting in Singapore]</b> It was a very difficult game, with the heat. But I am very happy. We played very well, we worked very well. It’s important to start like that, with a success against a great team. We have to keep going. I’m very happy<br /><br /><b>[Lucas reserved praise for Tanguy Ndombele, who marked his first appearance for the club with an assist for the Brazilian’s goal]</b> He is a great player. He will help us a lot. I am happy for him. He is a young player with a great <b>[football]</b> culture. It’s a good thing to have him with us in Tottenham.</p>

I am very, very happy to get my first trophy with Tottenham. It is always my objective to get trophies and to be champions, and I hope to get a lot more. We will work hard this season to get more trophies. It is very important to work hard in the pre-season. Games like this get us ready for the season because the season will be very hard.

My objective is always to be better and make the fans happy. To play football you need to feel comfortable, you need to be free, to have nice team-mates and I have this here. I feel really like a family here. My team-mates are fantastic since my first day here. I hope to stay here a long time<br /><br /><b>[Lucas also spoke about the upcoming season, which will bring big expectations for Spurs after the summer additions of Tanguy Ndombele, Giovani Lo Celso and Ryan Sessegnon]</b> For this season I feel good things.

It was the last minute and I thought it was finished when it went in. Only VAR can see - and thank you for it. I thought we played very well.

  <p><b>[Lucas Moura has admitted that his role as a super-sub can be frustrating but that he respects the decisions of manager Mauricio Pochettino]</b> He didn’t speak with me, he didn’t explain anything, but it’s normal. To be honest, in the hotel, when he gave the starting XI, I was a little bit sad. Of course, I would like to play but the most important thing is to win the game. Of course I was sad inside. I want to play. But I know how to understand. I know how to respect, and I know how difficult it is for him to choose 11 players. So that’s football. When I am on the bench, I always think of coming on and doing my best, but I want to play. I want to be in the starting XI<br /><br /><b>[Moura’s team held on for a 2-2 draw with <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> champions, a result he says gives the team belief]</b> It will be so difficult, they are favourites but I think in football everything is possible – there is no invincible team. Everything can happen, and we need to believe that. We went to City and got a good result. We cannot lose stupid points at home as we did last season. My objective, and our objective, is to win a trophy. We have a very good squad, an amazing structure, a lot of fans and we can dream of a trophy. I think it is possible and we will try</p>

Yes. We need to look forward now. There are a lot of hard games to come. We lost against <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> but I am sure we have the quality to go to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and come back with three points. That’s what we must try to do. Each game is different. This is a new season and we have new players. I think we are stronger now <b>[than in previous years]</b>. I am sure we can go anywhere and win games. For sure it was a very bad result against <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>.

He will be stronger very soon. I am happy for him because it was a good transfer for him to make. I am also happy because he is closer to me now.

I will always give my best and I am happy for the opportunity he has given me. I think everyone knows him. I don’t need to speak about him because he is a winner, a champion.

Now I feel very good in this position (as a wide player).

We need to continue the work that has been done over the past five years, and now with the special touch of a coach who knows the way of titles like no one else. It has everything to happen. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> is undoubtedly one of the most iconic coaches with whom I have worked given all he has achieved and for his history. He is among the best coaches in the world. It is a great pleasure to work with him. We have the structure, squad, great players and a great coach.

Of course he’s a big name, a big impact for everyone. Everyone knows his career, how good he is, because he has won trophies at every club where he has worked. Now it’s a big opportunity for us to learn from him and we have everything we need - a very good coach who has a lot of experience and a lot to bring. I really believe we can win a trophy now. Each coach has a different mentality. He always talks to us, he tries to put in our mentality that we are strong, that we are a big club, that we are winners. He tries to put this mentality in us and then afterwards, tactically, step by step, his philosophy. But especially he wants to put this mentality - a strong mentality, winners - in us and that we can win<br /><br />That’s the game we need to have as a reference. It was the best game with him. From the first minute to the last we were aggressive, we didn’t let <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> play and that’s the spirit we need to keep. We need to do it every game and if we do it - this aggressiveness, this concentration - then with our quality we can go very far. That’s what we want to see.
