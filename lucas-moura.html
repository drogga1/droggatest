  <p><b>[Lucas Moura on <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> team-mate <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> Ibrahimovic]</b> He treats everyone really well, but he has a profile that everyone knows about. He says what he thinks - if he does not like someone he lets them know. He is not trying to be popular. On the field, he has that explosive behaviour. He complains, insults and all of that, but I think it’s almost normal for a striker</p>

You must be very, very organised.<br /><br /><b>[On Neymar]</b> It’s great for our country to see him doing well there, and me doing well here. He’s a great example. I’m happy for him, for everything he’s doing there and in the national team as well. I don’t think he can be like Messi, because every player has their own style and their own history.

  <p><b>[Lucas Moura has been linked with Manchester United and Liverpool in the past]</b> In every transfer window there is always a lot of speculation. Actually, no offers have been made for me yet, nothing concrete. My agent has not told me about anything yet. I have a contract until 2020. If something materialises, we will sit and analyse it. Right now, nothing is happening.<br /><br />Regarding a return to Brazil, I am not thinking about that. I have objectives I want to reach in Europe. Leaving PSG for another European club could be a possibility for me but I am under contract and I have no offers in front of me at this moment. If something arrives, we will see what is best for me and for the club. Right now, though, I am doing well in France.</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas overcoming PSG frustration and snow football at Spurs]</b> I had five fantastic years in Paris, then something broke and the last seven months have been difficult. This is not the time to talk about certain things, I just want to say I’m happy with the choice I made. Spurs are a club building for the future. There are international players like <b>[Harry]</b> Kane, <b>[Christian]</b> Eriksen, <b>[Dele]</b> Alli and Son <b>[Heung-min]</b>. There is a young, knowledgeable and ambitious coach, and a club with state-of-the-art facilities.<br /><br />Everything is going well, the only problem is the weather! I had never played in the snow like I did against Newport, but I will adapt to that too<br /><br /><b>[Lucas said of the Juventus test]</b> The return leg will be a tough one. It would be a mistake to be cautious and try to control the game at Wembley. The 2-2 in the opening game is a good result for us but Juve are one of the best clubs in Europe. They are finalists from two of the last three Champions Leagues and have lots of international experience. They are a very balanced team, they can attack and defend very well. Their start in Turin was astonishing but we made a great comeback. That night issued us a warning: Juve can score two goals in the space of a few minutes</p>

It was a little bit sad to leave him and Paris because I like the life there. But I had been there for five years and it was time to have a new challenge. I wanted to play in another championship and coming here was a big opportunity for me to play in the best league in the world. Tottenham are a big club. They are probably bigger in structure than PSG. I am impressed about this and I was happy to come here. Now I am ready to give my best because I will do the whole pre-season with the team. That is important because here is very different - the Premier League is very hard - so I will be more ready to show my talent<br /><br /><b>[On Mouricio Pochettino]</b> The relationship with him is very good. I believe we can have a big season, win a trophy. That’s why I am here, to win a trophy because I believe in the team, the project. We have the capacity to make history here</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd’s £52.5m Fred call backed by Tottenham duo Serge Aurier &amp; Lucas Moura]</b> It’s very good to have another Brazilian in the Premier League and in a strong team like Manchester United. Fred is a very, very good player, he’s young and he has a big future both in the Premier League and in the national team. He has a lot of quality. When he gets forward from midfield, he can shoot with both feet and he is quick and intelligent. I think he can be a very good player for United and I’m happy that he’s here in the Premier League, but I hope we win against him this time!</p>

I need to enjoy it but also to keep working because I believe I have much more to give and I’m sure we will have a successful season because we can, and I believe in my team-mates, I believe in this club. I want to deliver much more. I worked a lot and very hard for this moment and I think the team had a great month with great games. I’m so happy because I know it’s not easy to win this trophy and it was a great month for me and also for the team. For me, the Premier League is the toughest league in the world and to win a trophy like this, to be player of the month, it’s not easy. To be here now and to win this trophy gives me more motivation to keep working and to want more. I don’t have much to say but thanks to God and to share this with my team-mates and with my family, and to keep working because this is only the beginning. We have a lot more in front of us, so I need to keep working and doing my best.</p>

I forget the last five or six months I had at PSG. I like to think about the four years when I was very happy there and won a lot of trophies. The last year was to learn and to grow up. Now I think I’m more experienced and stronger.<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether Emery had ever explained why he was not being played]</b> No. I need to respect the decision of the coach. I know that it’s difficult for him because he needs to choose 11 players to play. I don’t like to look behind. I like to look forward to what I can do, what I can win. I have nothing against Unai, I respect him, he is a very good coach<br /><br /><b>[Lucas has scored four goals in 12 Premier League appearances]</b> I am in a big club and I play with big players.

  <p><b>[Tottenham winger Lucas Moura has praised Harry Kane]</b> The fans always want the club to buy new players. Sometimes, when we don’t win, they think it’s because of a lack of spending. Tottenham has a philosophy that’s a bit different to other clubs, and that doesn’t stop us from fighting for titles. We have a very strong and connected group that always finishes in the top four of Premier League, which is very hard. We are always competing in the Champions League, always reaching the knockout rounds<br /><br />Look, I would say he is in the top three <b>[strikers in the world]</b>. He has so much quality, it’s impressive because of his age, he’s still young. He scores a lot, has technique, a lot of power, a good sense of positioning… He’s a complete forward and a great striker<br /><br />Two things helped me decide to sign for Tottenham. The main thing was that I was not playing, sometimes not even in the squad. Besides that, I felt it was time to move on. I learned a lot in the five years at PSG, achieved many things, made great friends, but it was time to look for new challenges. The Premier League has always been a great goal, a big dream. I am very happy at the moment. Playing in England has been a really good experience. Representing a great club, playing in the Champions League. Everything has been very nice</p>

That’s why we are going there to play the game otherwise we might as well stay in London, give up and let them qualify. One-nil, things can happen. A game is 90-95 minutes and a lot of things can happen. Look at when we played Manchester City in the second game. In 20 minutes there were five goals. Who could believe that? No-one. The spirit against City was amazing, was unbelievable, and we need to play like that. We went there and played against City and we did a very good game. We were strong mentally because it’s important. And now we need to do the same. Run, fight. Like I said, we can go there, I believe in my team-mates, let’s rest well now, prepare for the next game and believe always. Hopefully when we go there we will score a lot of goals and get the qualification. That would be amazing for us and all the Tottenham fans</p>

My objective, and our objective, is to win a trophy. We have a very good squad, an amazing structure, a lot of fans and we can dream of a trophy. I think it is possible and we will try</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Moura insists <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are stronger than last season and are ready to prove it by winning at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> for the first time since 2010 on Sunday]</b> Is this the perfect game for us to have after the <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> defeat? Yes. We need to look forward now. There are a lot of hard games to come. We lost against <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> but I am sure we have the quality to go to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and come back with three points. That’s what we must try to do. Each game is different. This is a new season and we have new players. I think we are stronger now <b>[than in previous years]</b>. I am sure we can go anywhere and win games. For sure it was a very bad result against <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. We tried but it was very difficult to play against them, especially as they kept everyone behind the ball after they scored<br /><br /><b>[Added to the intense derby atmosphere, Moura is relishing the prospect of doing battle with close friend and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> new-boy <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a>, who was a team-mate of his during their time at <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>]</b> David is a very experienced player and knows how to go through this situation <b>[after being blamed for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> defeat]</b>. He will be stronger very soon. I am happy for him because it was a good transfer for him to make. I am also happy because he is closer to me now. He can come visit me at my home easier because when he was at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, he was so far away! But on Sunday he will be my opponent, I will work and do the best for my team to get three points. On the pitch <b>[our relationship]</b> is different.

I will always give my best and I am happy for the opportunity he has given me. I think everyone knows him. I don’t need to speak about him because he is a winner, a champion. He has a lot of trophies and I am sure he has much to bring for us and to add to our team, our club.<br /><br />Every player wants to play, it doesn’t matter the position. But everyone knows I am not a No.9, it is not my best position. When <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> put me there I always gave my best because for me the most important thing is the team but each coach has one opinion, a different mind.

In the last moment <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> went in and I decided to go to Paris. I have never worked with him. I am getting to know him now but, in the beginning, it is very, very good, everyone is happy, everyone is optimistic and step by step we are getting to know him and putting his philosophy <b>[in to practice]</b>.<br /><br />I am happy to win two games, let’s keep working and look forward. Everyone is optimistic with him and we believe in his job. I think it is too early to speak about change but I think you can see a few changes he has made about positions, some players. Step by step we put his philosophy <b>[in to practice]</b>, his way to play and I think he has a lot of things to bring to our team</p>

We need to continue the work that has been done over the past five years, and now with the special touch of a coach who knows the way of titles like no one else. It has everything to happen. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> is undoubtedly one of the most iconic coaches with whom I have worked given all he has achieved and for his history. He is among the best coaches in the world. It is a great pleasure to work with him. We have the structure, squad, great players and a great coach. To crown it all with a title, we simply need to believe and know that we also have the same ability as they (Manchester City and Liverpool) have. You need to add this winning mindset<br /><br /><b>[As a result, the former <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> forward believes he can become a better player under his tutelage]</b> I will try to absorb as much as I can, I can learn a lot from him. He brings tremendous confidence to the group, as he has achieved so many things in his career. His is has a name marked in the history of football. I have many goals yet, I can contribute a lot. I really want to win a title for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>.

Of course he’s a big name, a big impact for everyone. Everyone knows his career, how good he is, because he has won trophies at every club where he has worked. Now it’s a big opportunity for us to learn from him and we have everything we need - a very good coach who has a lot of experience and a lot to bring. I really believe we can win a trophy now. Each coach has a different mentality. He always talks to us, he tries to put in our mentality that we are strong, that we are a big club, that we are winners. He tries to put this mentality in us and then afterwards, tactically, step by step, his philosophy. But especially he wants to put this mentality - a strong mentality, winners - in us and that we can win<br /><br />That’s the game we need to have as a reference. It was the best game with him. From the first minute to the last we were aggressive, we didn’t let <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> play and that’s the spirit we need to keep. We need to do it every game and if we do it - this aggressiveness, this concentration - then with our quality we can go very far. That’s what we want to see. We have a lot of things to improve but this aggression and this intensity is what we need to show every game</p>

But now is a new season and a new moment. I cannot tell you what happened if it is about mentality, about confidence, but we know that something is missing. I don’t think there is a lack of confidence. We know that we have good players, we have a good squad and we can do better. It is just football. Sometimes you can try everything you play well, you don’t win. It is just something that is missing. We will find the winning way again.

It’s not me who has to decide, but of course I want to play with him in the next season. I want to stay with him because he’s very important for us and it’s not easy to find a player like him.

For me, his quality to score goals is unbelievable, with right and left foot. He’s so strong. He shoots very, very strong.
