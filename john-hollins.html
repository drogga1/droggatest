<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Eden Hazard has no reason to leave Chelsea]</b> Hazard is happy here, he’s in London, it’s a lovely city and his family are all settled. Why would you want to get up and settle again when you are on top money, you’re the main man of Chelsea who can do anything you want, and you’re still a Belgium international? You must think to yourself ‘why would I want to move?’ The players around him suit him, he also uses his skills against players who want to kick him and <b>[those around him]</b> protect him.<br /><br /><b>[Hollins has been impressed with the impact Sarri had made since replacing Antonio Conte in July]</b> <b>[Sarri]</b> is not one that wants to be in the limelight. He sits on the side there and has a cigarette now and again. I don’t know whether that’s what keeps him calm!<br /><br /><b>[On Alvaro Morata]</b> There’s always someone saying ‘let’s get rid of him and bring somebody else in’ but Morata has scored again now so hopefully that will strengthen his position - and it’s a very good position to be in, whoever is in it. You’ve got Hazard, Willian and other people around you. They’ve started off, they haven’t been beaten, they’re playing well, Christmas will come and there might be a few presents bought there and brought into the team and they’ll most probably win the league. Then all of a sudden you’re in the Champions League!</p>
