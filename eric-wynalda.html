  <p><b>[Alexi Lalas gives Bruce Arena ‘A-plus’ for revitalizing USA]</b> We just went through a phase where we were led to believe that Jurgen Klinsmann was the guy who had the key to the room we haven’t been in yet, because he’d done it as a coach and he’d done it as a player.<br /><br />As far as Bruce is concerned, I think we’re going to take this as far as our players take it. Bruce is managing a group; the group will push this. That doesn’t mean it’s all on the players. For the last five years, we’ve been told to lower our expectations because the players aren’t good enough. Bruce isn’t about that. Bruce is like, ‘Let’s figure out a way to make you better than what you are.’ Something has to happen that gives our group the belief they can accomplish more than what’s expected of them<br /><br />Klinsmann was going to fight back. Who do you think you are? I’m in charge here. Landon Donovan, you’re cut … because I’m the show here. Clint Dempsey, you’ve done nothing at Tottenham. It was all about ego.<br /><br />Bruce is like, I know you usually play here, but you’re going to play there today and here’s why - but you got this, you’re great. The conversation with Klinsmann was, This is what you’re doing wrong, and if you do this, we’re in trouble. And don’t do that; if you do that, I’m pulling you out. It’s no fun playing for a guy like that</p>

  <p><b>[USA Soccer presidential candidates]</b> There’s been a lot made of the role that I’ve had in the last decade and a half being on television. What I’m experiencing now, and I think it’s been a great experience, is a lot of people are being introduced to the real me.</p>

  <p><b>[How painted poles, pregame vomiting and a timely goal defined first-ever <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> match]</b> Leading up to it was just madness, complete chaos. It was just… let’s get to the finish line. Let’s get this game started, let’s get this league started, so we can just focus on the future. But everything leading up to that was really tough.<br /><br />It was just nervousness. It was guys that had never played in a professional game or were just starting to feel the magnitude of what was about to happen; that we were going to be playing a game that the world was going to be watching<br /><br />I think the hardest part for players in the days - two days prior and maybe even the last time that we stepped on the field prior to the game the day before - was just the amount of people, just running around and the anxiety that people were having. They had to paint the poles, the light poles, green, so they didn’t stand out for television reasons. I watched <b>[producer]</b> Michael Cohen get in a pretty good argument with Peter Bridgewater, our then-president and GM, and this was going on during our practice. So the hardest part was getting the guys to just focus on the game<br /><br /><b>[The game wouldn’t finish scoreless, though. In the 88th minute, Wynalda broke the deadlock]</b> It’s hard for me to talk about it sometimes because it sounds a little self-serving but I’m just so glad that I scored and we finished that game 1-0 and it didn’t give all the haters that opportunity to say like, ‘Soccer’s boring, 0-0’. It was a wonderful moment, and it really was the kickstart</p>
