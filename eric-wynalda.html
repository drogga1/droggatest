<blockquote>
  <p><b>[How painted poles, pregame vomiting and a timely goal defined first-ever <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> match]</b> Leading up to it was just madness, complete chaos. It was just… let’s get to the finish line. Let’s get this game started, let’s get this league started, so we can just focus on the future. But everything leading up to that was really tough.<br /><br />It was just nervousness. It was guys that had never played in a professional game or were just starting to feel the magnitude of what was about to happen; that we were going to be playing a game that the world was going to be watching<br /><br />I think the hardest part for players in the days - two days prior and maybe even the last time that we stepped on the field prior to the game the day before - was just the amount of people, just running around and the anxiety that people were having. They had to paint the poles, the light poles, green, so they didn’t stand out for television reasons. I watched <b>[producer]</b> Michael Cohen get in a pretty good argument with Peter Bridgewater, our then-president and GM, and this was going on during our practice. So the hardest part was getting the guys to just focus on the game<br /><br /><b>[The game wouldn’t finish scoreless, though. In the 88th minute, Wynalda broke the deadlock]</b> It’s hard for me to talk about it sometimes because it sounds a little self-serving but I’m just so glad that I scored and we finished that game 1-0 and it didn’t give all the haters that opportunity to say like, ‘Soccer’s boring, 0-0’. It was a wonderful moment, and it really was the kickstart</p>
