  <p><b>[Wolfsburg complete Bruno Henrique signing]</b> I am very happy to be here. It has always been my big dream to play in Germany. The <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> is one of the strongest leagues in the world. I’ll give everything now so I can also help the team in a timely</p>

  <p><b>[Bruno Henrique reveled in sharing the pitch with such a star, although he could not help noticing <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> had eyes for someone else - himself]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> is one of the biggest players in the world. I never imagined that one day I would be marking him. It was exciting. He is a great player, very skilled, strong and difficult to mark, but I did well, right? What I also saw differently is that he kept staring himself in the big screen the whole time!</p>

  <p><b>[Up to five years ago Bruno Henrique, now 25, worked as a receptionist in his native Belo Horizonte until he was discovered playing a Minas Gerais amateur championship and won a contract with local giants Cruzeiro. The forward only made his Brazilian <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> debut at the start of last year after a tortuous climb up the pyramid, and he affirmed that playing in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> just 12 months later was a dream come true]</b> Life in football is not easy, and I am grateful for everything I have. I have been through a great deal in football, I have gone hungry and lived in a hostel playing for tiny clubs. I have faced a lot of difficulties, but working hard I have made it to where I am.<br /><br /><b>[He has not struggled with the change of surroundings in 2016, despite his confession that he is still getting the hang of German]</b> I am very happy here in Germany, I am enjoying life here. The country is beautiful and very organised, only the language is complicated, but I have a company that works with me and works everything out for me, which makes everything easier and reduces any problems.</p>
