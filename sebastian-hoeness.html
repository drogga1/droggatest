  <p><b>[Sebastian Hoeness says Obsessed’ <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> spent an hour talking to me about football, just because he felt like it]</b> I particularly remember this incredible obsession with him about wanting to talk about football. I sat with him and he spent an hour talking to me intensively about football. Just because he felt like it. It was extremely exciting for me<br /><br />I just found <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Thomas Tuchel</a> exciting. I felt early on that he is a young coach who represents a new philosophy. I really wanted to watch him and then had the opportunity to have a long conversation with him.It showed on the one hand that we have very similar footballing ideas, but on the other hand we also have the same doubts in certain areas. Otherwise, I was just a training observer and focused on tactical aspects</p>

  <p><b>[Sebastian Hoeness has paid tribute to his former team-mate Kevin-Prince Boateng]</b> I’ve never been on the pitch with a more talented player. <a href="kevin-prince-boateng.html">Kevin-Prince Boateng</a> was exceptional in the overall package and was already a crazy man at the time, extremely confident. He didn’t care about anything that would have given him a bloody nose or two. But that was one of his great strengths. He knew what he could do and took responsibility<br /><br />I was a few years older than him. I remember how I said to him once: ‘Kevin, you are not about whether you will ever become a professional, play in front of many spectators and make a lot of money, it’s all about whether you win titles or just play along’. In the beginning there was actually a risk that he would not quite make it to the top. Then it clicked and he won titles. I’m happy about that</p>

He previously played in the second team and indicated to me his great potential. He was always motivated and tried to get involved<br /><br />Obviously, <b>[Davies’]</b> physique is one of his great strengths. He is a model athlete: fast and also very robust. Accordingly, his body is his greatest weapon. He is also a left-footer who works well from a technical point of view, even at the highest speed. The fact that he mostly played at the front during his apprenticeship now benefits him as a left-back</p>

  <p><b>[Why doesn’t <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>’s academy produce more superstars?]</b> In the last few years, the results of our work haven’t been good. No player has even come close to making the first team since <a href="david-alaba.html">David Alaba</a>. The new <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> Campus will also provide one answer to the current transfer madness and the explosion of salaries. Like many big clubs around the world, a youth academy has been our dream for many years. What you can see here today can make us all feel proud. Our staff have an infrastructure better than any other<br /><br />Certainly not too late. We are happy that the campus is standing and that we can benefit from these great conditions. Now we want to do our job and develop players that could be considered for the professional squad in the near future. I am very impressed by the cooperation and atmosphere on campus. There is a common goal that is in the foreground. That means developing players. The right direction has been taken</p>
