  <p><b>[Zozulya causes controversy again]</b> When it all started, I was a fascist. Then they started to check my Facebook and I was a Nazi. Recently they called me a racist and today, I didn’t listen but I was told they shouted ‘communist’ at me. People don’t make any sense. Soon they will say that I am a f<em>*. ‘M</em>ricon’ is gay in Spanish. It wouldn’t surprise me</p>

  <p><b>[Albacete striker Roman Zozulya issues apology after using homophobic slur in interview]</b> Soon they will say that I am a f<em>*. ‘M</em>ricon’ is gay in Spanish. It wouldn’t surprise me <b>[…]</b><br /><br /><b>[After drawing even more criticism for his recent statement, the forward has issued an apology alongside his current club]</b> Hi everyone, I would like to comment something about the Ukrainian TV interview I did in Spain. Unfortunately, I have not expressed myself correctly. That is why, and above all, I would like to apologise to my team-mates and Albacete Balompie. All the words I spoke do not correspond to the history of the Club and its shield. I would also like to apologize to people who felt offended by my words. My intention was not to humiliate or offend anyone. I hear these words very often on the football fields and I also believe that they should be eliminated from football and sports in general. Each person chooses their path in life and decides how to live it. Never in my life have I stated that I am against it. I apologise once again. I didn’t want to offend anyone. I wish you all goodness, health and happiness. Aupa Alba!</p>
