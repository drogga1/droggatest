  <p><b>[Wellington Phoenix will unveil their new coach in June]</b> Chris Greenacre and Des Buckingham earned the right to interview for the top job next season and impressed the football committee with their tactical awareness and vision for the club.<br /><br />While they have been unsuccessful this time, in Des and Chris, we believe we have two of the most talented young coaches currently active in Australasia. Since it was confirmed, on April 8, that Wellington Phoenix were out of finals contention the club has engaged in a thorough review of our coaching structure - our present strengths and weaknesses - and what leadership attributes are necessary to take this club forward. I’ve previously and publicly expressed our commitment to a 31 May deadline for finalising the head coach appointment, and after six weeks of winnowing out applications, conducting interviews across three continents <b>[and numerous timezones!]</b>, I can happily report that we have met this commitment ahead of schedule<br /><br />We have a signed contract with our preferred candidate and pending flights and immigration we look forward to presenting our new head coach in Wellington, early June. In the interim our new head coach has been talking to our football operations department, assessing our current squad of players and potential new signings from across Australasia and beyond<br /><br /><b>[Dome has claimed the Phoenix’s new coach will kick-start a new era for the New Zealand-based club]</b> With a deep knowledge of European football, experience of developing young talent and a wide network of scouting contacts, our prospective head coach is excellently situated to attract quality players to our football club and we look forward to announcing several key signings over the months ahead</p>

  <p><b>[Wellington Phoenix have agreed to release marquee winger Kosta Barbarouses from the final year of his contract]</b> It’s not a decision we have made lightly, especially after the back end to the season that Kosta had. But it’s never been our policy as a club to stand in the way of a player’s happiness, or the happiness of those dear to him, and as much as we could have dug our heels in, the best thing for all parties concerned is an amicable termination. Obviously it’s disappointing to lose a player of Kosta’s pedigree - he’s exactly the type of character we want to attract to this football club. But every door closing is a door opening and we remain confident the squad we are currently assembling will have Wellington very much in the mix for finals football.</p>

We wish him all the best in Germany and look forward to seeing him progress all the way through to Bayern’s first team as he continues his development as a professional footballer</p>
