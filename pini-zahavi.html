  <p>[Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski has rubbished reports suggesting a change of agent means he is off to Real Madrid] Of course I have a lot of contacts in the industry, but that has nothing to do with it. However, one never knows what will happen in the future</p>

  <p>[Neymar needs to remain out of the shadow of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo] Neymar did what he had to. There are only three football superstars - Messi, Cristiano and Neymar. They can’t play in one club. At Barca, Ney was always the No. 2. He was the second to shoot from free-kicks, second to the penalties, second to everything. He came to Spain as a young boy. He grew up. Now he’s 26 and has eight or nine years at the top level. He needs independence.<br /><br />PSG have big plans. Before Neymar’s move to PSG, only French people watched Ligue 1. Neymar changed it<br /><br />I admire Lewandowski from the very moment that he signed with Borussia Dortmund. Even when he didn’t score as many goals as now, I’ve always said that he’s got [quality]. He’s the best forward in the world. No one is better. To score goals you need not only skills, but also an instinct. Robert’s got everything. I admire him.</p>

  <p>[Will Real Madrid target Robert Lewandowski leave Bayern Munich this summer?] [Robert] feels that he needs a change and a new challenge in his career. Robert’s motives are not money or a specific club, because almost all the top clubs would like to have the best striker in the world in their ranks. Everybody in the club leadership of FC Bayern has had a great playing career. They should understand his situation.</p>

  <p>[Neymar is a football genius again] The injury was really bad, more than we said, he was able to participate in the World Cup but he went without being able to do a complete preparation, out of competition. He was racing against the clock to regain all his skills, but he was not totally ready. The World Cup was very difficult for him, but what you saw in Russia was a player coming back. It’s unfair to judge him on this.<br /><br />You can say that he is back and it is excellent. He just goes back to his level, he’s the one we’ve always known, a football genius</p>
