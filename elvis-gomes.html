  <p><b>[Keenan Almeida and Romeo Fernandes have fallen foul of the Goa Football Association after being accused of participating in unregistered football tournaments]</b> It’s quite surprising that ISL and I-League players have been involved in such tournaments. Romeo and Keenan are among the 40-odd footballers we will issue the show-cause notice. We have evidence against these players and so we have to take action against them. The rules are uniform for all. We can’t bend the rules for some.</p>

  <p><b>[Goa Football Association lifts suspension of 46 footballers, players welcome move]</b> With the transfer window open and the confusion about ISL and I-League going on, we already have too much on our plate. It’s great to hear that good sense has finally prevailed.</p>
