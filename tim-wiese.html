  <p><b>[Tim Wiese, the former Germany keeper, on becoming a wrestler]</b> The WWE is a really interesting thing for me. I think you all remember me from when I weighed 90 kilos. To put on 40 kilos in two years is rare, it’s striking. Gym visits are like an addiction. If I don’t go to the gym, it feels like I have done something wrong. And you have to eat, eat, eat. I already have two training sessions behind me, which were incredibly painful and I hadn’t expected that! Whatever happens now is up in the stars, I’ll just keep continuing my training and who knows where that will lead</p>

  <p><b>[Former Germany goalkeeper Tim Wiese talks ahead of making his full World Wrestling Entertainment debut]</b> I was a big WWE fan when I was a boy. I kept track of it during my football career but never thought of myself as a wrestler. I didn’t take it seriously as first, then things became more concrete. It’s been a long time since I worked as hard as I did in the last few weeks. This is Champions League. WWE is the biggest thing in wrestling, so I’m fully focused and blending out everything else around me. I think I’ll be playing the role of the bad guy - I’m being pushed in that direction, but that’s OK. In football, I was already the bad guy who opposition fans would insult. It doesn’t bother me. They can all hate me. I don’t care. I will hurt them, they won’t hurt me. Anyone can have a go: I’m going to be unbeatable</p>
