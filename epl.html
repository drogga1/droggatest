At a Shareholders’ Meeting today, clubs were provided with an update on the non-live VAR trials being undertaken by the League and Professional Game Match Officials <b>[PGMOL]</b> this season. Key learnings from VAR’s use in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup, and other leagues across the world, were discussed in detail. The Premier League’s non-live testing programme will remain in place for the rest of this season, with a continued emphasis on those Saturday afternoons which have several matches being played concurrently, and developing a clear protocol for communicating VAR decisions to fans. The League will now formally make a request to the International Football Association Board and FIFA to use VAR next season.</p>

  <p><b>[Bolton Wanderers face liquidation this week unless a deal to buy the club can be resurrected by 17:00 BST on Tuesday]</b> The EFL have made their position clear by insisting on a 17:00 BST deadline on Tuesday for a deal to be completed or give compelling reasons for an extension. They have also written to everybody concerned in the process to underline that sense of urgency. On Sunday evening, there was some tentative dialogue, but we are still some way from reaching a solution. Therefore, I am appealing to those parties whose position seems intractable to do everything to reach a compromise.<br /><br />In just over 24 hours, the club will have its membership of the EFL revoked. Over and above that, the club is currently not in a position to carry on trading and, as such, the process of closing down the company will commence on Wednesday. This will ultimately lead to its liquidation, the expulsion of the club from the EFL and the inevitable loss of over 150 jobs. More than that, it will devastate a community for whom the football club is a beacon of hope and expectation</p>

No one wanted to be in this position but following repeated missed deadlines, the suspension of five League fixtures, in addition to not receiving the evidence we required in regard to financial commitments and a possible takeover not materialising; the EFL Board has been forced to take the most difficult of decisions<br /><br /><b>[Meanwhile another League One side, Bolton Wanderers, are set to experience a similar fate as Bury should they not solve their financial crisis in the next 14 days]</b> Despite repeated assurances, we are extremely disappointed that we are still not in a position to reach a successful resolution with the sale of Bolton Wanderers and have therefore taken the decision to lift the suspension on the notice of withdrawal. I again urge all parties to finalise the proposed takeover. The reality of this action is that there are now 14 days to secure the Club’s long-term future, and I sincerely hope we can find a way through these challenging circumstances for the benefit of all those who have an association with the Club</p>

  <p><b>[The Deloitte Annual Review of Football Finance covering the 2017-18 English Football League season revealed that broadcast revenues - including parachute payments - accounted for over 50 per cent of total Championship revenues. Those parachute payments totalled some £243 million ($295m) which, Deloitte adds, was the highest ever total paid in a single season. <a href="hull-city-fc.html">Hull City</a>’s parachute payments alone accounted for 75% of total revenue]</b> interest-free soft loans from shareholders constituted 78% of total debt. That emphasises the extent to which Championship clubs are dependent on owners pumping in the cash. Bolton’s late owner Eddie Davies waived £170m ($206m) of loans in 2016 but without his funding the club slid towards oblivion in 2018-19. The wages and transfer fees that clubs are committing, their actual revenue can’t substantiate it on its own basis. They are reliant on owner funding. We’re probably in a unique situation being such a big league and not being a top league in Europe. But the reality is, what are our clubs playing for? They are playing for the absolute opportunity to get promoted to the Premier League so they can share in the riches that come from competing in that competition<br /><br />The big clubs would love to have the opportunity of owning, controlling, funding, ‘fostering’ a smaller club from one of our competitions on the basis they believe that would best help the development of their players. But English football is relatively unique; we’ve got 92 full professional teams. Each one of them is sovereign; it runs itself. It’s there for the benefit of the local community. And every time the question has been approached our clubs are adamant: they want clubs to be individual; they want to have their own identity; they want to be able to make their own decisions. That’s always been the strength of English football for many, many years. Our rules are set to make sure that another club cannot dominate the future prospects of another team and I think that’s where we’ll be for some considerable period of time</p>

The FSA, Premier League, EFL and <a href="fa.html">The FA</a> encourage all clubs and supporters’ groups to remain in contact during this difficult time and, where possible, support one another in their community efforts. We also extend our gratitude to those football supporters who are key workers, and those who have offered their support on a volunteer basis. We urge fans across the country to follow the ongoing Government advice, to provide us all with the best opportunity to keep fans and communities safe. It is also important to note that any official communications will come from the Government and football authorities themselves. Please follow our official channels for this information. As the situation is regularly changing, the Premier League, EFL and <a href="fa.html">The FA</a> will continue to consult the FSA and keep supporters updated on the progress made as soon as is practically possible.
