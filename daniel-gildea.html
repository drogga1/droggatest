  <p><b>[Gildea’s path has been unorthodox]</b> I grew up in a system where I felt like skills were taught to an extent, and technique was taught to an extent, but then I felt like they were knocked out of you a little bit when you get to 15, 16, 17. Winning becomes paramount, style goes out of the window.<br /><br />I think I grew up in a system that I thought was broken a little bit, and I wanted to kind of hone in on the technique, what the Brazilians do, and play with that flair and creativity. Part of the stuff I’m doing is keeping the exercises fun, challenging and massively player-centric and not team-oriented.<br /><br /><b>[Gildea has total control over the curriculum he teaches]</b> It’s just being a player-centric coach and developing individuals that can definitely fit into a team but <b>[also]</b> be a game-changing type of player, not a reserve. Here in the States and when I was back in England, I think we develop those kinds of <b>[robotic]</b> players… the <b>[right]</b> intentions are there, but I think at times we knock that kind of flair and creativity out of players.<br /><br />It’s a lot of repetition <b>[of skills]</b>. Also allowing players, especially in the final third, to make their own decisions. When I have very, very good attacking players that can do amazing things with the ball, I try not to fall into the trap of dictating what they do. I’ll give them suggestions; if they make the wrong decisions, then there’s talking points there, but it’s not ‘don’t do that’. It’s not ‘you can’t do that skill because it won’t work’. I think you can use any of the skills that we do in game situations if they’re done at the right level and the right intensity<br /><br />People can say - and they’ve got a point - that there’s a huge thing in terms of street football <b>[in Brazil]</b>, but they’re still learning that stuff in structured environments as well.<br /><br />Neymar was in a professional academy as a kid, so he wasn’t necessarily just honing all of his skills in that street environment. The stuff he does is very fluid and with a lot of flair, but I guarantee that he did a lot of repetitive stuff as well to get to the level he’s at<br /><br />The early maturing players dominate the game at younger ages and are the ones coaches want on their team. I haven’t got a problem with having big players but when you allow them to just use their power and strength to win games you’re not helping them either, because at 15, 16, they’re the ones that dip off because you haven’t taught them, ‘actually, at the next level you’re going to need to know how to hold the ball up, how to turn quickly and link up play<br /><br />There’s a reliance on big, powerful, quick players which the U.S. produces, but the soccer brain and the fluidity and the technique is what will shine through in the end. I think, as well, there’s a mistake of… there’s a lot of money in youth soccer out here, more so than most other places, and there’s a huge reliance on recruiting <b>[players]</b> and winning big championships and winning leagues to be able to recruit <b>[the next crop of]</b> players<br /><br />I think sometimes that takes away from the development in terms of, are we producing individual players that can go on and play at that next level? Or are we producing two-touch robots on a team because they can win you games? That’s what I see out here a little bit<br /><br /><b>[On Christian Pulisic]</b> The talent is there, but I just think at times it gets coached out of you - ‘that won’t work <b>[in games]</b>’. It does work. If Ronaldinho was pulled back <b>[like that]</b> when he was 12, 13, 14, I don’t think you’d see the same Ronaldinho that we saw for 10 years dominating the game</p>
