Even if one of the candidates is not a good one, they have the right to be at the congress. That’s why I’m advocating that Morocco has to go to the congress. Morocco cannot be kicked out before the congress.<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he said he was confident of clearing his name Blatter said]</b> What I have done - or what we have done?

The one thing they have said, altogether they have said, is don’t judge, otherwise you will be judged<br /><br /><b>[Blatter has also criticised Fifa’s plan for a League of Nations]</b> The rich will become richer, and those who have less, they remain poor. This is not the idea in the development programmes we started 30 or 40 years ago.

  <p><b>[q: How did you get into the position?]</b> I worked at the Swiss Olympic Committee and I was called by the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> general secretary in 1966. He told me that they needed my help. I left everything, including my position in Longines brand marketing. Football was always a part of me and it was my chance. Years later, they told me that president <b>[Joao]</b> Havelange needed a football player, not to score goals but to implement a programme to develop the sport. It was 1974 and I accepted immediately. In February 1975, I began and was there until February 2015, when I was suspended from any activity<br /><br /><b>[q: What was <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> for you?]</b> A dream and a challenge. It was about being involved in football and developing it. Six years after starting, I was appointed general secretary. Football isn’t just about touching the ball, it touches lives through its very important social and cultural aspects. It is a school of life. It is about discipline and respect for the team, the coach, the referee and the opposition. It is a competitive game, like life, but with sportsmanship. Football can help society and we have achieved that. There are two billion people involved<br /><br /><b>[q: What were your first steps like in <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>?]</b> When I arrived, <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> didn’t have an official sponsor. We only had Adidas for the ball and nothing else. Coca Cola then arrived and I’m proud of that. There were 11 people at <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>. I was number 12 and at that time, No. 12 was the substitute. What changed everything was television in the 1970s. Public and private television changed both football and <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>. The World Cup in South Korea and Japan <b>[2002]</b> changed everything. <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> and national leagues changed, especially the English one because of the impact it had all over the world. It sold well and things continued<br /><br /><b>[q: Why did <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> start to change?]</b> There was another issue that entered the football world. When talking about a social, educational and economic issue, then what follows are political issues and when those entered, football changed. We had already lived through the World Cup in Argentina, a complicated situation. Later, we have seen that it has a direct influence on things, as was proven by the designation of the venues for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments. <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>’s executive committee decided that the 2018 tournament would be in Europe and 2022 in the USA for rotation reasons and because eastern Europe had never had a World Cup<br /><br /><b>[q: So why did that not happen and the 2022 World Cup went to Qatar?]</b> Due to the political intervention of the French president <b>[Nicolas Sarkozy]</b> through the vice-president of <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>, who was <a href="michel-platini.html">Michel Platini</a>. He asked to vote for Qatar and managed to change everything. The USA were out of the running. Now, they have another World Cup themselves, due to the intervention of the American president for 2026. <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> can’t do anything when a head of state moves like that. Football has become an important issue, for both good and bad reasons<br /><br /><b>[q: Were the United States unhappy with the decision to take ‘their’ World Cup to Qatar?]</b> Not as much as England in 2018. I remember what <b>[former prime minister David]</b> Cameron said. ‘That man <b>[meaning me]</b> told me that the World Cup was ours’. But I never said that. Those who lost out attacked FIFA<br /><br /><b>[q: Would nothing have happened <b>[to you]</b> then if England and the USA had won?]</b> That is clear. The police actions, including press attacks, would not have taken place. They wanted to eliminate me and they got their wish<br /><br /><b>[q: But there were some things done that were bad, as has been demonstrated…]</b> Yes, yes, but those leaders have committed infractions outside of <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>, in their respective confederations, especially in South America and North America. Nobody was tried in Switzerland. There is talk of FIFA-gate but that is wrong. People should have said confederation-gate<br /><br /><b>[q: Did you feel betrayed by people you trusted?]</b> Naturally, but I can’t be responsible for people who I did not choose. It was the confederations who chose them. We had installed more moral control in 2012, but <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> eliminated that with their general secretary at the head… and he is now president of FIFA<br /><br /><b>[q: What did you think when things began to go wrong at <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>?]</b> On the morning of May 27, I met the political intervention at a five-star hotel in Zurich 06:00, with American journalists present. The roof fell in on me. Thirty days after my re-election as president, the American justice system said that <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> was a mafia and had to be destroyed. It was the end of a dream<br /><br /><b>[q: They knocked on the door of your hotel room that early in the morning?]</b> I was unaware of anything, but the Swiss government knew about it<br /><br /><b>[q: There are two dates which stand out among everything that happened: the day dollar bills were thrown at you during a press conference and the day the police entered your office during an executive meeting, right?]</b> The hardest was the press conference, when an artist from England appeared and threw the money. We controlled the entrance and failed. The other thing, the day they entered my office, I wanted to help because I was not involved. It was a consequence of the crimes of others. That day, I had to give a press conference and I told the police that. They told me it was okay to do it, but I had to be accompanied by them. Could you imagine if I had appeared with the police?<br /><br /><b>[q: Do you not think that <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> lived beyond its means in terms of food, luxury hotels, high-end cars, etc?]</b> Yes that could be the case, but what I did wrong was the decision in the duration of the terms of office. My family told me many times, especially after the World Cup in Brazil, that I should leave. <a href="michel-platini.html">Platini</a> was the chosen one <b>[to replace me]</b>, but suddenly he said he didn’t want it. The rest of the confederations told me they hadn’t prepared a substitute. Luxury cars were something our sponsors demanded. The president and members of the executive had to have luxury cars. It was normal. When I started as president, <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> had a debt of 60 million dollars. When I left in 2015, we had 2 billion dollars in reserves and 1.4bn dollars in money, which has been used for the development of football, not other things<br /><br /><b>[q: Do you sleep soundly every night?]</b> Yes, without problems. At the time of the suspension, I couldn’t sleep but now I can<br /><br /><b>[q: Do you continue to fight to prove your innocence?]</b> Of course. Morally and from the legal aspect, I don’t know what I could do<br /><br /><b>[q: A key person in everything that happened around your departure was <a href="michel-platini.html">Platini</a>. What happened to him and his 2m euros?]</b> It is the famous subject of the 2m euros as part of a verbal contract. We paid his salary, which appeared on the books of <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>. When we were suspended, he wanted to be president and went to court. He wanted to be separate from me in the struggle to prove his innocence. He wanted to go the fastest way, but now we are still in the same situation<br /><br /><b>[q: Did you feel betrayed by <a href="michel-platini.html">Platini</a>?]</b> <a href="michel-platini.html">Platini</a> presented his case to the French justice system. Neither the Swiss justice system nor <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>’s administration itself said anything because everything appeared on the books. Nobody said anything. No member of <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> filed a complaint. I have asked for my case and <a href="michel-platini.html">Platini</a>’s to be resolved at once. I think that by the end of the year, everything will be resolved, but it is strange that the sports justice system is slower<br /><br /><b>[q: Have you felt persecuted?]</b> No, no. The subject is still open, but there was no basis for it. The case opened three years ago and there’s still nothing. There is no logical reason to intervene in the financial aspects of the agreement with Platini<br /><br /><b>[q: Do you like the current <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> regime of <a href="gianni-infantino.html">Gianni Infantino</a>?]</b> I can’t say if I like it or not because I have only met him twice in the month of March, after his election. The problems with <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> haven’t been resolved. He doesn’t want to talk to me. Only the lawyers speak and I think that is a lack of respect. Thing aren’t going well, but I can’t say if it is very good or bad<br /><br /><b>[q: Do you consider yourself innocent of everything you are accused of?]</b> Naturally, yes. The ethics committee of <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> told the press at all times that my issue was not corruption and commercial or economic misconduct, something that is incomprehensible when you take charge of an organisation like <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> that has nothing and you leave them with billions. I have never been investigated for corruption. It hurts me that my granddaughter at school was singled out and had problems with her classmates because they told her that her grandfather was a bad man. That hurt me. There is no reason for that<br /><br /><b>[q: Did Blatter make money as president?]</b> Sure, but my father in his day told his three children that we should never take money that we didn’t personally earn. The Blatter family pays its debts and have never given money to third parties to benefit us. I have helped people with my money<br /><br /><b>[q: Was <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> a mafia like people said?]</b> No. Those who said that must apologise<br /><br /><b>[q: Has football given Blatter more or has Blatter given football more?]</b> Football has given more to me, but I still want to give something. It has given me a wonderful life, but I also worked hard for it. It is something exceptional. I consider myself a missionary of football because football needs missionaries. What I have done is develop it in the whole world. The organisation that I made is my contribution to the sport. I think I made football better<br /><br /><b>[q: Was your <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> a credible organisation?]</b> <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> wasn’t a mafia. It was individual people who were impossible to control. When I started in <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>, there were 11 people working there and now there are 800. In football, there were no problems because there was no money. Maybe we could change the basic organisation, with a code of rules being given to a party on the outside<br /><br /><b>[q: What do you regret?]</b> Not listening to my family when they told me to leave. At 62, people retire, but I spent 17 more years working for <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>. I’ve worked for more than 40 years in football, surrounded by young people and that’s how I felt. My feelings are positive<br /><br /><b>[q: A few days ago, you said you didn’t like draws in European club competitions… are there hot balls?]</b> I shouldn’t talk about that topic. It is very delicate. A president should never intervene in the draws. It is always possible to prepare things, so it is dangerous for a president of a competition to draw balls. We never did it at <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>. You must always be a neutral person<br /><br /><b>[q: Do you still follow <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>?]</b> Of course. I’m still an honorary member of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, something given to me by <b>[Alfredo]</b> Di Stefano. When I played amateur football in Switzerland, <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> were the most popular team and Don Alfredo was my idol. I managed to get my team to change kits and wear white for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. Later, while working for <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>, I was invited to a <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> game by Mr Bernabeu too</p>
