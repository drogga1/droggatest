  <p><b>[Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold knows Manchester City tried to target him in the Champions League]</b> I guess Man City looked at it and <b>[felt]</b> I’m the weak link. Maybe that gave me that underdog mentality and <b>[I]</b> tried to prove them wrong. That’s what I went out to try and do – to go and prove them wrong and show them I’m not the weak link in the team. I think over the two legs I tried my best and did my best to win my personal battles and help us win the tie.<br /><br />You look forward to playing these types of games, these types of opponents and testing yourself when you can. I got the opportunity to do that over the two legs and I tried to do the right things. Hopefully I came out on top and I hope everyone sees it that way as well</p>

I am happy to get the chance to play whenever I get the chance and it is down to the manager’s trust and the trust he has shown in me. Every time he has trusted me to play, especially in the big games, I try to show why he has trusted me and I try to do him and the team proud.</p>

I want to challenge myself and test myself against the best players in the world and there are not many people better than the likes of Ronaldo. It will be a huge test for everyone and hopefully we come out on top.<br /><br />You have to admit he’s an unbelievable player and he’s done exceptional things in the game. The numbers that he does season in, season out are absolutely unbelievable, but come May 26 we’ll be looking to stop him and the rest of Real Madrid. You’ve just got to focus on the game and if he’s a direct opponent you have to see what the strengths and weaknesses are and use them to your advantage</p>

  <p><b>[Trent Alexander-Arnold was given slightly special treatment following his World Cup call-up]</b> I found out this morning, just before we came out to Marbella. The manager came and spoke to me just as we were getting on the plane. He asked me if I knew anything about the squad or anything yet. I said, ‘no’ and he said, ‘Have you got anything planned around the time of the World Cup?’ I was like, ‘No, no holidays or anything…’. He said to me, ‘OK, good… You’re in the squad!’. It was a really proud moment. On England’s behalf, it was nice of them to let the manager tell me.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool youngster Trent Alexander-Arnold says that Cristiano Ronaldo may be one of football’s all-time greats, but he is not perfect]</b> He’s one of the best players ever. He’s done unbelievable things in the game, but he’s got weaknesses as well, as every player has. On Saturday we’ll try to exploit them and stop him from doing what he does best, to stop him from scoring.<br /><br />It is not just a one-man team either. They’ve got other threats too and unbelievable squad depth. Even coming off the bench they’ve got world-class players, so it will be tough for everyone on the pitch and everyone will have the task of a direct opponent who is world class. It will be tough, but we’re excited for it.</p>

Somewhere I want to stay for the rest of my career is Liverpool. It’s what I’ve always dreamed of. Liverpool are special. It’s completely down to the fans. Whether we are winning or losing we always have their love. I remember Istanbul <b>[the 2005 Champions League final]</b>. Only Liverpool could fight back from 3-0 down. The players said they could hear You’ll Never Walk Alone at half-time. Not many teams’ fans would still be there, singing their hearts out at 3-0 down, after making a long trip to Turkey. A lot of teams’ fans might have left early, tried to get an early flight home, but not Liverpool fans, we stay to the end.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold has claimed that he has more trouble keeping tabs on Wilfred Zaha than either Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> On the day, I’d say Zaha was the hardest. Just his athleticism. You can’t get the ball off him, hard to tackle, fast, skilful, can score goals, set them up, a match-winner. With Neymar and Ronaldo, you can see they are very intelligent players, people who know their trade, different movements, but they never got much of the ball against us. Obviously Zaha is not at a level of Ronaldo and Neymar, but for me on the day Zaha was probably the hardest.<br /><br /><b>[Jordan Henderson]</b> is a great role model for everybody in the city. Off the pitch, he’s quite quiet. As soon as he crosses that white line, he’s a different person, he’s very passionate. He’ll scream and shout and encourage, do everything he can to win. That’s something we all look up to as our captain, to lead us out on to the pitch, lead us to victory and that’s what he does. He’s a born winner. I want to become captain one day. That’s definitely a dream of mine. I hope with dedication, the right advice and the hard work that still needs to be put in that one day I might achieve that dream of becoming captain, something that me and my family will be very proud of if it comes</p>

  <p><b>[Trent Alexander-Arnold admits to living the dream at Liverpool]</b> Yeah, definitely. To play for Liverpool is the dream, the aim, and I can’t see it changing to be fair. As long as possible I want to have that relationship with Liverpool, to be a Liverpool player. To say I have done that for the whole of my career is something I have dreamed of being able to say.<br /><br />The club brought in quality players. There’s a lot more squad depth, and there are world class players all across the pitch. Looking at the season so far, there have been a lot of rotations. It’s not just going to be 11 players that are successful, it’s the whole team, it’s 20, 25 of us that need to play our part and need to keep the momentum up<br /><br />We’re still in three of the competitions, so we’ll aim for all three of them, but we’re not just in them to have fun, put on a show, we’re there to win. We’re not a team that likes to lose or even likes to draw. Every game we want to win. You know it would mean a lot to the fans if we did win the league. We want to do it, everyone wants to do it in their career, but it’s important to stay short-focused, focus on the next game, because that’s what is going to stop you, one bad result. At the end of the season if you miss out by one point you will look back to where you went wrong, and that could be a game in October that you should have won and only got a draw. The best chance we have of being successful is to not slip up and keep working hard to get three points on the board</p>

  <p><b>[Alexander-Arnold: Derby win will give Liverpool confidence for festive period]</b> You’re not smiling! I should be to be fair! Emotions get the best of you, especially in games like this. Everybody probably thought we’d settled for the draw but we’ve shown this season that we dig deep many a time and come up with the goods late on. We’ve done it again! It’s something you dream of. It’s very special to play in the Merseyside derby and especially win. It’s one that all the players will remember for a long time and hopefully the fans will as well because we’ve dominated the fixture for so long and we’ve extended it. So it’s something we’ve got to be proud of and hopefully it will give us momentum to go into this Christmas run, which will be tough for us, and hopefully we’ll get a few more results like this<br /><br /><b>[Moments such as Origi’s header, or Riyad Mahrez’s penalty miss for City at Anfield back in October, feel so pivotal]</b> They’re massive. But it’s important for us to stay in the game. Keeping a clean sheet gives us the foundation to go and do these things. It’s massive for us. I think we’ve shown with PSG at home and then Chelsea away and now Everton - three times this season - that something that we’re doing is staying in games and then producing in the last minutes<br /><br /><b>[On Divock Origi]</b> He probably hasn’t played as much as he’s wanted to and not been in and around the squad. But the gaffer showed why he’s still putting him in. He’s come on and missed a massive chance but repaid us all with a goal last minute. After the miss it’s easy to put your head down and settle for a point. But it’s a credit to his character and his mentality to be in the right position. I think many people wouldn’t have been in position to follow up but he’s gambled and it has worked out for us</p>

  <p><b>[Alexander-Arnold warns Arsenal ahead of Anfield visit]</b> We have shown we’re tough to beat and not only that, we’re tough to score past. Not many teams come here and can score past us. We have kept a lot of clean sheets, especially at home. It’s something we pride ourselves on as defenders and throughout the whole team; we come off happy when we’ve got a clean sheet. That’s the foundation we’ve got to lay, then provide the balls for the attackers to go and do what they do best, scoring us goals. As long as everyone does their part - the attackers score the goals and the defenders keep the clean sheets - then you can’t go too wrong. That’s the formula for us at the minute.<br /><br />We’ve got another game in a few days, against a tough opponent <b>[Arsenal]</b>. They showed that only a few weeks ago when we played them at the Emirates <b>[in a 1-1 draw]</b>. The festive period is very tough on the legs and the mind - it’s important to rest, recover and be able to be available for selection again, which is the main thing. That boosts the team. If everyone is up for selection it makes training more competitive and makes everyone work harder for the position, and essentially makes us all better players, which is the most important thing. That’s how we’re going to be successful, to push ourselves</p>

  <p><b>[The rise of Trent Alexander-Arnold at Liverpool]</b> I remember when I was a kid and I was in the stands. I was speechless then and I am speechless now! It’s very tough to describe. Not many people will experience it, but you feel so lucky and privileged to be able to play in these games, and to be part of such an amazing club and such an amazing atmosphere. These nights are incredible<br /><br />It was an unbelievable year. It was something that me and my family are very proud of. Obviously when you’re very young, you dream of those sorts of occasions. I’m very grateful they have happened, and now I want to focus on getting more of them<br /><br />I saw Gerrard and <b>[Jamie Carragher]</b> do it when I was young. I always wanted to be them<br /><br />I always supported Liverpool. My whole family did! I started playing football with my mates and my brothers, in the playground or the park or the front garden. It was just about enjoying it, having a good time playing. I wanted to play all the time. Then I started playing Sunday League football, and obviously from there you move into academies, and that’s when you realise that’s where you want to be<br /><br />I was probably 13 or 14 when I realised I had a chance to make it. That’s when I realised that a bit of education had to be sacrificed in order to become a footballer. I’d miss some lessons to go training, miss some afternoons, which was difficult for me and my family because we were so focused on me getting good results in exams and things like that. But it’s good that I had the support and the backing of my parents especially, to have the faith in me to hopefully see my dreams come true. That’s something that I’m really thankful for. Some parents could have said ‘no, it’s not possible, you have to focus on school first and foremost’ but we came up with a plan to catch up on schoolwork, to do extra homework or to stay in during lunch and break-times, and those sacrifices were all worth it<br /><br />In all honesty <b>[the rise]</b> is something that has surprised me. But it is something that I always wanted. To be a Premier League player is something that not everyone can say, even some of the best players in the world can’t say that!</p>

He’s shown that many times already for us<br /><br />He’s an incredible player and a really good person off the pitch as well, which is something that’s important for any team and especially us because we like to have a good team bond and he’s fitted in straight away and shown that he can adapt as well.

  <p><b>[Trent Alexander-Arnold has revealed that his record-breaking performance against Watford was down to a pre-match plan]</b> Obviously it’s every full-back’s dream to provide assists and to get three in a game is probably not something I’ll get the privilege of saying too often. But I’m happy to be able to provide the team with chances to score and credit to the lads for taking them, especially Virg with his two goals, who’s shown that he’s a real aerial threat. It was one of them where maybe their wingers weren’t probably that enthusiastic in tracking us and if the lads got the ball out wide to me and Robbo, that maybe we could provide crosses in and that’s the way it worked. I think especially first half we had a lot of freedom down the sides and we tried to provide as many balls into the box as we could for the lads. We had a bit more of an aerial threat with Sadio being so good in the air and Divock <b>[Origi]</b> coming into the team, who’s a big lad, so it was important for us to give them service and that’s what we did.<br /><br />I think the main thing for us going into the game was to enjoy it and I think it’s not very often where players are in this position that they’re fighting for a league title, so a lot of the lads it’s our first time of doing it so we all just want to enjoy. We want to embrace it as much as we can, go with the flow and hopefully pick up results when we can and that’s what we tried to do today: just enjoy it, go out there and play fluid. That was the main thing for us, to get back into a rhythm and that’s what we did. It looked really good and it felt really good to be out there. We know that it is one game at a time, but right now we are top of the league. It’s something to be proud of - not many players can say that they are at this point of the season. There’s 10 games left now so I think the fans know we need as much support as possible and hopefully we can put in performances like this and we can give back to them by bringing results and performances like today</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool’s Alexander-Arnold aiming to be a legend like former England star Ashley Cole]</b> When I was younger I was always a defensive centre-mid player - someone who liked to get on the ball and make things happen. But now it is up to the manager <b>[Jurgen Klopp]</b>. I am happy to play wherever the boss wants me. At the moment he sees me as a full-back and I am happy there. It is important to bring in different dimensions to the position. When I was growing up Ashley Cole came in and showed that you don’t just have to be a defender. You can go forward and attack. He showed what full-backs can be. The dream is to win everything possible for my club and country. I want to be a legend for Liverpool and England. Hopefully one day I can be captain for them both.<br /><br />There is not so much a nervous tension, just eagerness to get it going. Not until four or five games left will we start to look forward a little. It is important right now to stay focused. At times you can feel the supporter’s expectations. We know Liverpool fans are so passionate. We can hopefully give them performances that they can go home and talk about the next day. That is the main thing for us - to give them a reason to come back. We know how hard it is to win a league title. You have to be consistent across a full season. Quite a few of the lads have never been in this position before, including myself. It is important for us to enjoy it, learn from it and just see how it goes</p>

  <p><b>[In-form Sadio Mane has been billed as world class]</b> He’s a world-class player and he showed that again. It was a special first goal and great movement for the second goal, I think credit goes to Mo for picking him out. But especially the first one, he did fantastically to get the finish away<br /><br />It’s important that the strikers don’t just feel that they are under pressure to get the goals for us and it’s important that other positions can do that as well. So, for us, it’s all about contribution and the more goals we score the better chances we have of winning games. That’s the way we are looking at it now<br /><br /><b>[On Liverpool’s performance against Bayern as a whole]</b> It was massive for us. To obviously get the clean sheet at Anfield was big for us and we knew that coming here and getting a few goals would make it very difficult for them to go through, so the main aim for us was to come here and put a few <b>[chances]</b> away. We spoke about the game, coming here and being brave and not folding under the pressure. I think it’s probably what they are used to. But, like I said, the main thing was for us to come here, put pressure on them and try to hit them on the counter - and that’s what we did, we punished them</p>

These are the ones that maybe go unnoticed during the season but they’re vitally important for us. We’ll probably look back at the end of the season and think that - whatever the outcome may be - that this game was important for us<br /><br />The full week was tough. We went down at home to Burnley, it was tough going to Bayern and then conceding a late equaliser at Fulham was tough. Mentall we’ve been put through a lot of tests this week but we’ve come out with three wins and that’s all you can ask for from the lads. We’re a force to be reckoned with</p>

  <p><b>[Trent Alexander-Arnold has hailed the impact of England head coach Gareth Southgate]</b> I think I first met him when I was about 15 or 16 in the England setup and he would always go out of his way to say hello to you and make sure he knew the young players who were coming through. It’s always nice to feel like you’re known with senior managers, and at the time he was the U21s manager so it was nice to feel as if he knew who you were and how you were playing at your club. That gave you a bit more motivation to be one of his players and nowadays he’s the senior manager and it’s something that young players can hope for a bit more as well.<br /><br />He’s incredible, someone who’s really honest and he understands what it’s like to be on the playing side of it. He understands the pressure that comes with it, especially with the national team. He helped take that off us, in the summer especially, and I think that’s one of the reasons why we did so well because he managed it perfectly and we were able to escape the pressures. It’s something that really helped us.<br /><br />The World Cup was really good, really positive, and at the same time we still know that there’s room for improvement. And that’s the exciting thing about the future of the country, that there are so many young players coming through and they’re getting their chance to show that on big stages. The manager’s giving young players chances and I think if everything goes to plan it will be a really good few years coming up</p>

We went up the other end and it was very fortunate, but a goal is a goal and a win is the most important thing we wanted - and that’s what we got<br /><br />It was tough, they are a really top side and they might feel like they deserved a little bit more but we showed we wanted it more and that we’re a top side.

The quality you see looking around the changing room is frightening<br /><br />It’s something I’m massively proud of, being able to play for Liverpool. Something I’ve always wanted to do and want to always do. I think the main thing for fans is the effort you give for the club. They never want to see a player who thinks they’re too big for the club.

  <p><b>[Alexander-Arnold hails <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s leader]</b> Unbelievable. Just everything about him in every way. His man management, as a person, as a manager. Just unbelievable<br /><br />He’s the same person, because I feel as though in those interviews, when you see him on the camera, you can see that he’s a loving person. You can see that he’s someone who cares about the people around him. He cares about his family, he cares about his players, he cares about his staff. He treats everyone as equals. He treats the captain the same as he would a young player. People probably have a conception of him as maybe being very emotional, heart on the sleeve. Which he is to an extent, but he knows how to control it in ways that are beneficial to everyone around him. He knows what needs to be said and what tone it needs to be said in, at the right time</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s Alexander-Arnold opens up on his path to stardom]</b> <b>[My family]</b> sacrificed a lot for me to be able to play football when I had to. It must have been difficult for an older brother who was missing out on football because of his younger brother, and likewise a younger brother who isn’t really allowed to enjoy the same freedom in football as us, because he has to miss certain games to come and watch me play<br /><br />It was intense juggling both <b>[school and football]</b>. But for me and my family, education was just as important, if not more, because the likelihood of making it as a footballer was so slim. For most lads of my age, it wouldn’t work out - those were just the statistics - but I always dreamt of football and felt it was a realistic option if I worked hard enough. It wasn’t as if I was overly confident that I would make it; it was just I never thought I wouldn’t<br /><br />I used to show too much frustration, anger and disappointment. I had to learn to make things right on the pitch rather than beating myself up and letting my head go down. At that age, you’re only playing two or three times a week. I wanted to play more than that<br /><br />You adapt. <b>[The fame is]</b> all part and parcel of what I do. As a kid, that’s all you ever want: for people to want your autograph, to want their picture taken with you. I dreamt of this life, you know. But then there are times when you need to escape from that.

  <p><b>[Trent Alexander-Arnold says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s progress under <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has been astonishing]</b> For me, it’s the progression we’ve made over the last three or four years and the strides we’ve made from being where we were to where we are now, it is massive. As a player, an individual and as a team, the progression we’ve all made is astonishing really. Obviously the manager is a big part of that, and the staff and everyone - the whole club in general has come on leaps and bounds. It’s something to be proud of. Over the lockdown it was a good chance to know that we’ve still got a lot of potential to unlock and we can still get better, which is what we strive to do. Thinking about what we’ve achieved motivates us to go and do those things again.<br /><br />Just thinking back to when I was a kid and how that motivated me; seeing the parade always motivated me to want to achieve those things. In 10 or 15 years, the younger generation of today will grow up and hopefully use our success as motivation to want to achieve those kinds of dreams and goals, and know these things are possible with enough hard work. For us, we want to inspire a generation to come through and keep the success of the club going</p>

We train every day with no fans so I imagine we might be able to adapt quite quickly to it. The first game might be strange but we’ll get used to it, then everyone will find it normal.<br /><br />You can see from the powerful messages from everyone - from people with massive platforms and the amazing amounts of numbers in protests - that a lot of people want change.

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> defender Trent Alexander-Arnold wants to use his profile to promote greater equality in society]</b> Racism as a whole is not only the person that it is directed to. Just because I haven’t been directly racially abused doesn’t mean I haven’t felt racially abused, I feel the pain they feel. It’s a community feeling, if you say it to one person, you say it to everyone. Maybe I put pressure on myself because I know that’s the right thing to do. It’s what I believe in. I want to make sure I’m educating people and be a role model. I’ve got a big platform, I know a lot of kids look up to me. It’s not just about being a role model on the pitch. I want to be someone who feels as though I’ve made a change in the way that people think. At the end of my career I want to look back that I influenced a generation, someone who made a change in the way people think. If I get through my career and I haven’t done that then I’d see that as a failure on my part<br /><br />There’s not enough equality within the system. For that to change we need black people in the boardrooms, we need people in there with a voice. We need equality from physios and kitmen, all the way up into the boardroom. We need everyone to have an opportunity. If two people are evenly deserving of a job, more times than not it will go to the white person, maybe subconsciously it happens. No one is asking to be given freebies. We want everyone to have an equal opportunity so when you are going into an interview you feel as though you are being judged on the right things. Not your skin colour or where you’re from, you are judged on your CV and how good a coach you are</p>

  <p><b>[Alexander-Arnold speaks out against racism with Black Lives Matter boots for Merseyside derby]</b> ‘Do your talking on the pitch’. I’ve always loved that sentiment - but now we need to speak up in other ways as well. Tonight my boots will carry the message Black Lives Matter. It can no longer just be our feet where we express ourselves. We have to use our profile, the platforms we have and the spotlight that shines on us to say, it’s time for meaningful change. The system is broken, it’s stacked against sections of our society and we all have a responsibility to fix it. Black people are viewed differently. We face discrimination in actions but also in thought. It’s more than just violence and abuse. Opportunity in life is restricted if you look a certain way. How can that be in 2020?<br /><br />We are pre judged on skin colour rather than character and personality. We then have to prove these misconceptions wrong! Why? Why is it my responsibility to correct an ignorant perception?<br /><br />Sadly so many in the black community have to face this each and every day - but I also have hope. Hope that the world is awake in this moment. Finally willing to learn. So while we have this opportunity, where people are listening, let’s speak, let’s educate, let’s campaign and let’s promote the message that better education brings change. This is the moment of change. This is the moment to say enough is enough. This is the moment to make sure it stops now. Racism is a fire that is now burnt out.</p>

  <p><b>[Alexander-Arnold says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> embodies <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and made dreams come true]</b> To think back to where the club was when he took over to now, all the players and what level we were at whether he bought us or helped us come up from the academy, the things he’s done to the whole club have been mind-blowing. To change the whole club, to change everyone from doubters to believers, to get everybody thinking the same way, believing the same way and having the same dreams. He just embodies the whole club. Even without being from the city, the country and being local, he just clicks with the club. He does it with every person - the fans, the staff and the players. You’ve got to respect the things he does. Every person who has been involved with him can only thank him as much as possible. The way he develops the people around him to making their dreams come true and helping them do what they want is amazing. He is someone who will always be special to the club and to me personally<br /><br />If you can imagine your ultimate dream and being so, so close to it - two steps away from it really - and someone saying: ‘You need to wait over 100 days then you might get it’. It was quite frustrating. But the league position hasn’t changed, our mentality hasn’t changed and that is to win every game, push boundaries, break records, win the league and be remembered. You have to wait so long to win the league, then when you do it, you have to wait so long to celebrate it properly. The things we see on that day, though, will hopefully be things we will never forget.</p>

It was when I was around 18 and he asked me ‘When do you retire? Maybe when you’re around 34 or 35.’ That’s 17 years. So, you’ve only got 17 attempts to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, 17 attempts to win the Champions League or any other trophy.

The first try ended in a Champions League final defeat. The second, we missed the title by one point, but became champions of Europe. This season, we’re about to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. So, I’m already thinking I’ve only got 14 more chances. Even though you can play hundreds of games, the fact is you only get a few attempts at silverware. I really pour everything into each season and focus on the here and now.<br /><br />It doesn’t help to think about the future and winning five or six trophies or whatever because you’re then losing sight of the opportunity in front of you to do something special.
