  <p><b>[Alexander-Arnold speaking on his favourite moment of 2018]</b> I think I would have to say the smiles on my family’s faces when I played for England in Russia. Not many people can say their family has seen them play at a World Cup. I feel I have been very lucky. When you are growing up you have dreams of being a footballer, perhaps even playing for the club you support, and I am living that dream</p>

  <p><b>[Trent Alexander-Arnold believes Liverpool will become unstoppable once they secure their first piece of silverware under manager Jurgen Klopp]</b> This team is good enough to win leagues, to win Champions Leagues. We’ve shown that across the last two seasons especially and we just need to get over the line now. I’m sure as soon as we get one, we’ll be unstoppable and that’s the focus for us - becoming a formidable team that is unbreakable.<br /><br /><b>[Alexander-Arnold, 20, thinks Liverpool are ready to take on the challenge of playing in another final]</b> This time we know what it’s all about, we understand everything around the game so we’ll be more prepared in that respect. We’re a more complete team. During the course of this season, we’ve shown a variety of ways to win and to conduct ourselves. When we score first, we’re very hard to break down. If we need a late goal, we can produce it. If we need to manage a period of a game and take the sting out of it, we know what to do. If we’re not at 100 per cent, Spurs can hurt us, but we will be leaving everything we’ve got on that pitch</p>

We’re used to how he plays and how Tottenham play as a team. It’s not about us singling out players. As a team they’ve showed their quality.<br /><br />We play with a certain style and we’ll try not to change that for any team. If we sit back and let them get on top of us, that’s when they’re at their best. We need to be on top and in their half; that will work for us tomorrow. Whatever happens, we’ll try to play our way</p>

I’m speaking for everyone when I say massive thanks to Hendo for leading us here. The team is always his first thought: none of us do that more for Liverpool than Hendo. He shows on a daily basis that he deserves to be skipper: how he carries himself in training and around the place, the respect he has for everyone, whether it’s Mo Salah or the cleaning staff. <b>[Henderson]</b> doesn’t see anyone as bigger or more important than anyone else and that’s a lesson to learn not just in football but life too. He is so valuable to the club and anyone at Melwood could speak for hours about just that.</p>

  <p><b>[When asked how important it would be to win the Nations League Finals]</b> Massive. It would be a dream come true. You don’t expect to be in these situations and you never know if you ever will be again, so I think for now I’m trying to soak it up, give everything that I can and hopefully that will be achieved in the next few days. If you look at everyone in the squad, in one way or another, they’ve got something to be proud of this season. Whether it’s Manchester City, who have won the vast majority of trophies, or us winning the trophy the other night or the Tottenham players who’ve also had an incredible season and have pushed everyone so far. The whole squad has had a really good season altogether and I’m sure we’ll be looking to top it off over the next week and hopefully we’ll leave Portugal with another trophy.<br /><br /><b>[Alexander-Arnold said Tottenham players were among the first in the squad to congratulate the Liverpool contingent for their triumph at the Wanda Metropolitano]</b> The reception has been unbelievable. They’re really happy for us and positive. For the Tottenham lads it must be tough for them, but they’ve come and congratulated us and were one of the first to do it. Even if it was the other way around you have to put what happened with our clubs to one side and focus on winning something for your country. We’re a team now, a few days ago we weren’t, but now we are so we need to recognise that and if we pull together for the same aim then we’ve got a great chance of reaching where we want</p>

  <p><b>[Trent Alexander-Arnold is looking to become ‘the best right-back in the world’ while also taking the captain’s armband with Liverpool and England]</b> I am fortunate to have the people around me who understand the balance between letting me get comfortable, praising me too much and feeding that hunger that needs to be there in terms of wanting to strive to be better, wanting to be one of the best players in the world, the best right back in the world, being the first name on the team-sheet, wanting to be Liverpool captain, wanting to be England captain. That’s the main thing for me. It’s not selfishness to think this is what I have done it is about what the team has done and is doing. It is we and not I. We have achieved things as a team. To be recognised as one of the best in the world you have to have silverware behind you. That’s important to us as a team to be recognised as one of the best.<br /><br /><b>[That success marked a first for Klopp at Anfield, while it also brought a seven-year barren run on the silverware front to a close]</b> It is the elite competition in Europe and the best compete in it. It shows the quality in the team to final twice in a row. Istanbul feels like yesterday and we want to create the same kind of memories for the next generation that are coming through</p>

I try to make sure I am there for them and they know they can come and speak to me. Hopefully they know I have been in their situation and I know what they’re going through - coming in and out of teams, being rotated, not getting the minutes you want, finding it too hard or intense, or struggling with fitness. I have been through it all. I hope they understand that I have, that I am always here for them, and that I am always available for them to come and talk.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>’s absence in the aftermath of his involvement at the Africa Cup of Nations will further test a team that failed to win while on tour in the United States]</b> Effectively our season starts on Sunday and we’ve got a massive game against one of the best teams in the world. Coming in off pre-season, it’s going to be tough and intense, but we know we can match them, we’ve shown that over the years. It will be tough, but I am sure we will put in a good effort</p>

As full-backs we get forward as much as we can, as well as defend. And we want to keep more clean sheets. We kept a lot last season, but we can get better. We did something special last season but none of that matters now. We’ve got to focus on this season and hopefully we can go one better in the league</p>

  <p><b>[Trent Alexander-Arnold is confident <a href="adrian.html">Adrian</a> can fill the void left by Alisson between the sticks for Liverpool over the next few weeks]</b> <b>[His experience]</b> is the main thing, he knows what he is doing. He’s played a load of games, so he knows what it is about. The reception he got <b>[on Friday]</b>, I think he feels as though the supporters are already behind him. Obviously when a keeper has to come off, it’s never too promising, so yes, I think everyone needs to get their head around <b>[the fact]</b> that he probably will be our keeper for the next few weeks and if so, then we have to live with that, embrace that and I’m sure he will learn from us. We will be able to make good connections with him and I think a lot of the lads have made bonds with him already because he’s such a good lad off the pitch. He’s a great lad to have around and obviously he is playing now, that is good for him and us<br /><br /><b>[Alexander-Arnold feels a high standard has already been set as the new campaign gets into full swing]</b> I think the lads are back and they have hit the ground running. It’s good for us to have them back and in-form straight away. Obviously Virg popping up with a goal again shows that this season will hopefully replicate last season with everyone chipping in with goals and hopefully the attackers don’t feel that it is just them that need to produce the goals and it is a team effort. So yes, I think, so far so good and of course it’s still early days, but it is good to set the standard we have today</p>

I think Saturday is going to be a different kind of test to the one we faced last week so we’re preparing for that. We did well against them last year, especially at home, and we’ll be looking to do the same kind of thing<br /><br /><b>[Liverpool fell behind in their home meeting with the Gunners in December before Roberto Firmino sparked a remarkable recovery, scoring three times in the convincing victory]</b> I think over the last few seasons, especially at Anfield, we’ve always had high-scoring games <b>[against Arsenal]</b>.

We did well against them last year, especially at home, and we’ll be looking to do the same kind of thing. It helps having the full week and I think for us it’s important to get used to both sides of the game - having not much time to prepare and having a full week. We need to be ready for all of those situations throughout the season and the lads have really adapted well. So early on, playing three games in a week is tough physically and mentally but we’ve done well. Last week was positive, we won all of our games and hopefully we’ll be able to carry that on on Saturday</p>

He’s someone who really helps them play football, understands the way that they want to play, really encourages the team to play out. They are able to hit <b>[it to]</b> him and he’ll be able to hold the ball up. He’s a really tricky player, really strong, fast, quite agile.

Coming up against him is always a tough test but they’re the things that you expect in the Champions League. He’s a great player, probably a little bit underrated in terms of the respect and the plaudits that he gets. But he’s a real fantastic player. I think his team-mates will say the same and the people that come up against him will say how tricky he is to actually nullify. He’s a good player, they’ve got many a good player and we need to be ready for that<br /><br /><b>[Alexander-Arnold admits that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have something to prove having lifted the Champions League trophy last season]</b> A lot of the players that we have are world class players. They know what it takes to win things, what it takes to be successful, so I’m pretty sure we’ll be able to embrace that as a team. I think we have so far this season in the league. We obviously know that last season we did so well so this season we’re up there again. A lot of teams will want to come to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, beat us, play different ways and we know that’s going to be the test for us. But we need to be ready for all types of tests<br /><br />We know that being able to keep clean sheets and being able to win games away from home are massively important - especially in the Champions League when you’ve probably only got one or two chances to beat teams and get results. You’re playing Europe’s elite, you’re going to get fewer chances than you do in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> so it’s about maximising those chances and minimalising the opposition</p>

They had to push me really hard and really far so I wouldn’t break when these challenges came in senior games. If I could watch those sessions back and see how I handled it, I’d be embarrassed about how I acted when I lost. I’d be kicking up a fuss, kicking balls away, shouting at people. They knocked that out of me and taught me how to harness a very strong competitive edge in the right way. They taught me I was a better player when I made it personal between myself and the winger.

  <p><b>[Trent Alexander-Arnold says the setbacks and knockbacks suffered by <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in recent times have made the club stronger]</b> The players that we have in our side have all had failures before, we’ve all had setbacks and knockbacks. We’ve really bounced back from there and got to where we are now and where we are as a team. The biggest example of that is probably the fact that we lost the Champions League final the season before and were able to use that as motivation to get back there and win it the next season. It’s something a lot of teams aren’t capable of, but we’ve showed that we are and we’re able to get better from disappointment<br /><br />Traditionally and historically, the Man Utd-Liverpool game is always massive.

The manager wants us to get forward, he wouldn’t be happy if me and Trent were just stood on the halfway line defending and the back four just stayed where they are.

It is madness but hopefully it inspires the younger generation when they come through these halls and see things like this, it let’s them know that anything is possible.<br /><br />I want to be captain, I’d like to think so in my mind that it could happen. It is not my decision at the end of the day but I try and lead by example everyday, all the time. It is <b>[working]</b> so far. So far, so good. It is mad because you don’t think about these things.<br /><br />You don’t realise you can have your picture at the Academy and you can have things like in and around them building about the trophies you have won and such, but it is a dream come true that these things can happen<br /><br />I want to win everything that is possible for club and country and just try and be a legend. If that is possible, I want to be remembered as someone who was an amazing player, who gave his all on the pitch and someone who made the fans happy, that is the main thing. And when I am finished, I will be able to look back proud at a lot of trophies won</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool’s Alexander-Arnold opens up on his path to stardom]</b> <b>[My family]</b> sacrificed a lot for me to be able to play football when I had to. It must have been difficult for an older brother who was missing out on football because of his younger brother, and likewise a younger brother who isn’t really allowed to enjoy the same freedom in football as us, because he has to miss certain games to come and watch me play<br /><br />It was intense juggling both <b>[school and football]</b>. But for me and my family, education was just as important, if not more, because the likelihood of making it as a footballer was so slim. For most lads of my age, it wouldn’t work out - those were just the statistics - but I always dreamt of football and felt it was a realistic option if I worked hard enough. It wasn’t as if I was overly confident that I would make it; it was just I never thought I wouldn’t<br /><br />I used to show too much frustration, anger and disappointment. I had to learn to make things right on the pitch rather than beating myself up and letting my head go down. At that age, you’re only playing two or three times a week. I wanted to play more than that<br /><br />You adapt. <b>[The fame is]</b> all part and parcel of what I do. As a kid, that’s all you ever want: for people to want your autograph, to want their picture taken with you. I dreamt of this life, you know. But then there are times when you need to escape from that. I need to be a normal 21-year-old who goes home and plays <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> with his mates, sits in his bedroom and just watches TV and does normal things</p>

  <p><b>[Trent Alexander-Arnold says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s progress under <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has been astonishing]</b> For me, it’s the progression we’ve made over the last three or four years and the strides we’ve made from being where we were to where we are now, it is massive. As a player, an individual and as a team, the progression we’ve all made is astonishing really. Obviously the manager is a big part of that, and the staff and everyone - the whole club in general has come on leaps and bounds. It’s something to be proud of. Over the lockdown it was a good chance to know that we’ve still got a lot of potential to unlock and we can still get better, which is what we strive to do. Thinking about what we’ve achieved motivates us to go and do those things again.<br /><br />Just thinking back to when I was a kid and how that motivated me; seeing the parade always motivated me to want to achieve those things. In 10 or 15 years, the younger generation of today will grow up and hopefully use our success as motivation to want to achieve those kinds of dreams and goals, and know these things are possible with enough hard work. For us, we want to inspire a generation to come through and keep the success of the club going</p>

  <p><b>[Alexander-Arnold targets perfect finish from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as Reds seek to smash through 100-point barrier]</b> We’re not training now just to hopefully cross the line, but to win every game we’ve got left. We’ve got nine games and we want to win them all - that’s our aim<br /><br />It will definitely be different. We train every day with no fans so I imagine we might be able to adapt quite quickly to it. The first game might be strange but we’ll get used to it, then everyone will find it normal.<br /><br />You can see from the powerful messages from everyone - from people with massive platforms and the amazing amounts of numbers in protests - that a lot of people want change. I think it’s something that is vitally needed. It’s been way too long, it shouldn’t still be happening in the modern day</p>

It’s something that I’m really thankful for and obviously I have to give thanks to him for them words. I try to be the best player I can be. I think it’s obviously a team game, so it’s about the players I have around me. The players I have in training, the manager, the support I have all around me that enables me to be as good as I can be. Accolades may or may not come in the future, it doesn’t really faze me as much as maybe it does other players</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold wants to use his profile to promote greater equality in society]</b> Racism as a whole is not only the person that it is directed to. Just because I haven’t been directly racially abused doesn’t mean I haven’t felt racially abused, I feel the pain they feel. It’s a community feeling, if you say it to one person, you say it to everyone. Maybe I put pressure on myself because I know that’s the right thing to do. It’s what I believe in. I want to make sure I’m educating people and be a role model. I’ve got a big platform, I know a lot of kids look up to me. It’s not just about being a role model on the pitch. I want to be someone who feels as though I’ve made a change in the way that people think. At the end of my career I want to look back that I influenced a generation, someone who made a change in the way people think. If I get through my career and I haven’t done that then I’d see that as a failure on my part<br /><br />There’s not enough equality within the system. For that to change we need black people in the boardrooms, we need people in there with a voice. We need equality from physios and kitmen, all the way up into the boardroom. We need everyone to have an opportunity. If two people are evenly deserving of a job, more times than not it will go to the white person, maybe subconsciously it happens. No one is asking to be given freebies. We want everyone to have an equal opportunity so when you are going into an interview you feel as though you are being judged on the right things. Not your skin colour or where you’re from, you are judged on your CV and how good a coach you are</p>

  <p><b>[Alexander-Arnold speaks out against racism with Black Lives Matter boots for Merseyside derby]</b> ‘Do your talking on the pitch’. I’ve always loved that sentiment - but now we need to speak up in other ways as well. Tonight my boots will carry the message Black Lives Matter. It can no longer just be our feet where we express ourselves. We have to use our profile, the platforms we have and the spotlight that shines on us to say, it’s time for meaningful change. The system is broken, it’s stacked against sections of our society and we all have a responsibility to fix it. Black people are viewed differently. We face discrimination in actions but also in thought. It’s more than just violence and abuse. Opportunity in life is restricted if you look a certain way. How can that be in 2020?<br /><br />We are pre judged on skin colour rather than character and personality. We then have to prove these misconceptions wrong! Why? Why is it my responsibility to correct an ignorant perception?<br /><br />Sadly so many in the black community have to face this each and every day - but I also have hope. Hope that the world is awake in this moment. Finally willing to learn. So while we have this opportunity, where people are listening, let’s speak, let’s educate, let’s campaign and let’s promote the message that better education brings change. This is the moment of change. This is the moment to say enough is enough. This is the moment to make sure it stops now. Racism is a fire that is now burnt out.</p>

  <p><b>[Alexander-Arnold says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> embodies <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and made dreams come true]</b> To think back to where the club was when he took over to now, all the players and what level we were at whether he bought us or helped us come up from the academy, the things he’s done to the whole club have been mind-blowing. To change the whole club, to change everyone from doubters to believers, to get everybody thinking the same way, believing the same way and having the same dreams. He just embodies the whole club. Even without being from the city, the country and being local, he just clicks with the club. He does it with every person - the fans, the staff and the players. You’ve got to respect the things he does. Every person who has been involved with him can only thank him as much as possible. The way he develops the people around him to making their dreams come true and helping them do what they want is amazing. He is someone who will always be special to the club and to me personally<br /><br />If you can imagine your ultimate dream and being so, so close to it - two steps away from it really - and someone saying: ‘You need to wait over 100 days then you might get it’. It was quite frustrating. But the league position hasn’t changed, our mentality hasn’t changed and that is to win every game, push boundaries, break records, win the league and be remembered. You have to wait so long to win the league, then when you do it, you have to wait so long to celebrate it properly. The things we see on that day, though, will hopefully be things we will never forget.</p>

  <p><b>[Alexander-Arnold hints at long <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> stay]</b> I want every trophy and as many of them as possible. I remember <a href="alex-inglethorpe.html">Alex Inglethorpe</a> breaking it down into a thought process that I’ve never stopped thinking about since. It was when I was around 18 and he asked me ‘When do you retire? Maybe when you’re around 34 or 35.’ That’s 17 years. So, you’ve only got 17 attempts to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, 17 attempts to win the Champions League or any other trophy. As much you think that’s a long time, the reality is you get only 17 tries and there will be failure, which is natural and will reduce that number<br /><br /><b>[Alexander-Arnold, who made his <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> debut in October 2016, added on his ambition]</b> I’ve been in the senior team fully for three seasons. The first try ended in a Champions League final defeat. The second, we missed the title by one point, but became champions of Europe. This season, we’re about to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. So, I’m already thinking I’ve only got 14 more chances. Even though you can play hundreds of games, the fact is you only get a few attempts at silverware. I really pour everything into each season and focus on the here and now.<br /><br />It doesn’t help to think about the future and winning five or six trophies or whatever because you’re then losing sight of the opportunity in front of you to do something special. I know that if you get into that relentless habit, with a great team, a great manager and a great support structure, the chances will automatically be maximised</p>
