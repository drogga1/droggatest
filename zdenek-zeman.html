  <p><b>[Zdenek Zeman criticises the Roma coach]</b> <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> is currently the best coach in the world, even if I hate Tiki-Taka, because I have a very different vision of football. The problem is not him, but those who try to copy him without having the right players. I think <a href="rudi-garcia.html">Rudi Garcia</a> at times focuses too much on possession without seeking more goals</p>

  <p><b>[How Zdenek Zeman has turned <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> strugglers Pescara around once again]</b> All I can do is thank the lads because we only had three training sessions together but they showed that if we dedicate ourselves and if we stay focused we can do well. We broke the spell<br /><br />It doesn’t depend only on us, it depends on how the others do, too. We would need the three squads ahead of us to stall and us to leap forward. Plus, we still have to face (Serie A leader) <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> so we already have one less match available - even though we’ll try to win that one<br /><br /><b>[Zeman said he inherited a squad in poor physical condition]</b> We’re going to have to work on that aspect a lot. The important thing is that the lads don’t think the season is over. I would have liked for them to have come out and given us a hand. I hope we can convince them to return</p>

  <p><b>[on Francesco Totti]</b> <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> is what every child dreams of being when they grow up. A fan that become a champion, a champion that becomes a symbol, a symbol that becomes a legend. Talking about Francesco the footballer is a somewhat banal exercise as he can do anything on the pitch and do it well. Along with <b>[Roberto]</b> Baggio and <b>[Gianni]</b> <a href="gianni-rivera.html">Rivera</a>, he is one of the most outstanding Italian footballers I have ever seen.<br /><br />It isn’t easy to be the king and remain humble. He has stumbled, but knows how to get back up, he has had serious injuries but recovered, and he never gave up. The main thing about football, or what it should be about, is having fun, and for 20 years Francesco has done just that.<br /><br />One day Roma fans can say ‘I was lucky, because for 20 years I was able to watch <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> play,’ and I can count myself among them. But I will also be able to add ‘I coached him twice.’</p>

  <p><b>[Zdenek Zeman says <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> has been forced out of Roma]</b> He did not say he is leaving football. Others have decided for him that he will not play for Roma anymore. I hope Francesco decides to have fun and enjoy himself again. I don’t imagine him going to another Italian club. Abroad, yes. <br /><br />Could he unite with <a href="alessandro-nesta.html">Alessandro Nesta</a> at Miami? I have no idea. I know him. It will have cost him to maintain balance and respect. But I’m not surprised. I know what Francesco has given Roma - he carried them on his shoulders. <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> has made many coaches in recent years; They did not make him</p>

  <p><b>[Respected football manager Zdenek Zeman has shared his belief that <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> are the favourites to go all the way and win the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> title come the end of this season]</b> For me <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> are still the favourites, but if you they make a few errors in games, Lazio are ready to take advantage.<br /><br />In the end I think <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> will win it, but it is not obvious. After eight years without opponents for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, there is balance at the top. Inter are also up there alongside Lazio</p>
