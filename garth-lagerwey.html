  <p><b>[Garth Lagerwey tells about <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> helped him negotiate bringing Nicolas Lodeiro to the Pacific Northwest club]</b> You don’t have body language, it’s harder than it is straight to the face and so he just got frustrated that he couldn’t understand everything that I’m saying. And so he says, ‘Hold on, speak to my friend’, and I said, ‘OK’, and I have no idea what’s happening. And <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> gets on and says, ‘Hi, this is <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a>, how are you?’ And I’m like, ‘Morning, Mr. Suarez, how are you?’ And he was our translator</p>

  <p><b>[Sounders GM Garth Lagerwey not expecting ‘splashy’ signings]</b> I wouldn’t expect a splashy third DP-level signing. Our big investments are in Nico Lodeiro and Raul Ruidiaz. Those guys are the cornerstones we’re building around and certainly we are going to continue to bring in good players…But I don’t anticipate it’s going to be at an impact like a Lodeiro or a Ruidiaz</p>

  <p><b>[Sounders general manager Garth Lagerwey revealed in 2016 that Suarez unexpectedly got on the phone with him as he was negotiating with Lodeiro, and even joked about a future move to Seattle himself]</b> I was talking and Nico’s English is actually pretty, pretty good, but he isn’t always so comfortable on the phone. You don’t have body language, it’s harder than it is straight to the face and so he just got frustrated that he couldn’t understand everything that I’m saying. And so he says, ‘Hold on, speak to my friend,’ and I said, ‘OK,’ and I have no idea what’s happening. And <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> gets on and says, ‘Hi, this is <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a>, how are you?’ And I’m like, ‘Morning, Mr Suarez, how are you?’ And he was our translator. He (Suarez) told me maybe he comes in seven years. That was his quote, so maybe that’s when his contract runs out. I told him we’d love to have him whenever he was ready, but it was just a funny little anecdote along the way</p>
