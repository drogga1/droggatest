  <p><b>[Garth Lagerwey tells about <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> helped him negotiate bringing Nicolas Lodeiro to the Pacific Northwest club]</b> You don’t have body language, it’s harder than it is straight to the face and so he just got frustrated that he couldn’t understand everything that I’m saying. And so he says, ‘Hold on, speak to my friend’, and I said, ‘OK’, and I have no idea what’s happening. And <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> gets on and says, ‘Hi, this is <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a>, how are you?’ And I’m like, ‘Morning, Mr. Suarez, how are you?’ And he was our translator</p>

  <p><b>[Clint Dempsey returned to full Seattle Sounders training for the start of preseason Tuesday]</b> We’ve been pleased with his progress. Attitude has been awesome, he’s worked really hard. He’s now progressed to a point where he’s able to rejoin the team on a regular basis. We still have some steps to get through. We’re excited about what the future may hold.</p>

  <p><b>[Sounders, USMNT lose Jordan Morris for 2018 with ACL tear]</b> We are going to rule him out for the season. We are going to do what is best for Jordan’s career long term. We think he is a Sounder for the long term, he is in the club’s long-term plans. Jordan is part of the Sounders, that has not changed, that will not change. We are going to do what’s best for him long term, which may mean a longer recovery.</p>

  <p><b>[The Seattle Sounders have loaned winger Aaron Kovan to LAFC for the 2018 season]</b> This is an excellent opportunity for Aaron to gain playing experience and further his development as a player with exposure to another club. LAFC provides a new, competitive environment for Aaron and we feel this loan benefits all parties.</p>

  <p><b>[The Seattle Sounders have announced the signing of Peruvian striker Raul Ruidiaz as a designated player from Liga MX side Morelia]</b> We are thrilled to complete the signing of our top designated player target in Raul Ruidíaz. Collectively, we were relentless in our pursuit of Raul because he is a proven difference-maker at the highest levels of the game. Wherever he has played, he has made his teams better, scoring well over 100 professional goals in the process.</p>

  <p><b>[The Seattle Sounders have signed Bournemouth defender Brad Smith on loan]</b> Combined with his background, Brad’s significant speed and versatility on the flanks make our team immediately better for the stretch run of the season. We believe he can help our club continue its climb up the table and into the MLS Cup Playoffs.</p>

  <p><b>[American soccer legend Clint Dempsey announces retirement]</b> As far as I’m concerned, Clint Dempsey is the greatest player in the history of our country. His mark on both our club and the United States men’s national team is indelible, and his hard-earned reputation as a trailblazer for our nation in Europe helped pave the way for generations of future of Americans abroad.</p>

  <p><b>[Sounders GM Garth Lagerwey not expecting ‘splashy’ signings]</b> I wouldn’t expect a splashy third DP-level signing. Our big investments are in Nico Lodeiro and Raul Ruidiaz. Those guys are the cornerstones we’re building around and certainly we are going to continue to bring in good players…But I don’t anticipate it’s going to be at an impact like a Lodeiro or a Ruidiaz</p>

  <p><b>[Seattle Sounders center back Chad Marshall has announced his retirement midway through the 2019 MLS season]</b> Thank you, Chad. It was a privilege to have such a smart, humble player as part of the Sounders for so long, one of the greatest careers for any domestic player in MLS history</p>

  <p><b>[Sounders general manager Garth Lagerwey revealed in 2016 that Suarez unexpectedly got on the phone with him as he was negotiating with Lodeiro, and even joked about a future move to Seattle himself]</b> I was talking and Nico’s English is actually pretty, pretty good, but he isn’t always so comfortable on the phone. You don’t have body language, it’s harder than it is straight to the face and so he just got frustrated that he couldn’t understand everything that I’m saying. And so he says, ‘Hold on, speak to my friend,’ and I said, ‘OK,’ and I have no idea what’s happening. And <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> gets on and says, ‘Hi, this is <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a>, how are you?’ And I’m like, ‘Morning, Mr Suarez, how are you?’ And he was our translator. He (Suarez) told me maybe he comes in seven years. That was his quote, so maybe that’s when his contract runs out. I told him we’d love to have him whenever he was ready, but it was just a funny little anecdote along the way</p>
