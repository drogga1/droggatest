  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah and Alex Morgan have each been named to Time Magazine’s 100 Most Influential People of 2019]</b> Mo Salah is a better human being than he is a football player. And he’s one of the best football players in the world. You’d be hard-pressed to find a professional athlete in any sport less affected by their success or status than Mo, which is incredible because I can’t imagine the kind of pressure that comes with the intensity of adoration he receives. Mo is an iconic figure for Egyptians, Scousers and Muslims the world over, and yet he always comes across as a humble, thoughtful, funny man who isn’t taking any of this too seriously</p>

  <p><b>[What football team does John Oliver support?]</b> My family is from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - both sides. My mum’s family are from Knotty Ash and my dad’s family are from Wirral, so supporting <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was very much not a choice. That was pointed out to me pretty strenuously at an early age. There were other things I could choose in my life, but a team wasn’t one of them! I grew up in <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a> but I grew up there as a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fan.<br /><br />Istanbul was a happy memory. I was in London watching the game and my dad phoned me. He was choking back the tears saying, ‘Remember this day son, remember this day!’ He wasn’t wrong and it was incredible</p>
