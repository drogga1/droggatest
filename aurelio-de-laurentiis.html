Maurizio never answered me <b>[about whether he was staying]</b>. If you close the door in my face, I will politely stay away so as to not disturb your work, but only up to a certain point.

We had already gone from 700 thousand euros to a million and a half. I also once heard him say that for his next contract, he wanted to get rich. Sarri’s declarations of love for the city? I believed it, but then I wondered: ‘What if he was using me as a bank?’.<br /><br /><b>[On Carlo Ancelotti]</b> Ancelotti was a date written in the football universe as if fate had decided it.

Football is an important industry. Without the brakes put on by FIFA and UEFA, which go back to antiquity, it would have even more value. It’s our fault, we are old idiots. There are boring games! Football matches are too long - you fall asleep. You have to play two 30-minute halves with a two or three minute break in the middle of each. If not, what is the coach for?<br /><br /><b>[European club football is due an overhaul]</b> We must change everything. Why doesn’t Europe work? It should be a Europe of England, France, Italy, Germany and Spain. If you make a championship of five nations instead of the Champions League, with the top four of each championship, that’s 20 teams. We only have one match, without going back and forth - the draw would only indicate whether the match it at home or away. On Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays you would play in this new competition. Saturday, Sunday and Monday would be for domestic championships. This new competition would bring in 10 billion euros</p>

I would call it the European Cup and the games would be played on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, thus respecting the placement of the national championships over the weekend<br /><br />It’s all very outdated, we are often confronted with sparring partners.

Should a referee not be held to the same rules? <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> have been denied numerous penalties this season. It’s not just me saying that, but recognised throughout the media. If this chain reaction of errors should turn into a financial loss of €200m, who would pay us back for that? I think top level lawyers would enjoy taking this on. Never say never. Plus, if five, six or seven clubs who were damaged by serious refereeing errors were to decide to stop the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> season? It would perhaps be traumatic, but still an efficient way of breaking the back of this laissez-faire attitude and carelessness<br /><br />The challenge is the very least they could do and is probably already too late. I think two challenges per game, one in each half, would suffice. The coaches have the right to demand verification in the most dubious cases and can also step in front of the monitor with the referee to get a clear explanation for the decision that has been made. That is a sacrosanct right of the coach</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="fabian-ruiz.html">Fabian Ruiz</a>]</b> I paid €30m for <a href="fabian-ruiz.html">Fabian Ruiz</a> and he’s a fantastic player. If some of the European top clubs were to offer €180m (£150m / $194) we can start talking about selling him</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> are open to selling <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Kalidou Koulibaly</a> and <a href="fabian-ruiz.html">Fabian Ruiz</a> this summer]</b> If City or United or <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> showed up with €100m, I would think about it and it is probable that they would leave, always if their will was to leave. I don’t even consider an offer of €60m (£55m/$68m). I am firm on that. If I wanted to win the Scudetto at any cost today I would find myself with three, four hundred million in debt. I look around and see companies at 500, 600 million, less than a billion. I don’t owe anyone a shit<br /><br /><b>[De Laurentiis also confirmed they have entered talks with Spanish winger Jose Callejon about a bumper new extension to his contract]</b> In September, or maybe it was October, I don’t remember well, we talked to each other and I clarified our intentions. I must have changed up the contract for €100,000 or €200,000. That’s enough. He knows the conditions</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> president Aurelio De Laurentiis has confirmed that the club have offered talismanic forward <a href="dries-mertens.html">Dries Mertens</a> a new deal]</b> He is a street urchin. We met for breakfast six months ago, it was a revelation, I discovered a special man, intelligent, mentally sharp, a badass. Renewing the contract for a 33-year-old footballer is not part of our habits, but with <a href="dries-mertens.html">Mertens</a> it was simple, natural. I will say more when he has stopped playing, I would like to find him a role to continue the collaboration</p>

  <p><b>[Aurelio De Laurentiis has accused <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a> of forcing him into a change of management at <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>]</b> He made me angry with the tasteless excuse of money. He forced me to change <b>[head coaches]</b> and still had a two-year deal. In February, he invited me to lunch in Tuscany, close to his house and his wife was there. He didn’t mention stopping and led me on all the way to the day ahead of the last game. That created uncertainties for the club. Three unforgettable seasons? There are other factors: in football the rule of cinema applies where to make a good film you need an excellent director and an excellent producer, they are the parents of the work of genius. Who brought <b>[Edinson]</b> <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Cavani</a> here? And <b>[Walter]</b> <a href="walter-mazzarri.html">Mazzarri</a>?

I chose his serenity, composure, his pleasant closeness. My father was a philosopher, an extremely sweet man. Like Carlo. But signing him, being able to resort to the release clause, I should have told him: ‘Carlo, I don’t think you are made for the type of football they want in Naples, let’s keep the great friendship because football here is different. I introduced you to a city that you now love and that surprised you, better to end it here. Instead, I made the second mistake</p>
