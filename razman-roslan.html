  <p><b>[Razman Roslan and Juliano Mineiro praised their Selangor teammates after a solid 2-0 away win over Kelantan]</b> For me, every player gave their 100% commitment. We knew it won’t be easy going up against Kelantan and the three points we collected are really important to us. Every player who got the chance to play will give their best and for me, Adam gave more than 100% and really helped the team tonight.</p>

  <p><b>[Selangor skipper Razman Roslan has described the Red Giants’ Super League encounter against Pahang this Saturday as a special match for him]</b> Indeed, to me it is a special match as I used to play for and captain Pahang, and won a number of titles with them. But to me, my commitment and responsibilities to Selangor is more important this time around. God willing I will do my best and help Selangor obtain the best result <b>[against Pahang]</b> this Saturday.<br /><br />As we know, Pahang are a formidable side with quality players this season. I hope all of my teammates can give 100% of their commitment and focus throughout the match. Head coach Maniam Pachaiappan’s tactics and strategies will hopefully help us produce the results this Saturday</p>

  <p><b>[Pahang’s goals in their 2-2 draw against Selangor in their Super League match on Saturday were soft goals]</b> <b>[I am]</b> a little disappointed. However I have to thank my teammates for giving their 100% percent commitment. One point is very valuable as it’s never easy to play here. Praise God.<br /><br />Our defence worked very hard tonight, Pahang’s attack was very sharp, and we were forced into working hard and conceding two soft goals. …I’m disappointed, but at the same time also still satisfied <b>[with the result]</b>,<br /><br />Although Selangor were not on many people’s radar before the start of this season, but now that we’re almost at the halfway point in the league, we aim to finish in a top three position in the league</p>

  <p><b>[Selangor captain Razman Roslan has urged former manager Amirudin Shari to settle his teammates’ 2016 bonus]</b> Please discuss the issue of the team’s bonus from last year, YB. Aren’t you going to call for a meeting? The issue of bonus should not affect the players, as this is a matter that should be discussed between the former administration and the new one. I’m sure you’re aware that the new president has settled the wages, now we’re only owed the bonus. I can’t speak too much about this, but can’t we meet sometime?.<br /><br />It’d be better if you ask the FAS president to come see the MB <b>[Menteri Besar]</b> and discuss a solution. Or come see the MB yourself, if you want to take care of your teammates, you’ll only get Internet likes if you ask on social media. I’ve mentioned before that we’re open for discussions, so be it. I’ve arranged it <b>[a meeting]</b> so many times, but in the end I was the one bitten.<br /><br />Please meet me, YB. We haven’t played ping-pong in a while. Or we can have tea, just let me know when you are free.</p>
