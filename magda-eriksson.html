  <p><b>[Magda Eriksson comments on she and her girlfriend <a href="pernille-harder.html">Pernille Harder</a>’s kissing photo in Paris that went viral]</b> We weren’t even aware anyone was taking a photo … I think that’s when I felt the demand for role models in that way, because of how big it was and how many people wrote to me on Instagram saying they looked up to us and how much we’d helped them. That’s when I understood that we’re really powerful together. Before, we hadn’t really seen ourselves as that<br /><br /><b>[Magda Eriksson talks about signing up for Common Goal]</b> We’ve played without privilege and now we are privileged. So now we want to give back to those people who don’t have the same situations we do<br /><br /><b>[Magda Eriksson talks about comming out]</b> I came out a lot earlier than Pernille, but when I think back to it I still had anxiety. When I told my friends for the first time I was crying so much, and had so much pressure building up to it, even though I was probably in one of the most accepting environments in the world. So I can imagine how tough it is for people who don’t have the environment I had, because I struggled even though it was really acceptable<br /><br />If you look at the photo from the World Cup and the support we got, imagine what a men’s player would have, it would be massive. But it feels like we have to break the norm before that happens, unfortunately. The men’s game has taken a different turn and it’s very difficult for players to come out. Hopefully when youngsters today grow up, the norm will change<br /><br /><b>[Magda Eriksson talks about female footballer]</b> I feel we know what it’s like when you’ve come from a lower point. You want to help the younger generation and grassroots build something because of what we’ve gone through. That’s been the life of a female footballer throughout history. They’ve always had to do more than be footballers. They’ve always had to drive it and get questions that would never be asked of a male player. But hopefully those things will change in time<br /><br />People were like ‘It was so fun to watch you guys, so entertaining’. I’d never heard anyone say they’d genuinely enjoyed watching us before. Previously it was a bit ‘We support you guys … ‘ but kind of condescending. This time they’d enjoyed it and I was like ‘Ah, this is the point I’d been wanting to reach for so long’. One where people just respect us and don’t think of us as women playing football but just watch the football game<br /><br />I kind of got used to it. Every time I was at a stadium I was really thinking ‘Women’s football is so cool and fun to watch’. And I think a lot of people who hadn’t seen it before changed their view of it</p>
