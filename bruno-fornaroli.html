  <p>[Melbourne City skipper Bruno Fornaroli has hailed the rise of winger Nick Fitzgerald] I don’t just think it’s the last month - this season he’s played fantastic football. Nick works hard every day and when you start to play a lot of games you take a lot of confidence and your level goes up. When your confidence is high, you can play your best football. For me, I need the wingers in the best moments and Nick is fantastic now.<br /><br />[Melbourne City will be without Caltex Socceroo Tim Cahill for tomorrow night’s visit to Spotless] He’s a big miss for us, of course. When Tim is in, he can get at a defender. When he makes a run to the [near] post, the defender goes with him and creates space for the other players. But we have big players, we can change the formation. Maybe ‘Fitzy’ [Nick Fitzgerald] goes in again. It’s good, because we have [plan] A and B. I think we have the solution<br /><br />[Fornaroli won the Golden Boot in a sizzling debut campaign for City, scoring an astonishing 25 goals last season] I don’t think much about the Golden Boot. I’m a striker and of course I want to score a lot of goals but I think more of my team. I don’t need to win another Golden Boot; I need to work hard for my team</p>

  <p>[Melbourne City captain Bruno Fornaroli has conceded an elimination final exit to Perth Glory this weekend would be a failure for his team] Of course. We’re here to try and win and this is what we want. This is what the club wants, the fans want, so we’re trying to do everything to win the play-offs.<br /><br />Last Sunday was a crazy game because we both need to win, Perth need to score a lot of goals, we needed to win for Asia so I expect a different game this Sunday. Now we have a long week to fix everything, work hard before the final. We need to stay more calm when we have the ball, try to create chances but also try to defend well. This is the first thing but we have confidence about this game</p>

  <p>[Melbourne City captain Bruno Fornaroli has spoken of his love of sudden-death matches] Absolutely. Yeah, of course. I wait for this moment. I can feel this, everything. The fans go to the stadium, it’s a different atmosphere to the normal A-League games. So I can’t wait to play this first final and try to win.<br /><br />We played good football in the first final last year. We get chances and we score, I score two, so I have good memories but every year is a different story and the game you have to play. Perth have a great team, great players. It’s difficult to win every time against Perth but we have confidence<br /><br />This is the last opportunity we have. Maybe you play, you prepare all year for this moment, so all the work in one year is in one game because if you don’t win the first one you can’t go to the second</p>
