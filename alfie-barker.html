  <p><b>[Alfie Barker says he trolled <a href="harry-arter.html">Harry Arter</a> because he was ‘annoyed that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> were losing 3-0 at Bournemouth’]</b> I am just so sorry about what I have done.<br /><br />I was watching <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> at home last night and I was hyper. At 3-0 down they weren’t playing well and I was annoyed. I’d had a couple of beers and was frustrated at the way the team was playing and I just lashed out.

I cannot justify in any way, shape or form what I did but I would like to say sorry. I would like to write a letter to Harry saying sorry too. I feel like the worst person in the world today.<br /><br />I’m not a horrible person.

I’d like to apologise to <a href="harry-arter.html">Harry Arter</a> and his family for such disgraceful comments and I’m sorry from the bottom of my heart. The FA have launched a probe and will be seeking Barker’s observations in relation to his social-media activity</p>

I also completely understand why Hitchin Town took the action they did and I completely agree they did the right thing</p>

I’m saying sorry because I want to say sorry and I mean it, not because I’ve been caught out.</p>
