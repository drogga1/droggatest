That is what we were given. And maybe no one ever thought to question whether it makes sense. But if you look at some other sports, someone must have decided one day that, actually, it would be daft to get women - average height in the UK 5ft 3in compared with 5ft 9in for men - to run over the same sprint hurdles in the Olympics. The women’s hurdles were made to be nine inches shorter, 33in compared with 42</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea Women’s boss Emma Hayes has praised club owner Roman Abramovich as the Blues and the rest of the Women’s Super League prepare for a historic opening weekend]</b> We have been taken to Israel by our own, who is extremely proud of us. He is determined to make sure he sells out the stadium. Not once, but more than once. We have a CEO (Guy Lawrence) who has driven the entire football club to make sure we promote a wonderful day to everyone involved, and a chairman (Bruce Buck) who is the driving force of the women’s football in this club and beyond. What more could I ask for? We are showing as a club that you can <b>[progress]</b> if you invest in it at the very top. I urge all the other clubs to be a driving force in their own way. That’s what makes the difference. <b>[Back in]</b> 2012 was the first time I felt the appetite from <a href="bruce-buck.html">Bruce Buck</a> and everyone inside the club to be a driving force in the game.<br /><br />I think that’s side-by-side with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> in particular. The three of us have continued to push the domestic game to the standards that it’s at. More have joined at differing levels of investment. You’ve had the Olympics alongside the relaunch of the Women’s Super League. Moving from a summer league to a winter league, which is completely the right transition, you have had a more hand-in-hand approach between <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> and those clubs. Plus, subsequent events of the Euros and the World Cup has demonstrated what you can do when the investment is there. I don’t just mean financial, I mean by being able to give it the right amount of broadcasting space, commercial space and marketing space. The realities are that women haven’t received equal access to all of those things. We have been deprived for more than 50 years and because of that, it has been suppressed. I feel even more certain that it isn’t about salary caps or containing our dreams. It is the opposite.<br /><br />Do more, invest more, give more, find a bigger platform for exposure. This is a wonderful time for women in the game to not just have a career for themselves, but they can fulfil anything they need to in any capacity. There is even more growth to be had. I don’t think it is about being satisfied. More things are aligned than ever. Hopefully with the new board you will see the game driven to new heights in the next 12 months. Eventually, I suspect, the league will either become stand-alone, or go into the hands of the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[Emma Hayes played down her match-winning substitutions in Sunday’s win over <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, saying should the changes have backfired, they’d have been called ‘a pile of sh<em>te’]&lt;/b&gt; I’ve learned a lot this weekend about the value of the whole. When you’ve got a top group of players picking 11 is really challenging because there’s world class talent sat on the bench.<br /><br />Managing that is even more difficult and I’m someone who thinks I manage it quite well. The realities are that to get into this <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> team means everybody has got to go up a notch. The second half we were totally dominant and I am so over the moon for Maria Thorisdottir and Ramona Bachmann because those two deserve to be in the team. But, so does everybody else. I know I can only pick 11, so when they trudged off from training extremely disappointed yesterday, I said to Paul Green <b>[assistant manager]</b>, ‘No matter what, they’re coming in the game’ because their training performances were outstanding<br /><br /><b>[Thorisdottir came into holding midfield to change the game, despite naturally being a centre-back]</b> If you get it right you’re an unbelievable manager, if you don’t you’re a pile of sh</em>te. I got it right today. That for me is what wisdom is about, you’ve got to get more right than not. I’ve got <b>[Magdalena]</b> Eriksson and <a href="james-milner.html">Millie</a> Bright at the back, how unlucky is Maria Thorisdottir? She’s an unbelievable player being kept out by unbelievable players. So you know what she’s going to have to adapt if she wants to get in the team. Is <b>[her]</b> goal unusual? No, if you’ve been in our training then you’ll see she does that all the time. She is a winner, like Ramona she is desperately unlucky not to be in the team. I can only pick 11<br /><br />It’s not about not deserving <b>[to play]</b>. Sometimes you just select a team that you think is going to win a game. It’s not about proving managers wrong either, I don’t believe in that. What I think it actually is, is proving your team-mates right, your manager right, that you add great value. And in return, I have to make sure that I keep reminding them of their importance and their value</b></p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea boss Emma Hayes has urged everyone to look after Fran Kirby as she makes her way back to full fitness]</b> I’ve spent a lot of time not saying much about Fran Kirby, because there is huge expectation on that player. I think it is important for everyone to know that she has made her way back from really, really critical injuries. She has, effectively, four kneecaps. You need to understand that. A very explosive player like she is might need more time to recover so it’s important we build her through this period. You can’t go from zero to 90 mins.<br /><br />No, she isn’t anywhere near her best level yet, but she’s come through another game <b>[against Arsenal]</b>. I thought she grew in confidence and yes, you can leave Fran in the game, but I value her life and I value her career. I think it’s important to put that at the front of it and protect her because there’s not many talents like Fran Kirby, believe you me. <b>[It’s important to]</b> not overexpose her so she is injured, in the team, injured, in the team. No more. We need to manage her. I have a responsibility to do that and England have a responsibility to do that<br /><br /><b>[Erin Cuthbert is another who is working back to full fitness, having struggled with injuries after her World Cup campaign with Scotland - withdrawing from the national team squad in August]</b> I don’t even think they are 75 per cent. Erin only started to train the week of the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> game, Fran had two weeks and no training and then when she came back in the squad, only had a week under her belt. They don’t have enough pre-season so you have to take risks, I took risks with Erin <b>[against Arsenal]</b>, but sometimes you have to do it.<br /><br />I will do it less with Fran. We need to look after Fran. Everybody needs to look after Fran. We all have a collective responsibility to do that and recognise that she has had a really, really challenging time and she may not get there as quickly as everyone would want. It is important we get her back in the right amount of time</p>

The fact she chose <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> when she could have gone to any club in the world is a testament to the players and the staff here because she saw this is the best place for her to grow and take the next step in her career.

What didn’t help is they went down to 10 players and then they dropped deeper and then spaces were no longer there, so I made adjustments. I made adjustments in the first half just to give us a bit more width higher up the pitch but it’s exciting to see the pair of them together and I’m sure they’re happy to get the first one out the way. <br /><br />I don’t think I can ask any more <b>[of Kerr today]</b>. She’s rusty. It’s her first time here, there’s a lot of expectation on her. She’s humble. Hardworking. Honest. Thoughtful. An unbelievable team player, she cares about what the team think of her and she will work and do her job for the team at any point. You have top players but to have a top player who is a top person?

It is a bit frustrating but teams like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and Brighton obviously set up differently and it’s hard to break them down.<br /><br />It’s not as easy as people think on the outside. When they put 11 players behind the ball, it’s different to when you’re playing <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and they’re coming out at you. We have a lot of chances in those games as well without putting them away. As you’ve seen today, we can score really good goals so why can’t we do it against the other teams?

  <p><b>[Manager Emma Hayes says WSL champions <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are here to stay due to Abramovich backing]</b> Yes, <b>[Abramovich has congratulated us]</b>, I have received some messages from the whole board and the pride they have for the whole team. When we were in Israel with the owner, he spoke so openly about his growing knowledge of the women’s game and his interest in our team. I am extremely fortunate in all my meetings with the top people at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and the message is always clear that our owner is a big fan of the team, women’s football and he asks beyond our team what he can do for our game. I always ask him to keep supporting our club to the best of our abilities so we can be flag bearers where we can be. I think without what we achieved together, there wouldn’t be this success. Without this constant conversation or evolution, then we wouldn’t be able to win seven trophies in my time. I can only speak positively for what that relationship has done for the team. When I came into <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in 2012, we were an amateur team and gone from there to where we are now which is a key reason we are in this position. Since I have worked with this football club, with an owner who is so supportive of the drive to win. I think there is a perfect marriage of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and myself for these reasons. I am grateful I have an owner who gets me and while I am here I will always do my best to win trophies for him. I celebrated with the players on a Zoom call, then I sat in the family with my garden and I hadn’t seen the majority of them which was nice. A low-key celebration with the people that mattered most to me. Knowing my team, when we get back, it will be business as usual. I am sure we will do something together when it is appropriate but already after the call we are talking about what’s next for us. When you aspire to something, once you get it, I take it in a lot more as an older person than the players who are like what’s next. They don’t want to spend time celebrating. They want to progress and get to the next level. My captain will put her hands on the trophy first and mine will be on it last.<br /><br />It is extremely hard to win back-to-back titles in any profession and I have never done that. Watching the Last Dance, I am in awe of Phil <b>[Jackson]</b> and his team. It isn’t easy to win back-to-back and I won’t take it for granted. I learned from the Last Dance that top players drive the standards and behaviours. You need more of these players than not. The more you have working as a cohesive with the team at the epicentre of that and not the individual. That was the making of that team even though they had the best player in the world. I thought it was a remarkable sports series. We have so many leaders, that’s the beauty, I think of how to turn seven or eight of them into 12 or 13 and I have already spoken to my captain about how to draw it out further.<br /><br />I think we are more joined-up than ever with the methodology and I am excited for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> beyond my time as well</p>
