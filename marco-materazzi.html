  <p><b>[Chennaiyin FC part ways with head coach Marco Materazzi]</b> These past three seasons with Chennaiyin has been a great adventure on a sports and human level. I leave the club today grateful to have been given the opportunity to contribute in my own modest way to the shaping of India as a football nation and most of all grateful to have lived firsthand the birth and growth of Chennaiyin FC. Incredible team, incredible fans, incredible India!</p>

  <p><b>[On Jeje Lalpekhlua]</b> I think that Jeje should not only be the best striker, but the best player in India. For the last two years now, his goals were amazing. He is a very important player not only for me but also for India as a whole and he is an icon and is the perfect man to develop football in India.</p>

  <p><b>[How the cult of Mourinho’s relationship with his players has changed]</b> He showed he was willing to die for us, just like a father or an older brother would. And when I say ‘us’, I don’t just mean the players who played regularly but also those who were not in the XI such as myself, a substitute. He was the leader of a family which was ready to face everything and everyone.</p>

  <p><b>[Marco Materazzi not surprised by Coutinho’s price]</b> Prices always depend <b>[on]</b> the offer and the request. If there’s a team asking that much and there’s another willing to pay that amount, it’s not Marco Materazzi’s problem.</p>

  <p><b>[Gianluigi Buffon is the greatest goalkeeper of all time]</b> Buffon is the greatest goalkeeper of all time. No doubt about it. The greatest ever.<br /><br /><b>[On Roberto Mancini]</b> We will know in a couple of years’ time whether he is the right choice. It is a job that he very much wanted himself and he will work very hard to get the results Italy need<br /><br /><b>[On Mario Balotelli]</b> For what he has done this season for Nice, he deserves to have been called up</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus a failure if they don’t win Champions League with Ronaldo]</b> Juve is strong every year and have an obsession with having to win the Champions League. When you win a lot in Italy, you have to do one more step and the extra step is called the Champions League. And then this year they took a player <b>[Ronaldo]</b> who is unequalled at European level, so I think that Cup is their first goal. In Italy, nobody is able to remove the Scudetto from Juventus. But if they do not win the Champions League, I think they will be a failure. When you take the strongest in the world, along with Messi, it is right to expect that Cup. If they win, I will congratulate them, as an Italian. But do not ask me to cheer for them.</p>

It won’t be easy, because you can’t forget or cancel out the past, but he is hungry for success. With desire and effort, the Inter fans will grow to love him. It’s up to him to win over everyone’s trust</p>

Motivating him was not easy. Jose, you know how many messages he sent to <b>[Eto’o]</b> say ‘they <b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> transferred you thinking of improving themselves, sending you here so that we don’t win.’ Then he came here and made us win the treble. I think that year he was willing to do anything. He has won two trebles in a row, things that perhaps do not happen to anyone. He did it with two different teams. Stuff of another level</p>
