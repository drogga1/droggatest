I don’t know what can happen, but what I can say is that I did my part on the pitch. Now I have to put my future in the hands of those who run the business side</p>

  <p><b>[Lyon seal €20m Bruno Guimaraes signing to end <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> links]</b> I’m very happy, I can’t wait to start playing, to meet my teammates and my coach. I am impatient but also very happy to get started in this new stage of my life. It is a great career opportunity that has been offered to me. I am very happy that the club trusts me. The whole club and all the staff have shown a lot of interest. <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> is a great team. My goals are to win titles and help the team upon my arrival. I must live up to this responsibility and the investment that has been made in me. So my goal is to win titles and write my name in the history of the club</p>

  <p><b>[Meet Bruno Guimaraes: The new <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> hero who could wreck <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>’s Champions League hopes]</b> I don’t let myself get overcome with emotion, even if it is a unique feeling. I grew up watching <b>[Ronaldo and Neymar]</b> play, I admired them, supported them and now I am against them, trying to steal the ball off them. These are things I could not imagine up until recently. And, to be honest, I did not know how I would react.<br /><br />I am not his rival, but I am competition. We are talking about a truly great player here. <a href="casemiro.html">Casemiro</a> has achieved so many things in Europe, he has won so much, whilst I am merely just starting out. I am here to leave my mark on <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>, win titles and obtain the stature of a great player</p>
