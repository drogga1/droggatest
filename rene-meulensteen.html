  <p><b>[Rene Meulensteen says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> attacker <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> should embrace <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> as a role model]</b> In many ways, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is unique because he had such huge belief in his own ability. But I do think that <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> has got a similar mindset to be the best player he can - and I think he should use <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> as his role model. I’m not saying Marcus can be the next <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> - because I think <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is a one-off talent. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is one of the all-time greats who will be remembered alongside <a href="pele.html">Pele</a>, <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, <a href="eusebio.html">Eusebio</a>, and <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>. But Marcus can create his own reputation as a fantastic player if he wants it badly enough.<br /><br /><a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>’s natural instinct was to always try to score the most beautiful goal possible - and that is something I also see in <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a>. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> was always trying to find the top corner from 30 yards and win the goal of the season. I made him realise that he had to become a great goalscorer rather than a scorer of great goals. That meant scoring more goals, not more spectacular goals. Of course, we worked on his technique for finishing, but we also worked on his thinking process so that he would naturally get himself in the right positions to help him score more goals</p>

  <p><b>[Rene Meulensteen says <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> partnering with <a href="mino-raiola.html">Mino Raiola</a> could cause more problems for Man Utd]</b> It’s really strange to me. Sometimes these agents get far too much control, but that’s just how the system works, unfortunately. It’s crazy and it causes problems for managers. I think a club the size of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> should be able to look after that themselves. <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> was already with him, but now <a href="jesse-lingard.html">Jesse Lingard</a> is going and <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> … it’s not a good development in my opinion. His way is <a href="mino-raiola.html">Raiola</a> first and then the player, and not the interest of the club<br /><br /><b>[Meulensteen believes <a href="mino-raiola.html">Raiola</a> is more concerned with personal gain than making sure his clients are happy]</b> The pathway of the players in terms of where they want to play and their development, that’s the way United have worked all these years and that’s exactly how we did it when <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> first left the club. We had a fantastic plan in place for Paul, who was just coming onto the scene in the first team. It was a great pathway with all the benefits that went with it, but obviously he went to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> because it was a deal struck by <a href="mino-raiola.html">Raiola</a> and he was making sure he looked after himself</p>

  <p><b>[Rene Meulensteen says <a href="jesse-lingard.html">Jesse Lingard</a> has always had <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> attributes]</b> Jesse had various loan clubs and then he came back. And I think <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a> was the manager at the time and Louis was very big on bringing young players through and Jesse got the chance to suddenly play in the first team and so did <b>[Marcus]</b> <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>. That’s the luck that you need and certain managers can see it. Jesse always had attributes in his game as <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> had for Barcelona<br /><br />Jesse, in my opinion - and I think he knows it himself, he’s a great kid - he’s the sort of player that’s so difficult for opposition teams to mark. I think it’s more a confidence thing, you need to recognise as staff and coaches and say ‘okay, when did you have the best games? When did you score the most goals? And why isn’t it happening now?’ Somewhere down that line there’s a dent and you need to find that and what you can do to make sure the focus goes back</p>

  <p><b>[Rene Meulensteen says Red Devils no longer look vulnerable]</b> Fernandes has made a fantastic impact. At the moment what’s happening on the pitch is working, and he’s made the difference. There was always this vulnerability about the Man United team, but now there’s much more bite and belief about them, and I think <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> has played a key role in that. You know what I like about him? He doesn’t accept low standards.<br /><br />There was a moment <b>[in a 2-0 derby win over City]</b> when <a href="daniel-james.html">Daniel James</a> broke on the right-hand side and he should have played Fernandes in, he should have pulled it back and it would have been 2-0 - game over. And his reaction to those moments where players play a ball and it doesn’t come off, he’s not happy with that. That’s exactly what should happen; you should always aim for the highest standards and not accept sloppiness, and that is one of the things he has got.<br /><br />On top of that he also always looks to play forward, and he’s got that little bit of unpredictability that you saw in the free-kick that <b>[Anthony]</b> Martial scored from. That element of the game was lacking at Man United and, now they have it back, it makes all the difference.</p>

  <p><b>[former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> coach Rene Meulensteen says If Ravel Morrison had 75 per cent of the ‘mentality and drive’ that <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> possesses then he could have been an unbelievable footballer]</b> I got to know him when he was in the under-9s when I first joined <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in 2001. I saw something in Ravel that was the closest to <a href="paul-gascoigne.html">Paul Gascoigne</a>. He had a swagger about him, he had a way of going past people like they weren’t even there, he had a change of pace, he could dribble with both feet, he could change angles, he was unpredictable. That was not the problem. When he was there, when he was training, he was fantastic, he was not a problem, because he loved it. It was when he left, when he got in a different environment outside of the club, where we all know he was not in the best of environments that could have helped him. I was fortunate to work with someone like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, and if you look at his mentality and drive, if only Ravel would have had 75 per cent of that he would have become an unbelievable player, because he had so much going for him naturally. It’s very hard to predict, but if that mentality had been there he would have been a top, top player<br /><br /><b>[Meulensteen says United gave Morrison every chance to become the player they believed he could be, but his inability to settle anywhere highlights how difficult he can be to handle]</b> Believe me, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> did not leave a stone unturned to try and get him on the right track. He’s had something like ten clubs since leaving United, and every manager who has brought him in has seen his talent, but every single one of them has experienced the same problems. They couldn’t get him to understand what it takes to be a really good professional footballer. It’s the most frustrating thing, because we didn’t leave any stone unturned, we had millions of conversations with him, which a lot of the time Ravel acknowledged, he nodded his head, said he understood, but it was the same behaviour all the time</p>
