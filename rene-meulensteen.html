  <p><b>[Manchester United had identified Mats Hummels, Marco Reus and Ilkay Gundogan as potential transfer targets prior to Sir Alex Ferguson’s departure]</b> The fact that he was going to retire or finish came to me and a lot of others as a complete bombshell. He was as sharp as ever. He was always an early bird, always arriving early at Carrington. I didn’t read anything in him where it suggested it would be his last season. We had very normal staff meetings regarding pre-season. That year we were going to Australia. Sir Alex even mentioned taking us to one of the best vineyards out there. I was looking forward to that! We had possible scouting meetings, possible players we were looking at in terms of trying to build a picture of what we think we need. All that was ongoing. We looked at a few German players like Hummels, who went to Bayern Munich. I think we looked at Gundogan and Reus, too. There were a number of players but we never got that specific to really target them.</p>

  <p><b>[Rene Meulensteen believes Manchester United would be in a much brigher situation today had they appointed Ryan Giggs as Sir Alex Ferguson’s successor in 2013]</b> At United there was stability and continuity. Ferguson, David Gill, the Glazers. It was working like clockwork. So there was another way of doing it, which was basically bringing somebody from within. Then Ferguson could’ve managed his departure in a different way. He could’ve faded into the background over time and helped with this important transition, obtaining a consultancy role. Knowing that Ryan Giggs was keen on stepping into coaching - he was doing his licenses - he knew United inside out. The culture, the identity - he knows everything. Plus with us <b>[in Ferguson’s backroom staff]</b> being around there, plus Ferguson still being there, that could’ve been an ideal scenario. That is just a different way, a different strategy, which I think could’ve worked.<br /><br />Bringing somebody from the outside, I knew straight away that it wouldn’t matter who it would’ve been. But obviously for David Moyes it was a massive step up because he’s never played, never worked on a similar level. If they would’ve said we want to bring in Mourinho then, or Carlo Ancelotti or Pep Guardiola or Jupp Heynckes, who have worked at Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, they wouldn’t be fazed. They know what’s expected of the club. They would’ve respected and understood the importance of the 26-year tenure of Ferguson. What has happened is it’s ended up in a very erratic period, which still hasn’t settled.<br /><br />Mourinho is pragmatic, he’s calculated, there’s not so much unpredictability. He organises his teams very well. He wants to make sure he nullifies the strengths of the opposition, doesn’t give anything away. Going forward, he exploits the weaknesses of the opposition. You look at what he’s done as a manager and you can’t knock him. Every manager has got his own blueprint, but it’s different to what we were used to with Sir Alex and it’s also different from Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp. They have all got a belief and an element that football needs to be played also to entertain the crowd. They have an obligation. People come to see football, they pay a lot of money</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United are paying the price for constant disruptions]</b> There are too many things coming out, whether from Mourinho or the players, and that causes constant disruptions inside and outside the club. Obviously there is a problem because there are certain things as a manager between your players you want to keep between the walls of the dressing room. That is part of the strength of the squad and that’s what you need when you are getting into difficult times, like Man United are in at the moment. That’s when you need to pull together and close the ranks, rather than throw something out that again opens up the speculation and causes a lot of disruption.</p>

  <p><b>[Jesse Lingard is following advice to model his game on Spanish legend Andres Iniesta]</b> I told him, ‘You remind me of him and can be the English version’. Coming between the lines, picking the ball up, turning the back line, those smart runs he possesses. And now he scores goals, too</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Jesse Lingard has been billed as the English version of Andres Iniesta]</b> Sir Alex always had a clear picture of what a good player looked like and they had to have quick feet, quick brain, and a big heart. That is basically everything that Jesse had but he was very slight for his age. I worked with him from the age of eight or nine and taking him abroad for tournaments and he was always having to fight battles because he was of a tiny build. But all things level themselves out and eventually those three things make a difference - quick feet, a quick brain, and a big heart. And he has done every so well. The fans always need to associate themselves with players who have come through the ranks. While I was there and Sir Alex was there it was so important to keep bringing young players through. The difference with Jesse is that he was always the English version of Iniesta. He can play in the pockets, he’s very mobile and very agile. He can beat a man and he’s good in combination play. The last few seasons he started to score important goals as well.<br /><br />Stability is a big thing, especially in the back four. Most of the successful teams are able to play with a solid and stable back line, including the goalkeeper. It’s normal with a club like Manchester United that it takes some time for a player to settle in but you can see now that Victor has settled. He’s played a string of games so he’s starting to find his feet and learning what is required to play at this level. He’s done well but the defence is still an area which people are looking at critically. Antonio Valencia is getting on and Ashley Young is a bit older now but still doing a great job. There is a need for a really good centre-back alongside Lindelof who can lead from the back and stabilise everything. If you look at the firepower and the pace United have up front along with the variety of abilities they can scare any defence in the Premier League and across Europe. In midfield they are strong. You have Paul Pogba to the fore and getting better. Nemanja Matic is very strong with a lot of experience. But you could maybe do with another creative player there, a passer that can unlock defences from deep</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba is proving that he can be a difference maker at Manchester United]</b> Ole has probably reassured Paul Pogba what a good player he is but secondly he has also placed on his shoulders the responsibilities he must live up to. Those responsibilities come down to just two things - work hard in every game and play the best football that you’re capable of for this club. When he does those things he’s a difference maker<br /><br />Alexis Sanchez is a runner with the ball. He likes to pick the ball up and basically drive forward past people. I would like to see Alexis Sanchez at his best for Manchester United because we all saw how good he was for Arsenal. You can’t tell me that that has suddenly disappeared. It’s all about making the players understand what is expected of them and unlocking how to get the best out of them. I’m sure that Ole will be able to do that<br /><br />Ole obviously had a good look at the squad and he wants to play with a lot of energy and a lot of pace. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a big fan of Juan Mata and think he’s a great player but it just might be that Mata doesn’t fit in the picture that Ole sees. That is obvious otherwise he would have played more often and at some point you have to refresh your squad in certain areas</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba may have made the PFA Premier League Team of the Year]</b> I know Pogba’s in the PFA team of the year, but he wouldn’t get in the City team, not with Pep. Yaya Toure could do brilliant things, but he ultimately wasn’t able to do what Pep wanted. He went missing for periods and couldn’t do the pressing or fast rhythm with the ball that was required. When Pogba gets going he’s fast, but he’s not light on his feet. With City, if you lose the ball, you have to win it back as fast as you can and then move it quickly.<br /><br />We always brought a lot of reserves to train with the first team and Paul was the one we were looking at for the following season. I worked with him in some smaller groups and we were looking to measure him up with the first-team players. Paul was on the verge of the first team and Jesse Lingard was another big hope. Paul had similar traits to Patrick Vieira - he’s tall, strong, can drive forward and is able to find a pass. That’s the type of player we thought he could become for us, but then he went to Juventus</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba is struggling at Manchester United because he lacks players of Andrea Pirlo and N’Golo Kante’s quality alongside side]</b> He clearly struggles to dictate the game if he doesn’t have good enough players around him. With Juventus and France, he did extremely well but had players like Andrea Pirlo, Claudio Marchisio and Arturo Vidal with him in Turin, and N’Golo Kante for France. The pace of the game is also much slower in Italy than it is in the Premier League, where it’s constant action and you have to be urgent both in and out of possession. If you look at some of Pogba’s best games for United, they’ve been alongside Ander Herrera. The two of them are complementary. Herrera gives Pogba the platform to get in the box and play those searching passes because he keeps the balance. He’s able to stop the fires, is mobile, can pick the right passes and has really good game understanding. I don’t think the other central midfielders we’ve seen have been able to provide that same platform<br /><br />Paul has obviously suffered a bit from the lack of quality around him. When Ole <b>[Gunnar <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>]</b> took over people got carried away - ‘we’ve got the old United back’ - but after that PSG away win in the Champions League everything has been turned on its head. He <b>[Pogba]</b> suffers from this languid style, he’s a heavy mover. In England especially, the fans want to say: He might not have been great today but he gave it everything. Paul has that languid style and needs to learn to play with more of a spring in his step. The first thing that’s expected of anyone is attitude, energy and work-rate. Scott McTominay doesn’t have the same technical quality as Pogba, but he is a hard-working lad, so the fans have warmed to him.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen has explained how setting goals helped take a young Cristiano Ronaldo to the next level]</b> Cristiano Ronaldo was someone I got to spend plenty of time with at the start of the 2007-08 season. A red card in the second game of the season meant he was banned for three games, which gave me the perfect opportunity to work on some things with him.<br /><br />I believed he was one of the best forwards at a very young age, but he wasn’t productive enough. We needed him to score more goals. I knew that was what he wanted too. My aim was to bring him from awareness to understanding. To recognise how he could get from where he was to where he wanted to be. That was about a few things off the pitch, but a lot of things on it. It was also about the value of setting aims and targets, and explaining to him that people who have a clear goal - and devise a strategy to get there - will be far more successful than those who say ‘I want that’, and then wait and hope for the best. He was very receptive to anything that he knew could bring him closer to what he wanted</p>

But I do think that <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> has got a similar mindset to be the best player he can - and I think he should use <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> as his role model. I’m not saying Marcus can be the next <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> - because I think <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is a one-off talent. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is one of the all-time greats who will be remembered alongside <a href="pele.html">Pele</a>, <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, <a href="eusebio.html">Eusebio</a>, and <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>. But Marcus can create his own reputation as a fantastic player if he wants it badly enough.<br /><br /><a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>’s natural instinct was to always try to score the most beautiful goal possible - and that is something I also see in <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a>. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> was always trying to find the top corner from 30 yards and win the goal of the season. I made him realise that he had to become a great goalscorer rather than a scorer of great goals. That meant scoring more goals, not more spectacular goals. Of course, we worked on his technique for finishing, but we also worked on his thinking process so that he would naturally get himself in the right positions to help him score more goals</p>

Sometimes these agents get far too much control, but that’s just how the system works, unfortunately. It’s crazy and it causes problems for managers. I think a club the size of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> should be able to look after that themselves. <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> was already with him, but now <a href="jesse-lingard.html">Jesse Lingard</a> is going and <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> … it’s not a good development in my opinion.

  <p><b>[Rene Meulensteen says Red Devils no longer look vulnerable]</b> Fernandes has made a fantastic impact. At the moment what’s happening on the pitch is working, and he’s made the difference. There was always this vulnerability about the Man United team, but now there’s much more bite and belief about them, and I think <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> has played a key role in that. You know what I like about him? He doesn’t accept low standards.<br /><br />There was a moment <b>[in a 2-0 derby win over City]</b> when <a href="daniel-james.html">Daniel James</a> broke on the right-hand side and he should have played Fernandes in, he should have pulled it back and it would have been 2-0 - game over.

That’s exactly what should happen; you should always aim for the highest standards and not accept sloppiness, and that is one of the things he has got.<br /><br />On top of that he also always looks to play forward, and he’s got that little bit of unpredictability that you saw in the free-kick that <b>[Anthony]</b> Martial scored from.
