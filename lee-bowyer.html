  <p><b>[Charlton manager Lee Bowyer outlined the club’s determination to hang on to Joe Aribo]</b> We are trying our hardest to get Joe to sign a contract. The speculation with Arsenal, if that is the case, shows we have done a good job with him. He was hardly playing last season, now he has got teams like Arsenal supposedly looking at him.<br /><br />I’ve spoken to Joe on a number of occasions and he knows how we feel. We want him to sign not just for us, but for his own career so we just need to get over this barrier that’s been put in front of us. Joe is a good lad so I don’t think articles like that will affect him. He comes to me and I give him advice and if anything was turning his head or putting him off his game I’m sure he would come and talk to me about it.</p>

  <p><b>[Charlton Athletic vs Sunderland. Lee Bowyer, the latest in a line of managers under Roland Duchatelet, has brought some much needed stability to the London outfit]</b> No one tipped us to be in the top six so to have a day out at Wembley, it’s a great achievement for our football club. At the start of the season, the big thing for me was to try to bring the fans and players together because everyone knows there was a lot of negativity around the football club before I came in. I wanted to bring them back together and make sure they were part of the journey that we were going to go on.</p>

  <p><b>[Charlton have announced that manager Lee Bowyer has signed a contract extension]</b> We went on a real journey last season. The club came together - the players, the staff, the fans and we achieved something special. The journey hasn’t finished yet and I’m delighted this has all been agreed. This has been a long process and I never wanted to leave, I love this club. I’d like to thank the owner for giving me the initial opportunity and now for continuing to believe in me. We have a fantastic fanbase here and my focus continues to be on getting our squad in the best possible shape for the Championship next season</p>

  <p><b>[Bowyer has previously stated that he is confident Conor Gallagher will remain at the Valley]</b> I can’t see it. We had <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in last week and they said they are really happy with his progress - he is getting everything they want him to get from a loan. He’s playing all the time and is experiencing winning and losing. He’s experiencing everything you need to learn as a kid. I can’t see them taking him away</p>

  <p><b>[Charlton boosted their Championship survival hopes with a hard-fought victory over QPR at The Valley]</b> I knew with nine games to go there is a lot of football left and even with seven to go, we are not out of it yet. We have to focus and keep fighting for every point because this league can hurt you.<br /><br /> We have had a good start and we are in a good position, but we have to keep fighting until the end because the most important thing for me is staying in the division. And what they were trying to do before with the points-per-game thing was ridiculous. I think we are proving that as it stands today, but still a long way to go</p>

  <p><b>[Cardiff and Charlton saw their 100 per cent records since football returned come to an end as the two Championship sides shared a goalless draw in the Welsh capital]</b> It was a well-earned point. At times we looked dangerous, but to be fair at times so did Cardiff. It was a fair result and there were not many clear-cut chances. This is a tough place to come because don’t forget Cardiff only came down from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> last season. I’m happy with a point because Cardiff are a good side<br /><br />Not many teams have beaten <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> this season. They had a good win at Preston as well so we knew it would be tough. To get seven points from our first three games is very good The players are putting their bodies on the line and defending properly. To have three clean sheets means you are always going to be in a game</p>

  <p><b>[Millwall kept their play-off hopes alive with a late 1-0 win at Charlton in the Championship on Friday night]</b> It’s a bit like when we played at their place. To come away with nothing it hurts. You can’t create that many chances and not score a goal, but that’s our problem since we’ve come back, we can’t score in open play. We’ve had five good chances and a one-on-one with the goalkeeper and it’s not good enough. If you don’t score goals then you don’t win games, and that’s what has cost us tonight</p>

  <p><b>[Brentford needed late goals from Said Benrahma and Ethan Pinnock to beat Charlton 2-1 and crank up the pressure on West Brom in the race for automatic promotion]</b> I think, looking at the situation we are in, we have to fight for every point but if we keep performing like that and showing that fighting spirit we’ll get over the line. Brentford have been hammering teams left right and centre, both before and after the lockdown, and we gave them quite a scare. Tonight wasn’t meant to be.</p>

  <p><b>[George Puscas’ early penalty handed Reading a battling 1-0 Championship win at Charlton]</b> It’s disappointment, again, it’s another game that we should have got something from and we haven’t really done much wrong. They get a penalty early on, and then after that I thought we were the better side. I thought we created more clear-cut chances again. And decisions have cost us. The officials have cost us the game today, it’s plain and simple<br /><br />Chuks Aneke, his goal is a goal. And I said to the fourth official, ‘the linesman can’t just guess’. You have to be 100 per cent right on these decisions, these are big moments, there are careers on the line. My players give everything and we haven’t got our rewards<br /><br />If their penalty was a penalty then so was ours, because Jake got dragged to the floor, and it’s a penalty. So you’ve got the offside and the penalty. Big decisions. I’d love to know what he puts in his report, because I know my report isn’t going to be good for him. Something has to be done, because that wasn’t up to scratch, all of them, the ref and the two linesmen</p>

  <p><b>[Lukas Jutkiewicz denied Charlton manager Lee Bowyer a winning return to St Andrew’s as <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a> grabbed a late equaliser to earn a 1-1 draw]</b> For me, 49 points is safe. Looking at what the other teams down there have got to play, I think we would have been safe. It hurts a lot. But we could not see the game out. The whole team has to manage the game better. I feel like I’m saying the same thing again and again - we should have won this game comfortably - we hit the post and there were clear chances for three or four others. But if you miss things like that you don’t deserve to win. If you don’t take chances you don’t score, and if you don’t score, you don’t stay up</p>

It’s been too long for them not to be in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, so I’m really happy for the club, the fans and for the owners.
