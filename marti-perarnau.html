  <p><b>[There are also misapprehensions that <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> was always squarely behind his boss <a href="joan-laporta.html">Laporta</a>, but an extract from Marti Perarnau’s book suggests this was often completely wide of the mark]</b> He had found in <a href="joan-laporta.html">Joan Laporta</a> a dynamic but pushy man who possessed volcanic energy and who could be supportive one minute and undermining the next. <b>[…]</b> <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> balanced the at-times hysterical behaviour of <a href="joan-laporta.html">Laporta</a> with his own calm sobriety. <b>[…]</b> Relations with neither president were simple. Pep managed to deal calmly and quietly with <a href="joan-laporta.html">Laporta</a>’s histrionic outbursts <b>[…]</b> At times Pep felt like the captain of a ponderous ocean liner as he fought to steer the team in one direction whilst the club pulled in the other. No decision was straightforward</p>

  <p><b>[The resurrection of Gundogan]</b> He’s not fit, he’s not in good shape. But he understands very well the tempo of the play that the team needs at each moment, like David Silva. I think he needs 20 more matches in his legs. He hasn’t played too many matches in the last three years. I hope in 20 matches we will see a very good Gundogan.<br /><br />The team needs a very good Gundogan. I think he can be at his highest level if he plays 20, 25 matches in December, January and February. He could arrive in March and April at a very good level. I think the team will need Gundogan</p>

  <p><b>[When Bernardo Silva scored for Manchester City against Arsenal on Sunday, Pep Guardiola turned to Mikel Arteta and threw his arms around his second-in-command]</b> Do you remember from Sunday’s game, after the second goal, Pep’s hug with Mikel?. That was because Mikel said to Mendy, ‘Don’t make a high cross when you get to the end line, make a cut-back along the floor,’ and after that Bernardo scored the goal. He <b>[also]</b> talked with Mendy and Sterling to try to make a double pass before the last cut-back.</p>
