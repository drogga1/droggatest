<blockquote>
  <p><b>[In the wake of Barton ban, Matthew Etherington accuses gambling companies of preying on ‘vulnerable’ footballers]</b> I was targeted when I was at West Ham, I think it was around 2004-05 season. There were gambling companies coming into our training ground with cards, with leaflets, saying that you could bet with us, you could bet as much money as you wanted, it would all be settled or we’d pay them at the end of the month. They knew we were young, maybe a little bit vulnerable and lots of money in our bank accounts. Looking back at that now it was very, very irresponsible of them. It leaves a little bit of a bitter taste in my mouth.<br /><br />More can be done within the PFA going into clubs, it’s just whether the players want to listen. I think it’s got to come from the person to want to stop. I’ve had players come to me through their agents, Premier League players, since I’ve retired, probably half a dozen, saying they feel it’s getting out of hand and how did you do it <b>[kick the addiction]</b>? But I’ve not heard from them again after that. It’s very hard, especially when you’re going into professional clubs it’s a very ego-driven world and everyone’s fighting for that place in the starting line-up on a Saturday, and they just want to get home to their wives, or family, or they just want to get home to do whatever they want to do. Sometimes it’s hard to get through to them</p>
