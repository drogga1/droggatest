<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Dimitri Foulquier is eager to secure another move away from Watford]</b> I must make another transfer or take in another loan. At Watford the path is blocked so I’m looking for a good project.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether he has been deemed surplus to requirements by the Hornets]</b> They have not told me that they are not counting on me anymore, but they told me that it would be difficult this season. They told me to be patient and to consider going on loan again. But I am not against a permanent move either<br /><br /> desire is to play and to enjoy my football. At Watford that is not possible so I will inevitably look to go elsewhere. There are options at the moment but if they do not happen, that is because we didn’t manage to find an agreement or the project on offer did not interest me<br /><br /><b>[A return to his homeland has been mooted]</b> I do not have a priority. What I want is to stay in a big league. That is the only criteria I have.</p>

  <p><b>[Granada defender Dimitri Foulquier has hit out at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> claiming they often benefit from referee decisions after seeing his side beaten 1-0 on Sunday]</b> Whenever we come to the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> it is the same. We compete, we fight, but they don’t let us. When in doubt, the decisions are always in favour of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. When in doubt, they always call for them. They laugh at the little ones and all the effort we make to match their millions</p>
