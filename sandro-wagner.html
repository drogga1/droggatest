  <p>[Sandro Wagner delighted after bizarre penis goal against Hoffenheim] [The goal] was a mixture of this area. I do not want to go into that now. My best part might have been involved, but I’m not sure anymore. It just went so fast. It was very pleasant.</p>

  <p>[Bayern Munich striker Sandro Wagner is looking forward to the challenge of playing against Cristiano Ronaldo in the Champions League semi-finals] He is great. I like people such as him. I know that a lot of people criticise him, but I like him. It would be boring if we were all the same, He scores more goals in games than I do in training. I will be very happy to meet him.<br /><br />Our defence is brutally strong, we have the best defence in Europe, so we do not need to hide<br /><br />I think Real Madrid are the toughest of the three possible opponents. But our players are not blind, so we’re very positive and confident for the games, so we’re just in a good mood and looking forward to the two matches<br /><br />[On Niko Kovac] Of course, he is a good coach. Frankfurt have a great team. I also have a very good relationship with Bruno Hübner [Frankfurt sporting director], who always praises him. He is a good coach. Otherwise, Bayern would not take him. But, as I said, in the summer we can talk a lot about Niko Kovac, but for now Heynckes is our coach<br /><br />You do not ask Müller or Hummels every week whether they are going to the World Cup. That’s exactly how I see it with me. I have done my best in the last few weeks, months and years. I deserve it and I will be part of the squad, I’m sure</p>
