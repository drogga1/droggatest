  <p><b>[John Gregory explains why he’s buying British at <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>]</b> Signing most foreign players can be a bit like a holiday romance - great to begin with, but after a few months you wonder why you bothered</p>

  <p><b>[Chennaiyin FC announce John Gregory as head coach]</b> I am very excited to have joined Chennaiyin FC and would like to thank the club owners for believing in me and giving me this wonderful opportunity. Chennaiyin has been one of the most consistent teams in the ISL so far and I want to continue the great work done by Marco Materazzi in the first three seasons.</p>

  <p><b>[Chennaiyin FC announce new contract for Brazilian midfielder Raphael Augusto]</b> I have received great feedback on Raphael from Sabir. He has clearly been one of best midfielders in the ISL and at 26 can only get better. I hear that he is a real fan favourite so it’s great for the club to have him attached for the long term.</p>

  <p><b>[John Gregory says Indian players have not been given the opportunity to prove themselves]</b> Some of the Indian players in ISL have been in awe of the foreign players and have possibly not been given the opportunity to prove themselves. If it’s a choice between foreign and Indian players, the foreigners always get selected. Which is why I’m impressed with the new regulations that allow for only five foreigners in the starting XI. That’s a positive step. That will ultimately improve the national team.<br /><br />I believe ISL is growing quickly and back in England, I’ve seen how it started three years ago and now there is world wide interest in it. Also, I’m joining a club and following the footsteps of Materazzi. He has left a big pair of shoes for me to try and fill. Also, I was humbled and overwhelmed by the attention. The thing that hit me was the support from the fans who came to the airport at 5 AM to receive me and I’m gobsmacked<br /><br />I think we have an advantage because we have 4 players already which is four more than what Delhi <b>[Dynamos]</b> have. Also, I have assistant manager Sabeer Pasha alongside me who will help me pick Indian players as I don’t know many Indian players. However, we couldn’t afford to let go of players like Jeje Lalpekhlua who has proven himself on the international stage. The draft is gonna be an unusual situation for me but we’ll certainly go into it with expectations. By Sunday I hope we have a good team<br /><br />One thing I want is if you wear the Chennaiyin shirt, you have to give 100%. You have to commit yourself completely to the team. That sort of players will get my support. I expect discipline and players conduct themselves properly on the pitch and dont get involved with the referee or opposition</p>

  <p><b>[Chennaiyin FC has completed the signing of Slovenian playmaker Rene Mihelic for the 2017-18 season]</b> Rene is a player with a fantastic CV. He is not only a winner but has great technique and at 29 could have his best saved for Chennaiyin FC in the ISL. I have been following him closely since he moved to Israel a few years back and always had him on top of our shortlist of foreigners when I got to know he is available. We look forward to a great season from him</p>

  <p><b>[Chennaiyin FC has signed Spanish attacking midfielder Jaime Gavilan Martinez for the 2017-18 season of the Indian Super League]</b> Gavilan has exceptional technical quality with a fantastic CV. He also has the past experience of having played in the ISL two years ago when he had a very good season. He will add great value to our team going forward.</p>

  <p><b>[Chennaiyin FC sign Dutch winger Gregory Nelson]</b> Nelson is a highly accomplished player with a fantastic CV. He will add plenty of quality and variety to our attack. After a very good career in Europe he recently had a very impressive season in Bahrain and looks very well equipped to flourish in the Indian Super League.</p>
