<blockquote>
  <p><b>[How Luka Modric went from rejected youth player to the best midfielder in the world]</b> He arrived together with <b>[Vedran]</b> Corluka and <b>[Hrjoje]</b> Cale and I told them they had to earn their place in the team and if they manage that as 18-year-olds, they will become good players.<br /><br />Luka won his place in the starting line-up after only one month. I told him just not to be afraid, I stood behind him, it didn’t matter if he played well of not for three or four matches. I wanted to see him work hard, to fight, and with him, that was never a doubt.<br /><br />Even then, he was similar to today: if he played below his level, the whole team was below its level. In my Inter, he played behind the striker and regularly entered the opponent’s box. His weaknesses? He was weak in duels, but again so slight that he avoided duels very well.<br /><br />He always worked for the team and I am sure we would have become champions if he had stayed until the end of the season, as we initially agreed with Dinamo. With me, he never played as a defensive midfielder. I wanted him closer to the box. All his team-mates loved him, he was fair and honest and that is always appreciated. And on the pitch he was always the best<br /><br /><b>[Bogdan believes Modric honed his talents on the streets]</b> He was very confident and knew his goal. It was a pleasure to work with him. Today I work with kids at Inter and it is much harder. While Luka was growing up, kids grew up playing football in the streets and we only had to shape them as players. Today kids don’t play as much on the streets any more<br /><br />It is hard to say that we expected him to become the player he is today. I’d say only when he became the main player of Tottenham did we recognise that he was a wonder player</p>
