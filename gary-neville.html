  <p><b>[Gary Neville on himself]</b> I was a central midfield player. At 14 a new batch of players came. I quickly realised I wasn’t going to make it as a central midfield player amongst this group. You watched <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> or <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> as a young 14-year-old - you’re not stupid, you’re looking at people who are incredibly talented, far more talented than you are, and you think, ‘I better work hard here’. I was a hard working kid anyway, but I recognised at that point that I was going to have to work so much harder than I ever could have imagined. So at 16 - it sounds brutal this but I think you sometimes have to be brutal in life - I completely lost touch with all my school friends, and I had great friends at school from the age of 11 to 16. But I made a conscious decision. They wanted different things from their life. They could go to a club, they could go to a pub - I know you’re not supposed to but you just did (laughs). They socialised. I never socialised for two years. I never went out. Literally from the age of 16 to 18, I went to bed half-past-eight/nine o’clock every night. I woke up at half-past-six/seven o’clock every morning. When we had the afternoon off, I trained. In the evening, when everyone went home, I came back and trained with the schoolboys. I just threw my whole life into it for two years</p>

When I was in Paris <b>[for the Champions League win over PSG]</b>, you think about Mason Greenwood, Scott McTominay and Andreas Pereira - players like that. Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard obviously weren’t playing that day but Marcus Rashford did. All these players have played this season and it is brilliant to see, particularly with the results that have been happening. Credit still goes to Jose Mourinho and Louis van Gaal as well, as they gave some of these players opportunities. Even in difficult times, the club continues to try to give opportunities to young players and promote players from the Academy. That isn’t always the case at other clubs.</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Neville says it is nothing new for the club to miss out on major talent in the transfer market]</b> I think United can still attract top-end players because we’ve seen good players come to the club over the last six or seven years. This club will never move away from being a sensational football club, it will have difficult moments and it’s having a difficult time now. The money in the game now means you’re always in competition. The club has lost players when it’s been successful to Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. It lost Robben to Chelsea in the mid-2000s, we lost Nasri to City, don’t always think that when Sir Alex Ferguson was here it didn’t happen.<br /><br />This club lost players when it was successful to some of the biggest clubs in Europe that are competing with United. Don’t think that if United lose players now to Barcelona that this is the first time it’s ever happened, it’s happened before. It’s not because of the current plight, or the coach, or the manager, or the current players. It just happens sometimes. It happened during successful times too.<br /><br /><b>[Neville added that one of Solskjaer’s purported targets, Crystal Palace full-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka, is exactly the type of player United should be courting]</b> He’s a massive talent and the club, to be fair, have always signed young, emerging British talent and I don’t think that should change, and it would seem to me that the club would like to go back down that route and he <b>[Wan-Bissaka]</b> is one. The price is always going to be big because clubs are wise now to it, you can’t pinch players off clubs for £5m or £6m. They are wise to it and have the Premier League funding of £100-odd million so they don’t need to panic, they don’t need extra £5m or £10m, they want £50m or £60m. As long as they sign the right talent, I’m always encouraged. I’m also encouraged by the fact that Marcus Rashford, Jesse Lingard and Scott McTominay are playing.<br /><br />I’m encouraged by the fact the club are giving opportunities to young players, even in these times because for me that’s something that’s part of Manchester United’s history, it’s what Manchester United is. You just have to sign the right players and give them the platform to perform and the belief and opportunity. I’m not in a rush with Manchester United, I don’t have to see them be successful in the next 10 minutes. As long as the principles are right, play good football, bring the right players through, try and win as best you can, don’t give in, good attitude … and for me I can wait for two, three, four, five years for the club to be successful. It isn’t a problem for me. I lived through 20 years as a fan when I was growing up where the club wasn’t successful. I’m not in a rush I just want to see the right things happen and with Ole here as a coach there’s an opportunity for that to happen</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Neville says Harry Winks must be a key player for England if they are to achieve international success]</b> Currently we don’t have enough players who can have that look over their shoulder, see where they are and beat a man. The hardest thing in football is to beat a man with your back to play, but the very best players can do so. The midfield was not ideal against Netherlands. Declan Rice, Fabian Delph, Ross Barkley. That is not an international midfield, whichever way we look at it. I know everyone will look at the mistakes playing out from the back, but I think the midfield was the big problem in the game.<br /><br />It wasn’t just a case of making bad decisions on the ball. We continuously found our defenders having that first look, that first touch, that second look, that second touch, that third look, that third touch. Look at the midfields who have been dominant in recent times in international football. The current French midfield - Matuidi, Pogba, Kante, with Griezmann dropping in. The Spanish midfield with Busquets, Iniesta, Thiago, <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a>. The German midfield of Kroos, Ozil, Schweinsteiger. They’re all rhythm and tempo players, they control the pace of the match. Gareth doesn’t have the players at his disposal.

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville has questioned the mentality of players who court controversy via social media]</b> Why would you do something that is potentially going to bring you criticism? As a player, you have to ask yourself a few questions before doing anything. Is it going to help me? Is it going to make me a better player? Is it going to make people feel better about me? Is it going to earn me money? Is it going to make my coach like me more or less? If the answers come up negative then it’s probably best not doing it. The idea of a guy going on social media, looking a bit of a prat while not winning football matches and not playing that well is a really bad cocktail. But then again, on the other side, he’s giving his all, he’s a young lad and social media is the modern form of media, so get over it.<br /><br />We all make mistakes and I’ve made loads of them. Jesse Lingard doesn’t drink a lot. Twenty years ago, somebody going on a holiday would have been bladdered for four weeks. What’s worse - a social media post where somebody’s having a bit of a joke, or getting bladdered for four weeks? You’d rather have your player being sober, probably training all day and having a joke with his mates. This is absolutely a lesser evil than we had 20 years ago when players would go off for five or six weeks and come back overweight. These players today run faster, they eat better, they drink less alcohol. They’re all running 13, 14km a match, some of them are running 1500m at high intensity and 20 years ago Gary Neville and his team-mates weren’t doing that. That’s why I retired, because I was seeing it in front of my own eyes, that I couldn’t get to that level any more.<br /><br />When we came through there was still a drinking culture Saturday-Wednesday-Saturday, every club was doing it. We stopped, we didn’t do it, and we won four out of our first five league titles purely based on fitness because the rest of the clubs were still drinking. Think of Liverpool and the Spice Boys, they didn’t get that nickname for nothing. They were still going out and drinking. We weren’t</p>

Absolutely not, no. There are some good professionals there, Juan Mata for instance, Ander Herrera, when he was there, and Scott McTominay - you can see he’s a good lad and wants to play football. But I don’t think they carry the influence in the dressing room to be able to dominate the culture and that’s a real problem.

Manchester United are a better team when Paul Pogba plays but if players don’t want to be at the club - that doesn’t mean Pogba, he may want to be at the club - you have to get everybody onside and aligned with where you’re going. Ultimately, that’s the first thing Ole had to do - to work out who was going to be ready for the club moving forward. I’m still unsure on many players. I see the speculation on Sky Sports News and online and it looks like it could be moving all the time. You’ve got to get players in before you let them go because being armed with the money makes you vulnerable.<br /><br />For United, it’s all about timing and manipulating and manoeuvring to a point where they know they’re going to get players in before letting some go. Otherwise they’ll become very easy to target in terms of people bumping the money up, which I’m sure they are already</p>

Manchester United will be in the pit with the rest of the sharks looking for the big signings.<br /><br />It’s difficult for all clubs as they all want the same players. They all want Harry Maguire, every single club wants him. Everybody wants Christian Eriksen. Players that are being bandied about, there are four or five clubs in for them. They aren’t just going to sign for the first club, they’ll choose wisely and look at the different aspects. Manchester United have got a big job to do in order to get a squad right for a championship challenge.

You can’t get out of it in one year, it’s going to take two or three years of good culture and tone, in terms of what they’re doing, to get out of what they’ve done.

  <p><b>[Gary Neville says Manchester United have kept Anthony Martial out of fear of seeing him become one of the best players in the world elsewhere]</b> Martial has not realised his potential on the left side for three or four years and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is probably thinking he wants to play centre forward, he’s a good finisher, I have to give him that chance. You could argue it’s to the detriment of Marcus Rashford, but if he can get his head around playing on the left and be comfortable and Martial can be a centre-forward then it’s worth giving him that chance. At Manchester United when there’s speculation around Martial leaving there’s been a big fear that he will go to another club and become one of the best players in the world because he has got that much talent. I think now is the time for Martial to deliver it. He is being given his chance as a centre-forward and scored a good goal<br /><br />Harry Maguire looks secure and he looks strong. Every time the ball came near him in the air he won it and he never looked any different to how he was for England or Leicester. I think that was the main thing; coming here with a huge price tag in a big game as a Manchester United player for the first time it didn’t look like anything had changed. He has a really good temperament. The hope is that he doesn’t just do his job, but he is a catalyst for strengthening the whole team. The great centre-backs I played with didn’t just help themselves during the game, they also had a big impact on others. We have spoken about Virgil van Dijk doing that at Liverpool. It’s too early to say Maguire will make the same difference as Van Dijk, but there’s a chance. Manchester City wanted Maguire and Manchester United won him and they so needed him. A character, a personality, a leader, a dominant force, he will bring stability to the club for the next five or six years</p>

This summer has been solid, if not spectacular, in the market. It’s a case of can Manchester United get a couple more signings in January and then two or three next summer and slowly rebuild what they want here, which is a team of players who want to be at the club and are committed and motivated and have the quality to challenge for the title. It’s never too far away.

It’s the start of something. They will have to be patient. They have a new strategy, it’s probably the fourth in the last eight years, but stick with this one. Don’t keep going down a path and then ending up back at the roundabout and going down another path and doing the same thing. You have to stick with a strategy. There has been a lack of that in the last few years. It ended up being a brilliant day for Manchester United. I don’t think Ole will get too carried away. He will know it’s early but he will think it’s a big moment. United are building a new team and have Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial, Daniel James, Jesse Lingard and Scott McTominay, there is youth there</p>

People think ‘ah, he’s earning all this money, he should be able to accept it and get on with it’. But it doesn’t work like that. Behind closed doors, it does hurt. You are no different to anybody else. You are human and when people say certain things about you, it bitterly disappoints you. There’s no doubt Paul will be bitterly disappointed. He is still smiling, still laughing but it hurts, definitely</p>

Gary Neville has insisted patience is the key for Manchester United]</b> I think United are going to have moments like that in this period, there is going to be pain and there are going to be defeats that you can’t quite explain. Beating <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> emphatically on the first day, playing well at <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> and could’ve won the game. Then, all of a sudden, you’re up against Crystal Palace and you lose at home - it’s quite mystifying. They’re the type of results you get when you’re trying to develop and change and transition out of one culture to another. All <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> have to do is remain patient and stick to what they’re doing<br /><br />The most important thing about the transfer window for United and <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> is that they don’t make mistakes, not that they do loads of business, but it’s about making sure they have the right type of players. It may seem like too far into the distance but I would suggest four or five transfer windows to get things absolutely right and get back to the type of squad he would want to challenge these <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> teams. I’ve said before, he’s got to be ready, not at the end of this season, not next season, but the one after, to challenge for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title. Potentially when <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> has left <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, or <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have had another round of recruitment and another set of players in…Ole has got to be ready to pounce.<br /><br />It’s a long-term thing, there’s not going to be a quick fix or magic wand from any manager.

I want to see a team building slowly</p>

What I would say is that if <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Laporte</a> is out for a long time, I think it will cost City points because he is a dominant centre-back. I saw him in Spain three times and he’s a great player. It’s a real worry for City. Maguire would’ve been ideal. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> did well to get him but I am surprised City didn’t really go for him alongside United. Maybe they did and they just pulled out because of the money in the end or whatever it was.

I’ve also seen managers go public, as Gareth has. What I would say is that the decision that Gareth has made… I feel like it’s the right one without knowing the detail of what’s gone on.<br /><br />There’s nothing worse than sweeping it under the carpet, and then all the players going back to their own rooms they all share together, and having that feeling that they’re all talking about you being weak, and that you’ve not dealt with it because he’s a big player and <b>[you have]</b> shied away from a big decision. So I feel that it’s the right decision. Ultimately, if it’s an incident that’s happened in front of the rest of the squad that couldn’t be dealt with internally and there was a breach of discipline then the manager has to act</p>

They’re hardened business people who lived through a campaign of green and gold for two years where the fans were essentially battering them, effigies everywhere and they didn’t budge one inch. If Gary Neville comes out tomorrow and says ‘the Glazer ownership is bad for Manchester United’ they’ll just shrug their shoulders and say ‘there’s another one’. I took money off the Glazer family essentially from 2004 to 2011 as a player, so the idea that I leave the club and <b>[am]</b> no longer paid by them and start whinging would compromise me: ‘Oh you were OK when you were taking money off them as a player, and never said anything as a player</p>

It is not a midfield for a mid-table club let alone one of the top spending clubs in Europe, though they have got injury problems and other issues in that area<br /><br />What disappointed me was the lack of penetrating runs with and without the ball of the front three. I felt they could have done much more for the team. That front three are the spark, they are the ones that win the game for this current team. They’ve got so much talent. There are two front threes in this league for the top two clubs, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, that are absolutely outstanding.

What you can’t expect is inconsistency around work ethic, application and attitude. I’ve come to the conclusion on two things. One: they haven’t got senior players setting the standards for them to let them know what’s required in a football team.

But I said it a couple of weeks ago, we’ve just had a General Election in this country, both main parties and the leaders of both main parties <b>[have been]</b> accused constantly over the last month of fuelling racism and accepting racism in their parties.<br /><br />If it’s accepted in the highest office in the country, we’re not talking at a micro-level, we’re talking about it at the absolute highest office in the country. And it’s the same here today, we’ve seen an incident, to be fair which we could say is down to one individual person, but it’s a far bigger problem than that. I think there has to be something that happens quickly. I think we maybe have to empower the players to walk off the pitch and stop the entertainment while it’s happening. That’s the only way I can see it happen.<br /><br />Ultimately, I didn’t walk off the pitch when <b>[fellow pundit and ex-Arsenal and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> player]</b> Ashley <b>[Cole]</b> was abused 15 years ago and you might argue that it’s now okay for me to sit here in my ivory tower of the commentary box and suggest players should walk off the pitch. But I think I would be ashamed of not doing it 15 years ago and absolutely proud of players now to empower them to think, do something about it, take it into your own hands.<br /><br />The <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> have to act because the <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> are there to protect players in this country and players in this country are receiving abuse while playing football and doing their jobs and that is uncacceptable.

  <p><b>[Man Utd legend Neville can see ‘spectacular’ finish to season]</b> The last thing I’m worried about is sorting out the fixtures. If football players need to play every day for nine days to finish <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> as a worst-case scenario, they would do it because they’d get their heads around it and make it a festival of football. It would be something spectacular. Football can bring some hope and joy to the country when we finally come out of this crisis. Doing a festival of football where the league is finished in two weeks, the Champions League gets finished in a week and <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup is finished in four days could be something quite special. I’m not saying they are the examples that should be followed, but there could be something quite spectacular about football fans coming together after this crisis is over. It would bring some joy back to the nation as football does impact so many people<br /><br />The least of my worries are the calendar as once the crisis is over I think footballers, the authorities, the associations will want to play as many matches as psychically possible in a week, a month or a three month period to get everything back on track.<br /><br />If you think about the Christmas period, clubs play four games in eight days. When we were going to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> with <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> we had a backlog of fixtures due to FA Cup and we played four games in a week. It is possible over a six or an eight-week period that there might be four games a week.<br /><br />I’m not concerned about squeezing more games in. Players, clubs, managers and physios will understand that you can’t complain about fixture congestion next season due to the circumstances. It’s a global crisis and football has to react and compromise</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Neville on he idea of staging fixtures with no fans involved once a green light can be given]</b> I said no on this about three or four weeks ago because I felt that it takes away from the essence of football. I also felt that EFL (English Football League) clubs and non-league clubs would suffer too much from the revenue loss and it would put them under. At the moment, the behind closed doors idea has got to come only after the health priority. Will fans turn up outside the stadium? Will fans congregate outside the stadium if their team can get promoted or get relegated, or if they can get into Europe? How are we going to stop that? How are the police going to man it? How are the health services going to react to incidents that happen off the back of it and do we need to put any more pressure on the services at this point in time? However, if those fears could be overcome somewhere down the line within this 12-week period then <b>[behind closed doors games]</b> could be the case</p>

He could do all things; he could score, set up play, run in behind, dribble, bring other players into play - he was the all-round centre-forward. It transpired that whatever combination of the four strikers we had on the pitch that season they all could play together, they all had good combinations with each other. For the treble season alone, <a href="dwight-yorke.html">Yorke</a> and Cole were the best. They were sensational, the way they played together. They lit up the whole league, they lit up Europe.

  <p><b>[Gary Neville believes he failed as <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> manager because he was weak and unqualified for the job]</b> Sometimes ‘no’ is a great word. However, sometimes you’ve got to say ‘yes’ and step up. I’d turned down two <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> enquiries and two Championship enquiries in the 18 months before. I had no intention to go into management. Although I was working with England and <a href="roy-hodgson.html">Roy Hodgson</a>, my role was more concentrating on analysis - like I was doing on Sky - rather than coaching. When Peter <b>[Lim, <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> owner]</b> rang me, he didn’t want to bring in a new manager halfway through the season because he knew he wouldn’t get the man he wanted. He wanted somebody that he trusted to navigate him to the end of the season. I said no initially but then eventually wanted to do it for him.<br /><br />A little bit of arrogance, a little bit of ego - I’d lived through <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> for 20 years, I’d gone to Sky and it had gone well and you feel a little bit unbreakable, like you’re in a position where nothing is going to go wrong.

I think it has helped me even in the last few weeks in respect to what has happened with this <b>[coronavirus]</b> crisis and my businesses, I now act far more decisively and definitely than I have ever acted before because of <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>.<br /><br />I fluffed around a few decisions that I should have made and I knew instinctively at the time that I should have made big decisions and I didn’t.

Never more than a handful each season, never a massive adaptation of the squad. It was controlled, with six or seven young players, 10 in the middle, and three or four that were in their 30s.

The reason it didn’t happen for him, in my opinion, was that we had the best midfield that I think English football has ever produced - and I think will ever produce<br /><br />You had a midfield four that were on another planet, and what the manager was obviously trying to do was see life beyond that midfield four and try to add strength in depth and try to marry that midfield four with Juan Sebastian Veron<br /><br />So if you remember at the time what happened, Scholesy got moved forward one, or Scholesy got moved to the left if Giggsy was injured and <a href="juan-sebastian-veron.html">Juan Sebastian Veron</a> would play in midfield. So that disrupted the quartet<br /><br />The intent was there to try and move the squad forward - I think Carra <b>[Jamie Carragher]</b> has spoken about it with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, with Mane, Salah and <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>, if you go and sign a top player to come into that front three, one of them has to sit out<br /><br />All of a sudden you’ve got an unhappy player on your bench and it disrupts it. And when you’ve got such a set three like that - like we had such a set four - it just became really difficult<br /><br />So that was number one, because we were a 4-4-2 team, and that midfield quartet was so outstanding that he came in and we ended up with a different system. The second thing was the way Seba <a href="juan-sebastian-veron.html">Veron</a> played the game<br /><br />The midfield four we had played in what I would call quite a methodical way, you wouldn’t see <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> pop up on the left wing and <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> on the right wing, you wouldn’t see <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> and <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> cross in midfield if they’re going to get it off each other’s full-back<br /><br />They played a disciplined role - I’m not saying they didn’t go forward - but there was an element of discipline and understanding between them<br /><br />The way Seba played, he’s coming out of Italy, and it’s the way in which actually a lot of midfield players now play, like <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> who’s come to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. He reminds me so much of <a href="juan-sebastian-veron.html">Veron</a>. But the game has developed to a point now whereby players can move into different positions, there’s a lot more fluidity in systems, 4-4-2 doesn’t exist anymore<br /><br />Seba <a href="juan-sebastian-veron.html">Veron</a> was coming into a very methodical 4-4-2 which had really good patterns of play which we all knew, and he was moving across those patterns trying to get the ball from the left-back when <a href="paul-scholes.html">Scholes</a> gets the ball from the left-back as an example<br /><br />He almost was the first player - and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> did the same - who almost broke the code<br /><br />I think <a href="juan-sebastian-veron.html">Veron</a> came in with an interchanging position mindset and a different mindset, into a team that had been set in the patterns. So for me that was why it just didn’t quite happen. It was nothing to do with him as a player or as an individual. He was a brilliant player</p>

June 12 feels a touch early but there’s no reason to go beyond June 19 for a restart. I don’t see players’ fitness being a concern - I don’t see them needing four or five weeks. Even when they’ve had six weeks off for pre-season, within 10 days of going back in they’d be playing games again in pre-season. They wouldn’t be 100 per cent fit but these are uncharted times.

We’re constantly told throughout the season that players are overworked, play too many matches. What we can’t have is a situation where the players have had an eight-week break to then say they need six weeks of training to get back to fitness. That doesn’t feel right.<br /><br />If <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> was borderline fit for the European Championships and was going to be back two weeks before the tournament, he’d be saying he was fit and ready to go. I don’t see the difference with this situation. If this was a major cup final or league game, and a player had been out for eight weeks with an injury and he only had 10 days of training, he’d be fighting to get into that squad. I don’t buy into the need for an extended period of time</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Neville has spoken previously about football’s shutdown not being the same as the period of time between seasons]</b> I would liken it to when a player has had a two-month injury. Most players at some point in their careers would have been out for this period of time. In those two months, you wouldn’t be doing any contact training whatsoever, you’d be doing a little bit of work with the physios maybe before getting back into training, and in the gym, but as soon as you went back into training with the team, within 10 days or two weeks of training, you’d be playing again. So I don’t understand why this is different from what would be an ordinary two-month injury lay-off</p>

That is now a fair representation of what De Gea is as he’s making lots of mistakes. Ones he would never make - he was always somebody you could completely rely upon. It can only be a confidence thing. The arms, legs and body are the same - it’s got to be the mind. The reception he’s got in Spain has affected him. He’s even been booed by Spanish fans when he’s wearing the Spanish shirt. In the World Cup in 2018 he really struggled and from that he’s doubted himself. Mentally he’s not quite the same</p>

The only player really you would say could go into any other team in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, or the world. Since that 2018 World Cup, though, he’s had a real difficult time. What I don’t buy into is that <a href="dean-henderson.html">Dean Henderson</a> at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, obviously from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> on loan, can go into that goal in front of the Stretford End and adapt to what the demands are of being a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> goalkeeper. It takes a special character to play in that goal. What I think <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a> has done in the four or five year period before this last 18 months is build up a lot of credit, whereby he actually deserves a break, the idea he is given the opportunity to correct his form and get it back to where it needs to be.<br /><br />When a goalkeeper, or any player, goes through a rough patch it’s mentally tough. He’s at one of the biggest clubs in the world and the scrutiny is on him constantly.

That is a lonely old place out there to make a mistake if you’re a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> goalkeeper.

It’s not a time to get carried away, it’s still a time to invest and improve the squad but it is a lot better for Solskjaer<br /><br /><a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> have had a great season, for them to be in front of United at this stage is a great achievement.

  <p><b>[Man City ruling: Gary Neville says Financial Fair Play ‘needed this slap around the face’]</b> <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> can’t get a simple disciplinary hearing right - we’ve known that for years and years - and they’re certainly not going to be able to get something right that’s complex<br /><br />They’re an organisation that is ultimately transitioning away from what it has been in the past and this is in some ways a hangover from something that started a few years ago. But it’s no surprise that in a serious court that <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> have won this case because <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> are an organisation that simply cannot organise their own disciplinary measures<br /><br />The idea that they could take on a <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> legal machine that were going to throw everything at this and rightly so, not just because they’ve got the money but because they’re defending their reputation, they were always going to come unstuck<br /><br />I know that’s not what was being debated in the courtroom and legalities of it, but I don’t believe in FFP. I think FFP needed this slap around the face. I said a few months ago, FFP would have prevented Jack Walker doing what he did 30 years ago at Blackburn<br /><br />I know people have issues around potential owners, state ownership and other models but the reality is we’re not talking about that here, we’re talking about Financial Fair Play, the finances and people who can invest into football clubs<br /><br />It’s fundamentally wrong that there are restrictions placed on owners to put money into football clubs. Whether it’s <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> or <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a>, all those stories we’ve had in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> over the last 20 years or so, the addition to challenging <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and other clubs wouldn’t have happened if FFP had been implemented in its truest form. I don’t believe it’s right. There has always been rich owners investing into football clubs and that won’t change today. FFP needs changing to a different model<br /><br />An owner should have to fulfil the obligations he commits to - that is my take on how to create a sustainability model at a football club<br /><br />If <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> are signing contracts worth £200m for the next four years and they have the obligations placed on the club, they should have the money to be able to fulfil that. If the loss per year is £50m, the owner should, whether it’s through a bank guarantee or a bond, have to fulfil the obligations they commit to. They shouldn’t be able to leave what are essentially community assets in a mess<br /><br />We’ve seen it at lower league levels and at the top of the game, owners have to have the money they commit to - that’s it, as far as I’m concerned. So you need a test that has that as its fundamental, not one that restricts people. If you’ve got a trillion quid and you spend a couple of billion, that’s fine. If you spend 100 grand and you’ve only got 50, that’s not fine<br /><br />It’s not about the amount of money someone puts into a football club, it’s about whether than can afford it and it’s a test that needs creating based on that foundation<br /><br /><b>[Neville: A big relief for Man City]</b> It <b>[the ruling]</b> is not surprising. It’s a big relief for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, not just with what they want to achieve in the immediate term, but it would have left a stain on the club in terms of the trophies over the last few years if they had been found guilty of it… and they would have been worthless in a lot of people’s eyes<br /><br />In terms of attracting players, that was being questioned and whether current players would want to stay at the highest level so all of those things will be a relief but I imagine it’s the fact that today, they’ve got through a serious court and overturned the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> decision<br /><br />It also allows them to move forward, sign players and do the things that they want and it won’t be held against them as in ‘I’m not signing because you’re not in Europe’ or ‘Pep’s leaving because they’re not a part of the Champions League’, all that sort of stuff has gone away now<br /><br />It doesn’t affect those teams in the essence of they’ll have to go and win those games like they always thought they would have to. I don’t think <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> would have been banking on what happened with City and I don’t think <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> or <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> would have been either<br /><br />They would have benefited from it but they wouldn’t have been banking on it. They have to win football matches and they can’t have any complaints if they finish fifth and are out of the Champions League on the chance that <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> lose some legal case in Europe somewhere.</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Neville says fans are the only thing missing from positive <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> restart]</b> We are now seeing games that, were they to be played in front of fans, they would create great atmospheres. In the first couple of weeks of restart I found it tough getting used to the conditions of having no fans in the stadiums. Games were played at such a slow pace, it was cautious, players were struggling for match fitness and it was nothing like <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> football. Now we’re at the stage where there is a level of intensity, tackles are flying in and we are seeing the type of game you would expect when fans are in the stadiums. We are getting to a higher level; players are a lot sharper and clever with their movement<br /><br /><b>[Nev: Players demonstrating discipline and sacrifice]</b> The players have responded well, and the restart has been handled incredibly well. It surprises me every week when we get the positive test results. I expected there to be very few positives tests in the early days when players were returning to training because they had been in lockdown, like we all had. I thought there would be more as the country mobilised and the restaurants started to open, but the players have demonstrated an incredible amount of discipline. We’ve hardly seen any positive cases because they are obviously managing themselves well. I expected to see a situation where you would see 20, 30 positive cases and I feared a club may have to drop out. If the players and their families went back out into their normal lives, I only thought football could restart if the players were in a bio-bubble. But we are still seeing so few positive cases and clubs are not playing games without a host of players and for that I am grateful because that really would have been a massive issue in terms of integrity. With Champions League places up for grabs, relegation at stake, if clubs have players missing against a rival that would have been huge. But the restart has been managed incredibly well by <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, the privacy element over testing has been important, and the players and their families have demonstrated an incredible amount of discipline otherwise there would have been more positive tests. We’re not talking about robots here; we’re talking about human beings who do normal things. To only have one, two or three positive tests among the thousands of players and staff in this league demonstrates there is an incredible amount of discipline and sacrifice that exists in football. Footballers are ridiculed when they make a mistake, but they should also be praised when they do things well<br /><br /><b>[Nev: Return of fans signals a return to normality]</b> I was at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> for their win over <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. Had fans been in the stadium when Andriy Yarmolenko scored that late winner, the place would have been bouncing, absolutely rocking. We need that day back. There is no doubt we have to get people back into cities and towns, otherwise the economy will fall over. Manchester and London have been ghost towns compared to what they would usually be and the impact of that is bad on people. From a health point of view they have to make sure people feel safe for fans to return and that it is the right time to do so. Football is being used as a boost. The message to everyone is that football is back, you can watch <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> football now, but fans will be back in stadiums in two months. Once people get back into stadiums, they’ll probably be back in the pub and then they will think they can get back to the office. All of a sudden that feeling of normality resumes and people will go out again. Yes, we will have to social distance, wear masks and make sure we’re sensible and wash our hands, but there is no doubt the government are moving towards that. The announcement <a href="boris-johnson.html">Boris Johnson</a> made could well have been the one that had most impact in demonstrating a return to normality. That’s the power of football in this country, it can create change. Football and footballers can make big changes and have an impact beyond what they do on the pitch and the government have recognised and used that over the last few months in this country</p>
