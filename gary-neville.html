  <p><b>[Gary Neville on himself]</b> I was a central midfield player. At 14 a new batch of players came. I quickly realised I wasn’t going to make it as a central midfield player amongst this group. You watched <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> or <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> as a young 14-year-old - you’re not stupid, you’re looking at people who are incredibly talented, far more talented than you are, and you think, ‘I better work hard here’. I was a hard working kid anyway, but I recognised at that point that I was going to have to work so much harder than I ever could have imagined. So at 16 - it sounds brutal this but I think you sometimes have to be brutal in life - I completely lost touch with all my school friends, and I had great friends at school from the age of 11 to 16. But I made a conscious decision. They wanted different things from their life. They could go to a club, they could go to a pub - I know you’re not supposed to but you just did (laughs). They socialised. I never socialised for two years. I never went out. Literally from the age of 16 to 18, I went to bed half-past-eight/nine o’clock every night. I woke up at half-past-six/seven o’clock every morning. When we had the afternoon off, I trained. In the evening, when everyone went home, I came back and trained with the schoolboys. I just threw my whole life into it for two years</p>

Not in terms of skills necessarily but in terms of passion, commitment and loving the badge. Those are the most important characteristics for United players. Those players will always deliver more. United is a big place to play and you have to have the desire and resilience. I’ve heard people challenge him, saying he’s not good enough, saying get Henrikh Mkhitaryan in, get Anthony Martial in. No, let’s get Lingard in because he has all of the characteristics you want. People are viewing this period as a difficult period but he, Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young are shining like lights because they’ve got the underbelly and fight. What fans want is loyalty and care for the shirt and that is such an important characteristic. It shouldn’t be underestimated what that has been to United since the ’90s.</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Neville admits second shouldn’t be tolerated at Manchester United]</b> You’d say Huddersfield, Southampton, Burnley, Leicester are the games you can look at and say there should be four, five more points on the board. Then you’d say Manchester United would be having a fantastic season but it’s those dropped points combined with what’s happening over the road - the fact the City are so many points clear and the style in which they’re playing. But it’s still better at United than it has been in the past few years. The problem is that when you’ve got such big rivals and such big rivals in management terms as Jose and Pep, everything gets amplified. That’s the nature of a big club like Manchester United - getting criticism as well as the praise. But you have to forget the uncontrollables - don’t feel picked on, because nobody feels sorry for you when you’re at Manchester United; you have to accept and be tough enough to overcome it.<br /><br />They’ve still got trophies to play for - the FA Cup, the Champions League - and they have a real challenge on to finish second in the league. While second shouldn’t be tolerated at Manchester United, it would be an improvement on recent years.</p>

  <p><b>[Pep Guardiola’s naming of six substitutes for Manchester City’s clash with Burnley has been branded a joke]</b> I think it’s a joke, I absolutely think it’s a joke. If you’re a youth team manager at Manchester City, ring him up and ask which kid deserves that boost. Who has been playing well this season and who has worked hard? Forget the second team. Even if they played yesterday, bring one and put them on the bench. Bring a kid to travel with the team, help the kit man and put him on the bench to have the experience of being in a Premier League game. Give someone a boost at the club. If you’re the academy or reserve team manager at Manchester City you must think ‘I’m wasting my time’. Forget the fact they’ve spent however much money, six players on the bench … to me it’s like a protest. I’m not sure why he’s peddling this theme. He’s an absolutely incredible manager and the work he has done with this team is unbelievable and the team performance is absolutely outstanding. Things like that let you down. He doesn’t need to do things like that.<br /><br />He doesn’t have to bring the kid off the bench, the kid could just sit on the bench, travel with the team and have that experience and that feeling. Rather than saying in an interview ‘I haven’t got the players’, he could say he’s brought a young player from the youth team who has been wonderful this season. To me, the opportunity has been missed again to promote the wonderful youth team that Manchester City have got. I don’t know why he is peddling the story of having no players. It’s poor to not bring a young player, really poor. And I can guarantee you the youth team coach and reserve team coach at Man City will feel disheartened by him having six players on the bench. I guarantee you</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho has to win the Premier League title next season]</b> The individual talent is there but to coordinate that into a team is Jose Mourinho’s job in the next few months. He has to make them into a team. They look like a team that play five per cent below the intensity that they can play at and should play at. That’s what Jose Mourinho has to do. He has to mould this talented group of players into a team that can come together and can win the title. Next season will be Jose’s third season and you would think in his mind, and in everyone’s minds, that he has to win it next season. They have to start preparing now. I still think they will finish second and they are still in the FA Cup and Champions League so there is a lot to play for, but they still have these moments where they let games drift. They miss chances, they are sloppy in the final third so many times and they have to improve that. They have to become killers in the final third and they are not at the moment.<br /><br />The job will only be measured by whether Jose Mourinho wins the Premier League. Obviously winning the Champions League would be absolutely acceptable as well, but to win two trophies in his first season to now … he will be disappointed with how far Manchester United are behind Manchester City</p>

  <p><b>[Better players than Paul Pogba have been left out of Manchester United sides in the past]</b> It’s a tough one for Pogba to take because he’s been left out of a big match, but I was at United for 20 years and saw players left out of matches sometimes - players who were probably better than Paul Pogba. He shouldn’t take it as an offence, he should knuckle down as all great players and great characters do when they get dropped, to fight harder and make their way into the team. Over the last 10-15 years you think of Wayne Rooney who’s been dropped, he was one of the greatest players United have had. Other players, Nemanja Vidic at times, Patrice Evra, Rio Ferdinand, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, myself, all players who have played 400, 500, 600 games for the club have been dropped. There’s no given you’re going to play in the team, everyone has to accept it’s going to come to them and you’re going to be dropped and that can be at different parts of your career.<br /><br />The headline out of the game the other night in Seville was obviously that Pogba was dropped but I was delighted that McTominay played, and that Jose Mourinho had faith in a player to go into a really difficult atmosphere in Sevilla and to give him that trust and faith was a really big move. It was suggested that Jose Mourinho wouldn’t give young players a chance but to leave out your record signing and play a kid from your academy in one of his first big games, I would say, is just an incredible show of faith. It’s great for McTominay and great for the academy at United so that young players think they can come in and get a chance in the biggest games. That’s what the club has always been about and where I think it stands apart</p>

  <p><b>[Romelu Lukaku could soon follow Paul Pogba onto the Manchester United bench]</b> My view at the moment is that the one person who is under some pressure is Romelu Lukaku, in terms of his form, and also that Sanchez could go up front, because I’m not sure he’s suited to the right. That may allow Marcus to come back into the team. I think Lukaku has done well this season, but I think there comes a point whereby if both he and Alexis Sanchez are not performing to their best, which they are not at the moment, you’d think Sanchez will be moved up top and Lukaku may come out of the team for a few matches. It’s not because he’s a bad player, but he could come out of the team, freshen up, see the game differently, and then come back in when others have had a go.<br /><br />I think he’s had a lot of playing time this season, he’s had a lot of minutes on the pitch and up until a few games ago had taken part in every match. When you’re a young player coming into the team, ultimately you’re not all of a sudden going to play every game for the rest of your career. Ryan Giggs did that, but that’s an exception. When I came into the squad, or David Beckham, or John O’Shea, Wes Brown - there are periods where you are in the side for 10 or so matches, in a great run of form, then you dip a bit, then you are out of the team, then you come back in. You have that rest, you experience the game from the touchline, you have that period. In my point of view it’s not unusual for any young forward or winger to be in and out of the team, it’s absolutely usual. It’s what I would have expected. If I thought he wasn’t in the manager’s plans, or wasn’t in the frame or in favour, I’d be worried then, but I think Jose Mourinho has proven that he likes Marcus Rashford. But just at the moment, with Alexis Sanchez signing, with Anthony Martial doing quite well recently, he has just fallen behind those two slightly</p>

I think the defence needs strengthening but the main thing is that a team starts to emerge out of the players that they have already got. They have the bulk of the squad that should be challenging for the Premier League but they need to merge in to a team and that’s Jose Mourinho’s job. What he has to do from now until the end of the season is get these players who as individuals are so talented to get them in to a team. It’s not really about individuals stepping up, it’s about them all stepping up.<br /><br />I want to see which combination can play as a front three, which combination as a No 10 and a striker can play together. They’ve got Pogba, Lukaku, <b>[Anthony]</b> Martial, <b>[Marcus]</b> Rashford, Sanchez, <b>[Juan]</b> Mata - what an immense amount of talent to call upon. But the issue is, how do they combine together as a first XI where they can become a strong unit. That for me is the ultimate where you start to see patterns developing and combinations and relationships between players. At the moment they all look like they’re individuals playing in moments rather than being a combination of players playing in harmony together.</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Neville believes that goalkeeper David de Gea is currently the club’s only world-class player]</b> De Gea’s the only world-class player Manchester United have got. You could maybe say Sanchez but not at Manchester United yet, even if he has been at a level for the last five or six years that you would say is world class. But De Gea’s the only player Manchester United have got at this moment in time that I would say has performed for the club at a world-class level. The other player I would say that has done brilliantly well, whether you could say he’s world class or not, is Antonio Valencia over the last two or three years. He’s been outstanding. But to me De Gea is their stand-out player in terms of world standard at the club without a shadow of a doubt<br /><br /><b>[Sanchez’s influence on the decreased game time for fellow forwards Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard]</b> They are getting games, they’re just not going to play every single week and I would expect Manchester United players to be challenging for places all the time. The problem for Jose Mourinho at the moment is how you get Romelu Lukaku, Rashford, Martial and Sanchez into a front combination thanks works together. That’s the big question at the moment, who plays on the right? Martial’s been out there, we’ve seen Sanchez out there in a couple of games, and neither of them are ideal out there. They’d all probably prefer to play centre forward, Rashford, Martial, Sanchez and obviously Lukaku. So at the moment it’s how they fit into a front three which is the most interesting thing, not which one plays. They have to show they can play together</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Neville has a ‘very clear idea’ who will replace Mourinho at Man Utd]</b> I do have an opinion on my own club, but I’m not willing to share it with you because I want Jose Mourinho to continue. I have a very clear idea of who I think the next Manchester United manager should be, but I want Jose Mourinho to be successful first before that happens. I believe he will be successful because he’s always been successful wherever he goes. However, I believed that David Moyes and Louis van Gaal would be successful, because I am a fan of the club and I have to believe in the club’s managers as a fan. You sometimes lose that faith over a period of time watching them, but on the other hand, from a point of view of Jose, now that he’s been supported with a new contract and he’s been supported with investment in the transfer market, the club need to now go the whole hog and make sure they support him in the future, for the next year or two, to be able to win that league<br /><br />Jose is not going to win the league for the first two seasons it looks like, but I’d still advocate him being given that third season to go and try and win it. Jurgen Klopp hasn’t won a trophy yet at Liverpool, but I think the quality of the football and what he’s doing there means that ultimately he should be given more time to try and accomplish it, because the direction looks good. <b>[Mauricio]</b> Pochettino at Tottenham hasn’t won a trophy yet, but the direction and the quality is there. So it’s not always as easy as saying, ‘If they don’t win a trophy do we need to change managers?’ or ‘If they have won trophies, do we stay with them forever?’. It’s more around ‘Is the direction right? Is the quality there? Are the performances good?’ and I suppose it’s when you start to see the plateau and the tailing-off, you start to think ‘oh, here we go’.</p>

The first bit is a bit tactical for a bit of belief. I agree about not taking the ball, not getting on the half-turn as Man City are a great pressing side. But I can’t relate to it, in any way shape or form for the best players and teams in the world. City are the best team in the Premier League by a mile. When they give the ball away, they react. When they win the ball back, everything is quick and at top-speed. They won a cup final last Sunday and they came out on Thursday and they are at it again. There’s no rest. These Chelsea players took a day off. They took a rest. They chucked it in yesterday, those players. Antonio Conte has called us <b>[pundits]</b> stupid, I don’t know the exact quote, but he’ll have watched that back this morning. I know the Juventus team that he played in and I was England coach against his Italy team. His teams work hard, they are aggressive, they are good defensively, they tackle and they know how to play. He will have been equally disgusted. One thing I can guarantee you is the Chelsea boardroom will have watched that performance yesterday and will not accept it. It was nowhere near good enough and it was unacceptable.</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Neville has urged Paul Pogba to concentrate more at Manchester United]</b> Paul Pogba has got the character and personality to play for United, there’s no doubt about that. He’s played in the biggest matches in Europe at a huge club in Juventus. What he has got to do is perform consistently. Some will say it is down to the position he plays, while some will say it is his lack of concentration and focus. It is never a matter of a black and white in the sense that there’s always a player’s reason and always a manager’s reason, but as I look at it he needs to play with higher levels of concentration. Everything about Manchester United is a crisis. Every time they lose a game - like against Sevilla - everything is a crisis and there is no reasoned level being applied.<br /><br /><b>[Neville also discussed Luke Shaw’s situation]</b> To be honest with you, I can’t help feeling the whole Luke Shaw issue is a distraction from the critical aspect of the season. United spent a lot of money and the aspiration was to win the Premier League and go as far as they could in the Champions League and obviously neither have happened. The issue for me isn’t the individuals - whether Shaw, Paul Pogba or Alexis Sanchez are underperforming - but that the team aren’t very consistent, which over the course of Mourinho’s career his teams have always been. If you look at the performances against Liverpool and then Sevilla, they were night and day, and this looks like a group of individuals rather than a group functioning as a team. What I would say about Shaw is that the talent and ability are there, but his job as a footballer is to be prepared to perform every day and do every single thing in his life well to be a United player. At the moment, his potential is not being recognised. I’ve got a great belief in Luke Shaw and the reality is it would be a great shame if he leaves United without fulfilling his potential. There’s a lot of players out there with less ability but maximising their potential and I just hope he can get there</p>

I always think if you’re a wise individual, if you’ve got an element of sense about you, you just don’t draw attention when things aren’t going your way. You keep your head down, you work hard. That’s the basic premise that your parents will tell you, that your manager will tell you, that anyone will tell you. Pogba doesn’t work like that, he always wants attention<br /><br />He’s got a big job to do Paul Pogba, and that is to prove to Manchester United - to the coach, to the fans - that he’s serious about his football. We know he loves his football, but to be serious about your football is different to loving playing it. He obviously enjoys the game, but from my point of view at this moment in time coming here with blue hair today. Win? It’s fine. Lose? That’s going to get mentioned forever more by Man City fans, by Man Utd fans. Why would you even put yourself in that situation? It’s ridiculous</p>

It’s no good shouting and singing and not playing. You have to play well and he hasn’t in the last couple of months and he’s fallen out with his manager. It’s a difficult situation. He is a fantastic footballer and he makes Manchester United a better team. He shows great belief and confidence and shows total confidence in himself - but you have to deliver consistently. Manchester United have shown great faith in him to deliver, they paid a lot of money for him, and there’s a large expectation. The Manchester United badge carries a large responsibility. Manchester United fans don’t want robots, they want characters, but it’s then demonstrating it on the pitch and doing it consistently. He hasn’t done that in the last couple of months, but he is a good lad and a good player and I hope for him and for United that he can start now to affect the biggest matches and win the biggest games.<br /><br />At half-time I could see this getting quite messy for Pogba and the questions Jose would have to be asked about his midfield player. For Pogba to come out in the second half and score those two goals … he needed that, he absolutely needed that more than ever because there were big questions being asked before this game, during this game and at half-time.

  <p><b>[Scott McTominay lacks the ball-playing ability to be a Manchester United midfielder]</b> Pogba has fallen short in terms of quality <b>[this season]</b>, far too inconsistent. McTominay, when I watch him, I’m not sure he’s actually good enough on the ball to be a Man United midfield player. I do think he’s the type that it’s good for him to play games in there - but I do wonder whether if actually he’s got more of a position at centre back eventually, the physicality that he has. He’s a big lad. Is he sharp enough on the ball to be a Man United central midfield player?.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United’s much-maligned brand of football has been defended by Gary Neville]</b> Under David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho it’s been suggested the football is not very good. And every game that goes by Sir Alex Ferguson’s football gets better and better because you forget the bad games, the 1-0s, the horrible defeats. I think we’ve become a bit idealistic about what the football was at times under Sir Alex. I was there for a large part of it, 21 years, and saw every game. Yes, it was mesmerising at times, but from 2003 to 2006 it wasn’t good. I played in that team, it wasn’t good. We weren’t playing at a high level. We were pretty average. So you think about this three-year period or so now and what are you measuring against? Sir Alex’s 1999 or the 2003-2006 period when the football was pretty poor and Jose Mourinho was at Chelsea and destroying us?.<br /><br /><b>[On Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho]</b> These two managers have been at Real Madrid and Barcelona and both won leagues there. Ultimately at the end of next season if Pep wins another league that will be a big problem over a three year period but if Jose was to win the league next year you could actually argue Jose has done the better job. Next season will be critical</p>

I’d like to see Messi play for United or Ronaldo or Neymar or all these players, but the reality is they’ve got to want to come to the club. That’s the first question that needs to be asked. If he wants to come to United then absolutely, yes, because he’s a fantastic player and he is a game changer. For me every top club is looking for that player who is the difference, who can turn the big games.<br /><br />Once the disappointment finishes for all players and the coaching team and the fans, you always have that optimism for next season. That’s the way football always is. You always feel optimistic as a United fan about the next season and what the team can achieve. I’ve never - whether it be as a player, fan growing up, now today, never not felt optimistic going into a season. I’m positive for next season</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho’s criticism of Manchester United’s transfer dealings]</b> There seems to be a disconnect between the board and who Jose thinks should come to the club. It’s intriguing because Jose’s talking about the lack of influence managers have over signings and sporting directors, heads of recruitment having a bigger say. I actually think that’s the way football should go and that coaches should concentrate on football. But who are the people in the boardroom telling him that his signings aren’t right? United haven’t got a sporting director. Sir Alex Ferguson and Bobby Charlton aren’t being consulted. About three or four weeks ago when Jose handed his list to Ed Woodward, it was at that point he was calling on the board and I questioned privately what he was doing. But in the last few days, I can see exactly what he was doing.<br /><br />I think he thinks the board have let him down. They maybe thought the likes of Ivan Perisic and Toby Alderweireld - who I thought was a certainty - are a bit old. But get the players in. Jose was bought here to win. You can’t three-quarters build a house, you have to finish it, you can’t hold back. The club, since they sacked David Moyes, have been on a roundabout, reacting to things without a long-term strategy. Jose Mourino is a great manager - one of the best in the world over the last 15 years - but you have to back him all the way through and it looks to me at the moment like the board have just retreated a little bit. They’ve gone into reverse and said this doesn’t quite fit our philosophy. That philosophy went out of the window five years ago. You’ve now got to deal with the fact the philosophy you’ve got is to win and stop a long period of not winning.</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho has been hindered throughout his time at Manchester United by the really poor signings of Louis van Gaal before him]</b> The club have spent £700m since Sir Alex Ferguson retired, it’s a fortune. If you’d have said to me six years ago that Manchester United were the title winners and then would spend £700m in the next few years, I would have said that they would have won multiple titles. It hasn’t gone well, but you’ve got to remember Jose Mourinho has spent a lot of money, but the Louis van Gaal signings I have to say were really poor. So Jose Mourinho has had to get out of the club seven, eight, nine, 10 players, and then get them in. He’s only been here two years, he’s not been here 15 years. So for me there is still more investment to do to make up for the mistakes in those first three or four seasons. I actually like the signings Jose Mourinho has made, they’re more along the lines of the players I’d like to see at this football club.</p>

You look at that midfield, with <b>[Georginio]</b> Wijnaldum, <b>[Naby]</b> Keita and <b>[James]</b> Milner, with <b>[Jordan]</b> Henderson still to come in. There is some strength in depth there.

The likes of <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane, Salah, Firmino, if you leave space in-behind, they just cut right through you. I think directly there is a threat, and I think indirectly in terms of the bigger picture in the league, certainly with the signings they have made, the good feeling of getting into a Champions League final and finishing in the top four consecutive seasons is something where City will feel a threat. People are not feeling that way about Manchester United or Tottenham or Chelsea at this moment in time, because of what has happened in pre-season. So those teams will have to work their way into City’s thoughts</p>

Woodward was saying why we didn’t sign these centre-backs: ‘This is why we didn’t support Jose in the transfer market.’ Justifying to the media why he didn’t back his manager. Well, it’s too late for that. You gave him a contract extension in January, so back him to the end. My view is he should stay to the very end of that contract and be backed until the end of it. Don’t get me the wrong. The club have supported Jose Mourinho and given him a lot of money. But you cannot go half-rosy. Don’t three-quarters build a house. You have to finish. They had to finish it if they wanted to give him that contract extension in January.<br /><br />With Man Utd’s back four, I don’t think they can win the league. Irrespective of the manager, Man Utd need new centre-backs. My view is Maguire and Alderweireld would have been good options. If it costs them £120 million <b>[$153m]</b> to bring them in, that is what you have to do in backing Jose Mourinho. If Ed Woodward was going to doubt Jose Mourinho, the time to doubt him was at the point whereby he should have said he wouldn’t have given him a new contract in January. The minute he gave him a contract extension – which some say was unnecessary partway a season - and by showing him faith, he had to buy him the centre-backs</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho should be given the chance to put things right at Manchester United]</b> We saw Louis van Gaal sacked after an FA Cup final victory, we saw David Moyes sacked with four games to go of a season, so we are no longer talking about a football club that is behaving as it has historically done. I accept these are different times and I accept the difficulties and challenges, but my honest view as I stand here now is that Ed Woodward gave him a contract last season, only seven or eight months ago, and he should see that contract through to the end and do the job. You can’t keep jumping around with managers. I hear the third-year Mourinho stories and all the rest of it and you can’t disagree with those stories because there is some history. But what I would say is it’s time now for Manchester United to batten down the hatches and for Jose Mourinho and Ed Woodward to sort themselves out if there is a problem there. Get the team right for the rest of the season because the club is bigger than any individual. They have to get themselves sorted because it’s not a time for in-fighting and politics.<br /><br />He saw the end of his contract at Inter Milan, he saw the end of his contract at Porto and he saw the end of his contract at Real Madrid. It’s only at Chelsea, which is a club of madness, where this has happened. At Inter Milan, Porto and Real Madrid he saw it to the end so let’s not rewrite history. At Chelsea, everybody dies a little bit early. It’s that type of club, he’s not on his own there. It was tough for him at Real Madrid and he got through to the end of the season. I don’t see it happening during the season. To suggest that Manchester United are like Chelsea is not right. I have to say Manchester United still do things slightly differently. In the last few years there has been an erosion of the beliefs. Jamie Carragher said last week the morals and traditions and bringing through British kids has gone out of the window when they sacked David Moyes and brought in Louis van Gaal. I get that and I understand that, but it is still too early - three games into the season - to start suggesting there should be a change of manager. Nothing could be further from the truth. It has to be that Jose Mourinho is allowed to go through and complete this season. If he does well he should go through the next season as well, which is when his contract runs out</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho’s struggles at Manchester United have left him facing the biggest task he’s ever had]</b> The manager is always the one where the buck stops and Jose Mourinho has been the most successful manager in football in the last 20 years, along with Pep Guardiola, and he’s going through a difficult moment over a couple of seasons. This is the biggest task he’s ever had in his life in football and he’s got to come out of it. I look at the squad and the team and I’m not sure what the best XI is, what the best strike force is, I’m not sure there’s a back four there. You are just going to have to back certain players and go with them and stick with it, rather than changing it every single game. The buck stops with the manager and I have to say, at the moment, it doesn’t look a balanced outfit there at all.<br /><br />Before the game we didn’t have a clue how Manchester United were going to set up and I’m not sure anyone would have picked that starting system. They may have worked on it in the last four or five days, but Tottenham are so consistent and so stable.

  <p><b>[Harry Kane is suffering from playing too many games]</b> There are questions about how fatigue will be affecting this England team after the summer, especially Harry Kane, and there will be players who might be starting to feel it now and not feeling as strong or fit. It’s not one tournament, it’s the accumulation of the physical demands where you haven’t had any breaks. It usually hits you at three years without a real break and I did struggle in the 2000-01 season at the age of around 25. I hit a wall after I’d played in Euro 1996, the Tournoi in 1997, World Cup 1998, won the 1999 treble and then we went on a summer tour and all of that took it out of me. There’s no doubt that they need that month or two break. However, they will naturally pick up injuries which will give them that break and allow their whole body to recover.<br /><br />I think with Harry and other players who play week in week out, Saturday-Wednesday and all summer, what you would say is they continue to soldier on and maybe do dip in sharpness, but their level is still high enough to play. So, it is very difficult for a manager to give them a break because they look tired. Harry is playing at a high level, perhaps not at his peak, but there’s no way you can rest your captain for a competitive fixture. Historically, there were times where you could do deals between club and international managers to deal with fatigue, when there were friendly games around November, but I just don’t think players would want to miss these games<br /><br />It annoys me that Marcus Rashford doesn’t play down the middle. When he emerged, he was a centre-forward and scored. But as he’s got the pace and the know-how to drop back, he’s been turned into a winger. He should be playing up the centre. Rashford and even someone like Dominic Calvert-Lewin won’t play through the middle due to Romelu Lukaku and Cenk Tosun. Are they going to play at the level in order to push the current strikers in the England team? We’re going to need these players to get playing and get scoring in order to push people like Harry Kane</p>

Jurgen Klopp is yet to win anything, but there’s a buy-in to what he’s doing at Liverpool. Manchester United have to buy in to Jose Mourinho as manager, give him the confidence and not undermine him and just go with it. Because if Jose was to be changed in the next couple of weeks, the new manager will see a few players he doesn’t like and then you’re in that cycle of continually changing. I’m not sure this is a case where a new manager can come in and hit the ground running, pick a team up and be champions in 12 months. Jose is a serial win, and I don’t buy into this theory that he’s finished, that he’s a manager of yesterday. I heard that from 2003 to 2006 about Sir Alex Ferguson when Arsene Wenger and Rafa Benitez and Jose Mourinho first came to England. There were suggestions that it was the end of Sir Alex, but he needed to build a new team, and Jose needs time to work it out. I hope the club can back Jose with the players he wants in January, and the players he doesn’t want. That’s the key thing. I’ve got the feeling in the last few months that the club have retreated a little bit on him in the transfer market, but maybe even retreated on him in terms of the players he doesn’t want. I feel there’s maybe a tug-of-war <b>[between Mourinho and the board]</b> and that needs to stop<br /><br />In some ways, it was better for Jose Mourinho to win like that <b>[against Newcastle on Saturday]</b> than it was to win 3-0. If you beat Newcastle 3-0, everyone would say well Manchester United should beat Newcastle comfortably, the money they’ve spent, where Newcastle are in the league. But the way United were playing for 60, 70 minutes, and the way Newcastle were playing, you think that if they really aren’t with the manager, if they really don’t want to wear the shirt, if they really don’t have that spirit, we’re really now going to find out. But the players in the last 25 minutes responded, and they were fighting for everything, they were pushing until the end. It was a little bit messy, it wasn’t the perfect performance in football terms. The international break is probably a welcome break for Jose Mourinho, the board and for the players, but it all happens (when they return) in about a month and that’s when we’ll find out where they’re at this season. In terms of those earlier reports emanating that Jose wouldn’t be at the club, I’d be stunned if he wasn’t at Stamford Bridge in a couple of weeks’ time because ultimately the game was won <b>[against Newcastle]</b> and you could see the spirit at the club</p>

He did something that none of the rest could do and that’s control the tempo of a football match and when we talk about England not controlling a game, that’s the thing the likes of Pirlo, Modric, Xabi Alonso and Xavi can do - they’re the type of players you need at international level if you want to control games.<br /><br />If you look at England’s players coming through, there’s a lack of understanding about what controlling a game is and that can really influence the tempo of a match and make a game move at the pace they want it to. It’s about when to play long and when to play short and our players don’t seem to be able to know how to dictate the pace of games at international level.

If you think of Lukaku, <b>[Alexis]</b> Sanchez, Martial and Rashford, they need more from them. I want to see more runs past Lukaku. I want the two wide players, whoever they are - you see what Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah do for Liverpool, how they make those narrow runs inside. I’m not saying they have to play narrow but wherever you start, you’ve got to end up in goalscoring positions more often and you’ve got to show that little bit of quality and composure in the final third. I know they’re still young, but they’ve had two or three seasons in the first team and yes, it took Cristiano Ronaldo three or four seasons so there is still that growth to come, but they are getting lots of chances. They could score 20 goals a season from those positions and Lukaku could score 25 - that’s a target of 65 goals. Is 65 goals between those players, including Sanchez, too much to ask?

It was a big moment for the Chelsea team, fans and staff so they’re entitled to over celebrate, you always do with a last minute goal. Jose Mourinho actually came onto the scene at Old Trafford sliding down the touchline. My view is I would like to see it more if it was my team celebrating, but I love to see that emotion in football where you see people just lose it - not in a violent way - but in an emotional way.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United’s inconsistency and recent record in the transfer market has Gary Neville baffled]</b> I do not know where it ends. Chelsea on Saturday was encouraging, but the problem with United at the moment is the inconsistency, you just do not know what you are going to get. Jose Mourinho’s career has been built on reliability and consistency and he is getting anything but that at the moment and I do not know where it ends. Even from half to half you are not sure what you are going to get.<br /><br />There are a number of different factors <b>[why the team is not performing]</b>. I can see where the players are lacking in confidence. You look at someone like Romelu Lukaku - at the World Cup he looked absolutely incredible and then you look at him at United in the last few weeks and he just looks a little bit down. He does not have the same mobility and energy in his body language and that can only be confidence, and that happens in players’ careers and happened to all of us<br /><br />After the game against Juventus, his comments - some would say they were honest as when I saw the two team sheets before the game, I thought they were two completely different worlds in terms of players. But it is not just money, a lot of money has been spent on that United team. The reality is the recruitment has been poor for four or five years. There has been no consistency, strategy behind the recruitment. You have three or four different managers and different styles of managers’ players in the same squad, where the club should always sign players that fit their profile. And then if the manager leaves, you will always have players who believe in the club system. And at the moment, I do not see that, you have a collection of different players from different managers who believe in different things and Jose is trying to work them into a unit and he is finding it very difficult</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Neville says he is torn on Anthony Martial]</b> I think it’s probably the general answer of everybody that gets offered a new contract nowadays, that they turn a new one down. He probably wants the same level of money some of the other players in the squad are on, he is probably looking at his options externally. From that point of view, at this moment in time, it doesn’t surprise me at all that he’s turned it down<br /><br />He’s got unbelievable talent, the ability to become one of the best in the world, he just needs confidence, belief and to play in a team that’s successful and all of a sudden we’ll see the real Martial. On the other hand I’d look at it thinking his body language isn’t great, his movement off the ball isn’t great, he does not make enough moves between the right back and centre back. He doesn’t drive at people often enough in the final third and commit them, doesn’t actually have great quality when the ball is at his feet and he works his way in from the left. I am so torn, I think that’s where fans are as well, he is a bit of a conundrum in the sense you don’t want to lose him and think of what he might become. On the other hand he may need to leave to become what he might become. Diego Forlan had to play in Spain to become one of the best strikers in La Liga, there are players who have to leave sometimes to achieve what they want. Then there are sometimes players who achieve what they want, Cristiano Ronaldo it just hit him after three seasons and he became incredible. So I am really torn, it feels like I am sitting on the fence, but it is the reality I am at, I cannot make my mind up on him and I am not sure if that’s good or bad three years in.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United legend Gary Neville has defended manager Jose Mourinho amid recent criticism]</b> Forget everything else. If Jose Mourinho left Manchester United today then in his two-and-a-half years he will have won two major trophies, lost an FA Cup final, finished second in the league and qualified for the Champions League two seasons running. And had the best finish in the Premier League since Sir Alex retired. If Jose left today he would tell that story. And we are looking at it from the point of view of perfection. If you had said they would have this three-year period when I was a United fan as a kid, I would have snatched your hand off. In my childhood we won two FA Cups in 11 years! It doesn’t help that Man City and Liverpool are doing so well. So there are a lot of factors. It is only a period in a 20-year management career and I think Jose will be successful again.<br /><br />I do get Jose Mourinho’s part of it as well when he says: ‘Hang on a second, let’s not rewrite history’. He’s compared to history, and he should be. Even if you compare it to his own record. He would only compare it to his own record and history. In some ways he won’t be accepting what’s happening at the moment, but if we’re being balanced - and I’m thinking partly as a fan - you’ve got to look back at the bigger picture. In my 43 years of living, this is not an unsuccessful period. This is not an unsuccessful period in Manchester United’s 100-plus year history. This is an unsuccessful period compared to the glory years. And the glory years should be where we measure the club by, always. Fans, media and pundits. But we should all have perspective as well<br /><br />When you think about Manchester United in the bad times - and this seems a bad time - the club still wins trophies. If you look at the last five years since Sir Alex finished, an FA Cup, a Europa League, a League Cup, and FA Cup final, that’s three trophies in five years since Sir Alex Ferguson left. Liverpool haven’t won a trophy, Tottenham haven’t won a trophy, Arsenal: two cups. Manchester United are more successful than all of them</p>

  <p><b>[Mauricio Pochettino has already laid the foundations for his departure from Tottenham]</b> Pochettino has always peddled the party line well. We know what Tottenham are like in terms of being quite conservative and pragmatic with spending and they do what they can, but he has always managed things well and pushed away questions about why can’t you spend like other clubs do. Pochettino is a brilliant coach but at some point he was always going to want to manage one of the super clubs in Europe. There are a couple at the moment that you can imagine will be changing manager in the next 12 months and looking at him, and he will know they are looking at him. It feels to me that he has laid the first foundations for a move away from the club and started to prepare the ground.<br /><br />I said before the game it’s the first bricks in the foundations of potentially wanting to leave and during the game tonight the Real Madrid coach has been sacked. If you are Real Madrid and you are thinking ‘Where can I get a manager, where’s the next manager?’ He speaks Spanish and has been a coach in La Liga. That is an appealing job for anybody in world football. He took the job knowing Daniel Levy, the board at the Tottenham, the restrictions, so my view is that now he probably wants that next level of job because he deserves it as he is a brilliant coach. That next level is available at arguably the greatest club in the world of football in Real Madrid. That’s where the manager might be thinking ‘is this now the time for me to step out?’ I think Tottenham, if Real Madrid want him, will have a real problem in the next few days. I don’t think they do, we are just putting two and two together, but we spoke about the timing of his comments, and is the timing because a job has become available?<br /><br />The season so far, it’s strange because my feeling is the worst feeling I’ve had in the five years that I’ve been here. It’s the worst. My feeling, but it’s the best start ever for the club in the Premier League. It’s strange, no? I don’t know, it’s so difficult to explain because many things happen, I am disappointed we are still waiting for the new stadium when the expectation was to be there at the beginning of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho can be impossible as a winner or loser]</b> Some people might may not like that but I love that about him. I think there should be reaction and passion at the end of a match. I even like his reaction at the end of the game against Newcastle, which the FA have appealed against. To me, Jose’s best qualities were always that he was impossible when he was losing and impossible when he was winning and it was always enthralling to watch and he always brought everyone along the line. When I think of him in the press conference after the Juventus game and some of the one liners he came out with, compared to where he was a few weeks ago, and the day before the Newcastle game, that’s a massive difference. He has hung in there and shown determination.<br /><br />It was getting close, it was feeling like something was happening and the world was collapsing around the team, the club, the manager and it felt like there was going to be a change, and I think the Chelsea game was the big one. Even though you could point towards Newcastle, which was huge, nearly winning at Stamford Bridge and getting within a second of winning will have given the players confidence and since then they have grown and grown<br /><br />The performances are still not wonderful. I thought they played quite well against Juventus but the big thing is they have this resilience and doggedness which is a great quality to have. We are not watching Manchester United at their free-flowing best, we are not watching Manchester United play anywhere near 100 per cent, but what we are seeing is they are hanging in games where they are getting outplayed and they are hanging in there at moments when they are getting outplayed. Against Bournemouth, they could have been 3-0 down after the first 20 minutes but it was only 1-0. Things like that happen and then what they do is play in moments. They come alive in moments in games. Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial, or one of the other players, come alive and deliver a moment that means they are getting goals. That is what’s happening at the moment and it will be building confidence and belief and keeping the clouds away</p>

I did not think it three or four weeks ago, but in the last few weeks there have just been signs that they could pull away. They do not look like they are blinking, or wilting in any way, shape or form. I thought that the Wolves game was a game that could give others encouragement. It has not proved to be the case. They have destroyed everything in front of them and they are playing at such a high level. So I think at this moment in time, other teams will be looking at Man Utd to pull points off Man City. The league will be.<br /><br />I do not think there is a soft point to this Man City team because you could look at the centre-backs and say: ‘If they are exposed, you could get at them.’ But they are very rarely exposed, you do not get chances against them that much. You could look at David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne in central midfield and lazily say - 12 months ago I’m sure managers were saying: ‘Let’s run off them because they are not the best defenders’. But they have proven in transition and in defending these last 12 months that they react better than most. You talk about a defensive midfield player and his role, like Fernandinho, and it is obvious - every time Man City give the ball away, he makes tackles and breaks up play. But David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne, the way in which when Man City lose the ball they react and their reaction to winning the ball back is fantastic. So actually now you are sat here thinking ‘there is not actually that big a weakness there’, because they have removed it and proven over 50-60 games now these players that they can cope with these teams that play direct, the teams that play quickly, the teams that press from the front, the teams who drop off and play with a deep defence. They have proven against all opposition - when you win the league, you play against all different types of opposition, they have removed all doubts. What they have to do is retain their consistency and standards. And that is what they have done at the start of this season</p>

To carry that through the scrutiny he has, the price tag, he still carries that weight in the Manchester United team and they look to him.

I don’t think it would have been acceptable at the start of the season, and certainly the start of last season, to say the top four is achievable, because he will have wanted to challenge for the title with the money that has been spent. That’s where United need to be. But they’re not near that level at this moment in time, and it typifies really what they are at the moment, which is inconsistent.

  <p><b>[Neville backs Guardiola’s Man City to go down as Premier League greats]</b> Pep doesn’t measure a game of football in the same way we do. 4-0, you’re patting yourselves on the back in the dressing room after the game, but he sets a standard which is different to everyone else’s. Sometimes I think he also wants to send a message to his players that when he sees a little complacency or things that aren’t right, he’ll stamp on it. He won’t allow a drop in standard in any way and it’s been apparent this season that when they’ve won a league, there’s been a big dip. Every single day until the end of the season, he will make sure that little bit of complacency doesn’t creep in at any moment in any game.<br /><br />Back-to-back championships is what he’s desperate for and what he needs, and what he thinks is right for teams he manages. He knows that will take them from a great achievement last season to a great side. That’s what they’re looking like at this moment in time. He knows there are tougher tests to come where, if they do drop, they will get punished. But at the moment they look unbreakable. It looks like you can’t touch them</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United’s loss of strength has forced them to overpay to keep their stars]</b> Manchester United feels like a football club which is having to overpay to keep players because they are not in a position of strength, they are running their contracts down basically. It’s happened since Sir Alex Ferguson left - with Wayne Rooney, Adnan Januzaj, David de Gea before, Anthony Martial. Players are being allowed to run them down because the club isn’t in a position of strength, then they are having to overpay<br /><br />Other clubs are having to pay, don’t get me wrong, but are basically in a strong position where they say: ‘No problem, we’ll sell you and get another player for this team, they are queuing up to play’ and that’s the problem Manchester United have at this moment in time. They have lost their strength, bargaining and having to overpay and negotiate hard with their own players.

  <p><b>[Manchester United are so naïve it’s unbelievable]</b> Will Mourinho leave? I think it will happen, my preference would always be to get to the end of the season. But the boardroom is so naive it’s unbelievable, to give him an extended contract knowing the cycle of Mourinho and his three years. The third year is always the difficult year for him. So 18 months in, with United second in the league having won two trophies in his first season, that was the point where the board had to hold their nerve and keep him hungry in that third season. The minute he came back from pre-season he was at it and the club lost control. There isn’t that experience or knowledge of the club above him to be able to manage, control and handle him. His agent was out last week, he goes into press conferences and you don’t know what he’s going to say next and they don’t know what to do with him. They are paying the price now. The problem they will have now is that it will cost an absolute fortune to lose him and when you lose a manager midway through a season, there’s the situation of who is going to come in. What do they want for the next three or four years at the club? Because it’s not as easy as saying get rid of the manager. Manchester United need to reset. It’s not just the manager, it’s deeper than that. There is an incredible level of naivety and they lost control of the club when they gave him a new contract, they should never have done that. The minute he came out in that pre-season press conference the club should have gripped him and said, ‘we’re Manchester United, one more of those and…’ They’ve got to get a grip of their club.<br /><br />United fans don’t want to go to games, they are not looking forward to matches. That’s not just now, that was under David Moyes and it was the manager’s fault, under Louis van Gaal and it was the manager’s fault and now under Mourinho and it’s the manager’s fault. Three good managers that have good records - one of them the best in the last 20 years alongside Pep Guardiola - and that’s why you have to say something is broken. I’m sure Manchester United will change the manager at the end of the season at the latest, we’re all pretty certain of that. But there’s a multitude of issues, it’s more complex than the manager getting the best out of the players or not being backed. It’s a deep problem, it needs resetting, the whole club needs resetting</p>

There was an immediate bounce and impact from Ole, however it was Cardiff and we need to see if they can do it over six months.

  <p><b>[Gary Neville believes Mauricio Pochettino appears the natural choice to take over as Manchester United manager]</b> The win over Spurs changed my thinking a little bit. <b>[Solskjaer]</b> got it right and in the first half won the tactical battle. Yes, in the second half David De Gea made a lot of saves, and Tottenham should probably have equalised, but in the first half he went to a diamond with split strikers. It was a risk and I’ve not seen United do that in any game in the last two to three years. So he introduced a new system, a new shape and a new way of playing in his biggest match. He did what Manchester United managers should do - he took risks to win and he went for it. I thought it was a big moment that, for Ole.<br /><br />I do have conflicting views. Personally, I would want <b>[Solskjaer]</b> to have a shot at the job he’s got now. But on the other hand, I want the club to make an unemotional decision. Is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the best person for the job? If the answer is ‘yes’ at the end of the season because he’s got them into the top four and they’ve won the FA Cup, you’d say: ‘How can you not give him the job?’ I’m not going to change from this. I said United should go for the best off the pitch football brain in the world and the best head coach in the world they can get. And if that’s Ole at the end of the season … I go back to that Pochettino always was the one who stood out for me as the one, in terms of the football, values and bringing through young players, like what he’s done at Tottenham and Southampton. Over a period of time it feels to me like he would be the natural choice. However, you look at what Del Bosque did at Real Madrid when he picked up the team, or like what Di Matteo did in that six months at Chelsea. It feels like what Ole’s doing, like he’s having that sort of time now<br /><br />He’s had his failure at Cardiff, which is a good thing. It brings you right back down to earth and gives you a slap. It lets you know where you’re at. So Ole failing at Cardiff makes him a stronger manager at Manchester United and he’s now realising he’s got a chance. He’s been at Cardiff, Molde and now United, so he’s been on a journey as a young coach that he should go through and he’s immersed himself in it every day<br /><br />Ed Woodward, the board and the Glazers have got a really difficult decision, the more Ole wins. It gets harder for them. Is he the best man for the job? He might just be. United have appointed externally the last three times and it’s failed, so considering an internal appointment, which is what Ole is, could it be the way forward? I’d have said no six weeks ago, but seeing the job Ole’s now done …. we have to judge it at the end of the season. But I said to someone last week, whatever Manchester United do, they cannot allow a manager to walk through those doors ever again and bring their own philosophy that sits outside the principles of what United are, which is entertaining, attacking football, playing with risk with young players that come through the academy</p>

They need someone with authority. You watch Virgil van Dijk or Thiago Silva, they’re world-class centre-backs and United need someone like that. I would say three defenders, one midfielder and one forward, because of the form of Alexis Sanchez. Unless he completely changes what he’s doing in the next few months, United need another forward. I’d say they need five additions to the squad. Then the squad would be in good shape and could challenge.</p>

You wouldn’t do. You’d stick to the plan.<br /><br />There was no doubt before the game for me. After the game, he can name the length of his contract, he can name his salary, he can put a statue outside of the ground wherever he wants. He can do whatever he wants after that<br /><br />This feels out of this world just because of the size of the task, and also the team Manchester United had tonight. <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> had to play the young boys, all the midfield is gone, Martial is not there.

The board at United have tried everything - they’ve tried one of the best manager in the world in Jose Mourinho, the experienced guy in Louis van Gaal, who had been at all the biggest clubs in Europe and then you think about giving it to David Moyes, which is the approach the club had always taken about the British manager who deserves a chance.

  <p><b>[Manchester United should be prioritising defensive additions under <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>]</b> Defence is the main priority in terms of getting the centre-back pairings right because there have been so many changes. I think the defence is actually doing very well, it looks makeshift on paper but it outpunches its weight when you think about it. Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young have been doing brilliantly well at right and left-back for a few years, Luke Shaw has started to perform really well in the last few months. Victor Lindelof has had a good season, Chris Smalling’s doing well but in terms of that dominant presence, that is probably the key thing. A full-back and a centre-back in there, although there are other areas of the team. <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskajer</a> does need the right support around him now and that was something I said a few months ago. The structures and the quality of the people around him to ensure Manchester United get ahead of the game in recruitment is critical. <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> is not going to be a success at Man United unless he gets the right people around him on recruitment and gets the right players in. That is absolutely essential. And the amount of money Man United will spend will be big, but over the last few years, the club haven’t fallen short and have always supported the managers. I don’t think the club will fall short in financial terms, they will spend the money. It is in the back of my mind that the players have been fantastic in these last few months for Ole, but they are the same players that downed tools under Jose Mourinho and I’m conscious in my mind that the players need to maintain that same level of concentration, determination and attitude now that Ole has been made the permanent manager. That is the critical thing - getting the signings right, getting the people around Ole right and making sure that the players, although the performances have improved, can continue to maintain the levels they’ve been at over the last three months and don’t dip back to where they were before</p>

So what you have to look at is how United bridge that gap, and yes they will do that through the spirit that <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> has created, but they have to get better players on the pitch that can compete with Liverpool and City to go along with some of the very good players they’ve already got.

  <p><b>[There would be ‘uproar’ if Callum Hudson-Odoi left Chelsea]</b> He’s a huge talent. It’s got to the point now that it’s one big problem. Chelsea have had such successful youth teams, carried some of the best young talents - not just from England but also from Europe as well and internationally - and not given them an opportunity in the first team. I think there would be uproar if Hudson-Odoi was allowed to leave Chelsea without a chance. All the talk of Eden Hazard leaving to go to Real Madrid… this feels like a sort of crossroads moment for Chelsea in terms of their belief in a young player, to give him the opportunity. Chelsea have failed so many times over the last five or six years to give young players their opportunity. They’ve offloaded those players and they’ve gone on to thrive elsewhere. This is the moment for them to believe in their own. He’s started 14 matches this season for Chelsea - that is appalling. A player with his ability needs to develop further and he needs more games in the bank to build up his resilience, robustness and learning.<br /><br />What I would say is, though, is having a distraction like a contract hanging over you for 18 months in your most formative years, the years in which you’re growing the most, learning the most. People eventually think you’re a money-grabber, fans start to turn. Does he really want that in his life as well? I look at both sides of it and I think is there a way for him to sign a contract with Chelsea, his boyhood club, in a way in which potentially gives Chelsea the security they want and the player the stability that he needs to develop his career. He should be playing in the first team. He should be playing more games. But let’s say Chelsea don’t play him next season or only play him ten matches. He <b>[could]</b> have a clause in there that says if you don’t play him more than a certain amount of matches that he’s then allowed to leave for five million, ten million, something like that. That’ll incentivise the club to play him but gives them stability. I think when young players have distractions in their head about contracts and money it’s not great for them. Their agents are into them, the clubs are in to them. Just play football. Learn every day about football and don’t think about contracts and money</p>

I always thought end of March early April was the right time to announce it if it was going to be Ole because I think if you’re going to do your work for next season you’ve got to make a decision. Ole now is finding out more about these players in the last month than he did in the first six to eight weeks when everything was golden. It was unbelievable, the run that they went on, the PSG game was one of the best nights I’ve ever had as a United fan. It was crazy but mad, but it felt so United, coming back, achieving the unthinkable. And all of a sudden in the last month or so the reality has kicked in and they’ve started to show vulnerabilities. They’ve started to perform at times like earlier in the season, games are harder to win. And what it does is it just sobers everyone up a little bit. A month ago it was ‘the players were fantastic, they’re better than they were, and Jose just couldn’t get the best out of them’. Now what we’re seeing is probably what the players are, the form under Ole in the first two or three months was Championship-winning form, Premier League title form, they were the best team in the league for that period, and all of a sudden now they look like what they are. And it’s never as good or a bad as it seems, but I’m actually happy that they gave Ole the job, he’s been able to see the players’ mentality in these last four or five weeks</p>

For 20 years this club had this perfect situation where they were strong enough to lose players knowing they wouldn’t upset the rest of the squad and cause disruption, but they are not in that position anymore.<br /><br />Manchester City have been the best club in the Premier League the last few years but they lost Virgil van Dijk to Liverpool because they paid more money, they lost Alexis Sanchez to United because they paid a lot more money, and lost Jorginho to Chelsea because of a relationship with the manager. You still lose players at the very top because there are other factors</p>

  <p><b>[Romelu Lukaku has been accused of looking unfit]</b> Lukaku is the most interesting for me. You watch him for 25 minutes and he looks like a world beater. Then you see him make one big run and he looks absolutely shot. He was a brilliant performer, then you say to yourself he always looks tired after one or two big runs. He’s a big decision. I’ve got very little sympathy for anyone who’s unfit as a professional footballer.<br /><br />Football players, they’re like a clock ticking, they should know their bodies inside out. You get to that point as a football player, there’s a routine. I’m not sure how he hasn’t corrected it and found a system during the week which is his training, his nutrition. It’s not a reflection against the sport science of the club, it’s something that’s not quite right</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Neville has taken aim at at his former club]</b> As a group of players, I don’t like them. You grow to like teams and you grow to not like teams. I’ve never not liked a Manchester United team, I’ve always thought the team can win, the team can lose, the team can draw, but I really struggle with this team. Tottenham finished sixth in Mauricio Pochettino’s first season in charge and that’s the level this Manchester United are at. The idea that this United team is better that it suggests - it’s not. It’s a really average team for what United needs to be.<br /><br />What pains me the most is that the two clubs that I dislike the most (Liverpool and Man City) I see them doing everything right. I see a spirit, a hunger, a resilience, a toughness, going until the end. The idea that United should be talking about winning the Champions League and the Premier League at this moment is nonsensical. Forget it. The first thing they have to do is cleanse the dressing room, cleanse the club. That’s from the top to the bottom, too, it doesn’t just start in the dressing room, above that needs to be dealt with as well. They need someone to run the football side of the club. This is a five-year project.<br /><br />Jose Mourinho, at the time, told us that it was his greatest ever achievement finishing second with that team. We all laughed at him - he’s joking, that’s just Jose playing games. Maybe he was right</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Neville puzzled by lack of transfer support at Old Trafford]</b> They’ve had coaches over the last six to seven years who have been best-in-class. Jose Mourinho was an equal in relation to Pep Guardiola in terms of success over 20 years. Louis van Gaal is one of the most experienced managers over the past 25 years.<br /><br />They’ve experienced best-in-class coaches who have failed. You have to say to yourself, is it just the coach? There’s a cultural problem. It’s deep, the decisions are bad. The choices are poor. Who’s signing the players this summer? At every other club in the country, I could tell you who’s in charge of signings. I haven’t got a clue at Manchester United. They’ve still got Sir Alex’s chief scout, they’ve got Van Gaal’s scout. They’ve got David Moyes’ chief football operator there, four or five people there and another I think who has been appointed by Ed Woodward. You’ve got a head coach who has an opinion, a CEO with an opinion, who’s in charge? Who has the final say?<br /><br />Jose Mourinho, last summer, was told his signings that he wanted were not right. He didn’t cover himself in glory - he should have moved to Manchester, he should have committed to buying a house. He should’ve smiled a little bit more, it should be a joy to manage Manchester United.<br /><br />Maybe the football wasn’t the most delightful, but actually it was better than I thought under Van Gaal. He made some wrong decisions, but you have to ask who’s telling him, a manager who has won things wherever he has been, that you cannot sign that centre-back? Who’s qualified to tell him that?<br /><br />Last year there were two centre-backs that Jose wanted to bring in and the club refused. They might not have been the right centre-backs, it might have been the right decision, but once you start going against your manager on signings, he might as well walk out of the door. You can’t bring him in and then say you didn’t like his last two signings, so you’re not going to support him on this one. You either work with him or you don’t. And as soon as they weren’t, they should have moved him out. Because as soon as you’re not supported as a manager with your signings, you’re finished</p>

This club will never move away from being a sensational football club, it will have difficult moments and it’s having a difficult time now. The money in the game now means you’re always in competition.

The price is always going to be big because clubs are wise now to it, you can’t pinch players off clubs for £5m or £6m.

As long as they sign the right talent, I’m always encouraged. I’m also encouraged by the fact that <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a>, <a href="jesse-lingard.html">Jesse Lingard</a> and <a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a> are playing.<br /><br />I’m encouraged by the fact the club are giving opportunities to young players, even in these times because for me that’s something that’s part of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s history, it’s what <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is.

As long as the principles are right, play good football, bring the right players through, try and win as best you can, don’t give in, good attitude … and for me I can wait for two, three, four, five years for the club to be successful. It isn’t a problem for me. I lived through 20 years as a fan when I was growing up where the club wasn’t successful.

We continuously found our defenders having that first look, that first touch, that second look, that second touch, that third look, that third touch.

Is it going to earn me money? Is it going to make my coach like me more or less? If the answers come up negative then it’s probably best not doing it. The idea of a guy going on social media, looking a bit of a prat while not winning football matches and not playing that well is a really bad cocktail. But then again, on the other side, he’s giving his all, he’s a young lad and social media is the modern form of media, so get over it.<br /><br />We all make mistakes and I’ve made loads of them. <a href="jesse-lingard.html">Jesse Lingard</a> doesn’t drink a lot. Twenty years ago, somebody going on a holiday would have been bladdered for four weeks. What’s worse - a social media post where somebody’s having a bit of a joke, or getting bladdered for four weeks? You’d rather have your player being sober, probably training all day and having a joke with his mates. This is absolutely a lesser evil than we had 20 years ago when players would go off for five or six weeks and come back overweight. These players today run faster, they eat better, they drink less alcohol. They’re all running 13, 14km a match, some of them are running 1500m at high intensity and 20 years ago Gary Neville and his team-mates weren’t doing that. That’s why I retired, because I was seeing it in front of my own eyes, that I couldn’t get to that level any more.<br /><br />When we came through there was still a drinking culture Saturday-Wednesday-Saturday, every club was doing it. We stopped, we didn’t do it, and we won four out of our first five league titles purely based on fitness because the rest of the clubs were still drinking.

Ole is going to have to transition those players out of the club if they do want to leave. There is always speculation around <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> and I don’t think it will go away, but if he can get his head down for this season and be the dominant force in midfield then he is <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s best player.

I thought Kompany won them the league in the last 10 matches of last season when he played in all those games. Forget the <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> moment which was just spectacular, I thought his leadership held them together at a time when <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were applying pressure like you wouldn’t believe.

To be fair, there is no one better in the world at coaching than <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>, full stop. And there is no one better at making what would be make-shift centre-backs play well. What I would say is that if <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Laporte</a> is out for a long time, I think it will cost City points because he is a dominant centre-back. I saw him in Spain three times and he’s a great player. It’s a real worry for City. Maguire would’ve been ideal. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> did well to get him but I am surprised City didn’t really go for him alongside United. Maybe they did and they just pulled out because of the money in the end or whatever it was. I just think with Kompany leaving, he was Belgian, but he was an old-fashioned throw your head at it centre-back in both boxes that when you go to certain grounds in the Premier league you play. When balls flew into the box and the pressure-built, <a href="vincent-kompany.html">Vincent Kompany</a> stood tall and made sure they all left</p>

That’s where <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are at. That is unacceptable in terms of where United need to be, but they are incapable - after six or seven years of poor recruitment - of going from seventh, sixth or fifth into first. They are nowhere near that at this moment in time. They are going to have to have three or four good transfer windows. The most important thing in the last window wasn’t just adding two or three players of the right type, it was making sure they didn’t make any further mistakes. I don’t think they’ve done that.

People have to start liking the team again<br /><br />I actually think United have taken a step backwards but a step in the right direction to go forwards because enough is enough of all these 30-year-old players coming in, not suiting the style. They’ve got to stop that because it’s not worked for the club. What I’m saying is they’ve changed direction. Whether you like it or I like it, it’s a change of direction.

I played the odd game in midfield and it was awful, even when I was full-back and I ended up in midfield just out of position sometimes and someone plays a pass into you, you think, ‘Oh, what’s behind me?’.

I took money off the Glazer family essentially from 2004 to 2011 as a player, so the idea that I leave the club and <b>[am]</b> no longer paid by them and start whinging would compromise me: ‘Oh you were OK when you were taking money off them as a player, and never said anything as a player</p>

It is not a midfield for a mid-table club let alone one of the top spending clubs in Europe, though they have got injury problems and other issues in that area<br /><br />What disappointed me was the lack of penetrating runs with and without the ball of the front three. I felt they could have done much more for the team. That front three are the spark, they are the ones that win the game for this current team. They’ve got so much talent. There are two front threes in this league for the top two clubs, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, that are absolutely outstanding. They are at it every single game, They fight for the ball and fight without the ball. They are not bad lads, and we know they have talent as they proved in the final 20 minutes, but there is something fundamentally wrong there in that first 70 minutes of the game - that cannot happen at that club.<br /><br />I can expect inconsistency from young players in terms of performance levels, missing chances and decision making. What you can’t expect is inconsistency around work ethic, application and attitude. I’ve come to the conclusion on two things. One: they haven’t got senior players setting the standards for them to let them know what’s required in a football team. When I first broke into the team I had people around me to let you know where to go. <a href="juan-mata.html">Juan Mata</a> and <a href="ashley-young.html">Ashley Young</a> are on the bench, <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> is injured, <a href="nemanja-matic.html">Nemanja Matic</a> is looking to get away.

He could do all things; he could score, set up play, run in behind, dribble, bring other players into play - he was the all-round centre-forward. It transpired that whatever combination of the four strikers we had on the pitch that season they all could play together, they all had good combinations with each other.

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> legend Gary Neville predicts coronavirus crisis will drag on]</b> I think at this moment in time it’s inconceivable that football will return for the next three to four months because of the fact that we’ve just been put essentially on a lockdown. Football will not return because all the resources that are required to run a football stadium, which requires the police and the ambulance services, will not be available in the next few months. They’ll obviously be in hospitals and in the care homes looking after the sick and people who need it the most<br /><br />Health comes first – of the fans, the players, the staff, the people who enter the stadiums.

  <p><b>[Gary Neville believes he failed as <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> manager because he was weak and unqualified for the job]</b> Sometimes ‘no’ is a great word. However, sometimes you’ve got to say ‘yes’ and step up. I’d turned down two <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> enquiries and two Championship enquiries in the 18 months before. I had no intention to go into management. Although I was working with England and <a href="roy-hodgson.html">Roy Hodgson</a>, my role was more concentrating on analysis - like I was doing on Sky - rather than coaching. When Peter <b>[Lim, <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> owner]</b> rang me, he didn’t want to bring in a new manager halfway through the season because he knew he wouldn’t get the man he wanted. He wanted somebody that he trusted to navigate him to the end of the season. I said no initially but then eventually wanted to do it for him.<br /><br />A little bit of arrogance, a little bit of ego - I’d lived through <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> for 20 years, I’d gone to Sky and it had gone well and you feel a little bit unbreakable, like you’re in a position where nothing is going to go wrong. When you’re unprepared, you’re not working hard at something as other people are, when you take something on that you’re not as qualified in as you should be, you get a slap round the face.<br /><br />To be fair, when I look back now at some of the decisions that I made - the initial decision and the decisions that I made when I got there - it was a massive learning experience. I think it has helped me even in the last few weeks in respect to what has happened with this <b>[coronavirus]</b> crisis and my businesses, I now act far more decisively and definitely than I have ever acted before because of <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>.<br /><br />I fluffed around a few decisions that I should have made and I knew instinctively at the time that I should have made big decisions and I didn’t. I sort of thought I could get away with it until the end of the season, steer the ship home to the sand and let someone else take it back out, but it never happened like that.

Never more than a handful each season, never a massive adaptation of the squad. It was controlled, with six or seven young players, 10 in the middle, and three or four that were in their 30s.

The reason it didn’t happen for him, in my opinion, was that we had the best midfield that I think English football has ever produced - and I think will ever produce<br /><br />You had a midfield four that were on another planet, and what the manager was obviously trying to do was see life beyond that midfield four and try to add strength in depth and try to marry that midfield four with Juan Sebastian Veron<br /><br />So if you remember at the time what happened, Scholesy got moved forward one, or Scholesy got moved to the left if Giggsy was injured and <a href="juan-sebastian-veron.html">Juan Sebastian Veron</a> would play in midfield. So that disrupted the quartet<br /><br />The intent was there to try and move the squad forward - I think Carra <b>[<a href="jamie-carragher.html">Jamie Carragher</a>]</b> has spoken about it with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, with Mane, <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> and <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>, if you go and sign a top player to come into that front three, one of them has to sit out<br /><br />All of a sudden you’ve got an unhappy player on your bench and it disrupts it. And when you’ve got such a set three like that - like we had such a set four - it just became really difficult<br /><br />So that was number one, because we were a 4-4-2 team, and that midfield quartet was so outstanding that he came in and we ended up with a different system. The second thing was the way Seba <a href="juan-sebastian-veron.html">Veron</a> played the game<br /><br />The midfield four we had played in what I would call quite a methodical way, you wouldn’t see <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> pop up on the left wing and <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> on the right wing, you wouldn’t see <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> and <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> cross in midfield if they’re going to get it off each other’s full-back<br /><br />They played a disciplined role - I’m not saying they didn’t go forward - but there was an element of discipline and understanding between them<br /><br />The way Seba played, he’s coming out of Italy, and it’s the way in which actually a lot of midfield players now play, like <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> who’s come to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. He reminds me so much of <a href="juan-sebastian-veron.html">Veron</a>. But the game has developed to a point now whereby players can move into different positions, there’s a lot more fluidity in systems, 4-4-2 doesn’t exist anymore<br /><br />Seba <a href="juan-sebastian-veron.html">Veron</a> was coming into a very methodical 4-4-2 which had really good patterns of play which we all knew, and he was moving across those patterns trying to get the ball from the left-back when <a href="paul-scholes.html">Scholes</a> gets the ball from the left-back as an example<br /><br />He almost was the first player - and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> did the same - who almost broke the code<br /><br />I think <a href="juan-sebastian-veron.html">Veron</a> came in with an interchanging position mindset and a different mindset, into a team that had been set in the patterns. So for me that was why it just didn’t quite happen. It was nothing to do with him as a player or as an individual. He was a brilliant player</p>

And the idea that someone would come into that changing room and not be at their best.

I think it feels unfair. What we’ve seen in the last couple of weeks has been quite unsavoury. Clubs have been demonstrating their self-interest to try and jostle for positions. But the big six and the powerhouses at the top will always be able to have that thumb pressed down on the others somehow, because they do carry the weight<br /><br />I do think it’s unfair for points per game for relegation.

Even when they’ve had six weeks off for pre-season, within 10 days of going back in they’d be playing games again in pre-season. They wouldn’t be 100 per cent fit but these are uncharted times. I wouldn’t expect the players to be absolutely perfect. I feel two to three weeks is about right to get them back playing again. We’re constantly told throughout the season that players are overworked, play too many matches.

Make ourselves still the best league in the world but make it more affordable for fans to get into a stadium, make it more accessible, all the things that we know are right. There isn’t one single person in football or one single person in this country who wouldn’t believe that they are the right things in my mind, apart from potentially 14-15 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> owners.

  <p><b>[Gary Neville has spoken previously about football’s shutdown not being the same as the period of time between seasons]</b> I would liken it to when a player has had a two-month injury. Most players at some point in their careers would have been out for this period of time. In those two months, you wouldn’t be doing any contact training whatsoever, you’d be doing a little bit of work with the physios maybe before getting back into training, and in the gym, but as soon as you went back into training with the team, within 10 days or two weeks of training, you’d be playing again. So I don’t understand why this is different from what would be an ordinary two-month injury lay-off</p>

He hasn’t been the same for some time. When form drops for six months it’s a blip but when it goes on for a year you start to worry. When it goes over two years it becomes more permanent. That is now a fair representation of what De Gea is as he’s making lots of mistakes. Ones he would never make - he was always somebody you could completely rely upon. It can only be a confidence thing. The arms, legs and body are the same - it’s got to be the mind. The reception he’s got in Spain has affected him. He’s even been booed by Spanish fans when he’s wearing the Spanish shirt. In the World Cup in 2018 he really struggled and from that he’s doubted himself. Mentally he’s not quite the same</p>

He was player of the year here and, in a very difficult period for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> post <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a>, was a shining light. The only player really you would say could go into any other team in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, or the world. Since that 2018 World Cup, though, he’s had a real difficult time. What I don’t buy into is that <a href="dean-henderson.html">Dean Henderson</a> at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, obviously from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> on loan, can go into that goal in front of the Stretford End and adapt to what the demands are of being a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> goalkeeper. It takes a special character to play in that goal. What I think <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a> has done in the four or five year period before this last 18 months is build up a lot of credit, whereby he actually deserves a break, the idea he is given the opportunity to correct his form and get it back to where it needs to be.<br /><br />When a goalkeeper, or any player, goes through a rough patch it’s mentally tough. He’s at one of the biggest clubs in the world and the scrutiny is on him constantly. There is no escape at this club - and that is why I’d be a little bit cautious around <a href="dean-henderson.html">Dean Henderson</a>. That is a lonely old place out there to make a mistake if you’re a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> goalkeeper.

I would just urge caution on that, at this moment in time.<br /><br />I’ve seen it before with players during my period at the club. We had two great goalkeepers during my time - <a href="peter-schmeichel.html">Peter Schmeichel</a> at the beginning and <a href="edwin-van-der-sar.html">Edwin van der Sar</a> at the end.

You’d almost like to see them playing the likes of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> to see where they are, although that could come in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup and Europa League games. It’s been comfortable for United in recent weeks and <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> will want those big tests because they look ready for them. They have looked so comfortable in games and they will go on to have a really good season. At times this season I wondered what was going to happen, but I think they will overtake <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> and get into the Champions League, and they could even win a trophy with it all to play for in the two cup competitions they are still in</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> ruling: Gary Neville says Financial Fair Play ‘needed this slap around the face’]</b> <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> can’t get a simple disciplinary hearing right - we’ve known that for years and years - and they’re certainly not going to be able to get something right that’s complex<br /><br />They’re an organisation that is ultimately transitioning away from what it has been in the past and this is in some ways a hangover from something that started a few years ago. But it’s no surprise that in a serious court that <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> have won this case because <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> are an organisation that simply cannot organise their own disciplinary measures<br /><br />The idea that they could take on a <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> legal machine that were going to throw everything at this and rightly so, not just because they’ve got the money but because they’re defending their reputation, they were always going to come unstuck<br /><br />I know that’s not what was being debated in the courtroom and legalities of it, but I don’t believe in FFP. I think FFP needed this slap around the face. I said a few months ago, FFP would have prevented Jack Walker doing what he did 30 years ago at Blackburn<br /><br />I know people have issues around potential owners, state ownership and other models but the reality is we’re not talking about that here, we’re talking about Financial Fair Play, the finances and people who can invest into football clubs<br /><br />It’s fundamentally wrong that there are restrictions placed on owners to put money into football clubs. Whether it’s <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> or <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a>, all those stories we’ve had in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> over the last 20 years or so, the addition to challenging <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and other clubs wouldn’t have happened if FFP had been implemented in its truest form. I don’t believe it’s right. There has always been rich owners investing into football clubs and that won’t change today. FFP needs changing to a different model<br /><br />An owner should have to fulfil the obligations he commits to - that is my take on how to create a sustainability model at a football club<br /><br />If <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> are signing contracts worth £200m for the next four years and they have the obligations placed on the club, they should have the money to be able to fulfil that. If the loss per year is £50m, the owner should, whether it’s through a bank guarantee or a bond, have to fulfil the obligations they commit to. They shouldn’t be able to leave what are essentially community assets in a mess<br /><br />We’ve seen it at lower league levels and at the top of the game, owners have to have the money they commit to - that’s it, as far as I’m concerned. So you need a test that has that as its fundamental, not one that restricts people. If you’ve got a trillion quid and you spend a couple of billion, that’s fine. If you spend 100 grand and you’ve only got 50, that’s not fine<br /><br />It’s not about the amount of money someone puts into a football club, it’s about whether than can afford it and it’s a test that needs creating based on that foundation<br /><br /><b>[Neville: A big relief for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>]</b> It <b>[the ruling]</b> is not surprising. It’s a big relief for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, not just with what they want to achieve in the immediate term, but it would have left a stain on the club in terms of the trophies over the last few years if they had been found guilty of it… and they would have been worthless in a lot of people’s eyes<br /><br />In terms of attracting players, that was being questioned and whether current players would want to stay at the highest level so all of those things will be a relief but I imagine it’s the fact that today, they’ve got through a serious court and overturned the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> decision<br /><br />It also allows them to move forward, sign players and do the things that they want and it won’t be held against them as in ‘I’m not signing because you’re not in Europe’ or ‘Pep’s leaving because they’re not a part of the Champions League’, all that sort of stuff has gone away now<br /><br />It doesn’t affect those teams in the essence of they’ll have to go and win those games like they always thought they would have to. I don’t think <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> would have been banking on what happened with City and I don’t think <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> or <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> would have been either<br /><br />They would have benefited from it but they wouldn’t have been banking on it. They have to win football matches and they can’t have any complaints if they finish fifth and are out of the Champions League on the chance that <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> lose some legal case in Europe somewhere.</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Neville says fans are the only thing missing from positive <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> restart]</b> We are now seeing games that, were they to be played in front of fans, they would create great atmospheres. In the first couple of weeks of restart I found it tough getting used to the conditions of having no fans in the stadiums. Games were played at such a slow pace, it was cautious, players were struggling for match fitness and it was nothing like <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> football. Now we’re at the stage where there is a level of intensity, tackles are flying in and we are seeing the type of game you would expect when fans are in the stadiums. We are getting to a higher level; players are a lot sharper and clever with their movement<br /><br /><b>[Nev: Players demonstrating discipline and sacrifice]</b> The players have responded well, and the restart has been handled incredibly well. It surprises me every week when we get the positive test results. I expected there to be very few positives tests in the early days when players were returning to training because they had been in lockdown, like we all had. I thought there would be more as the country mobilised and the restaurants started to open, but the players have demonstrated an incredible amount of discipline. We’ve hardly seen any positive cases because they are obviously managing themselves well. I expected to see a situation where you would see 20, 30 positive cases and I feared a club may have to drop out. If the players and their families went back out into their normal lives, I only thought football could restart if the players were in a bio-bubble. But we are still seeing so few positive cases and clubs are not playing games without a host of players and for that I am grateful because that really would have been a massive issue in terms of integrity. With Champions League places up for grabs, relegation at stake, if clubs have players missing against a rival that would have been huge. But the restart has been managed incredibly well by <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, the privacy element over testing has been important, and the players and their families have demonstrated an incredible amount of discipline otherwise there would have been more positive tests. We’re not talking about robots here; we’re talking about human beings who do normal things. To only have one, two or three positive tests among the thousands of players and staff in this league demonstrates there is an incredible amount of discipline and sacrifice that exists in football. Footballers are ridiculed when they make a mistake, but they should also be praised when they do things well<br /><br /><b>[Nev: Return of fans signals a return to normality]</b> I was at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> for their win over <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. Had fans been in the stadium when Andriy Yarmolenko scored that late winner, the place would have been bouncing, absolutely rocking. We need that day back. There is no doubt we have to get people back into cities and towns, otherwise the economy will fall over. Manchester and London have been ghost towns compared to what they would usually be and the impact of that is bad on people. From a health point of view they have to make sure people feel safe for fans to return and that it is the right time to do so. Football is being used as a boost. The message to everyone is that football is back, you can watch <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> football now, but fans will be back in stadiums in two months. Once people get back into stadiums, they’ll probably be back in the pub and then they will think they can get back to the office. All of a sudden that feeling of normality resumes and people will go out again. Yes, we will have to social distance, wear masks and make sure we’re sensible and wash our hands, but there is no doubt the government are moving towards that. The announcement <a href="boris-johnson.html">Boris Johnson</a> made could well have been the one that had most impact in demonstrating a return to normality. That’s the power of football in this country, it can create change. Football and footballers can make big changes and have an impact beyond what they do on the pitch and the government have recognised and used that over the last few months in this country</p>
