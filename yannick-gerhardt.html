<blockquote>
  <p>[Germany Under-21s lifted the 2017 UEFA European U-21 Championship thanks to a 1-0 victory over Spain] I think that, first at all, we showed a great team spirit. We knew Spain has a lot of individually great players and they also were the favourites before the match. Of course, you need quality players. The quality has already been there, but the different thing about Germany at big tournaments is that they are always able to show their maximum and their team spirit, and then you can beat everyone. Exactly like against Spain. We knew they were favourites, they might have had the best player [of the tournament] in the team. We helped each other to take them on<br /><br />Today, the limit was European Championship. The biggest thing you could have reached was this trophy, because it was the last game for this Under-21 team and we will not play together any more. Of course, I am sad due to the fact that my time in the youth is over, but I am pleased it finished with the cup. I see a lot of quality players in my team. I think that Germany has a lot of potential in the future and I think we can be proud of this</p>
