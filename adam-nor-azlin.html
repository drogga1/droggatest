  <p><b>[Selangor youngster, Adam Nor Azlin aims to get a national team call-up this year]</b> Last year, I played mostly in the second team but this year, I have the chance to play in the first squad. I hope I can give my best and use this chance to prove my worth. I have my personal targets, which is to play for the national team, and I also want to score as many goals as possible. Last year I only scored three goals, so this year I aim to score more than that.<br /><br /><b>[Selangor head coach P Maniam used a 3-4-3 formation]</b> This sort of tactic gives a lot of advantages. For me, I can have more chances to score when we use this formation. We are still trying to work on our understanding and for this game, I think we reached about 80% of it. So I think in the next game, we can improve even more. All players gave their best, and if one of use didn’t do well, then I won’t be able to score any goals</p>

  <p><b>[Selangor and Malaysia U22’s Adam Nor Azlin prefers to play as a forward, but has no qualms about playing in his new position]</b> This looks to be a permanent change, as I need to commit to one specific role. But if I were given the choice, I hope I can return to the midfield or striker position. However, looking at how things are going, coaches Maniam and Ong want me to play as a centre back, as they’ve observed that I am more comfortable there. The coaches know better, so I have to be here.<br /><br /><b>[Adam responded that he has no other choice but to catch up quickly upon his return]</b> For me, I do have concerns that I may fail to familiarise myself with the changes quickly. But that should not be a problem. Even if I have only one or two weeks to familiarise myself <b>[with the new formation]</b> with the coach’s help, I have to catch up as quickly as possible<br /><br />Judging by yesterday’s friendly <b>[1-1 draw against Felda United]</b>, I am confident we can go far in the AFC <b>[U23 AFC Championship qualifiers]</b> and the SEA Games. The home support <b>[at SEA Games]</b> is an advantage, but it also can turn negative. After all, the football gold medal is the most-coveted of all gold medals. There will be pressure when playing as the hosts in front of a massive crowd, especially when we are still relatively inexperienced as U22 players. But if we can turn the negative pressure into something positive, we can go far in the SEA Games</p>

  <p><b>[Malaysia defender Adam Nor Azlin’s error led to Brunei’s equaliser, but he made amends by scoring the winner in their SEA Games campaign opener]</b> As a player, I can’t focus on the kinds of mistakes that I committed in the first half. If I did it would only affect my performances. I decided instead to contribute by joining in on every corner kick and set piece, in order to make amends. And praise Allah, I managed to score the winner.<br /><br />I personally need to ‘switch on’ from the starting whistle and avoid the same mistakes like I committed today. I want to buck up against Singapore to ensure that they do not score against us. My priority will be on my defending duties. I may go up during set pieces, but defending is first and foremost for me<br /><br />One of our strengths is that we can play very well with short passes, but we need to work on our finishing. There’s no point of playing well if we can’t find the back of the net. We have a lot to work on ahead of the match against Singapore this Wednesday</p>

  <p><b>[Malaysia defender Adam Nor Azlin remarked that his team never looked back despite conceding first to Singapore]</b> Singapore’s goal happened due to the defenders’ failure to press <b>[Amiruldin]</b> in time, we lost our concentration there.<br /><br />We were stunned and down admittedly afterwards, but we never gave up. We proved that in the second half, and I’m proud of my teammates.<br /><br /><b>[He said]</b> the fans saw our mistakes in attack and in defence and we couldn’t give up. There was 45 minutes remaining in the match, and if Singapore could score a goal, the match was balanced, we needed to come back</p>

  <p><b>[Adam glad to have banished ghost of 2015]</b> I’ve been trying hard to maintain my performance in each match. Praise Allah that I, as well as my teammates, have performed to the best of our abilities and we have collected maximum points. The 2015 edition is a lesson for me, due to a mistake I made then. In this edition, I want to avoid repeating that mistake as we’re the hosts. I also want the team to keep focused in the semis. It’s a single-legged tie, we have only one chance to do it right. If we lose in the match, that’s it. We need to be at 100 per cent in the semis.</p>

  <p><b>[Adam Nor Azlin proud of team effort in gallant run to the final]</b> We are sad but we should take this as a lesson for the future. I hope all of us can continue to improve to prepare for the AFC next year. I’m proud of everyone. As everyone know, we had a lot of problems during the preparations but we managed to reach the final. That is something to be proud of. I think all Malaysians should feel the same.<br /><br />We cannot put the blame on any individual. It happened in a split second. We don’t expect that to happen and we conceded late in the first half. We gave our all in the second half but luck wasn’t with us. We have to accept the defeat<br /><br />It’s not only Malayan Ultras, everyone can be a supporter. For us, our motivation was still very high. We can still feel the spirit of Malaysia and it didn’t impact our game</p>

  <p><b>[Adam Nor Azlin is prepared to make the transition to the senior national team]</b> As a footballer I have to be ready at all times. It is up to the coach and I believe that my time will come. If I get the call-up, I need to give my best. I have received senior team call-ups previously, but did not get the chance to play. I think the challenges will be greater in this year and the next, and I have to make sure I’m ready for all probabilities.<br /><br /><b>[When asked about his future at Selangor]</b> Players will get opportunities anywhere if they work hard, regardless whether they are senior or younger footballers, and I must prove myself. Coaches favour young players, and wherever a young player goes, if he does his best he will get his chance</p>

  <p><b>[Adam Nor Azlin wants to debut for Malaysia as a starter against Hong Kong]</b> I hope this time around I will get to play, regardless as part of the first eleven or as a substitute. But to be honest, I want my debut to be as a starter.<br /><br />We want to make an impact on the senior team and I hope the more senior players will show us the ropes. We need confidence to play with them, and I hope that the combination of the young and more senior players will produce a positive result against Hong Kong</p>
