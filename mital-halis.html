<blockquote>
  <p>[The agent of Inter centre-back Milan Skriniar has claimed that his client is subject to interest from Real Madrid and Barcelona] Real Madrid want to sign him, so do Barcelona; whoever can convince Inter to let him go will sign him this summer. Skriniar is a model professional. If Real Madrid want him, they could get him but there are other agents who have a vested interest in taking players where they want<br /><br />Mino Raiola, who represents Ibrahimovic and Pogba, might try to mislead Skriniar, but the player is on the books at our company - we have a contract with him. Inter paid Sampdoria €28 million (£24m/$32m) for Skriniar and six months later, Manchester City came in with an offer of €55m. Now he is valued at around €100m (£87m/$113m). Any deal would certainly be complicated by the interference of intermediaries<br /><br />[On Ozan Kabak] Ozan Kabak is an exceptional talent, but he’s not eady to join a top level club like Real Madrid. At the moment he is not on Madrid’s list of candidates. He needs to get a few seasons under his belt and improve his game at Stuttgart before he goes anywhere else. There are a lot of steps he must go for before being in a position to join a side like Madrid</p>
