  <p><b>[on <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a>]</b> A great defender but what I really like about him is that he can really play too. The potential was always there and he was already very good when I played against him, but he’s just got better and better with experience. One of the best defenders in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Dion Dublin on Homes Under The Hammer]</b> I am thrilled to be joining Martin and Lucy on Homes Under The Hammer. I have a passion for property and look forward to meeting people on the show who share that passion.<br /><br />Whilst at Norwich in 2006 I had that ‘light bulb’ moment! My passion, after football, has always been music, in fact I often say it is something that had lay dormant in me for years. During the latter stages of my playing career I visited a hardware shop, bought some wood and nails, went home and put the 6 sides together - The Dube was born! Whilst in its infancy, I felt I had created something I wanted to perfect. After much deliberation, consultation and hard work, I now feel I have the almost perfect <b>[because everything can always be improved]</b> version of The Dube</p>

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford has been urged to make a decision on his Manchester United future]</b> Turning your back on Man United, I was only there for two-and-a-half years, but even for me, as a fourth-choice centre-forward for United back then it was difficult to turn your back on Man United. For Rashford, who is a lot more naturally talented than I was, has got a better chance of getting in that first team than I ever did. So, it’s down to Marcus, What does he want to do? What does he want to achieve? Does he want to fight for his place? Does he want to go away and play games? It’s down to him as an individual, but if he wants to play for his country, every game, we need to see more of him.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho’s miserable run at Old Trafford continued]</b> I was at Old Trafford for BBC Radio 5 Live and although the crowd was clearly unhappy I did not get a sense they were anti-Jose. I was asked after the game if I still think he is the right fit - and I think he still could be. However, something dramatic has to be said or done for that to happen, because United need to be in harmony and, right now, that is definitely not the case.<br /><br />Yes, it is Mourinho who has to drive any improvement. He is the manager and it is down to him to get the players to do exactly what he wants them to do on the pitch. But the United players have got to take responsibility too. At the moment I don’t see enough of them really digging deep and saying, ‘right I am going to take this game by the scruff of the neck, and make something happen’. I have not seen it for a long time, and it is very frustrating</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United got lucky against Juventus]</b> Jose Mourinho’s boys have done the job in a stadium that has been electric. If they had got even one point I would have thought it was outstanding but they’ve nicked all three. If you come here and get something from Juventus, you’ve done something right.<br /><br />None of the Manchester United players stood out. Anthony <b>[Martial]</b> maybe, but there was no end product. Man Utd kept knocking at the door and they wouldn’t go away. Man Utd stayed together and got lucky at the end</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United need a lot more from Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku]</b> United did not manage a shot on target on Wednesday, and they did not really use the ball well enough when they got possession. Pogba was the player expected to play the biggest part in unlocking the Barcelona defence, but we did not see enough of the creative side of his game. He will have to do much better next week, but he can only do that if his team-mates are making the forward runs that allow him to play those sort of passes. Lukaku should be doing exactly that. He did not manage a single shot in the first leg but I actually thought he played well. He held the ball up and was very reliable in possession, but all of his work was a long, long way from goal. If United are to have any joy at the Nou Camp, they need to get him in the box and give their wide players more to aim at, because firing the ball into the Barcelona area was clearly part of <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>’s plan</p>

  <p><b>[Dion Dublin on Canaries’ job offer]</b> A lot of people don’t know this, I actually got the assistant manager’s job at <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich City</a> for about five minutes. I went for talks for the assistant job with <a href="paul-ince.html">Paul Ince</a>, who went for the job. He said would I mind coming along with him as his assistant and I said I would go along for the talks. I knew Delia, Michael and the owners. I went and had a chat with Delia. They said they wanted to speak to Gunny first, so Incey went out, Gunny went in and I went out.<br /><br />Then they said they would make the decision in about five minutes and I found out they were going to give Bryan Gunn the job. They got Paul back in, told him the news, said they were sorry and said would it be okay if we asked Dion to be Bryan’s assistant? Gunny has said that was okay with him. Paul had no problem and I said I would definitely take it with Gunny.<br /><br />But I went back and spoke to my employers at the time and they said, ‘Sorry, no, we can’t release you from your three year contract, because you are signed up to us.’ That was it. That was my five minutes of management and I had a 100pc record<br /><br /><b>[Dublin admitted he does have some regrets he opted not to go into coaching]</b> Part of me does regret it because I would like to know if I could have done it. Whether I did have the skills to go onto the training pitch and be a coach not a player. It would have been very nice to know if I could make this leap. So thanks to my employer at the time. But the game has changed now</p>

What I mean by that is that he is running this club from top to bottom. He is making sure that the academy football is being played the same as the first team. When they come through, they know their jobs, they know their jobs, they know where to be, who to listen to.<br /><br />They have got good seniors around them, good pros who do the job properly, no flash Harrys, and they love it. They love playing with them, they respect them and the seniors respect the kids. That is why you are getting such balanced performances by the whole of this <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club. They look unstoppable at the moment. The way that <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> has picked his teams has nullified what other teams are trying to do</p>
