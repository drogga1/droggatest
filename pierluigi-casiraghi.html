  <p><b>[Manchester United have been informed that Sergej Milinkovic-Savic would be worth a €100 million investment]</b> I do not know if the valuation is right, if I had €100m I would buy him. I like him very much, not just from today, he was immediately seen as a great player. He is unique, he is <b>[just]</b> 23 years old.</p>

  <p><b>[On Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> Italian football and our defences are different from Spain. Cristiano Ronaldo is here to win, but I don’t think he can get 40 goals like in La Liga.</p>

  <p><b>[Pierluigi Casiraghi urges <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> has been advised to shut his ears after making a bright start to the season with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> Abraham started really well, he has talent and quality, so I hope he can do the whole championship at this level. <b>[He is]</b> a young boy who has to shut his ears and not listen to criticism. To grow you have to make mistakes and he must have the right to do it.<br /><br /><b>[Casiraghi is also backing <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> to be a success back in familiar surroundings]</b> <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> has a great chance. He will play his cards without having anything to lose and I am sure he will succeed in imposing himself, he loves young players and this makes him honourable<br /><br />I have a great memory on the one hand because for me playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has always been a dream, while on the other hand it was a negative experience for the fact that I had to stop playing football. For me, London and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> were a dream. A very serious accident cancelled everything</p>
