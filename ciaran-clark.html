  <p><b>[Aston Villa defender Ciaran Clark wants to put the disappointment of relegation behind him]</b> It’s been a tough season for Aston Villa. To go down the way we did it wasn’t nice, but hopefully now if I can get involved, make sure I’m fit, and training well, and if I can push to get on the plane, that would be a high for me personally. I’d like to think that I have learned a lot through the tough times but I’d also like to think I’d try and do well no matter where I play. Like I said, I’ll just be working hard and training hard and hopefully I can be on that plane.<br /><br />It’s a long, long way away. The squad hasn’t been picked or named yet so there’s still places up for grabs. Everyone’s obviously trying to keep the head down and work and fight for a spot on that plane. Every player in the squad just wants to make sure that they can keep training well and stay fit. That’s the main thing, if everyone can stay fit, it will obviously give the gaffer a hard decision come the end of the week<br /><br />At the end of the season I had a little knock and I was just carrying that into the trip beforehand so I just wanted to make sure it was alright before getting into the full swing of things, but it’s fine.</p>
