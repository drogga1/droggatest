  <p><b>[Shunsuke Nakamura Denies Rumours Of Quick Exit From Espanyol To Japan]</b> I didn’t mean it that way. I meant I have to think about how to play more games. I’m not over the moon about things. But it’s a question of trial and error. Everything went so well during my four years at Celtic so it’s a good experience to have to worry sometimes.<br /><br /><b>[Recently, Japan’s 2002 World Cup boss Philippe Troussier opined that Nakamura needed to earn his spot on the national team and should start on the bench. Nakamura is not worrying about such comments]</b> People might get concerned I could lose my match sharpness before the World Cup but I’m not done yet!</p>

  <p><b>[After spells in Italy with Reggina, in Scotland with Celtic and a brief time in Spain with Espanyol, the former Scottish Player of the Year is once again a Yokohama F. Marinos player. He now wants the title]</b> I hope to use my experience to Yokohama’s benefit. There is also pressure on me as people will expect me to deliver but the aim is to win the J-League title here. On the plane coming over I was thinking that the disappointment of Spain will give me extra motivation</p>

  <p><b>[Shunsuke Nakamura says More Difficult To Adapt To Japan Than Europe]</b> From a mental standpoint, it’s more difficult to adapt to the J.League from abroad than the other way around. When you go to Europe, it’s not hard to adapt because Japanese players are better than what the Europeans expected. But when you come back to Japan, everyone has high expectations of you so it is added pressure<br /><br /><b>[Nakamura is keen to start his second spell with Yokohama and has already talked to coach Kazushi Kimura about his role in the team]</b> He (Kimura) asked me, ‘What position do you want to play?’ I responded, ‘Anywhere,’. The Marinos already have a bunch of good players in the midfield. I want to make the club stronger so we can contend for a title.</p>

  <p><b>[Shunsuke Nakamura may be back home with Yokohama F Marinos but the Japanese international is experiencing reverse culture-shock in his homeland]</b> I’ve played at the stadium here a bunch of times with the national team, so nothing felt new about that. And it was nice to hear the fans singing the same song from seven and a half years ago. But everyone on the pitch was Japanese and that felt a little weird. Your teammates, the opponents, the referees–that was strange.<br /><br /><b>[Nakamura was also surprised as to how fast the J-league has become in his absence]</b> The game was quick; against the top teams, we’re going to have to do better than we did today.</p>

  <p><b>[Japan Star Shunsuke Nakamura Retires From International Football]</b> My next Japan game? There won’t be one. I wanted to leave some mark on this World Cup, but it just wasn’t meant to be for me. It’s weird. It’s as if the football gods are testing me. It has been really hard for me to warm the bench for Japan’s national side. Me and the World Cup obviously don’t go well together. Maybe that’s just destiny</p>
