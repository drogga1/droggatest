  <p><b>[Jonjo Shelvey says he might be a hero in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> now after doing his former club a favour by scoring a stunning late goal for <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> in their 2-2 draw with Manchester City]</b> We thought we deserved a point. They keep the ball so well but we deserved that. We needed to bounce back after Monday but showed we have character and a bit of spirit. I might be a hero in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> now but in all seriousness we need as many points as we can and we need to keep moving up the table<br /><br />We worked our socks off today, each one of us put in the 110%. When we had possession we did well and we defended for our lives today, you could see the defenders putting their bodies on the line. We do a lot of running during the week but on the pitch, the only time we have been defeated was when the other teams outworked us. This, of course, can’t happen and if we feel we can run more than the other team we’ll always have a chance in the game<br /><br />I saw they were sitting deep and I asked Christian Atsu to cut the ball back to me, it was always drifting away from the keeper. I know I can do that, I do it in training quite regularly but it is important to do it in a match and this secured us a point</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle midfielder Jonjo Shelvey has admitted that it was a mistake to leave <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> when he moved away from Merseyside in 2013]</b> I was only 21 when I left. I don’t think you would find many other players who go there at 17 and leave at 21 and I think that speaks a lot of what I’m like as a character. I wasn’t happy playing one or two games then coming out of the team. I wanted to carry on playing week in, week out. When you’re playing once and then not playing for six games, I don’t care what any footballer says, you don’t feel involved. You don’t feel part of the team. I think that was the feeling I wanted but, in hindsight, should I have stayed? Probably, yeah. Even if it was only for another year or two, just to see how things changed. But it is what it is at the end of the day<br /><br />It could have been a lot better, to be honest with you. Don’t get me wrong, by the time I finish I will have had a fantastic career. But you do sit there sometimes and think, ‘could I have gone higher? Could I have been playing in the Champions League?’ Hopefully one day I still will, but time’s running out now. You go back in the past and you’ve probably made certain decisions that were wrong</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle United midfielder Jonjo Shelvey has opened up on where it all went wrong for <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> cult hero and former <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea City</a> team-mate Michu]</b> When I signed I think <b>[Michu]</b> was their sort of main guy, in terms of goals and that. Then a week after I signed Wilfried Bony signed. I think personally that sort of knocked the stuffing out of him, because Wilfried came in on a big deal and as the main striker and after that it didn’t really work out for Michu. I only played with him for about six or seven months, but you could tell his finishing was just ridiculous<br /><br />We had these bands to wear, for when you go to sleep. They monitor you to show how much you are sleeping. They put it all up on a screen in the canteen. We had a meeting, there were a few lads going to bed at like 12 and that, on one graph he showed that someone was sleeping for three hours a night, and it was Michu. He was coming in and his eyes were drowsy and puffy, it turned out he was just up playing PlayStation til like 4 o’clock in the morning. I don’t know if had always been like that. He looked tired all the time, then he got a bad injury. I don’t even know what he’s doing now, he sort of disappeared off the face of the earth, but when he was at <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> he got a Spain call-up, he played for Spain, and you don’t get Spanish call-ups if you can’t play football</p>
