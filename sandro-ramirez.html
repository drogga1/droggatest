<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Everton have completed the signing of Spain Under-21 international Sandro Ramirez from <a href="malaga-fc.html">Malaga</a> on a four-year deal]</b> I’m very happy, this is a big step in my career. I know I’m signing for a massive club in England. <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> is the ideal place for me, I’ve got the ideal manager who is going to keep giving me the confidence to improve my game. I cannot wait to wear the blue shirt in front of the <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> fans at Goodison Park. It’s a big jump in my career coming to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and for a club like <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> which is really on the up. They have got big plans and want to succeed and keep developing. I’m hoping I can get to know my teammates as soon as possible, and want to adapt to the football and the way of life in the city<br /><br /><a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> have made some big signings and we’re hoping we can put in a great season and hopefully then we can achieve that aim of getting in the Champions League. It will be a big season for us. I was lucky enough to play with some of the best players in the world and managed to win the odd trophy but the important thing now is that I’m very happy to be signing for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. We’ve got a fantastic squad and I’m excited about being able to compete at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and win plenty of silverware</p>
