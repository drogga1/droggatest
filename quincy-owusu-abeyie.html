  <p><b>[Former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> attacker Quincy Owusu-Abeyie has opened up on his journey from growing up in a crime-riddled district of Amsterdam to transitioning from football into the rapper known as ‘BLOW’]</b> If it wasn’t for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, maybe I would have led definitely a different life. Maybe I would have just a normal nine to five, maybe I would have been a street guy, I don’t know … but fortunately I got that phone call. I was born and raised in Amsterdam. Bijlmermeer is the area - it’s basically the ‘hood. It wasn’t easy. Sometimes you might be on the block and you might hear a gunshot, or you might hear that someone got stabbed. When I got that phone call, I said ‘Arsenal? Who doesn’t want to play for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>?! That moment when I met <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> is when it sort of sank in, when I realised … It’s not on TV anymore. So I looked at my agent, and my agent looked at me, and it was like, ‘Boy … I gotta get the job done’.<br /><br />There was good music in the dressing room. <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> used to always be in charge of it. When I made my first <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> start, against Portsmouth in 2005, I started that game with <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> up front. And I remember before the game <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry</a> was like, ‘Quincy, put your iPod on!’ - it was a good feeling, and nice that they allowed me to do that. I was just a kid, you know? He didn’t have to do that. I always say I played with the best of the best. I was on the training ground with <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a>, <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a>, <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Dennis Bergkamp</a>, <a href="robert-pires.html">Robert Pires</a>, <a href="robin-van-persie.html">Robin van Persie</a>. Everyone who was part of the Invincibles - I was there. That was the best time and that’s when I learned the most about the game<br /><br /><b>[When he did eventually reveal his identity, however, it was a weight off his shoulders despite knowing there was plenty of graft ahead of him]</b> It wasn’t easy to make that transition from football to music. But when I eventually revealed myself - when I told people that Quincy Owusu-Abeyie is now the rapper BLOW - it meant that I could just be myself. With music, it’s different: you can bring one banger, but then you’ve got to think about the next one you’re bringing. If you fall off, it’s done. With football, you’ve got 22 men on the pitch, you’re with your team-mates. In music, it’s all on you. I wanted to do something different. I’m happy. I’m doing something I love doing. Music is life to me, man. This is my job now. This is who I am</p>
