  <p><b>[Jon Moss makes a cappuccino behind the counter of The Vinyl Whistle, his record shop-cum-café in the Headingley district of <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>, renowned for its vibrant nightlife and its student scene]</b> You go onto a streaming site, they have all the essentials that you might want to listen to and then you don’t listen to the album in its entirety. I think people have moved away from listening to full albums, they just listen to random songs and I think there’s so much missed because of that<br /><br /><b>[But record stores give something back to the community they serve]</b> If I want to hear about a song straight away, I might listen to it on streaming, but I’ll always want to own it on vinyl. There’s nothing quite like walking into a record shop, having a look through the racks, and finding something you didn’t know you were looking for. Or, similarly, finding something you’d been looking for, for a long time<br /><br /><b>[The indie stuff, Jon concedes, is more up his street]</b> Whenever I get a chance and my wife’s away, I can probably sneak about 30 records at a time. I’ve got a bag that carries that<br /><br /><b>[On field, in stoppages between play, there might be a little conversation between the official and one of the players about a certain gig or a certain song]</b> It’s as if you would have a conversation when you’re making a coffee at work. The same applies to referees and players. We’re not enemies, we’re working in that environment together</p>
