<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Religion has long played a role in Russian military life]</b> In late imperial Russia, when they began to build garrisons, every regiment sought to build a regimental church, but not a synagogue or mosque. In <a href="vladimir-putin.html">Putin</a>’s Russia, the Orthodox Church seeks every opportunity to represent itself as the national religion and tie itself to the state as it had under the tsars, so this act represents continuity broken temporarily by the Soviet years. Of course the Soviet regime did not build churches for the army, but it did build the ‘House of the Red Army,’ shaped like a star, in Moscow dedicated to the use of the Red Army and its soldiers. In some respects it was analogous to a USO <b>[United Service Organization that supports American soldiers]</b> building. So <a href="vladimir-putin.html">Putin</a>’s dedicating one particular building to the use of the Russian Army soldiers for purposes of morale-and morals-is in line with that</p>
