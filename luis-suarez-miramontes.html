  <p><b>[on <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, Suarez, and Neymar]</b> Suarez will not be having any problems with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>. The initial problem appeared to be between <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, but they have shown this season that there is no jealousy between them. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has been scoring goals and has also given <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> plenty of assists. The same thing will be happening with <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> because of his style of play. Suarez will realise that he needs <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and Neymar</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, Suarez, and Neymar]</b> I’ve never seen a trio like <b>[Messi, Suarez and Neymar]</b>, no bones about it. The humility with which <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has welcomed Suarez and <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> into the team has been central to it. The three have shown an appreciation that by leaving their egos to one side they can go on and achieve great things. In adapting they’ve showed that they are intelligent human beings</p>

  <p><b>[om his personal journey]</b> Ever since I was little I have had a passion for football. Like nearly all young boys at the time, I played football in the street. I had two big brothers and they also played. I used to go to see them play with Deportivo Juvenil. Unfortunately, they are no longer with us. I made it to the Deportivo de La Coruña first team when I was just 18 years of age. I was only there for a year, less than a year! Until <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a> came and signed me</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Suarez Miramontes criticising the treatment of <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Sergio Busquets</a>, suggesting that if it was him, he would leave]</b> If it was me and they did what they’re doing to <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Busquets</a>, I would talk to the coach and ask to leave. The most important thing to take from today’s game is that we are losing <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Busquets</a> at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. He isn’t cheerful, he isn’t happy, he doesn’t play with freedom or joy, the team are constantly lowering their performance and we’re seeing decisions which prevent <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Busquets</a> from being himself</p>
