  <p><b>[The LA Galaxy have sent defender AJ Delagarza to the Houston Dynamo in exchange for $125,000 in general allocation money and $50,000 in targeted allocation money]</b> AJ DeLaGarza is an excellent player and an excellent person, and we are really pleased and really excited because we’re bringing a wonderful player that no doubt, is going to important for the Houston Dynamo. He has won championships with the LA Galaxy; he will bring that pedigree, stability, a high level of play and a new energy to the locker room that will make the team better in all aspects.</p>

  <p><b>[Houston Dynamo have signed Uruguayan forward Vicente Sanchez]</b> By signing Vicente, we bring a player that offers a lot of experience to a very young group of attacking players both on-and-off the field. He has played in South America, Mexico, Europe and offers our younger players many life lessons from his time abroad. He has been very successful and will expect the best from everyone at training. He knows how to win. The players have received him with open arms - they respect him, look up to him and when he plays he is capable of impacting any game with his vision and passing.</p>

  <p><b>[Houston Dynamo have re-signed defender DaMarcus Beasley]</b> I feel that DaMarcus is the best left back in the country, and he not only has experience but also has a great level of talent. He can continue to bring that level to the team and to his teammates, and he’s motivated to do that. We’re really excited to have him back, and hopefully he starts to have an impact on the field and off of it right away.</p>

  <p><b>[Can Wilmer Cabrera help the Houston Dynamo emulate success of rival FC Dallas?]</b> It’s a lot of responsibility because it’s a club that has won MLS Cups, that has been very active in the playoffs at the beginning of its MLS run but right now is not doing very well in that aspect. It’s not getting to the playoffs, so the responsibility is high, but we are trying to work and have that mentality and the idea that we’re going to be able to achieve that goal with the players and the roster and the team that we have.<br /><br />Within the budget, we had to bring in the players that we can acquire and also players that can adapt to the environment. Remember, we’re not in New York. We’re not in LA. We’re in Houston. So that’s going to be difficult for some players to adapt to the heat and humidity. It’s not easy for, say, Europeans, like Swedish or Norwegian players or French players, to adapt to Houston. It’s going to be harder for that player than a player from Honduras or from Colombia or from Panama. Why? Because they’re used to that heat, they know how to play in that heat, and that changes everything because definitely our environment is different than other environments in MLS</p>

  <p><b>[Portland Timbers attack dominant in Houston Dynamo dismatling]</b> We have good players. We’re building a team of course. We need to continue performing. We need to get better. We have very tough games ahead of us. In order for us to get into the playoffs for this season, we have to be able to play better through the 90 minutes, and that’s something we still haven’t had success with.</p>

  <p><b>[An inability to duplicate their first-half success in the second half of matches]</b> We aren’t going to tell lies. Defensively, we’re giving away too many goals. Way too many. We’re one of the teams giving up the most goals in the league. We have to keep working, the defense has to be more solid, and we have to improve individually and collectively. When one is a defender, the first thing they have to do is win their duels, win their 1-on-1s. We have to improve in the duels, and the 1-on-1s, and our movement as a more solid defense.<br /><br />Above all, we gave up the ball too easily, and we let them find the goal too easily. If that happens, it’s because we didn’t have control of the ball and we weren’t in good shape. So, that’s on me. I need to work better and I need to send a better message to the players. I need to make them believe a little bit more in themselves. So, I’m going to blame myself for those 10, 15 minutes. I take full responsibility for that, and I’m going to continue looking and finding solutions for that situation</p>

  <p><b>[Wilmer Cabrera knew he had to do something about how his Houston Dynamo team was fading in the second half of matches]</b> I wanted to help the back four to be more protected. It wasn’t a decision to talk with them and to be telling them that, ‘We have to be better. We have to do better,’ but it was also important to be a little bit more protected.</p>

  <p><b>[Vicente Sanchez moment of magic puts Houston Dynamo into next round after dull contest]</b> I am not surprised about Victor Sanchez because that’s why I brought him and invited him to be part of this project. I’m not surprised. He’s unbelievably talented, smart and he has an unbelievable quality. He’s sad because he couldn’t score those goals and those opportunities but what he brought throughout the 35 mins, the extra time and the five more minutes during the end of the game, it was outstanding and he gave us the possibility to counter attack, to create problems for them and create a lot of possibility and a lot of options to be dangerous.</p>

  <p><b>[Patchwork Dynamo defense holds up]</b> Sometimes we have to start from the bottom to prove ourselves. The most important is not how you start. When you move, you need to be well prepared because at some point, when the opportunities open for you, you need to be ready and that’s what I wanted to do. I wanted to be ready. I’ve been working hard, we’ve been working hard together and now we’ve been rewarded. But we want more and we know that every time and every game you get something, now it’s more pressure for you. We like that. We really like that.</p>

  <p><b>[Philippe Senderos had settled into a nice rotation role with the Houston Dynamo]</b> That’s not normal that you bring a veteran with three World Cups to try out. He took that risk and when you take that risk it’s because <b>[he is]</b> humble enough to understand, despite what he was doing, he had some injuries and difficulties to play lately and that it was a little bit of doubt.<br /><br />He’s an excellent player. Experienced, playing in three World Cups, Europe for different clubs. So he has brought that experience, that communication, which is important, and he’s been a leader on the field and off the field. That is the reason we wanted to bring him <b>[in]</b> and work with him</p>

  <p><b>[Dynamo coach Wilmer Cabrera is quick to point out that his team is overcoming the home field conditions much more]</b> If there’s someone that’s going to be more affected by the field not being in good condition it’s the home team. That’s for sure because when you play away you want to defend, and the best way to help the defense is when the field is not in a great condition. The ball bounces and it’s difficult to control the ball. The field during most of the season was perfect, but in the end it was <b>[beat up]</b> a lot and it was just for different kind of games<br /><br />That’s out of our hands, we can’t do anything about that. If you can’t control it, you have to adapt. Does it affect us more? Of course, because we want a very nice field to try and attack and play forward. I know the club has been trying to work with the league to try and make sure the pitch will be in the best shape possible</p>

He demonstrates his professionalism in the way he takes care of himself, and the way he behaves on and off the field is important. In the locker room, he is a point of reference for all his teammates. As a player, he still delivers quality and a proficient level of soccer, ideas, talent and we need that this season.</p>

  <p><b>[Wilmer Cabrera’s debut season as head coach]</b> We’re trying to figure out the best way possible to do preseason but also to be sure that we’re very well prepared for the first games. We’re trying to do that, and we think the results will tell us if we did the right thing.<br /><br />We wanted to be sure that in terms of having players that can give us a little bit more stability, what I’m saying is that we need them to be healthy and be sure they can play consecutive games - especially in the back. We’ve tried to bring in these guys that can give us that, and we’re thinking they’re going to be able to have that consistency. If we have that consistency with the consistency we have up front or on the attacking side - because we’ve been consistent in the attacking side. In two seasons, we’ve been very good at scoring goals. There’s no doubt that everyone knows that we score goals, but we have to create that balance. We’re working as a staff to be sure that we create that balance and we have better seasons and contain more the rivals’ attack<br /><br /><b>[On Alberth Elis]</b> Alberth is a very important player because of what he does and what he’s been doing throughout the two seasons. Now, if there are possibilities that are convenient for the club and for Alberth, we’re going to be happy. I’m going to be happy. That’s what we want. We want players to have better futures and better possibilities. We’re open to doing that if that’s also convenient for the club, for the ownership group. The ownership group made an effort with Alberth when we brought Alberth from Monterrey. It was a financial effort from the club, trying to be sure that we have a very important player. Now, if something is a window or possibility for the club and for the player and it’s beneficial, I don’t have any doubt the club is going to try to do the right things for both.<br /><br /><b>[On Aljaz Struna and MLS veteran Maynor Figueroa]</b> It’s going to take time, it’s not going to be one day because we have new guys in the back, but we believe it’s going to be a good solution first with the new guys and second with the continuity and them playing together for a longer period</p>

Then, important for us, we made some subs and the guys came in with very good energy, mentality and goals. They changed the game. In 15 minutes we changed the game in our favor. We could’ve scored two more goals.<br /><br /><b>[On the Tigres clash]</b> That’s the game any player would like to play - and for our players, they’re excited about it.We’re going to respect the opponents, but we’re going to try to play the best game of our lives. Why? Because it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to play those guys here and then over there. We’re going to try to enjoy that. And enjoying is when you win. But the beauty of this game is that on the field everyone is equal. Guastatoya today, they were equal and they almost … they got it to 1-0 after 72 minutes. So you have to play the games, and we’re excited about the possibility to represent MLS against Tigres</p>
