  <p><b>[Wilmer Cabrera sacked as Houston Dynamo coach amid poor patch in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> play]</b> We’d like to thank Wilmer for all of his hard work and dedication over the course of the last two and a half seasons with the Houston Dynamo, including last year’s U.S. Open Cup title. We wish him all the best moving forward. At this time, we as a club believe the team will benefit from a fresh perspective as we enter the final third of our season and make a push to qualify for the playoffs</p>

  <p><b>[The Montreal Impact have announced that head coach Remi Garde has been sacked, with former Houston Dynamo boss Wilmer Cabrera replacing him]</b> Because I <b>[Kevin Gilmore]</b> have so much respect for Remi as a person and as a professional, it was a very difficult decision to make and it was well thought, but our latest series of failures in the past couple of months and the way the team acts on the field led to that change. We hope to bring back confidence to this group of players for the last stretch of the season, to get a playoff spot and to perform in the Canadian Championship final</p>
