  <p><b>[Free agent DaMarcus Beasley has signed a new deal with the Houston Dynamo that will see the defender return to the club for the 2018 season]</b> I am excited about having DaMarcus back because he is a true leader and a role model. He demonstrates his professionalism in the way he takes care of himself, and the way he behaves on and off the field is important. In the locker room, he is a point of reference for all his teammates. As a player, he still delivers quality and a proficient level of soccer, ideas, talent and we need that this season.</p>

  <p><b>[Wilmer Cabrera’s debut season as head coach]</b> We’re trying to figure out the best way possible to do preseason but also to be sure that we’re very well prepared for the first games. We’re trying to do that, and we think the results will tell us if we did the right thing.<br /><br />We wanted to be sure that in terms of having players that can give us a little bit more stability, what I’m saying is that we need them to be healthy and be sure they can play consecutive games - especially in the back. We’ve tried to bring in these guys that can give us that, and we’re thinking they’re going to be able to have that consistency. If we have that consistency with the consistency we have up front or on the attacking side - because we’ve been consistent in the attacking side. In two seasons, we’ve been very good at scoring goals. There’s no doubt that everyone knows that we score goals, but we have to create that balance. We’re working as a staff to be sure that we create that balance and we have better seasons and contain more the rivals’ attack<br /><br /><b>[On Alberth Elis]</b> Alberth is a very important player because of what he does and what he’s been doing throughout the two seasons. Now, if there are possibilities that are convenient for the club and for Alberth, we’re going to be happy. I’m going to be happy,” he said. “That’s what we want. We want players to have better futures and better possibilities. We’re open to doing that if that’s also convenient for the club, for the ownership group. The ownership group made an effort with Alberth when we brought Alberth from Monterrey. It was a financial effort from the club, trying to be sure that we have a very important player. Now, if something is a window or possibility for the club and for the player and it’s beneficial, I don’t have any doubt the club is going to try to do the right things for both.<br /><br /><b>[On Aljaz Struna and MLS veteran Maynor Figueroa]</b> It’s going to take time, it’s not going to be one day because we have new guys in the back, but we believe it’s going to be a good solution first with the new guys and second with the continuity and them playing together for a longer period</p>

  <p><b>[Houston Dynamo get reminder of perils of Concacaf Champions League]</b> We gave them life, and they scored a very good goal. Then, important for us, we made some subs and the guys came in with very good energy, mentality and goals. They changed the game. In 15 minutes we changed the game in our favor. We could’ve scored two more goals.<br /><br /><b>[On the Tigres clash]</b> That’s the game any player would like to play - and for our players, they’re excited about it.We’re going to respect the opponents, but we’re going to try to play the best game of our lives. Why? Because it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to play those guys here and then over there. We’re going to try to enjoy that. And enjoying is when you win. But the beauty of this game is that on the field everyone is equal. Guastatoya today, they were equal and they almost … they got it to 1-0 after 72 minutes. So you have to play the games, and we’re excited about the possibility to represent MLS against Tigres</p>

  <p><b>[Tigres right to be confident, even without Gignac, in CCL quarterfinals]</b> They’re not just favorites for no reason, they’re favorites for their players having won on the field and what they’ve gotten. You have to respect that.</p>

  <p><b>[Tigres punish Dynamo’s lack of perfection]</b> We got punished at the end twice, with good quality, but that cost us the game. I think it’s a very good learning game for us because it is important to understand that we were working well, we were running, we were moving but at the end when you have the ball you have to put in the quality.</p>

  <p><b>[Wilmer Cabrera sacked as Houston Dynamo coach amid poor patch in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> play]</b> We’d like to thank Wilmer for all of his hard work and dedication over the course of the last two and a half seasons with the Houston Dynamo, including last year’s U.S. Open Cup title. We wish him all the best moving forward. At this time, we as a club believe the team will benefit from a fresh perspective as we enter the final third of our season and make a push to qualify for the playoffs</p>

  <p><b>[The Montreal Impact have announced that head coach Remi Garde has been sacked, with former Houston Dynamo boss Wilmer Cabrera replacing him]</b> Because I <b>[<a href="kevin-gilmore.html">Kevin Gilmore</a>]</b> have so much respect for Remi as a person and as a professional, it was a very difficult decision to make and it was well thought, but our latest series of failures in the past couple of months and the way the team acts on the field led to that change. We hope to bring back confidence to this group of players for the last stretch of the season, to get a playoff spot and to perform in the Canadian Championship final</p>
