  <p><b>[The LA Galaxy have sent defender AJ Delagarza to the Houston Dynamo in exchange for $125,000 in general allocation money and $50,000 in targeted allocation money]</b> AJ DeLaGarza is an excellent player and an excellent person, and we are really pleased and really excited because we’re bringing a wonderful player that no doubt, is going to important for the Houston Dynamo. He has won championships with the LA Galaxy; he will bring that pedigree, stability, a high level of play and a new energy to the locker room that will make the team better in all aspects.</p>

  <p><b>[Houston Dynamo have signed Uruguayan forward Vicente Sanchez]</b> By signing Vicente, we bring a player that offers a lot of experience to a very young group of attacking players both on-and-off the field. He has played in South America, Mexico, Europe and offers our younger players many life lessons from his time abroad. He has been very successful and will expect the best from everyone at training. He knows how to win. The players have received him with open arms - they respect him, look up to him and when he plays he is capable of impacting any game with his vision and passing.</p>

  <p><b>[Houston Dynamo have re-signed defender DaMarcus Beasley]</b> I feel that DaMarcus is the best left back in the country, and he not only has experience but also has a great level of talent. He can continue to bring that level to the team and to his teammates, and he’s motivated to do that. We’re really excited to have him back, and hopefully he starts to have an impact on the field and off of it right away.</p>

  <p><b>[Can Wilmer Cabrera help the Houston Dynamo emulate success of rival FC Dallas?]</b> It’s a lot of responsibility because it’s a club that has won MLS Cups, that has been very active in the playoffs at the beginning of its MLS run but right now is not doing very well in that aspect. It’s not getting to the playoffs, so the responsibility is high, but we are trying to work and have that mentality and the idea that we’re going to be able to achieve that goal with the players and the roster and the team that we have.<br /><br />Within the budget, we had to bring in the players that we can acquire and also players that can adapt to the environment. Remember, we’re not in New York. We’re not in LA. We’re in Houston. So that’s going to be difficult for some players to adapt to the heat and humidity. It’s not easy for, say, Europeans, like Swedish or Norwegian players or French players, to adapt to Houston. It’s going to be harder for that player than a player from Honduras or from Colombia or from Panama. Why? Because they’re used to that heat, they know how to play in that heat, and that changes everything because definitely our environment is different than other environments in MLS</p>

  <p><b>[Portland Timbers attack dominant in Houston Dynamo dismatling]</b> We have good players. We’re building a team of course. We need to continue performing. We need to get better. We have very tough games ahead of us. In order for us to get into the playoffs for this season, we have to be able to play better through the 90 minutes, and that’s something we still haven’t had success with.</p>

  <p><b>[An inability to duplicate their first-half success in the second half of matches]</b> We aren’t going to tell lies. Defensively, we’re giving away too many goals. Way too many. We’re one of the teams giving up the most goals in the league. We have to keep working, the defense has to be more solid, and we have to improve individually and collectively. When one is a defender, the first thing they have to do is win their duels, win their 1-on-1s. We have to improve in the duels, and the 1-on-1s, and our movement as a more solid defense.<br /><br />Above all, we gave up the ball too easily, and we let them find the goal too easily. If that happens, it’s because we didn’t have control of the ball and we weren’t in good shape. So, that’s on me. I need to work better and I need to send a better message to the players. I need to make them believe a little bit more in themselves. So, I’m going to blame myself for those 10, 15 minutes. I take full responsibility for that, and I’m going to continue looking and finding solutions for that situation</p>

  <p><b>[Wilmer Cabrera knew he had to do something about how his Houston Dynamo team was fading in the second half of matches]</b> I wanted to help the back four to be more protected. It wasn’t a decision to talk with them and to be telling them that, ‘We have to be better. We have to do better,’ but it was also important to be a little bit more protected.</p>

  <p><b>[Free agent DaMarcus Beasley has signed a new deal with the Houston Dynamo that will see the defender return to the club for the 2018 season]</b> I am excited about having DaMarcus back because he is a true leader and a role model. He demonstrates his professionalism in the way he takes care of himself, and the way he behaves on and off the field is important. In the locker room, he is a point of reference for all his teammates. As a player, he still delivers quality and a proficient level of soccer, ideas, talent and we need that this season.</p>

  <p><b>[Wilmer Cabrera’s debut season as head coach]</b> We’re trying to figure out the best way possible to do preseason but also to be sure that we’re very well prepared for the first games. We’re trying to do that, and we think the results will tell us if we did the right thing.<br /><br />We wanted to be sure that in terms of having players that can give us a little bit more stability, what I’m saying is that we need them to be healthy and be sure they can play consecutive games - especially in the back. We’ve tried to bring in these guys that can give us that, and we’re thinking they’re going to be able to have that consistency. If we have that consistency with the consistency we have up front or on the attacking side - because we’ve been consistent in the attacking side. In two seasons, we’ve been very good at scoring goals. There’s no doubt that everyone knows that we score goals, but we have to create that balance. We’re working as a staff to be sure that we create that balance and we have better seasons and contain more the rivals’ attack<br /><br /><b>[On Alberth Elis]</b> Alberth is a very important player because of what he does and what he’s been doing throughout the two seasons. Now, if there are possibilities that are convenient for the club and for Alberth, we’re going to be happy. I’m going to be happy. That’s what we want. We want players to have better futures and better possibilities. We’re open to doing that if that’s also convenient for the club, for the ownership group. The ownership group made an effort with Alberth when we brought Alberth from Monterrey. It was a financial effort from the club, trying to be sure that we have a very important player. Now, if something is a window or possibility for the club and for the player and it’s beneficial, I don’t have any doubt the club is going to try to do the right things for both.<br /><br /><b>[On Aljaz Struna and MLS veteran Maynor Figueroa]</b> It’s going to take time, it’s not going to be one day because we have new guys in the back, but we believe it’s going to be a good solution first with the new guys and second with the continuity and them playing together for a longer period</p>

  <p><b>[Houston Dynamo get reminder of perils of Concacaf Champions League]</b> We gave them life, and they scored a very good goal. Then, important for us, we made some subs and the guys came in with very good energy, mentality and goals. They changed the game. In 15 minutes we changed the game in our favor. We could’ve scored two more goals.<br /><br /><b>[On the Tigres clash]</b> That’s the game any player would like to play - and for our players, they’re excited about it.We’re going to respect the opponents, but we’re going to try to play the best game of our lives. Why? Because it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to play those guys here and then over there. We’re going to try to enjoy that. And enjoying is when you win. But the beauty of this game is that on the field everyone is equal. Guastatoya today, they were equal and they almost … they got it to 1-0 after 72 minutes. So you have to play the games, and we’re excited about the possibility to represent MLS against Tigres</p>

I think it’s a very good learning game for us because it is important to understand that we were working well, we were running, we were moving but at the end when you have the ball you have to put in the quality.</p>

We wish him all the best moving forward. At this time, we as a club believe the team will benefit from a fresh perspective as we enter the final third of our season and make a push to qualify for the playoffs</p>

We hope to bring back confidence to this group of players for the last stretch of the season, to get a playoff spot and to perform in the Canadian Championship final</p>
