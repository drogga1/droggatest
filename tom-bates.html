  <p><b>[Tom Bates believes <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>’s example will help to encourage other clubs to follow suit while the Covid-19 crisis persists]</b> The players that I have spoken with from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> all the way through, they have different perspectives, naturally. One of the things that the guys have said is, ‘Well, actually at our club we are quite a wealthy club, so we could probably afford to keep our staff paid, but other clubs in different leagues won’t be able to do that’. Others feel like taking a pay cut to keep their staff on board is absolutely fine. The classic case is <a href="lionel-messi.html">Leo Messi</a>, who started this and was one of the first players to take a 70 per cent pay cut in order to make sure the staff at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> were able to carry on working, and I think that really is a global example to everybody when you’re talking about that level in money in wages, and that type of athlete. I am very privileged: I have met <a href="lionel-messi.html">Leo Messi</a> and <b>[Pep]</b> <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> over there in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> together as a team, and it doesn’t surprise me that they are leading the way with this. If there was going to be a global example of a player out there doing something for the greater good of their club - and he embodies that for me - so, in my professional opinion, if you can afford that and if you’re able to support by taking a pay cut, then clearly those who need it the most are going to benefit</p>

  <p><b>[Bates praises the influence of former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and England captain <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> in encouraging conversations around mental health]</b> Wayne is in many ways an ambassador, he is a cultural leader for the game, especially because of what he has achieved at international level, and certainly to be continuing his career even now and still performing at a very high level encourages others to do the same. When you have somebody like Wayne come and be very open and very honest about mental health on a global level within the game, that can only be a good thing because it encourages others to have conversations, to open up conversations and be courageous enough to talk about their own mental health, and of course talking about it is the first step to improving it</p>
