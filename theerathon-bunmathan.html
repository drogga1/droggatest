<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Theerathon Bunmathan created a slice of history last year by becoming the first Thai player to win the J.League]</b> To play in the J.League was my dream. I had decided to move to Japan if I had the opportunity to play outside of the Thai league, rather than the likes of the Chinese Super League or Australian A-League.<br /><br />My experiences in Japan have allowed me to be challenged mentally and develop a hungry spirit. It took me two to three months to adapt to the playing style of the J.League, Japanese culture and climate, as it was my first international transfer<br /><br />Initially I watched some matches from a higher perspective high up in the stadium. That helped me to understand appropriate positioning, better timing to join attacks and required movement etc. All of which is necessary to play here<br /><br />I believe Thai players can succeed in the J.League. Some young players will have that opportunity in the future, but they should understand it will be tough and they will have challenges. Great football technique is not enough<br /><br />I believe Thailand is moving forward step by step because some players, including me, play in competitive leagues outside of <b>[the Thai]</b> national league. To be a stronger team, the important thing is to raise good players consistently<br /><br />I have the feeling that Qatar 2022 is my last chance to attend a World Cup. It is not easy to win out of the qualification phase and we are in a challenging situation in the current round. But I will try to do my best and put everything on the line in order to get good results</p>
