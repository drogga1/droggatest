  <p><b>[Adrien Silva on Pepe’s last-minute goal which led to Portugal clinching third at the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Confederations Cup]</b> A thief in the last second - it’s one of those goals. It created such a good sensation. It felt like retribution for all the work we did in the entire game and it gave us that extra force that carried us through</p>

  <p><b>[Portugal international Adrien Silva is finally free to play for Leicester City]</b> It’s been very frustrating, but now the difficult times are past me and now I’m very happy to be close to my goal. I’ve been working hard every day to arrive at this moment and I’m in good shape. It’s been very important to keep training because it’s a long time not playing and of course I can work and train more than normal, but there is nothing better than the game. I will be in good shape because I have worked a lot - I have confidence in that - but I have to play games to get better.</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester star Adrien Silva is delighted that a potential move to Chelsea in 2005 went up in smoke when he was a boy at Sporting CP]</b> Thanks to God. It was a very strange moment and I was so young. To have this club approach me, especially when Mourinho comes to talk to you … at this time, we didn’t know why he came. But when the club wants something, they do everything. He came to see me in Portugal and we went there, to Chelsea, to see the training ground. Then we came back and it was a big, big situation with Sporting<br /><br />I had some injuries in my career but then you know why you don’t play and that’s part of football, so you can accept it. But this situation wasn’t correct. It wasn’t correct because I was able to play physically and I didn’t do anything wrong to make this situation. I will never understand the decision of Fifa - even after Leicester had tried everything to change it. OK, if it is so many hours <b>[after the deadline]</b>, but we’re talking about seconds here. So I think it was a very poor decision</p>
