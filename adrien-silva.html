  <p><b>[Adrien Silva on Pepe’s last-minute goal which led to Portugal clinching third at the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Confederations Cup]</b> A thief in the last second - it’s one of those goals. It created such a good sensation. It felt like retribution for all the work we did in the entire game and it gave us that extra force that carried us through</p>
