<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Cardiff City could face a Premier League points deduction if they fail to honour their £15 million ($19m) agreement to sign Emiliano Sala from Nantes]</b> If certain deadlines, which are mentioned in the transfer contract, are not met, then these may trigger consequences for the club in question. This can be from admonishment right up to a withdrawal of league points. It’s a very tricky situation as we are talking about a human tragedy and an important amount of money. It’s a human case on one side, and on the other side, for Nantes, a financial case and compensation that they are potentially not receiving. They have also lost a key player and for them it’s the sporting effect as well that needs to be considered.<br /><br />There are, in my opinion, two possible solutions. The first one is that the parties have decided to skip FIFA and, in such a case, the matter is submitted to the Players’ Status Committee in the first instance, with the possibility of an appeal to CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport). For this kind of matter, there is an obligation to go to football or sports-related bodies. It is also an advantage for the parties involved to go to a body that is specialised in football matters because they have a better understanding of the case and are far faster <b>[at coming to conclusions]</b>. I think it is very likely that Nantes will proceed to the end to get compensation in what is a unique case, and the two clubs will sit at a table to find a suitable solution for all of them</p>
