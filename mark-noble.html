  <p><b>[<a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> midfielder Mark Noble has praised the talents of the latest youngsters to graduate through the club’s academy]</b> I think Jordan, Moncs, Hally, Matthias, young Leo - who has travelled with us to the last two <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> games and been on the bench - and the others are doing well. If they keep on grafting, don’t let it go to their heads when they travel with the first team and put it in when they play for the Development Squad, then they will keep enjoying it and keep moving forward. We have got a good crop of young players and they will soon be pushing the seniors for their places. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is obviously a tough league to come into - I learnt that as a 17-year-old that it’s a tough ask and you’ve got to be mentally capable to do that - but hopefully they can keep pushing us</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Noble, West Ham’s captain, admitted he had been angered by the Frenchman’s decision to go on strike]</b> I am angry and disappointed, because I have always said that he is one of the best players I have ever played with. I had - and I say had because I haven’t really spoken to him for the last two or three weeks - a great relationship with him, but I don’t know his reasons.</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Noble does not expect to see another goalscoring midfielder in the same mould as former Chelsea star Frank Lampard]</b> I would like to pay tribute to Frank Lampard who retired a month or so ago. He has done everything in the game and won nigh-on everything, and I don’t think there will be another goalscoring midfielder like him. Frank gave us some tough afternoons and evenings when he scored against us, but he has done some things for me personally down the years which I will never forget and I wish him a very happy retirement and success in whatever he does next.</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham captain Mark Noble says a team effort made victory over Manchester United possible]</b> It’s a great feeling. It’s not only the result but also the way we played against a set of world-class players. It’s a credit to the team. Our confidence is high. We really wanted to win. Manchester United are fantastic, and a bit of magic from their team can change the game. The way we defended was fantastic. Zabaleta was fantastic. The two centre-halves and Arthur were brilliant. Our all-round team performance was brilliant.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> extend Noble contract to 2021]</b> I’ve been at this club all my life - I’ve always said I wanted to be at this club and I think we’re moving in the right direction, so it was the right time to do it. To be honest, I haven’t done my coaching badges. Football is so intense now that when it gets to the summer, I like to spend it with my kids and the wife. I’d love to be involved somewhere though.<br /><br />I think there’s no better person than me at this club to know the morals and ensure the foundations are kept with the young players and staff members</p>

  <p><b>[Hammers captain Mark Noble says <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> did scare <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> January was a bad month for us. We defended fantastically well and probably deserved to win tonight. You can’t play man to man against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and out-pass them. You have to keep your shape and stop them.<br /><br />We scared them. You have to do that against the top teams. I’m just gutted we didn’t come away with the three points. We’re gutted in there because the goal was clearly offside. We scored a fantastic set-play and didn’t manage to get a second goal</p>

  <p><b>[Noble revealed the players have spoken about the situation and hope to now build on Monday’s 1-1 draw with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to finally turn the corner]</b> We spoke about January in-house, together, and said look, the window has closed now. To be honest everyone has been great and is fully on board<br /><br /><b>[Despite some poor finishing all round from <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Manuel Pellegrini</a>’s side, Noble did admit the performance alone was something to be optimistic about heading into the rest of the season]</b> I think we did deserve more with the chances we had on Monday. I should have scored myself, Chicha had a great chance, Dec had a great chance, and their goal was offside.<br /><br />They are such a fantastic team and we were on a bad run of results the last three weeks, so to perform the way we did was a massive boost. We bounced back well from going 1-0 down, we scored a really clever goal and, yes, we probably should have won it in the end.</p>

  <p><b>[Noble proud of <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> season. Noble concedes that there are areas of improvement but overall he is pleased with how the season progressed]</b> I am also really proud of the season we’ve just had. To have secured a top-ten finish in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> was a real achievement, make no mistake about it<br /><br />The board invested heavily last summer and we have made real progress, both in our results and the way we’ve been playing. For me, we’ve had a very good season.<br /><br />We did not just bring in a new manager and nine new players last summer; we brought in a whole new philosophy and a whole new style of play.<br /><br />It would always take time for <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Manuel Pellegrini</a>’s methods to take effect and, since that happened, we have produced some superb performances and some outstanding results.<br /><br />As a player, it’s been so enjoyable to be part of it all, too. While professional football is about winning and losing, at the end of the day it is still a sport and meant to be fun, and I have definitely had a lot of fun being part of Manuel’s team this season.<br /><br />If I think back to my favourite moments, obviously beating <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> and becoming the first visiting team to win at their new stadium was the highlight, but it wasn’t the only one.<br /><br />Our win at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> got us going back in September and it’s always nice to get one over <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, then obviously to finish with three wins and a couple of goals at <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> on Sunday was the icing on the cake.<br /><br />We are only four or five points off where we wanted to be, but with no wins in the first four and we’ve probably been a little bit sloppy against the teams in the lower end of the league this year, but some of our performances, especially at London Stadium, have been fantastic.<br /><br />I am down at the Academy a lot as my son Lenny is there, and I must say I am hugely impressed with the redevelopment work that has been done at Chadwell <a href="tobin-heath.html">Heath</a>. It is a special place for <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> and it is so important that we continue to produce our own players.<br /><br />The women’s team have also really impressed me this season - their first as full-time professionals. They did something we would all love to do as <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> players by reaching an FA Cup final and their future looks really bright</p>

We know how big <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> in China and it has wonderful support, so to come and see it first-hand is pretty special</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a> should leave <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> now fans are on his back]</b> Granit has taken a lot of flak for his reaction. But I did have some sympathy for him. I know what it’s like when things are not going as well as you would like because, if you’re a manager or a captain, fans tend to aim more criticism at you.<br /><br />It’s a tough one and a fine line because you’re trying your best, but if you’re booed by your fans it is inevitable that your confidence will take a hit. I’ve had it myself, but the bottom line is that everything changes with results.<br /><br />Obviously, Granit has made mistakes and sometimes his discipline may not be the best, but the way I’ve always seen it is that the fans pay their hard-earned money, they go to the games and they have a right to express their opinion<br /><br />In all honesty, the best solution might be to tell his agent, ‘Look, they don’t like me here, so maybe it’s best if I go and play somewhere else’<br /><br />There would be a lot of takers for him because he is a quality player and it does seem, from the outside, that his fellow players love him, both as a professional and a person. If I was him I would say, ‘I’ve had a great time here, but it’s not worked out recently and it’s time for a new challenge’.<br /><br />I remember <a href="slaven-bilic.html">Slaven Bilic</a> telling me, ‘Once the box is open, it never closes’. The chances are that, if he makes one bad pass in the next match in which he plays, they’ll be on him again</p>

We continue to do all we can, collectively and individually, throughout this period for the benefit of those around us, our colleagues, our supporters and our community.<br /><br />On behalf of the players I send our best wishes to all of our supporters and their families, especially those who have been directly affected by the virus, and I look forward to the day that we can all be back together again</p>
