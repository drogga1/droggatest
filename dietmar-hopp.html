  <p><b>[Hoffenheim owner Dietmar Hopp has hit back against protests against his ownership of the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> club, saying he will not stop attending matches]</b> If I remotely knew what these idiots wanted from me, it would be all the easier for me to understand. I can’t explain why they are so hostile towards me. It reminds me of very dark times. I don’t want to talk to these people. It’s pointless. They live in another world. I don’t want to and I can’t talk to them, not at all. I don’t know what to say to them. Why shouldn’t I go to the stadium anymore? The people who do this are the ones who should stay away</p>

  <p><b>[The Hoffenheim chief has revealed that CureVac have been on the frontlines of the crisis since the turn of the year, and he insists that a breakthrough could be made in the next six to seven months. When asked how long it will be before a vaccine is released to the public]</b> That depends on the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute (the german institute for vaccines). It has to be tested first with animals and then with human beings. But I think it could be available in autumn at the time when possibly the next wave of infections will come<br /><br /><b>[Hopp, however, insists that the vaccine will not be privatised]</b> If we succeed soon to develop an effective vaccine against the coronavirus then this vaccine should reach, protect and help people all over the world and not only in one region.</p>

  <p><b>[UEFA officials are due to convene on Tuesday to discuss how best to move forward regarding the current season, with it suggested that Euro 2020 may be pushed back by a year to allow clubs to complete their schedules]</b> This tournament <b>[Euro 2020]</b> has to be cancelled, it could be played next year. This would have the advantage that the Club World Cup could not be played. That tournament <b>[the Club World Cup]</b> is not advisable anyway</p>

  <p><b>[Billionaire Hopp, recently targeted by fans around the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> due to his heavy investment in Hoffenheim, was unequivocal in his support of the ban on football, but thinks big clubs should step in to help]</b> This break is absolutely necessary because people’s health must be the priority. There cannot and must not be two opinions. Football cannot separate itself from society - and we would be well advised not to claim a special role in this absolute crisis and exceptional situation. Countless small and medium-sized businesses in this country are facing these problems, and many people have to put up with enormous restrictions and burdens. The same applies there as in football: it is the hour of solidarity. The strong help the weak. I have a lot of sympathy for the idea of ​​a solidarity fund to deal with this exceptional situation. There should be no prohibitions on thinking. We at Hoffenheim will definitely work out an idea. We want to develop a vaccine for the whole world, not for a country, not for certain classes, not for certain parts of the world. This vaccine, if successfully developed and tested, is not intended to be a speculation or power tool, but to help curb a global crisis</p>
