  <p><b>[<a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a> president Rodolfo Landim says the club has held talks with <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Mario Balotelli</a> following the expiration of the forward’s contract with <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a>]</b> It is not news to anyone that when <b>[manager Jorge]</b> Jesus arrived he requested that we add another player. In this case, <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Balotelli</a> is a great player. During the period that Marcos Braz and Bruno Spindel were doing their trip <b>[in Europe]</b>, they came into contact with <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Balotelli</a>, who showed a real interest in playing at <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a> and said he would like to. It has been nothing beyond that so far. It was a quick talk they had, that’s what they told me<br /><br />He’s a great player, no doubt. Now there’s a lot of water to roll under that bridge. It is fact: he is free in the market, but there’s nothing else besides what I’m saying. There was contact and he showed interest in playing here and the conversation has not evolved since then. The evaluation process is an ongoing process. We started doing this at the beginning of the year and we will always be looking to evaluate, sign good players that we understand can improve the quality, and eventually sell players if we understand that the team got too big</p>

  <p><b>[Ten young <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a> hopefuls lost their lives at the start of 2019 in a training ground fire]</b> This is without a doubt the worst tragedy this club has been through. The most important thing now is for us to try to minimise the pain and suffering of these families<br /><br /><b>[<a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a> contend that they have voluntarily come to an agreement to pay R$5,000 a month to those affected and claimed the verdict was reached behind their backs]</b> <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a> were not informed of this decision, but if it is unfavourable and we are not in agreement we will appeal</p>
