  <p><b>[Roy Evans says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> will not be leaving <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> any time soon]</b> Everyone will try and knock us off our perch now. That comes with being the best. That’s fine. Jurgen will be ready. But, yeah, winning the first one gives you confidence and belief that you can do it. If we can win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> this time, who knows where it can take us? Jurgen is crucial to it of course but I can see no reason why he would leave. While we are playing like this, why would he even think about it?<br /><br />You want to be a top club and <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> has taken us back to being the best club team in the world. This year they have been fantastic in terms of results and style. It’s been almost perfect at times<br /><br /><b>[Evans happy for the Reds to wait for that crown]</b> They are right to stop the season and it cannot resume until it is safe. This is only football, after all. But I hope we get the title eventually, somehow. I hope we get the games played. After waiting 30 years we can wait another few months if we have to. I must say that if somebody had told me that day in 1990 that we weren’t going to win the league again for three decades I would have said, ‘Yeah, OK mate. See you next season’. To not win the league for that long? No, I wouldn’t have believed it</p>
