  <p><b>[Ugo Ehiogu: Former England defender dies after suffering cardiac arrest]</b> I can’t fathom he’s no longer here. He was a tremendous person, a tremendous character, a dedicated footballer and dedicated to his family. He was a great guy to be around, so full of life and so enthusiastic. As a centre-back, I rate him right up there. He suffered from injuries throughout his career, but with more consistency he could have added to his England caps. He was very much a family man and it’s such a shame to leave such a young family behind</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Schwarzer admits Eden Hazard is a big loss for Chelsea]</b> It goes without saying how important Eden Hazard has been for the team over the last couple of years. But I just know that sometimes a player of that magnitude, a player of that importance, a player who needs to be on the ball so often, can sometimes be such a focal point that it takes responsibility away from other players. What’s going to happen now is there are other players in that squad who have to step up and start delivering more consistent performances. There are guys at Chelsea who have been hot and cold for a number of seasons, and now they have an opportunity <b>[to prove themselves]</b>. They’ve lost one of the best players in the world and it’s a big loss, no doubt about it whatsoever.<br /><br />However, Chelsea have still got a very strong squad and then you take into consideration the amount of players they have out on loan. <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> is in a position, if he were to be the next manager, to say, ‘right, what’s going to work, how are we going to slot this in, how are we going to mix and match for the next 12 months?’. I still believe Chelsea will be looking for a top-four finish. They are more than capable with the quality of players they have in their squad, it’s just finding the right mix.</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Schwarzer had never heard of N’Golo Kante when he arrived at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> but soon grew to realise that he was a superstar in the making]</b> I had never heard of him when we signed him. We watched him training and thought ‘wow, he has something.’ Then that progressed and progressed. He is pretty shy. On a football pitch he comes out of himself a bit more but he is still a very shy individual. That had a lot to do with the language barrier. Since learning English, he has come out of himself a little bit more but he is very much firmly with his feet on the ground. What you see on the football pitch on a matchday is the same as on the training field.<br /><br />He doesn’t turn it on and off. He is pretty much that every day on a football pitch. After he played a few League Cup games, you thought ‘he needs to go straight into the team, he is what we need’. The minute he played, you knew. ‘Wow, he is incredible’. Then you think ‘how long can he keep it up?’ And he kept going on and on. His work rate is unbelievable and he does it effortlessly. When you look at his face, he doesn’t look tired. He always has a smile on his face and it is a genuine one. I can’t speak highly enough about him<br /><br />For N’Golo this season, I think the biggest issue has been the sheer number of games he has played over the last couple of years. He has had slight niggles and always played on. He is a phenomenal athlete. A very humble guy and a great footballer. His rise is well-documented and it has been phenomenal. I was very fortunate to have spent a season with him. I played a couple of games in the League Cup with him. From the minute he played, you could tell he had something special. In terms of his strengths, I think they were underutilised under <b>[Maurizio]</b> <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> last season. The expectation of getting forward, he has the ability to do it as he showed, but his real strength is breaking up the play and gaining it back. He gives cover for the backline. If they have a fit N’Golo Kante, he should sit next to <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a> or <a href="mateo-kovacic.html">Kovacic</a>. <a href="n-golo-kante.html">Kante</a> gives that important balance that they don’t have when he isn’t there<br /><br /><b>[Schwarzer also commented on <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a>’s decision to return to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in a role as technical and performance advisor]</b> I used to chat with him a lot. You could tell he wasn’t just going to be a goalkeeping coach or sit in front of the camera and do the media side of things. He had grander ideas for his future. It is a perfect position for him. He takes an interest in football as a whole. He tries to make every aspect of his game better. That will transfer into his role as he looks to get small percentages out of people. I think he has some good ideas and he is very open-minded when it comes to learning new things as well</p>

  <p><b>[Australia’s legendary goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer thinks that his country will quickly become reliant on <a href="daniel-arzani.html">Daniel Arzani</a>’s pace and trickery as they rebuild a new generation of footballer]</b> <a href="daniel-arzani.html">Daniel Arzani</a> is one of those players who has been incredibly exciting and particularly leading up to the World Cup in 2018. He had a phenomenal breakthrough season in the A-League. He didn’t play enough games over 90 minutes, which is something he needs to build on. The Celtic move is one which I am not sure is the best move for him just yet. But it is about playing games and continuing to develop.<br /><br />His injury came at the very worst time as he just arrived and got his first opportunity to play from the start. It was not only unfortunate for his career at Celtic but also for Australia. I just hope that he can get back to the level he was at before his injury. He is a huge emerging talent from Australia. That’s why <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> signed him. I know he was at their sister club in Melbourne. He is a huge talent. He is very unpredictable. We haven’t had a player like that for a very long time. He has no fear on the ball. He is prepared to take players on. Drop a shoulder number of times and use a burst of pace. He does that effortlessly. He has a low centre of gravity, so it enables him to be nimble and quick. I hope his injury doesn’t affect that side of his game<br /><br /><b>[Schwarzer is concerned about the lack of Australian talent playing in top leagues]</b> Firstly, in international football, you continually evolve. We had a big part of our squad that stuck around for a long time then left and that change was always going to be difficult. There is a whole lot of retirement over a short period of time. The adjustment is huge. We have stagnated a bit in terms of the players we are developing. I mean we don’t have many players playing at the highest level in Europe. We only have a select few. In the past, we had 10 to 12 in the best leagues in Europe. We are nowhere near as spoiled for choice as we used to be. So it is a tough job and a job that needs a lot of coaching and prep work to develop the players we have. We need to turn them into better players</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Schwarzer says David De Gea’s been average for six months]</b> They will have to come to a decision at some point on whether his value is the same as what he is asking for. There’s speculation about him and then there’s the fact that he may still choose to leave. Ultimately there comes the point where your history and your past performances only get you so far. It is about now. If you look at his last six months, his average performances haven’t been anywhere near what they have been in the past. If you break it down, a lot of goals have come from direct mistakes from De Gea. Probably more than in the entire six or seven-year period before. There is always a balancing act as a player. What’s your current value? Your recent performances come into that. Can he get to the level he was at before? Part of that is being consistent. Consistency is not a word I would associate with <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a> over the last six months. If not more<br /><br /><b>[If United do lose De Gea, they could look to promote <a href="dean-henderson.html">Dean Henderson</a>, the England Under-21 goalkeeper on loan at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, but Schwarzer believes he needs to prove himself in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> first]</b> United have a very good goalkeeper <b>[in De Gea]</b>. He has been pretty consistent for most of his time at the club. The first 18 months were mixed, then he was exceptional and in the last 12 months he has dropped off a bit. Over a long period he has been very good for them. I have seen <a href="dean-henderson.html">Dean Henderson</a> play a couple of times, not a lot but a couple of times. He has got a long way to go. He has only had three games in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. It is a position that De Gea has played in for nearly 10 years. I don’t think it’s a genuine comparison at this stage. Let’s see how well Henderson does and evolves throughout the season. Then you can maybe have a better idea if he can play for a club like <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. Playing for <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> in the Championship, no disrespect, is very difficult from playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> in the Premier League<br /><br />A lot of teams have moved towards goalkeepers that can play like outfield players. Alisson and <a href="ederson.html">Ederson</a> have pushed that progression along quickly. Both of them are extremely good with their feet. If you pick the one who has made the biggest impact? I would say Alisson has really helped <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. <a href="ederson.html">Ederson</a> has been really good but I think Alisson was the missing link in the jigsaw for <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> play out from the back more and his consistency helps win them games. De Gea doesn’t start the play. I think he is good with his feet but we don’t see him very often play with his feet, not as much as <a href="ederson.html">Ederson</a> or Alisson</p>

  <p><b>[Outside of only <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> and N’Golo Kante, <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Azpilicueta</a> has arguably been <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s best performer since he joined the club. However, he has not looked himself in recent weeks. Former Blues goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer knows about longevity after making over 500 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> appearances - more than any overseas player]</b> Gym work and looking after yourself - those are things that <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Azpilicueta</a> has been brilliant at and he has delivered on the football pitch. The first couple of performances at a new-look <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> side under a new manager have seen <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Azpilicueta</a> not at the level in the past. Part of that, though, is because the level in the past was so high. I think it is going to take a period of adjustment. You have got a whole load of young players in the side who have played in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> like <a href="andreas-christensen.html">Christensen</a> and <a href="kurt-zouma.html">Kurt Zouma</a>.<br /><br />Some don’t know if they are in there because of injuries or whether the manager has just decided to play you and you can keep that position. At the start of the season, they know they are the number one pairing and it is up to them to stake their claim. <a href="antonio-rudiger.html">Rudiger</a> is coming back fit in a couple of weeks and it is up to them to keep them out of the team. That’s a different prospect, that’s an experience thing. It is not just the pairing. It is the whole team, the combination work and the people in front of them. You don’t just defend as a back four or five. You defend as a whole team. If you don’t have cover in front of you, then you can be exposed. There are errors there and individual errors at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. I was at the <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> game and for all the endeavour, they expose themselves to be countered. That happened a couple of times. Again, it is about finding that balance and making sure they get that spot on</p>

  <p><b>[Former goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer believes <a href="kepa-arrizabalaga.html">Kepa Arrizabalaga</a> could ‘easily’ be <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s first-choice shot-stopper for the next 15 years]</b> I think Kepa has grown, but it’s a massive step up from Athletic Bilbao. There is always that added attention. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> over the years have had top, top keepers. Following <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a> and <a href="thibaut-courtois.html">Thibaut Courtois</a> is no easy feat for anyone. It’s hard for anyone to compare with someone like <a href="petr-cech.html">Cech</a>, who won every <b>[club]</b> trophy there is to win. We can only really do that with Kepa 10 years down the line. With Thibaut, he was there for a shorter amount of time. I was a big fan of his, but longevity is huge so Petr stands alone. At 25, Kepa is very young in goalkeeping terms. He has a long way to go. He could be there for the next 15 years easily - if he stays fit and continues to get better and better<br /><br /><b>[Schwarzer, though, is keen to see the whole team work together in recovering possession to ease the load on the 25-year-old]</b> When you’re conceding goals, it plays a big part on your mind as a keeper, even if you are not at fault. The fact is you are the conductor, you are leading the guys, you are in charge of organising the line and you do feel responsible. You feel it is a blemish on you and keepers are judged on how many clean sheets they keep. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are conceding more goals this season but that is down to the set-up as well. It is hard. You need a team to work well together, to operate as 11 defending, not just the back four and the keeper. It is unusual to see <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> let in so many. But they are in a transitional period, there are inexperienced players learning their trade. They are doing very well but part of the sacrifice is you’re leaving yourself more open and let opponents have more chances. Without setting the world alight, I think Kepa has played well this season. It is going to take time. You have to stay confident</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Schwarzer says <a href="daniel-arzani.html">Daniel Arzani</a> made a mistake in agreeing a loan move from <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> to Celtic]</b> It took him (Arzani) a while to even get that opportunity to start in a Celtic side and when he signed for them, I said straight away, ‘I think it’s the wrong move for him’. I don’t think Celtic’s style of play suits him; I don’t think it’s the right environment for him to go into to develop as a player. And what do I mean by that? He needs game time. He needs to play in a first-team. He needs to play in a team that plays a style of football that suits him best<br /><br />He’s a very gifted technical player, a player that loves to get the ball at his feet and run at the opposition, but as a ball-playing player, he needs other intelligent players around him. So, I would have thought his best move would have been a place either like Germany, (or) in Holland. They play a more technical-based game of football and they also give a lot of young players opportunities. So, I always said, I think the Celtic move is the wrong move for him<br /><br />For <a href="daniel-arzani.html">Daniel Arzani</a>, I think he was ill-advised. Yes, he has been out injured so forget that, but (the) beginning part I think he struggled. He got injured in his very first game. But before that, it took him ages to get in there because apparently, he wasn’t up to speed. And I kind of get that coming from Australia, not playing 90 minutes of football very often, he did need bringing up to speed and it was going to take him a bit of time. But Celtic are not the type of team that was going to suit <a href="daniel-arzani.html">Daniel Arzani</a> in my opinion<br /><br />From a tactical point of view, from a technical point of view, I don’t think he is tested enough because of the opposition they play enough every week. If he goes to a more competitive league, I think he would also do well in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, again I think that is a perfect league for someone like Tom Rogic<br /><br />He wouldn’t be at a <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> that would be winning the league, or a <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> or <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> necessarily, or at the top and expecting to win every game, he’ll be a mid-table team so you are coming up against far better opposition. The time when Rogic gets tested the most, as with other Celtic players, is when they play in Europe and that is then a do-or-die situation because you’ve got a limited amount of games to perform and get up to speed. It’s like anything, if you go to another league, step up, I’m not saying the teams he is going to go to are going to be better than Celtic, it is just going to be in a league that is more competitive</p>

Whenever the manager decides to change a No.1 because he doesn’t feel that the performances have been at the level they should is a huge call itself. If a goalkeeper comes in and has an absolute disaster then I can understand a manager deciding to bring the No.1 back in - but he didn’t. <a href="wilfredo-caballero.html">Caballero</a> has come in and done a job. You wouldn’t say he has been outstanding but you wouldn’t say he has done badly. You know with <a href="wilfredo-caballero.html">Caballero</a> what you are going to get. I think the fact he made the decision that he believed he needed to make means he needs to stick with it for a little bit. I think that Kepa is all about his reaction and how he gets his head down<br /><br />He was conceding far too many goals, goals you would analyse and say on another day that he should have saved it. You analyse it and if that stuff happens too often, then you ask is it a technical problem? I am not sure where they are at in training and how they have adapted it. How are they trying to help him? There is no doubt that they will be trying to get him up to speed. One of the things for goalkeepers is that we are pretty set in our ways. Kepa will have a way that he trains, a way he likes to prepare for games and if you have a goalkeeping coach and other people trying to change it then that can cause resistance at times. It can take time to actually take it on board and accept the need to try and take a different technique and change things a bit. That might take time to do it and if they don’t embrace it then that can have a detrimental effect<br /><br />I think with Kepa, he is just trying to find his way. With Kepa, he has not been at a club like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> before and he is under the spotlight even more than at Athletic Club. This is still a learning process for him. He is still young. For Kepa, it could be the best thing that has happened to him that he comes out of the limelight that he gets back to training and working hard. Then he might get phased back in again in a couple of games’ time. There is an expectation at the club. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have had a run of goalkeepers who have been world class and then when you are not seeing the same consistency in goal then it stands out very much. With Kepa, that’s the problem. He has had to fill some huge shoes from top-class goalkeepers. He hasn’t played consistently at the level that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> staff, fans and owners are used to<br /><br />I think he will come back in the team between now and the end of the season and I think it all depends on how he performs when he gets an opportunity. There are concerns but I don’t think they will have made a decision on his future. I think when he comes in towards the end of the season that will be his opportunity to prove whether or not he has learned, worked hard enough and start performing better so the club can make a decision on whether to stick with him or to look to bring someone else in.</p>

He’s actually a really likeable person, he’s got a great sense of humour, he’s great for team morale, when things are going really well he’s brilliant. Am I surprised he’s been offered a new deal? They’re obviously not basing it off the last performance. There’s no doubt about that, they’ve been in discussions with him for a while. I think it was an activation of an extension of the contract. Listen, he’s got some really good qualities. I know he’s made some high-profile errors that have led to goals and been costly for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> but when you get him right and he’s mentally on song he can be a very valuable asset to the team<br /><br />He’s a likeable character within the group. I don’t know many people who didn’t get on with him or didn’t like him. He’s always bubbly <b>[but]</b> there’s no doubt he would have been down after the game against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>. He wears his heart on his sleeve so that would have affected him. I know that within the group he’s generally very well liked and considered an important member of the squad in terms of morale</p>
