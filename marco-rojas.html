  <p><b>[Melbourne Victory winger Marco Rojas has urged his team to be more clinical in front of goal in their third clash with Sydney FC this season]</b> It was disappointing in both of those games that that <b>[giving up a lead]</b> happened. But we learnt a lot from those games and we learnt that we need to be more clinical because good teams - if you’re only 1-0 - they’re always in with a shout and they’ll put pressure on you, and <b>[Sydney]</b> are a good team. They’ve got good quality up front, so they’re capable of scoring goals too.<br /><br />We’ll have a look if we get a free-kick at where the position is and have a chat about it and decide who we think is the best to take it<br /><br /><b>[Rojas reckons it’s time for the A-League to introduce international breaks]</b> I understood why at the start it wasn’t like that because this wasn’t really happening but now it’s a different story. The A-League is a different league. It’s a lot better - there are better imports coming in and a few of the Australians are picking up Socceroos caps. So it’s definitely something they need to look at because it’s not ideal when the <b>[international]</b> window comes along and three or four players are going</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne Victory winger Marco Rojas is relishing the build-up to Sunday’s A-League semi-final as he aims to qualify for his maiden grand final and - potentially - lift his first piece of club silverware]</b> It’s not often that you get to play in games like this. I’ve only played in one semi-final since I’ve been playing in the A-League, and to get another chance and to do that at home is something I’m very much looking forward to.<br /><br />I’ve only won one tournament and that was with the national team - the <b>[2016 Oceania]</b> Nations Cup - so in my club career I haven’t been lucky enough to win anything yet. So for me it’s a very important couple of weeks to and I’m looking forward to it<br /><br /><b>[Brisbane then had to travel to Thailand this week as part of their AFC Champions League duties]</b> It’s totally different to the <b>[regular]</b> season. Everyone knows that it’s elimination, you’ve give everything you’ve got to win the game otherwise that’s it. So I doubt that will be much of a problem for them <b>[Brisbane]</b> for what’s on the line</p>
