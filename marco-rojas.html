<blockquote>
  <p>[Melbourne Victory winger Marco Rojas has urged his team to be more clinical in front of goal in their third clash with Sydney FC this season] It was disappointing in both of those games that that [giving up a lead] happened. But we learnt a lot from those games and we learnt that we need to be more clinical because good teams - if you’re only 1-0 - they’re always in with a shout and they’ll put pressure on you, and [Sydney] are a good team. They’ve got good quality up front, so they’re capable of scoring goals too.<br /><br />We’ll have a look if we get a free-kick at where the position is and have a chat about it and decide who we think is the best to take it<br /><br />[Rojas reckons it’s time for the A-League to introduce international breaks] I understood why at the start it wasn’t like that because this wasn’t really happening but now it’s a different story. The A-League is a different league. It’s a lot better - there are better imports coming in and a few of the Australians are picking up Socceroos caps. So it’s definitely something they need to look at because it’s not ideal when the [international] window comes along and three or four players are going</p>
