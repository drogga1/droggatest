  <p><b>[USMNT center-back competition wide open heading into World Cup qualifiers]</b> I think Bruce has shown, even going back to the March friendlies, that there’s competition <b>[at center back]</b>. Even when <b>[John Brooks]</b> is in there’s competition. He’s not afraid to shuffle the pack and change things up and choose pairings that he sees as the optimal pairing for that match depending on what the strikers are doing, or the team as a whole that we’re playing.<br /><br />Obviously there was a decent amount of success down in Azteca. I can’t say definitively if we’ll see it again or not. I think we did a pretty good job, enough so that it gives them something to think about and it gives them an option. It’s something that maybe we can tweak, even in the flow of a game. You might see it. We haven’t really discussed tactics up to this point, but I think it worked well enough that it’s definitely an option going forward<br /><br />It’s nice to have competition. It keeps you on your toes. It keeps that competitiveness there. I think that’s important, not just at the club level, but at the international level. If you know you’re coming in and not going to get a shot, and a chance to play. It’s kind of demoralizing to be honest with you. I’ve been there, I’ve experienced that. It’s nice to come in and know that you have a very good chance of playing in one of the two games</p>

  <p><b>[Tim Ream ready to be ‘the next man’ up in USA defense]</b> At the time <b>[in college]</b> if you had told me I’d be here with the national team and somewhat established I might have laughed in your face. I don’t think I could have envisioned what my career has been and has become. It’s something that’s a lot of hard hours, a lot of long hours and a lot of sacrifices in areas that people who aren’t around professional sports don’t understand.<br /><br />Personally, I want to be starting games, but we all know as a national team you may be the star and start for your club team and come in with your national team and temper expectations and take on a different role. I think that’s the beauty of this team. Right now I’m one of those ‘Next man up’ types and for me to be next man up and come in and show that you have the ability to help out the squad in any way that you can is something that right now I’m very well aware of and something I’ve embraced<br /><br />I think Bruce has shown, even going back to the March friendlies, that’s there’s competition. Even when <b>[John Brooks]</b> is in there’s competition. He’s not afraid to shuffle the pack and change things up, and choose pairings that he sees as the optimal pairing for that match depending on what the strikers are doing, or the team as a whole that we’re playing<br /><br />It’s still really home. It was a place that gave me a chance to shine and prove myself on the professional level. There’s still a lot of people here that were here when I was, and that was five, five and a half years now. You don’t find that at a lot of clubs these days, so it’s nice to see some familiar faces and some old friends and it’s just nice to be back and see the things you used to see every day. It’s a little bit nostalgic really</p>

  <p><b>[The Championship play-offs get under way on Friday night as Derby host Fulham in the first leg of the semi-finals]</b> It was down to us, it was there for us, we got the result we needed in the Cardiff game and, pardon my French, but we shit the bed.</p>

  <p><b>[Fulham have announced that U.S national team star Tim Ream has committed to a new two-year contract with the club]</b> I wanted to sort it out fairly quickly. It gives you the freedom and the licence to go out and focus on the football, so it’s just nice to have it done. The goal all along was to be in the Premier League, and now to have the opportunity to play there with this group of guys is something that I think we’re all looking forward to, not just myself, and hopefully we can make it special this year.</p>

  <p><b>[Berhalter’s USMNT project set for next step as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams return]</b> He’s very focused on doing a good job and implementing his system. That’s a breath of fresh air because if was ‘Let’s qualify by any means necessary’, chopping and changing, switching things up, whatever it took. He’s very focused on playing a certain way and sticking to it.</p>

  <p><b>[Tim Ream says Fulham did not show the togetherness]</b> There should have been <b>[strong words]</b> all season long. There were some hard truths. We’ll see if it resonates with the guys. We will approach the remaining games like we have for every game. We will go out to try to get points, albeit meaningless points. We haven’t shown a togetherness, unity, desire, passion. We’ve shown it in bits and pieces, in the first half then go dead and flat. We need to find it from somewhere. Guys need to speak up more in training sessions. What we do in the match is a product of what we do between Monday to Friday. What Scott Parker brings to the table is not ultimately down to me.</p>

  <p><b>[Jamaica vs USMNT. Tim Ream, part of a back four that has not conceded a goal throughout the torunament, has pinpointed the speed of the opponents’ transition as a critical factor to consider]</b> We are expecting a fast, physical game as you always get with a team like Jamaica, and they will be very quick on counter-attacks and transitions and that is something that we will have to be wary of. Jamaica have shown over this tournament that they start out really fast, powerful, that’s something that’s probably hard to sustain in the temperatures that we are playing in and the conditions.</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT left-back Tim Ream, who is from St. Louis, also praised the city in a statement as the nation preps for its second-ever match at the home of MLB’s St. Louis Cardinals]</b> The town is incredible for its sporting achievements and what it has accomplished and I’ve been telling all the guys that. And I know Busch Stadium is going to rock as it always does and it will be sold out, such a good crowd as it was four years ago. I think all the guys are looking forward to it.</p>

  <p><b>[Crisis averted! USMNT fight off Canada while rediscovering a little bit of identity in the process]</b> We wanted to play with a desire, a hunger, a passion. We didn’t do that up in Toronto and we got embarrassed. There was no way around it. We were embarrassed after that game and we did not want that to happen again. There was a conscious effort to really bring it from the first whistle and hopefully, everyone saw that<br /><br />A lot of it was just communication between the coaching staff and Brad <b>[Guzan]</b> and myself and some of the more experienced guys on the team. We knew we failed last month, miserably, up in Toronto and we had it on our minds from phone calls even before coming into camp that things had to be different. There were clear lines of communication that we need to put more effort, more work, more desire, more hunger, more physicality into everything we did. That was a big theme this week</p>
