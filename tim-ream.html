  <p><b>[Jamaica vs USMNT. Tim Ream, part of a back four that has not conceded a goal throughout the torunament, has pinpointed the speed of the opponents’ transition as a critical factor to consider]</b> We are expecting a fast, physical game as you always get with a team like Jamaica, and they will be very quick on counter-attacks and transitions and that is something that we will have to be wary of. Jamaica have shown over this tournament that they start out really fast, powerful, that’s something that’s probably hard to sustain in the temperatures that we are playing in and the conditions.</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT left-back Tim Ream, who is from St. Louis, also praised the city in a statement as the nation preps for its second-ever match at the home of MLB’s St. Louis Cardinals]</b> The town is incredible for its sporting achievements and what it has accomplished and I’ve been telling all the guys that. And I know Busch Stadium is going to rock as it always does and it will be sold out, such a good crowd as it was four years ago. I think all the guys are looking forward to it.</p>

  <p><b>[Crisis averted! USMNT fight off Canada while rediscovering a little bit of identity in the process]</b> We wanted to play with a desire, a hunger, a passion. We didn’t do that up in Toronto and we got embarrassed. There was no way around it. We were embarrassed after that game and we did not want that to happen again. There was a conscious effort to really bring it from the first whistle and hopefully, everyone saw that<br /><br />A lot of it was just communication between the coaching staff and Brad <b>[Guzan]</b> and myself and some of the more experienced guys on the team. We knew we failed last month, miserably, up in Toronto and we had it on our minds from phone calls even before coming into camp that things had to be different. There were clear lines of communication that we need to put more effort, more work, more desire, more hunger, more physicality into everything we did. That was a big theme this week</p>
