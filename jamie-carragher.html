  <p><b>[Arsene Wenger should be more embarrassed by the apathy coming from the Arsenal support than the demonstrations to get him sacked last year]</b> Last season there was anger from supporters and marches against Arsene Wenger, which I thought were a disgrace. But I think tonight was worse. The Arsenal fans are not actually interested. They didn’t turn up. There were a few boos at the end but it wasn’t the anger of last season. Now it’s almost like resignation, just waiting for the manager to go. How sad is that? That very few, if any, Arsenal fans want Arsene Wenger as the manager next season. This man is a legend in the English game. But they have to change it, it has to be done. There’s no way the end of this season should be about this man being hounded out and going through that in empty stadiums.<br /><br />Make the decision now and give this man the send-off he deserves for what he’s done over 20 years, not what he’s done over the last five, six, 10 years</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah’s stunning form at Liverpool has put him more in the Cristiano Ronaldo bracket than the Lionel Messi mould]</b> Cristiano Ronaldo is the prime example of how the role <b>[of wide forward]</b> has changed. When he joined Manchester United he liked hugging the touchline, performing his step-overs and terrorising right-backs. Now he is completely different player - a goalscorer more than provider. He is disappointed if he comes off the pitch and has not scored. He does not want to be indulging in his party tricks out wide because he cannot shoot from there, so his game is all about cutting inside and getting into the penalty area to swell those extraordinary numbers. That is why although there has been some comparisons made between Salah’s style and that of Lionel Messi - obviously he is not at the level of either Messi or Ronaldo yet - the Liverpool forward has more of Ronaldo’s approach about him. Messi likes to come deeper for the ball and involve himself in the build-up. That is not Salah’s way. He has the mindset of a prolific striker, as demonstrated by how disappointed he is whenever he is substituted late in a match as he craves more goals. It is refreshing to see.<br /><br />If you had asked me a few months ago who deserved this year’s accolade I would have said it must be De Bruyne, especially given the massive gap between the champions-elect and the rest. It will be no surprise if City’s domestic dominance ensures their best player is rewarded. But with respect to the Belgian, the more I assess Salah’s contribution, the more I feel he deserves to push De Bruyne far closer than I imagined. He has the potential to go ahead in the next few weeks, particularly if he produces a match-winning performance at Old Trafford next weekend</p>

  <p><b>[Mauricio Pochettino must take the Manchester United job if it is offered to him]</b> If Mauricio Pochettino is offered the Manchester United job, he has to take it. That is hard for Tottenham Hotspur supporters to accept. Sadly for them, it is inevitable that they are prey to a more powerful Premier League rival. Hearing some arguments against Pochettino moving to Manchester United, I cannot help but think a reality check is needed. It does not matter how great Spurs’ new stadium is and how many supporters fill it. It does not even matter what they win this season or over the next few years. Spurs are not Manchester United. They will never be as big as Manchester United<br /><br />Pochettino owes Spurs nothing. He has done an unbelievable job with a fraction of United’s budget. Only Pochettino’s devotion to his current squad can keep him at Tottenham, allied to a belief he is on the verge of winning the biggest honours. The signs have been there since the summer that his team’s capacities are being stretched to the absolute limit. He expressed frustration at being unable to strengthen. This long-term perspective will be the chief consideration should United call<br /><br />My suspicion is an agreement will be reached that works for all parties this summer. If Pochettino departs at a considerable price, his successor might have more to spend than the current manager should he stay</p>

  <p><b>[Roberto Firmino brings Luis Suarez-esque qualities to Liverpool]</b> Firmino has been a revelation this season. I actually think he is one of the most underrated players in the Premier League. He has always been Liverpool’s number one striker but what he has been adding is the goals. He can actually match up to the other strikers now goals-wise and still bring all the other stuff that he brings. Even without the goals, I don’t think Klopp would ever look to replace Firmino. If Harry Kane gets 40 goals and Firmino gets 20, he would still be one of - if not the first - name on the team sheet because of what he does off the ball. Klopp appreciates all of the extra things that Firmino brings to this Liverpool team that nobody else can. There is something about South American players. They just seem to be able to keep going. Klopp said recently that Firmino has one rest day after a game and then he’s back on it in training and that’s exactly how Luis Suarez was. He never wanted a rest even in training. That is just how some people’s bodies are - they seem to be able to deal with anything.<br /><br />Without a doubt, Firmino is helping Salah too. He is very clever with his passing and his movement drags people out of position as well. He comes towards the ball and that opens up the space for Salah to make that penetrating diagonal run in behind that space between the full-back and the centre-back. It is a great combination for Liverpool</p>

  <p><b>[On weight of centre-back Virgil van Dijk]</b> I think it will prove to be a great signing. But he hasn’t hit the ground running. I think he needs to get fit and lose a bit of weight. He actually looks too big. Maybe that’s to do with not having a pre-season, not playing too many games for Southampton.</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona overpaid for Philippe Coutinho]</b> I think if you lose your best player there’s no way you can dress it up as a positive window. I think every Liverpool fan, when Philippe Coutinho stayed in the summer, thought ‘okay, we know he’s leaving next season. Lets enjoy this 12 months’. To lose him mid-season, I don’t agree with it but for that fee … Coutinho’s not worth that. He’s not that good. I would have taken £20m-£30m less in the summer to know that Liverpool would have had him for the second half of the season because at that time we were still in the FA Cup, still a Champions League to play for.</p>

The financial reward is vast. So is the risk. But I still fear a mid-season deal unnecessarily jeopardises Liverpool’s Champions League place for next season. If they do not finish in the top four, everyone will point at Coutinho’s sale.<br /><br />Regardless of how much Coutinho agitated, Liverpool could have stood firm. While some players, such as Alexis Sanchez and Virgil van Dijk, lost form after being denied their summer move, Coutinho was the opposite. He has never played better for Liverpool than between September and December this season. I am sure the Brazilian would have recovered from his disappointment for four more months</p>

  <p><b>[Champions League win would make Salah a Liverpool legend inside one season]</b> It’s the hope that kills you, isn’t it? It’s natural for a football fan to worry! And with the position Liverpool are in, I suppose you feel you’ve got so much to lose now too.<br /><br />It’d move the manager towards legendary status, and a few of the players too. Rightly so, too. It’d be great for the club, and for the fans more than anything. It’s not been the best decade for us really, but special clubs always come back. They always do something you don’t expect. This is a special club and there is something about the Champions League that brings that out. To think we could have an opportunity to win a sixth European Cup, it’s unbelievable really. We’re not Real Madrid or Barcelona. We can’t buy the biggest players and we don’t have the most money. We’ve not even been the biggest in the Premier League over the past 10 or 20 years. We’ve had to be clever and build teams without household names. So to think of a city in the north west of England with … what’s the population of Liverpool? Half a million? Less? So to have six European Cups wouldn’t be bad, eh?<br /><br />I can see it being a tough game. But what you’ve got to remember is, Liverpool haven’t lost in the Champions League all season, and they don’t lose many games full stop. People say we’re a bit soft or we concede goals or whatever, but we don’t get beat often - and we have to lose this one by three if we’re to go out. And, well, you’ve got to fancy Liverpool to score, haven’t you?<br /><br /><b>[Mo Salah in the kind of form he’s been in]</b> It’s unbelievable. There are so many new stats coming out about him, every single week. He’s breaking records from the 1930s and the 1940s! The great thing about it is he does it every week. You can have players who score hat-tricks or four in a game, then they don’t score for five games. He scores virtually every game! People are comparing him to Suarez when he was here, who would you rather have and all that. But what Salah has over Suarez, for Liverpool, is the big games he’s scored in. Suarez is probably a better player all round, but for a one-off season there can’t be many who have had a season like this in the history of the club<br /><br />When we had Suarez and Torres, we thought they were as good as anyone around. But when they eventually left the club, they only left with ‘he was a great player’. They didn’t actually take the team to something. Salah could take the team to a European Cup, and if he does that he’s a Liverpool legend. When you win a big trophy, everyone is a hero. But there are always a couple of players who you know have dragged you to it. Salah would be a legend inside one season, and right up there with some of the greats in the club’s history<br /><br />I love Firmino. He’s probably my favourite player! What Salah is doing is ‘wow’ but I love watching Firmino play; his touch, the way he links the play, his strength, his working back. And I can’t believe that some people still say we need a centre-forward! I hear pundits on TV saying it and it’s like, ‘Oh my god!’ He’s got 27 goals! And he’s not just a penalty-box striker. He doesn’t take loads of penalties. It’s because of Messi, Ronaldo, Salah now. They’ve changed the way people look at strikers and their numbers. But that’s not normal, what they’re doing! If you’ve got an attacking player getting 25 goals, and doing everything Firmino does besides, then you’ve got a great player. I think he’s arguably Klopp’s most important player, for how we press, what we do. He’s just brilliant.<br /><br /><b>[On Jurgen Klopp]</b> He’s a special manager. He gets pigeon-holed. He’s seen as a motivator, he whips the crowd up and the players run round like headless chickens for him. It’s a load of nonsense. You don’t manage at that level, with different clubs, and get the performances he gets, without being a special manager. Of course a big part of it is his character, his enthusiasm. You’d imagine the players love him, and that is rare. You may respect your manager, but I think these players respect him and they love him. I’ve enjoyed being in his company when I’ve had the chance. He’s a great character, you can see why players would love to play for him. I definitely would!</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool must find themselves another Sadio Mane in the transfer market this summer]</b> You have to be concerned. I thought the squad was very good at the start of the season, but I think what it lacks is cover for the front three. When one of them misses out, the quality coming in is not enough. <b>[Naby]</b> Keita will add quality to the midfield, but I think we do still lack a little bit since <b>[Philippe]</b> Coutinho went in terms of that final pass. Defensively we’re fine in terms of numbers, but I think we need something more in the final third<br /><br />We don’t need a striker. We need a multi-functional player. Another Mane, if you like. You could probably play Mane up front if you wanted to. He can play left, right or up front, like someone like Alexis Sanchez can. There’s no point bringing in a striker to cover for Firmino and sitting him on the bench. You need someone who can come in and cover for one or two players with quality, start games when he needs to and compete with the others. As a manager it’s difficult. You bring in a squad player, and you try to find someone who is good enough to replace your starters, but happy not playing every week. There aren’t many of those players around! If Liverpool can find a really good attacking player who can play two or three positions, he will get games anyway. He will almost play every week. Players need resting, the manager rotates, he changes for different fixtures. It is possible to keep them happy, but you have to find the right player<br /><br />Since I finished playing, these are my great memories. The Europa League run in 2016 and this season. I love it. You just want that feeling that you’re in the mix, in with a shout every season. It’s been too long. I always remember a Liverpool fan writing that he judges the season on the games you play in April. Are you still playing for something? Do the games still matter? If you get to mid-April and the games still mean something, it usually means you’ve had a good a season. There’s nothing worse than getting to April and May and already having to think about next season, who you’re going to buy or sell or whatever. You want to be involved in the big games. Thankfully, Liverpool are. Hopefully they can win one more of them!</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool had to make the record-breaking signing of Alisson]</b> Everyone’s talking about Liverpool and with good reason. You look at getting to a Champions League final and having Virgil van Dijk for a full season. We’ve seen the impact he made after arriving in January. The goalkeeping situation has given everybody a massive lift. What happened in the Champions League final with Loris Karius, yes it was disappointing for the Liverpool supporters on the night losing that game, but we’ve all been there as players where you have a poor game. But it’s happened in a game which will, unfortunately, be remembered for a long time. Hopefully he will go on to be a great goalkeeper and be remembered for that but Liverpool had to make a change because I think there would be no belief in Liverpool actually, never mind winning a league but challenging for the league with the two goalkeepers they had.<br /><br />Simon Mignolet and Karius are good goalkeepers but not great goalkeepers. That’s not to say the guy they have signed is a great goalkeeper. It’s a great price - a world-record price - and when you pay that type of money you are expecting a top goalkeeper, but he will be new to the Premier League so let’s see how he adapts. He looks cool and calm on the ball and that’s what Klopp wants from his goalkeeper, but they were areas that had to be rectified and it looks like most of them have been. So at this moment, on paper, Liverpool do look the strongest challengers.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool may have invested £170 million in fresh faces but that only gives them a one-year window for Premier League title success]</b> Klopp has spent £170 million, but those funds came mainly from the £142m received for Philippe Coutinho last January. We cannot ignore that when trying to redefine Klopp as some kind of chequebook manager, or Liverpool’s American owners as Roman Abramovich-style benefactors. It means this summer’s investment is unlikely to be repeated without selling another star. I wrote last season I feared Liverpool may never win the league under Klopp due to the financial strength in Manchester. I also stated after Coutinho’s sale that the extraordinary fee presented an opportunity - for one summer at least - to outspend the rest of the Premier League. That is the world Liverpool is in today. They have given themselves a chance by investing heavily to correct weaknesses in their line-up - a chance that will not come along regularly.<br /><br />It remains to be seen how good goalkeeper Alisson is but he will be an upgrade. Naby Keita and Fabinho add midfield power, and Xherdan Shaqiri could be a shrewd acquisition backing up the strikers. The heavy spending to correct flaws, building on a good side, fuels the idea that this is a massive opportunity. But it also means that if Liverpool do not go close, they may find themselves back in familiar territory in 12 months’ time, behind those who usually invest more but are rebuilding going into this campaign. It has been all-too-rare for Liverpool to go into the season with any likelihood of challenging, let alone winning the Premier League. That is why so many are talking about them. Whether they have the capacity to catch a formidable City or not - and no matter how much opposition managers speak about Klopp having to start delivering a major trophy - it is better to be part of the conversation than on the outside listening in</p>

Does he have to leave United? I think so. Is he good enough to displace Lukaku? Is Rashford good enough to be Manchester United’s centre-forward for them trying to win the Premier League or the Champions League? He may not be. It gets to the stage where you want to play every week. Will he be an England regular or be Manchester United’s real centre-forward where you know, when the team is picked every week, that he is in it. Will it ever get to that stage? In that position you have got to be world class. Rashford is not world class yet, but he might be at 23 or 24, as Romelu Lukaku has done. He looks like one of the best strikers in the world. Lukaku is in front of Rashford and I don’t see Rashford displacing him as long as he is there. But remember when Lukaku was at Chelsea and he had to come away and go to Everton. Then he ended up as top scorer and got his move to Man Utd<br /><br />Possibly Everton is the sort of club you are looking at, just below the top six, for someone like Rashford, similar to what Lukaku did. You know you are going to play every week as the centre-forward and you know if you have a couple of games where you don’t score then you are still going to play the next week. Last season after they played Brighton away, Mourinho had a little pop at him and Lukaku went straight back into the team. That’s the problem you will always have</p>

Tottenham have had a little bit of a wobble, a good result for them yesterday but it will be really tight and it always is with the top six.<br /><br />I think the top six are so far ahead now that if just one or two of them teams on any given weekend drop points it feels like a really big thing for the rest of the other teams because a lot of the other dropped points come from each other. So far Liverpool winning, City winning, for Tottenham and Arsenal, for Chelsea and United to drop points against two of the lesser sides it’s a really big thing. City showed last year - and whoever is going to win the title this year - that the points total now to win the title - it was 80 or so when I was playing - but it’s 90 plus now</p>

But to be honest I look at him and it’s not just Declan Rice, it’s every young player who comes through at a Premier League club or any club always have to be seen to be grateful they’re playing and they can’t just ask for a bit more money. If there was a young foreign player signed from abroad there’d be no questions about what they deserve. I felt it when I was playing that because I was a local lad at Liverpool I had to be seen to be grateful. Local players coming through at their football clubs are definitely treated differently financially. This is a lad who could be West Ham’s main man over the next five or six years so I think it’s unfair he gets the criticism for not accepting the first offer he’s given.</p>

  <p><b>[Alexis Sanchez at Man Utd is the new Torres at Chelsea]</b> There is broad agreement Alexis Sanchez has not been the same player since he joined Manchester United. Actually, this is slightly inaccurate. Sanchez has not been the same player for longer than that. The more I watch him in a Manchester United shirt, the more convinced I am his poor final year at Arsenal was not due to a declining team or loss of motivation as he prepared to leave. Sanchez’s best years have gone. He is to Manchester United what Fernando Torres was to Chelsea. The warning signs should have been clearer to Manchester United when they pursued Sanchez. The forward they signed had made 667 senior appearances for club and country before his 29th birthday. By any standards, that is a massive number. Copa America, Confederations Cup and World Cup commitments have stopped Sanchez enjoying a summer break throughout his career. The reports coming out of Arsenal during the final months of Sanchez’s spell at the Emirates were uncannily similar to those I recall about Torres at Anfield, his declining contribution attributed to a general malaise at the club as Arsene Wenger’s reign came to an end. No matter what the circumstances, no world-class footballer wants or tries to play badly. There had to be more to it, and Arsenal fans seeing Sanchez toil at United will be the least surprised at how the move is turning out.<br /><br />There were reports that Sanchez is unhappy with his role at United under Mourinho, but the manager is entitled to be unhappy with how his marquee signing is performing. Rather than seeking to blame others, Sanchez should be looking at himself. Sanchez is the elephant in the room for Mourinho and all those United fans seeking to pin all the blame on executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward for the current imbalance in the squad, failing to secure transfer targets. When you hear and read some of the remarks about United’s poor recruitment, you would think Mourinho is the only manager in the world who has missed out on targets. Sanchez’s salary is reportedly the highest of any Premier League footballer and in the same ballpark as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. United thought they were signing a ready-made, world-class attacker who would immediately elevate the quality of their side - a guarantee of goals and assists. Instead, Sanchez is one of the many problems contributing to a difficult period in Manchester United’s history.</p>

Torres started to have a hamstring problem during the 2008-09 season, and also suffered an ankle injury the year we finished runners-up to Manchester United.

It can’t be five times a game, and I think that was where he was losing the ball at Everton. Now he is making better decisions. Also look at the distance covered, I think he’s fitter, stronger and maybe that is something to do with what we are seeing now at Chelsea. He was really good for Everton but towards the end of his time there his decision-making wasn’t great. He dribbled when he should have passed, he passed when he should have dribbled, and the crowd got on his back and he found it difficult at times.

  <p><b>[Jamie Carragher believes that Jurgen Klopp has exceeded expectations at Liverpool]</b> My worry was it was always going to be an unbelievable ride with Klopp but will Liverpool win the big trophies at the end of it? They may not but they’ve been to a Champions League final already. They are top of the league after 16 games and looking like they are going to mount a real title challenge. That’s because of the changes Jurgen Klopp has brought in. That’s the biggest testament to him as a manager<br /><br /><b>[Carragher credits Klopp with making the necessary changes at the club to spark a revival in fortunes]</b> I think Klopp’s pigeonholed as running up and down the line, screaming and shouting and as this motivator but there’s not much thought or tactical stuff going on behind the scenes. I think there’s a myth with every manager because we always pigeonhole managers. But did I think Klopp was capable of making the changes I’ve seen, certainly this season and the back end of last season? No, so he’s actually an even better manager in my eyes for what’s happening this season. Not because Liverpool are top of the league, because they were top at this stage of the season two years ago under Klopp, but actually the way they are going about it. People are saying it’s not exciting but that’s absolute rubbish. What Liverpool are doing now is much, much better than anything we’ve seen under Jurgen Klopp since he arrived</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho’s Manchester United career began to fall apart before the season even began]</b> I think you have to go back to the start of the season, really. I just thought it was inevitable that Jose Mourinho wouldn’t be the manager the following season. There were a lot of problems between him and the board, and then obviously with his big-name players within the squad, which is obviously a massive downturn. It was a relationship there that was for all to see. Taking the captaincy off of Pogba, giving it to him in the first place, it just looked like it was coming to an end from the very start of the season and before a ball was even kicked, really. Then you see the results and performances, it’s nowhere near what Man Utd should expect. The squad of players at his disposal isn’t the greatest in Manchester United’s history but it certainly shouldn’t be so far behind the teams that are challenging for honours this season.<br /><br />There’s no doubt a lot will be made about him wanting a centre-back in the summer. I don’t think a whole regime should fall down because you miss out on one player. I think managers in the past have missed out on players; Pep Guardiola missed out on Alexis Sanchez, and Mourinho got him in January. You have to move on and look at a different option. That’s just top level management, not even top level management, managers up and down the country will say they don’t get everyone they want. But there has been a lot of money spent, I think they have the highest wage bill in the country. So, talking about funds and what United spend is a bit of a red herring. There’s no doubt a new manager coming in will want a centre-back. I think what we’ve seen this season is down to a lot more than them missing out on one centre-back</p>

  <p><b>[Jamie Carragher says he believes Manchester United have a better squad than Liverpool]</b> I said yesterday Manchester United have a better squad than Liverpool. People may have thought it was a strange thing to say but I think we’re seeing little signs of it. On the right back situation, Klopp’s made a mistake letting Clyne go. I know there were a couple of injuries but you don’t need to let him go - keep him there. At the moment James Milner has played there twice now and watching him you can’t quite believe he played left back so well for so long. He looks like someone completely out of position. Keita, who he paid big money for, looked quiet and keeps losing the ball. Firmino doesn’t look himself. Salah we didn’t see anything from tonight. I think that’s a worry going forward, not in terms of this pressure in the lead, more that when there’s a few injuries in different positions it doesn’t look like that solid Liverpool side we’ve seen for the last few weeks.<br /><br />I think there were was a lot of frustration out there tonight. I think there were a lot of poor performances. I couldn’t believe how bad Liverpool were tonight, but I also think there needs to be a bit of perspective that Liverpool are still top of the league. If Liverpool go one or two points behind City and Tottenham, they’re still in the race for the league</p>

  <p><b>[Jamie Carragher believes recent criticism of Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp was unfair]</b> What did they think was going to happen? Liverpool were not going to win 14 straight games to the end of the season. They were going to drop points, things are going to happen, nerves are going to kick in. And that’s for everyone, not just Liverpool. The criticism from outside is harsh on the team and the manager. What they’ve done this season is unbelievable. To actually be up there with City, a team who had 100 points last season and who will be close to that again this time, is remarkable. To talk about nerves and stuff like that is unfair. They’re not going to win every game. But at this moment, Liverpool are the only team in the country that can say ‘if we win every game, we win the league’. There’s still time to go, but it’s not a bad place to be at this stage. And the win against Bournemouth just puts that negativity and the talk of nerves and all that to bed.<br /><br />This team is a lot stronger defensively. Yes, that’s been a bit of a worry of late, where we have looked a little bit more open. But I think injuries have played a part in that, to be honest. Trent <b>[<a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a>]</b> is back now, and we can hopefully get that solidity back. If we get that back, we’ll be fine really. The 2013-14 team didn’t have that. Attacking-wise there is probably not a lot between the two teams, but it didn’t have that base you could rely on. <b>[This team]</b> haven’t had that the last few games, and that shows. If you don’t have that base then you can see players get a little bit nervous in games because you feel like the opposition can score at any time. If you play in a team where you don’t feel you’ll concede, I think the whole team relaxes and thinks that one goal or two goals will be enough<br /><br />I think I should just qualify that a little bit! I think in attacking areas, United have a bit more quality off the bench. The reason I’m using them as an example is that they’re not going for the league, and we are. I think we’ve known for a long time that our front three are imperative to what we do this season. And, touch wood, none of them have picked up a serious knock this season, and I think we’ll need that to continue until the end. That’s not being negative, it’s just a fact. I think 11 v 11, we’re better than United, we’ve proved that this season, and I think we are as good as City. It’s maybe just that little bit of quality in reserve</p>

But a goalless draw is the best draw you can get and without getting the away goal, that will be at the back of Bayern’s mind. I think Liverpool will be confident they can score in Bayern Munich because I feel tonight <b>[Mats]</b> Hummels was outstanding at the back but he defended very deep. At home, Bayern have to win the game and you may expect their defenders will be closer to the halfway line so there will be more space for <b>[Mohamed]</b> Salah, <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane and <b>[Roberto]</b> Firmino.

And I think with 15-20 minutes to go, yes you want to win the game, but you also have to think don’t lose the game. Bayern Munich put in a performance tonight like a really experienced, top-class Champions League team - and that’s what they are.

But we’re almost in March and Liverpool haven’t made one of those statements yet in the new year. And between now and the end of the season they’re probably going to have to make four or five of them, and there’s probably no better place in Liverpool supporters’, players’ eyes than doing that at Old Trafford. So if you could go and win it would be a massive three points for the table obviously but also for Man City who are just about to kick off in the Carabao Cup final because that is a game they’ll be looking at and thinking: ‘Liverpool will drop more points</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool will make a move to land a ball-playing midfielder of the Philippe Coutinho mould]</b> They lost Coutinho last January and they never replaced him. They tried to replace him with someone from Lyon <b>[Nabil Fekir]</b> in the summer but they couldn’t get him, there weren’t three or four different options. So it’s not just a case of right now, in the summer, even if Liverpool win the league, it is still a position I think they will try and fill because it’s not just a case of one player going in there and being the best player. They don’t even really have that type of player off the bench. But when you’re talking about that being a problem, I don’t think there should be massive panic for Liverpool because they don’t look like conceding a goal - that’s back<br /><br />The thing I go back to - we know about the midfield. I do look at the changes from the bench, I don’t think they were great last week at Old Trafford <b>[against Manchester United]</b>, the first substitution when Daniel Sturridge came on. Then <b>[against Everton]</b> I was looking at the substitutions and thinking ‘bring Roberto Firmino on, try and get someone behind Everton’s midfield’ and he stayed with the three in midfield. If you’re bringing Firmino on, play him as a No. 10 and play two central midfield players so instead of having three midfield players that Everton’s midfielders can see in front of them, put one in behind them. Even when Adam Lallana came on, he didn’t come on as one of the midfield three, he came on as one of the front three. Now maybe Klopp thinks at that stage that it isn’t a bad point. Liverpool have only lost one game this season, I played in a season when we only lost two games and never won the league. It doesn’t matter how many games you lose, it’s points that you drop and these points at the moment are proving vital. You just look and think ‘could they have been more proactive in the substitutions that they make?’ We’ll only know that at the end of the season</p>

I know Manchester United fans are desperate for Liverpool not to win the league, but City have got a great chance to win the quadruple and that would topple Manchester United’s treble from ‘99. So it’s a big dilemma I think for United. What would you rather happen - Liverpool win the league, or City win the quadruple? I think a lot of them may start changing their opinions and try to get a decent result against City.<br /><br />I think the pressure has come off Liverpool slightly because I think everyone expects City to win the league now. It may not be the worst thing in the world if City go in front. If you’re up there, you’re there to be shot at. There were lots of questions being thrown at Liverpool and they weren’t really answering them. For two or three weeks they had a lot of draws in games.

It is who they sell. There would be one name on the top of my list. Paul Pogba. If Real Madrid have £100 million and Zinedine Zidane wants him, United can solve the first of many problems as their long reconstruction gets underway.<br /><br />I have heard Pogba described as world class. Being a World Cup winner does not automatically make you that. There is a difference between a world-class talent and a world-class player. He played his best football as a left midfielder in Turin without justifying what United paid to re-sign him, and he was a key member of France’s World Cup-winning side by enforcing a disciplined, tactical role rather than a spectacular or thrilling one. Even during those more encouraging moments he has shown nothing to suggest you can build a team around him. Juventus didn’t. France didn’t<br /><br />United have a choice. Pogba has two years left on his current deal - with the club having an option for a third. If they do not sell Pogba they will have to offer him a new contract over the next year or two. What will he demand? Around £400,000 a week? Is he worth it? There has been enough damage done to United on the field since <b>[Sir Alex]</b> Ferguson’s retirement.

  <p><b>[How Liverpool can prevent Messi wreaking havoc]</b> I remember Rafa Benitez pulling Arbeloa while we were having a pre-match walk. He told him he was playing left-back, which was a bit of a surprise. Rafa had a reputation of being very considered and of planning weeks in advance, but he was capable of springing a surprise on the day of games too. Messi wasn’t the main man back then - it was Ronaldinho’s team really - but we all knew about this kid coming through who was going to become a superstar. Obviously we knew he played on the right and cut inside, so Rafa’s idea was to have Arbeloa on his stronger side dealing with that. Every time Messi cut in, it would be onto the defender’s strong foot.<br /><br />One thing that never changes in football is that if you’re not compact, you can’t defend effectively. You have to close the gaps and the space. The genius of Messi, of course, means that even the best-laid plans can go out the window. What makes him special, the best in my view, is that he can hurt you without space. He only needs half a yard and he can beat two or three and open the game up. In tight areas, there is nobody better<br /><br /><b>[Would he, then, consider a man-marking job on Barcelona’s star man?]</b> I don’t think Jurgen Klopp would ever do that. But he will certainly want to try and stop <b>[Sergio]</b> Busquets from getting on the ball. Whether <b>[Roberto]</b> Firmino plays or not, he’ll want someone in and around Busquets trying to disrupt him and stopping him building the game. If you can do that, you have won a big part of the battle<br /><br />A big thing for me will be who plays on the left of the midfield three for Liverpool. Keita has played there of late and he’s done very well; he’s improving week by week. But for a game like this, against opponents like this, I think Klopp will be tempted to go back to what he knows best, and that means maybe Wijnaldum there or Milner</p>

You love him when he is in your team and you hate him when he plays for the opposition. It was the first time he was in the opposition and I don’t think Liverpool fans will have liked him. He plays on the edge, very street-wise. A great first goal for him but I don’t think it will be the hero homecoming he will be hoping for</p>

He plays as if he’s 29 and at his peak already. You can only imagine how good he will be when he actually is 29.<br /><br />Virgil is a player who has experience in the top leagues. Of course, you would want to learn from him. It’s very helpful playing alongside him in the Dutch team. It could happen (a move to Anfield).

Mane himself has said that tiredness is only mental and that he has never had a holiday that lasts longer than 20 days since joining Red Bull Salzburg in 2012.

But I still think City are favourites and are the best team in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at this moment because they won <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and they proved that last season. So, I think it’s still on <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to overtake City but they’re more than capable</p>

Since knocking out <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> in last year’s Champions League - the match which sealed <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>’s position - United are averaging less than a goal a game, scoring 18 in their last 20 fixtures. They have not won away in seven games. Let’s be honest. There is an understandable reluctance from United supporters, ex-players or anyone with a love or affiliation to the club to admit the coach is not performing at the required level for a club of such stature.<br /><br /><a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> is not liked by United fans.

If they do, that’s fine. But what they don’t want to do is, next season, in September or October, if they make a bad start, then think: ‘What do we do?’ If you think you would get rid of a manager if they started next season badly, change it before. No problem this season, but, maybe, when the summer comes, would you go with Ole again?

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> defender Jamie Carragher on <a href="son-heungmin.html">Son Heung-min</a>’s red card]</b> If you give a red card for that, every challenge is endangering the safety of an opponent.

He actually gets injured in between the two challenges in some ways, and the Son challenge does force him to fall as his leg, unfortunately, gets stuck underneath him just before <a href="serge-aurier.html">Aurier</a> comes in.

  <p><b>[Carragher: I can’t argue for VAR anymore]</b> I am now looking at it and thinking that I can’t argue for it anymore. I am probably seen as someone who is pro-VAR in terms of how I have spoken about this at the start of the season and in terms of how I have reacted to things on social media. I was never pro-VAR. What it was is that I felt it should have been given a chance and in some ways, I felt I was fighting for VAR because so many people were negative about it from the start<br /><br />VAR has been brought in to help our game. And when I say our game, it’s not just the players, it is the supporters, the pundits, the owners. We have the best game in the world so how can we make it better? How can it move with the times? That’s why I was supporting it. Never stand still. Other sports are doing it. I am actually tired of listening to people complaining about it and I have got nothing to come back at them with because the whole point of VAR was to help referees. We spend so often in this job talking about decisions by referees. We are now spending probably double or triple that time talking about decisions so it hasn’t done what it was brought in to do.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> captain <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Cesar Azpilicueta</a> outlined his frustrations with VAR following a controversial penalty call in his side’s game on Saturday, saying he thinks the on-field referee has to make the final call]</b> The thing about the picture on the side of the pitch, I didn’t want referees to look at that. I wanted someone to look at that cold in Stockley Park or wherever it may be. The referee is running over there having made the decision, the crowd is screaming and shouting, he’s hot and bothered and he’s got two sets of benches in his ear. So I am not sure it’s this thing that will cure everything if the referee goes over there</p>

Within <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, eyebrows are raised when stories emerge about fears of another attack on City’s bus as happened in the Champions League quarter-final in 2018, and there was incredulity at <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>’s comments about <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>’s diving.

Certainly going from that first season to what he is doing now, there has been a bit of a dip. But he was never going to score another 47 goals in a season.<br /><br />Speaking to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans and looking at social media, I think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have got six world-class players. I think they have the goalkeeper, <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a>, <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a>, <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> and <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>. I think if you asked <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans whether they would take big money for the other five, they would all say no, no matter what the money. There is no way they would sell Alisson or <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a>. But if you offered them £130m for <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>, they would think about it. That is why I say he is underappreciated<br /><br /><a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> is going to lose the ball but he is also going to score goals. <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> gets a lot of assists too. Only <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> has more goals and assists than <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> in Europe’s top five leagues since he joined <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>.<br /><br />The big thing I like about him is that he is never injured. You see <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> play and he is there week in and week out. Ninety-seven appearances out of 102 (now 98 out of 103). If you look at minutes per goal, there might be others. But if I am a manager I want someone who is playing week in and week out, never misses a game and delivers.<br /><br />There is talk of <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> being the dream for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Maybe that’s not realistic. There is also talk of <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a>. That probably is realistic for every top team in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> is world-class, maybe the man to overtake <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> is on the verge of being world-class. But I think it would be so difficult for them, in their first two-and-a-half years at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, to get those numbers. That is why <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> need to be careful. Look at the numbers. Only <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> in European football is above this man.<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> need an attacking player to come in because <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> is maybe going to go to the Olympics and then the African Nations Cup, Mane the same, and bringing <a href="divock-origi.html">Divock Origi</a> on in Madrid is not enough for the European champions. But no way in the world should they be even thinking about looking at moving this player on</p>

  <p><b>[Carragher feels <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> needs multiple honours]</b> I think there’s a bit of a worry - not for the league, the league’s won - it’s actually is the league enough for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> this season? The league feels like it’s been won for two or three months. I know <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> wouldn’t say that but it almost feels when you’ve had a season like that it doesn’t feel enough, you still want one of the cups, whether that be <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup or the Champions League. The worry is now <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> midweek and the following midweek is <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>. If <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> go out of both cup competitions there’s no way it will be a damp squib, because they’ve waited so long to win the title, but there will be a little tinge of how good this team is, the results they’ve had, they probably should win more this season<br /><br />The worry is after the break they’ve had, they’re not quite firing on all cylinders, and these cup competitions come when they’re not quite at 100 per cent. It wasn’t losing, it was the manner of the defeat. It was really poor. And for the team at the top of the league to lose to the second bottom doesn’t normally occur too often. People keep talking about <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> defensively and they were really poor but they never looked like scoring a goal in the game. And that was so surprising. So there’s problems at both ends. But <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> thoroughly deserved the result and were well worth 3-0 as well. The performance will worry <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> more than the result. It was bound to happen at some stage. There’s a lot of rejoicing from a Mr Neville, popping champagne and getting too carried away as you’d expect, but <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans are delighted as well because it saves the Invincibles record. But the title has been won for a couple of months and it’s just when <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were going to win it. There was a lot of hope from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans that it would be at Goodison Park in a couple of weeks but the result on Saturday puts that to bed now and it may have to wait until the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> game</p>

  <p><b>[Carragher advises <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> on tactic to defeat <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a>’s Atletico]</b> You’ve got to move the ball fast in a game like this. When you get the opportunity to really attack Atletico you’ve got to go for it and that means taking risks. You might lose the ball more than normal in trying to force it but it’s about reacting to situations and not allowing them to get organised with 11 men behind the ball. Atletico won’t commit many players forward but on the rare occasions they do have two or three caught upfield, you need to turn defence into attack quickly. As soon as the goalkeeper catches it, he needs to be looking to get <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> flying at them</p>

  <p><b>[Carragher wants season finished at all levels]</b> Nothing is more important than health and beating the coronavirus, but I don’t think we should hide away from how much football means to us and how important it is in people’s lives - not just <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> supporters but everyone right up and down the country. It doesn’t bother me when football starts again. I just feel that so much has been put into this season by so many people, I don’t know how you can stop it. We all know <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were, or are, going to go on and win the league. They only need to win one or two games. But if the league stops, it just doesn’t feel right. Yes, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> may be given the league, that’s what people are saying. But there will always be something there that just didn’t feel quite right about it. But that’s not going to affect <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> economically, or what division they are in.

That’s why I say <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> isn’t the most important thing. It’s the teams who are going to lose huge sums of money in completely different divisions. So this season has to finish because it impacts next season, because of European places and Champions League places and so on. Whenever the date is that we get back to playing football, it needs to be finished. Then we have to be creative with next season</p>

It’s been a contrast in styles but I’m certain if I was a manager, I’d be more <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> than <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> because of the upbringing I had and how I saw football. I couldn’t go on to a training pitch and try to coach Barcelona-type football. I wasn’t brought up on that as a kid. Certainly at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> we tried to play good football, but it was about using your brain and not taking chances. Football was always more about the result than the performance. I was always about the result above all as a player. But the game has evolved, and it’s become a lot more expansive. Nowadays, for managers and supporters, you have to get the result and the performance to keep so many people happy<br /><br />People always ask players, ‘are you going to become a manager?’ Some people can’t be bothered, and they get to the end of their career before they think about what they’re going to do next. I was the opposite. If you’d asked me in my 20s, whether with England or with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, I’d have said I’d have been a manager. Former coaches were certain I would. But as I got closer to finishing my career, I started looking more at the pitfalls of management, and the other options I had. Now, part of me thinks it was for the best I stayed away. Ten or 15 years ago, my first thought when it came to entering management was probably ‘hassle’. I used to look at it and think, ‘is it worth everything that you go through?’ I don’t really like people acting to me or being like that myself. I’m very straight with people, but I feel managers must be like that, telling players sometimes what they want to hear rather than the truth. I’m just not sure I’d have been cut out for that<br /><br />Would I say the fear of failure put me off going into management? No, but it’s definitely something you look at. I had a good career, not a great one - there are certainly hundreds who had better careers than I had. But your football career is there and always will be. I do sometimes think the ridicule of managers is disgusting and is a disgrace. The way people talk about them as if they haven’t got a clue. It almost feels like unless you become <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>, <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> or <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, you’re a failure. There are managers in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> who’ve not won anything but they’ve had three or four <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> jobs. If you’ve managed three or four <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> teams, then I think you’ve had a very good managerial career. So many managers are disrespected over what they’ve not won, but sometimes I feel the circumstances are forgotten and dismissed</p>

I don’t agree with that. I think the money should in some ways go back there. You’ve got to think, how do players get paid? There are three ways players get paid - it would be through the TV money, the money through the turnstile, and probably advertising money. All of those revenue streams have stopped coming into football clubs. The wages players are getting now, some of them are getting £200-300,000 a week. Good luck to them, they deserve everything they get. But I don’t believe that football clubs and football owners actually make hundreds of millions each season. We see that in their accounts. A lot of them break even, a lot of them lose money every year. There’s only <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in the last year or two, because they got the Champions League final.

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> player Jamie Carragher has said that the Reds’ offensive weakness without <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> is worrying]</b> The front three are as good as anyone in Europe but whenever one of them is out, there is a massive drop off. When <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> dropped points at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> wasn’t playing. That’s why <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> need to strengthen the front three. <a href="divock-origi.html">Divock Origi</a> is a legend for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as he’s scored big goals at big moments but doesn’t have quite the quality. Is <a href="takumi-minamino.html">Takumi Minamino</a> part of the front three? Not for me. The front three are very robust and don’t miss many games but if <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were to lose one of them, especially the two wide players, for a lengthy amount of time they could have a real problem next season</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has guided <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to an historic <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title triumph, but Jamie Carragher admits to having doubted whether the German could deliver a long-awaited crown at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>]</b> It was shortly after my last meaningful title bid in 2009 that I started to lose my faith. The 2010 season was awful. <a href="xabi-alonso.html">Xabi Alonso</a> had been sold to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafa Benitez</a>’s team was unravelling, and the club was braced for another period of reconstruction. Reluctantly, I faced up to the disheartening conclusion a championship victory parade would never happen. Throughout the 2000s we headed into every pre-season adamant a couple more signings might be the difference. On a few occasions they nearly were. But even when looking back upon my career, the times we came closest - in 2002 under <a href="gerard-houllier.html">Gerard Houllier</a> and 2009 under <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> - <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> were stronger<br /><br />Once outside the Kop bubble, the more I studied the broader landscape in English football, the more I realised the best <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> sides I played in punched above our weight. No matter who the manager, and as much as I considered Fenway Sports Group good owners, I could not see how it was possible to change that without a Roman Abramovich or Sheikh Mansour-style investment. That feeling grew after <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> lured <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> to England. I saw <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> v <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> as the next great <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> battle, with <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> in a fight with <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> and <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> to finish in the top four. I am ecstatic to be wrong. As a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> title winner, <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> now stands tall in the ultimate VIP suite alongside <a href="kenny-dalglish.html">Kenny Dalglish</a>, Joe Fagan, <b>[Bob]</b> Paisley and <b>[Bill]</b> Shankly</p>
