  <p><b>[Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher has revealed he would love to see Philippe Coutinho rejoin the ranks at Anfield]</b> I still think they could add a creative player. I said it before, I’d love to see Liverpool bring back Coutinho if that was possible in any way. Obviously, it hasn’t worked out for him at Barcelona. I just think he would be a great addition. You’ve got Adam Lallana and Xherdan Shaqiri in those positions, but they’re not Coutinho. He would give something that they don’t have compared to Manchester City.<br /><br /><b>[Carragher acknowledges that catching City is going to be a hard task for his former team]</b> I mean, only losing one league game was a phenomenal achievement. Ninety-seven points was a phenomenal achievement. So, in some ways, if Liverpool got 90 points, I don’t think they’ve gone backwards, because it’s so difficult to do again. But they’ve got to hope that City come back as well, a little bit<br /><br /><b>[The native Liverpudlian thinks the team is in their best position for three decades]</b> Now, everyone has so much confidence in the club.

Right now, it just feels like Liverpool, if they need to spend big, they can. They’ve got one of the top managers around, a great squad, the stadium now, the stand.

  <p><b>[Liverpool have been urged to make the most of Jurgen Klopp’s presence over the next three years, with Jamie Carragher not expecting the German to commit to another contract]</b> This group of players have got to be looking at this next three or four years because Klopp’s got three years left on his contract. I’m not sure if he would sign another one. He’s only ever stayed at a club for seven years. I think over the next two or three years Liverpool have got to be looking to try to pick up as many trophies as possible. You want the league, that’s the obvious one. They’ve got competitions this year, the World Club Cup, the Super Cup, just pick as much as you can before he goes. And hopefully, over the next two or three years, one of those will be the league for Klopp<br /><br /><b>[He added on a side set to face Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham across the opening three months of the new season]</b> Liverpool could easily lose two games in their first 10, and that wouldn’t be the worst form in the world. You know, they could win seven, draw one, lost two. And normally you’d say, ‘that’s an alright, decent start that’. But because you only lost one last season, if that does happen it’s how you cope with that psychologically. But this team has been called, ‘mentality monsters’ by Jurgen Klopp, so I’m sure whatever is thrown at them in the early stages, I think they’ll be able to deal with, the managers, the players, they’ve proven that. It will be very interesting this season, I think it’ll be very difficult to replicate what they did because it was so good last season</p>

  <p><b>[Jamie Carragher considers Liverpool to have arrogance in a nice way]</b> I think that’s how the players will feel. But also, remember they are on the back of their Champions League win. I can only use my own experience on what that does to you as a player, it gives you a bit of arrogance in a nice way - football arrogance I’d say. They should believe <b>[they can win]</b>. When we won in 2005, I never believed I was good enough to play at that level or to win that competition. But once you’ve done it, you think ‘well I am now’. Before, the current players were probably watching Barcelona, Real Madrid and all these teams and maybe they thought ‘am I as good as them?’ But now they’ve done it, it should give them that little bit extra this season<br /><br /><b>[Klopp’s side having come close to toppling Pep Guardiola’s side in the Community Shield before suffering a penalty shootout defeat]</b> I think they will be well aware that they will have to go near to perfection this season. The second half in the Community Shield sort of gave everyone lift. The pre-season didn’t go great for Liverpool. But that’s no big deal. The way they should have won the game against Manchester City has given them a bit of added belief. In terms of that they can run them close again. Beforehand, I think people thought they got so close but will they get that close again? If Liverpool got 90 points the season, it’s still an amazing total. It’s just that you’re coming up against one of the greatest sides - and I think we will be saying when Pep Guardiola leaves that it’s the best of all time</p>

  <p><b>[Jamie Carragher says Chelsea’s style of play and set-up under Frank Lampard has been compared to basketball]</b> It’s like watching a basketball game. The idea of Frank is spot on, it’s the way top sides, top managers want to play. People talk about them being naive and getting caught on the counter-attack, they’ve got no organisation in possession<br /><br />Frank wants his full-backs to go forward. Cesar Azpilicueta (should be) experienced to know he doesn’t need to go every time. They keep getting counterattacked every time, leaving spaces, because they’re not organised in attack. I don’t think they have to take it to the letter of the law, exactly what the manager says. Use your brain, drop in. Experienced players like Jorginho go flying out, doesn’t make the challenge and then there’s massive holes in the middle of the pitch. It’s too easy to get out (for Leicester), which is why it’s like a basketball game. They probably should have lost the game really. Willian, who I absolutely love, if Frank could have had another substitute he would have taken him off, he was that bad. They can’t sustain an attack, keep the ball and they’re so open</p>

That was really noticeable to me in how he reacted to the arrival of <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> in 2017, when he had already been at the club for a year. Salah was suddenly the most exciting forward in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, scoring 44 goals in his first season, but there was never even the slightest sense that Mane was put out. He even moved position to accommodate Salah and allow him to be the main goal threat. With <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> also becoming so fundamental to Klopp’s system of pressing from the front, I feel like Mane’s contribution is not as widely appreciated as it should be. Which brings me to the concern that I now have. Mane has become so important that <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is understandably reluctant to leave him out and let him have a proper rest<br /><br />He has played in 53 club games since the start of the 2018-19 season. Of all the forwards throughout the entire <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>, only Salah has played more than his 4,515 minutes. Liverpool’s season did not finish until June and he was then away with Senegal in the African Cup of Nations, playing seven matches. The last was the final on July 19 against Algeria and yet he was still involved in the first match of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> season three weeks later against <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich City</a>. It was similar the summer before when he played in the World Cup and was then away with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in America in the International Champions Cup.<br /><br />In an ideal world, Mane would have been rested this season until after the first international break and not started under September. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> said after Saturday’s win against Southampton that no footballer should play more than 50 matches a season, especially in what he called the ‘intense positions’, and he has the resources in midfield to address this concern. His use of Mane, however, unfortunately already suggests that Liverpool’s squad is not strong enough in the attacking positions. Mane himself has said that tiredness is only mental and that he has never had a holiday that lasts longer than 20 days since joining Red Bull Salzburg in 2012. I truly hope he is right but you cannot keep defying your body and my big worry is that there will be a drop off without a carefully scheduled rest. How <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> absorb either scenario could very well decide whether another <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> challenge can be sustained</p>

Since knocking out <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> in last year’s Champions League - the match which sealed <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>’s position - United are averaging less than a goal a game, scoring 18 in their last 20 fixtures.

I am probably seen as someone who is pro-VAR in terms of how I have spoken about this at the start of the season and in terms of how I have reacted to things on social media. I was never pro-VAR. What it was is that I felt it should have been given a chance and in some ways, I felt I was fighting for VAR because so many people were negative about it from the start<br /><br />VAR has been brought in to help our game. And when I say our game, it’s not just the players, it is the supporters, the pundits, the owners. We have the best game in the world so how can we make it better? How can it move with the times? That’s why I was supporting it. Never stand still. Other sports are doing it. I am actually tired of listening to people complaining about it and I have got nothing to come back at them with because the whole point of VAR was to help referees. We spend so often in this job talking about decisions by referees. We are now spending probably double or triple that time talking about decisions so it hasn’t done what it was brought in to do.<br /><br /><b>[Chelsea captain <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Cesar Azpilicueta</a> outlined his frustrations with VAR following a controversial penalty call in his side’s game on Saturday, saying he thinks the on-field referee has to make the final call]</b> The thing about the picture on the side of the pitch, I didn’t want referees to look at that. I wanted someone to look at that cold in Stockley Park or wherever it may be. The referee is running over there having made the decision, the crowd is screaming and shouting, he’s hot and bothered and he’s got two sets of benches in his ear.

Within <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, eyebrows are raised when stories emerge about fears of another attack on City’s bus as happened in the Champions League quarter-final in 2018, and there was incredulity at <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>’s comments about <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>’s diving.

If you look at Tuesday night, the big problem for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is when one of those front three are not playing. <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> had to come off and the player they bring on in is <a href="divock-origi.html">Divock Origi</a>, who is a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> legend because of what happened last year at the <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Wanda Metropolitano</a>, but it’s not quite good enough for the best team in the world to be bringing that quality on. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> do need a top attacking player to come in the summer. <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> or Werner? I’ll take both<br /><br />They don’t need to let anyone go, they just need to add to the squad that they’ve got.

Also, you have to think of injuries and the Africa Cup of Nations next season with Salah and Mane going away, it’s almost certain <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will buy a top attacking player.

  <p><b>[Jamie Carragher claims <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> would think about £130m <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> sale]</b> I think <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a> is seen as world-class by those on the outside but with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans, I think he is a little bit underappreciated. Certainly going from that first season to what he is doing now, there has been a bit of a dip. But he was never going to score another 47 goals in a season.<br /><br />Speaking to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans and looking at social media, I think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have got six world-class players. I think they have the goalkeeper, <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a>, <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a>, <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> and Salah. I think if you asked <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans whether they would take big money for the other five, they would all say no, no matter what the money. There is no way they would sell Alisson or Van Dijk. But if you offered them £130m for Salah, they would think about it. That is why I say he is underappreciated<br /><br />Salah is going to lose the ball but he is also going to score goals. Salah gets a lot of assists too. Only <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> has more goals and assists than Salah in Europe’s top five leagues since he joined <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>.<br /><br />The big thing I like about him is that he is never injured. You see <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> play and he is there week in and week out. Ninety-seven appearances out of 102 (now 98 out of 103). If you look at minutes per goal, there might be others. But if I am a manager I want someone who is playing week in and week out, never misses a game and delivers.<br /><br />There is talk of <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> being the dream for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Maybe that’s not realistic. There is also talk of <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a>. That probably is realistic for every top team in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> is world-class, maybe the man to overtake <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> is on the verge of being world-class. But I think it would be so difficult for them, in their first two-and-a-half years at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, to get those numbers. That is why <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> need to be careful. Look at the numbers. Only <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> in European football is above this man.<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> need an attacking player to come in because Salah is maybe going to go to the Olympics and then the African Nations Cup, Mane the same, and bringing <a href="divock-origi.html">Divock Origi</a> on in Madrid is not enough for the European champions. But no way in the world should they be even thinking about looking at moving this player on</p>

  <p><b>[Carragher feels <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> needs multiple honours]</b> I think there’s a bit of a worry - not for the league, the league’s won - it’s actually is the league enough for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> this season? The league feels like it’s been won for two or three months. I know <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> wouldn’t say that but it almost feels when you’ve had a season like that it doesn’t feel enough, you still want one of the cups, whether that be <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup or the Champions League. The worry is now <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> midweek and the following midweek is <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>. If <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> go out of both cup competitions there’s no way it will be a damp squib, because they’ve waited so long to win the title, but there will be a little tinge of how good this team is, the results they’ve had, they probably should win more this season<br /><br />The worry is after the break they’ve had, they’re not quite firing on all cylinders, and these cup competitions come when they’re not quite at 100 per cent. It wasn’t losing, it was the manner of the defeat. It was really poor. And for the team at the top of the league to lose to the second bottom doesn’t normally occur too often. People keep talking about <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> defensively and they were really poor but they never looked like scoring a goal in the game. And that was so surprising. So there’s problems at both ends. But <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> thoroughly deserved the result and were well worth 3-0 as well. The performance will worry <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> more than the result. It was bound to happen at some stage. There’s a lot of rejoicing from a Mr Neville, popping champagne and getting too carried away as you’d expect, but <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans are delighted as well because it saves the Invincibles record. But the title has been won for a couple of months and it’s just when <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were going to win it. There was a lot of hope from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans that it would be at Goodison Park in a couple of weeks but the result on Saturday puts that to bed now and it may have to wait until the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> game</p>

  <p><b>[Carragher advises <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> on tactic to defeat <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a>’s Atletico]</b> You’ve got to move the ball fast in a game like this. When you get the opportunity to really attack Atletico you’ve got to go for it and that means taking risks. You might lose the ball more than normal in trying to force it but it’s about reacting to situations and not allowing them to get organised with 11 men behind the ball. Atletico won’t commit many players forward but on the rare occasions they do have two or three caught upfield, you need to turn defence into attack quickly. As soon as the goalkeeper catches it, he needs to be looking to get <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> flying at them</p>

  <p><b>[Carragher wants season finished at all levels]</b> Nothing is more important than health and beating the coronavirus, but I don’t think we should hide away from how much football means to us and how important it is in people’s lives - not just <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> supporters but everyone right up and down the country. It doesn’t bother me when football starts again. I just feel that so much has been put into this season by so many people, I don’t know how you can stop it. We all know <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were, or are, going to go on and win the league. They only need to win one or two games. But if the league stops, it just doesn’t feel right.

But that’s not going to affect <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> economically, or what division they are in.

It’s been a contrast in styles but I’m certain if I was a manager, I’d be more <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> than <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> because of the upbringing I had and how I saw football. I couldn’t go on to a training pitch and try to coach Barcelona-type football. I wasn’t brought up on that as a kid. Certainly at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> we tried to play good football, but it was about using your brain and not taking chances. Football was always more about the result than the performance. I was always about the result above all as a player. But the game has evolved, and it’s become a lot more expansive. Nowadays, for managers and supporters, you have to get the result and the performance to keep so many people happy<br /><br />People always ask players, ‘are you going to become a manager?’ Some people can’t be bothered, and they get to the end of their career before they think about what they’re going to do next. I was the opposite. If you’d asked me in my 20s, whether with England or with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, I’d have said I’d have been a manager. Former coaches were certain I would. But as I got closer to finishing my career, I started looking more at the pitfalls of management, and the other options I had. Now, part of me thinks it was for the best I stayed away. Ten or 15 years ago, my first thought when it came to entering management was probably ‘hassle’. I used to look at it and think, ‘is it worth everything that you go through?’ I don’t really like people acting to me or being like that myself. I’m very straight with people, but I feel managers must be like that, telling players sometimes what they want to hear rather than the truth. I’m just not sure I’d have been cut out for that<br /><br />Would I say the fear of failure put me off going into management? No, but it’s definitely something you look at. I had a good career, not a great one - there are certainly hundreds who had better careers than I had. But your football career is there and always will be. I do sometimes think the ridicule of managers is disgusting and is a disgrace. The way people talk about them as if they haven’t got a clue. It almost feels like unless you become <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>, <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> or <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, you’re a failure.

If you’ve managed three or four <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> teams, then I think you’ve had a very good managerial career.

I don’t agree with that. I think the money should in some ways go back there. You’ve got to think, how do players get paid? There are three ways players get paid - it would be through the TV money, the money through the turnstile, and probably advertising money. All of those revenue streams have stopped coming into football clubs. The wages players are getting now, some of them are getting £200-300,000 a week. Good luck to them, they deserve everything they get. But I don’t believe that football clubs and football owners actually make hundreds of millions each season. We see that in their accounts. A lot of them break even, a lot of them lose money every year. There’s only <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in the last year or two, because they got the Champions League final.

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> player Jamie Carragher has said that the Reds’ offensive weakness without <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> is worrying]</b> The front three are as good as anyone in Europe but whenever one of them is out, there is a massive drop off. When <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> dropped points at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, Salah wasn’t playing. That’s why <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> need to strengthen the front three. <a href="divock-origi.html">Divock Origi</a> is a legend for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as he’s scored big goals at big moments but doesn’t have quite the quality. Is <a href="takumi-minamino.html">Takumi Minamino</a> part of the front three? Not for me. The front three are very robust and don’t miss many games but if <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were to lose one of them, especially the two wide players, for a lengthy amount of time they could have a real problem next season</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has guided <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to an historic <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title triumph, but Jamie Carragher admits to having doubted whether the German could deliver a long-awaited crown at Anfield]</b> It was shortly after my last meaningful title bid in 2009 that I started to lose my faith. The 2010 season was awful. <a href="xabi-alonso.html">Xabi Alonso</a> had been sold to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafa Benitez</a>’s team was unravelling, and the club was braced for another period of reconstruction. Reluctantly, I faced up to the disheartening conclusion a championship victory parade would never happen. Throughout the 2000s we headed into every pre-season adamant a couple more signings might be the difference. On a few occasions they nearly were. But even when looking back upon my career, the times we came closest - in 2002 under <a href="gerard-houllier.html">Gerard Houllier</a> and 2009 under <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> - <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> were stronger <br /><br />Once outside the Kop bubble, the more I studied the broader landscape in English football, the more I realised the best <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> sides I played in punched above our weight. No matter who the manager, and as much as I considered Fenway Sports Group good owners, I could not see how it was possible to change that without a Roman Abramovich or Sheikh Mansour-style investment. That feeling grew after <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> lured <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> to England. I saw <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> v <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> as the next great <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> battle, with <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> in a fight with <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> and <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> to finish in the top four. I am ecstatic to be wrong. As a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> title winner, <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> now stands tall in the ultimate VIP suite alongside <a href="kenny-dalglish.html">Kenny Dalglish</a>, Joe Fagan, <b>[Bob]</b> Paisley and <b>[Bill]</b> Shankly</p>
