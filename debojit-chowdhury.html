<blockquote>
  <p><b>[You could never imagine seeing <a href="hernan-crespo.html">Hernan Crespo</a> playing in the I-League]</b> Barasat is a part of Greater Kolkata and we feel we can market our team more there than in Kolkata, moreover we also have a brilliant stadium, and then of course we can draw fans away from the Kolkata franchisee too. Barasat forms the supply line of the football players from East Bengal and we are hoping to tap that<br /><br />Competition is always good<br /><br />I feel Bengal players are being neglected and hence I wish that my team will have a clutch of players from Bengal itself to compliment the foreign recruits<br /><br />You could never imagine a <a href="hernan-crespo.html">Crespo</a> playing for East Bengal in the I-League but we have signed him, and in the coming seasons. I am hopeful that we will be able to attract even bigger stars as the league grows in profile and stature<br /><br />When passion becomes profitable, is there anything better? And I am sure we will be able to profit from this enterprise if not today, but in the long run certainly<br /><br />We are in advanced talks with Bhaichung Bhutia. Not only will he play for us but he will also be our brand ambassador. We are also in talks with Dipendu Biswas to come play for us. Moreover, Bhutia has promised to bring in some players from his team that currently plays in the second division of the I-League</p>
