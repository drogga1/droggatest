  <p><b>[New <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> Arrival Cristiano Zanetti says <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> Didn’t Want Me Anymore]</b> Do not say absurd things, the story should be explained fully. I took note of Juventus’ behaviour towards me and looked around. They never had any intention of renewing my contract. This is a matter of respect. I have heard a couple of things from Secco to which I must respond. I have never asked for guarantees of any kind in my life. In the end, the work I put in was always my warranty. I never asked for anything, because he did not ever consider my possible <b>[contract]</b> renewal. <b>[I asked for]</b> Three years? We had never spoken. I am happy, very happy, to be at <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a>. To <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> I could not have said no, they know how to treat people. That’s enough for me.</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Zanetti says he Returned To <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> To Win]</b> I am here to reach the Champions League, because it is essential for us. Tuesday will be a crucial test against Sporting. How have I found <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a>? It is an excellent team. I know many of my new team-mates already. In all the teams I played on, I have always won something. The goal of everyone is to do well in the championship and it is also mine. My physical condition? I’m good. My relationship with <b>[Riccardo]</b> Montolivo is progressing, I can work well with everyone and Riccardo is an excellent player. The coach will decide the team ahead of the match</p>

  <p><b>[Fiorentina Midfielder Cristiano Zanetti says he Don’t Deserve An Italy Place]</b> I am neither better or worse than anybody, I have not come to replace any specific player. The national team? There are those that deserve it more than I do. For me that is the past, now I only think about Fiorentina</p>
