<blockquote>
  <p>[Sergio Busquets reached 500 matches in a Barcelona shirt in Saturday’s visit to Atletico Madrid] His greatest virtue is that he was always very intelligent. He is a player who understands the game wonderfully and applies his technique to perfection. Every time he left his position it was for a reason - he knew what to do at all times. He was more than a number six. It’s unusual to find people like that in football, someone who helps the whole team and provides balance. And, of course, he has only improved over the years with experience.<br /><br />I had full confidence in [Pep] and [he and Busquets] got to know each other very well. I have no doubt that he saw unique qualities to bet on him as blindly as he did<br /><br />His father, Carlos, is very much responsible for Sergio’s success. He inherited his character from his father and he always knew what he had to do and knew how to earn Pep’s complete confidence<br /><br />[on September 13, 2008, Busquets would make his full first-team debut] He was given an opportunity after a bad result and in the end he took advantage of it and played well. He was in the starting XI that day and since then he hasn’t left that post</p>
