<blockquote>
  <p><b>[But his physique was still holding him back: initially he trained, but didn’t play competitively]</b> The first time I saw him play in competition, you could see that he really had something but he was still very underdeveloped. You see so many kids with great technique, but they never make it. The physical jump came in his final year as a junior, that was when the footballer we know today was born and when finally the doubts about whether he would make it passed<br /><br /><b>[Beyond his brilliance with the ball at his feet, <a href="reinaldo-rueda.html">Rueda</a> pays tribute to his strength of character]</b> He came all the way here only speaking French at such a young age, having to go back and forth between here and Bayonne. But he showed he was very strong mentally, very expressive, cheerful, and he always had a smile on his face - he won us all over right from the start</p>
