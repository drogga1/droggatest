  <p><b>[Graham Taylor may have been able to return to work, but his assistant Phil Neal was criticised for being ‘a yes man’ after the documentary was broadcast. At the time, he was England’s most decorated player, yet his managerial career never recovered, with a brief spell in charge of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in 1996 his last job as a coach]</b> At the time I felt terrible. not only for Graham but I also feel responsible for Phil not being able to earn a living in football any more. If it wasn’t for Graham’s help, we would not have been able to film in Rotterdam. We would have missed all of that drama. I found it hard to take the consequences of the film. But there is nothing I would change. It is a piece of honest film-making</p>
