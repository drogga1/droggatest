<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Why was Shakhtar scoring sensation Facundo Ferreyra such a flop at Newcastle?]</b> I was never scared, but I went through some strange situations. One day <b>[in Donetsk]</b>, the Ukrainian flag would be flying over the building, the next, the Russian flag. When I went to training, the Donetsk police would ask me for my documents. On the other side of the building, a group of hooded men would also ask me for identification. They were pro-Russians. They were tough times<br /><br /><b>[Ferreyra blamed his snubbing on his lack of the physical prowess necessary to star in England]</b> When I got here <b>[Newcastle]</b>, I struggled to adapt. It cost me physically perhaps, the inactivity in Ukraine. There were many tense moments. There is a lot of running, which becomes attractive, and there are a lot of goals. The defenders are very strong and have to withstand whatever is thrown at them. Here, if you are not good physically, you can not play<br /><br /><b>[Back in Ukraine and determined to make the best of a bad job]</b> It is like being in a different country. Everybody began a new life. In our stadium there were always 50,000 fans supporting us, they exert a lot of pressure. Now it is tough for them to travel, it is a day’s drive. It is tough to play in these conditions, it is an advantage for our opponents. But we draw strength from our adversity. We are respected in Europe, we have a sort of mystique. Some big players, like Douglas Costa, have left us, but we keep on fighting</p>
