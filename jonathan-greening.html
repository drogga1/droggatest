  <p><b>[Former Red Devils midfielder Jonathan Greening says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> should be prepared to sell <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> for as much as they can and reinvest the money in the squad]</b> He’s come out and said that he wants to go, and Ole has come out and said that he wants to keep him so it’s a Catch-22 situation. He’s a world-class player on his day but if he keeps saying that he wants to go…It’s going to be interesting over the next few weeks, if Madrid come out publicly and say that want him at Madrid, as it will be in <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>’s corner to say to the world, the players and Ole that he wants to leave United. Then Ole will have a decision; do you sell him for £160 million ($194m) and invest back into the squad or do you keep an unhappy player that might not try for you? It’s a tough situation, but for me, if he came out and said he wanted to go to Madrid, I’d sell him for as much as I could and invest in the squad<br /><br /><b>[Greening, who was part of the club’s treble-winning squad in 1999, said that <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> could be become unpopular with his team-mates]</b> For me, if you have an unhappy player, it kills the team spirit in the changing room. If I’m a United player, sitting next to <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> who wants to leave, I know he’s not going to give 100% in training or on the pitch, so automatically it creates an atmosphere where players won’t like him<br /><br />Obviously <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> got rid of him; he said he thought he was too big for the club so he got rid of him, which was quite interesting! On his day he can be absolute world class. Against <a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a> he was absolutely fantastic. His range of passing, his skills to beat players and his possession of the ball. One game he’s a 9/10 - his work ethic, you can’t get near him - and then the next three games he looks like he’s not even trying, passing the ball out of play. I think for United fans, it’s just the consistency that you need to bring every game which he isn’t doing<br /><br /><b>[With regards to who <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> should bring in to improve his squad]</b> <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Paulo Dybala</a> had be a great acquisition for the club. I think if they sell <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> they need to sign two or three players extra to fill the void. He’s (Solskjaer) looking for younger, hungrier players who want to play for the badge. He (Dybala) fits the mould as a player with a lot of years ahead of him and he can look after the ball really well</p>

  <p><b>[ex-Old Trafford youngster Jonathan Greening says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> must play <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> and <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> together]</b> They need to sort out the <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> situation, because he’s such a good player, and when he’s on his game he’s unreal. I’d like to see him back fit playing with <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a>, leaving <a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a> or <a href="fred.html">Fred</a> sitting in. Let those two <b>[<a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> and Fernandes]</b> play together, and they’ll bounce off each other really well. If <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> stays, commits himself, he’s happy and fit and wants to play there (at United) it will be immense for the team and a massive boost<br /><br /><b>[Greening believes that they are not far off challenging for trophies once more]</b> They definitely need another striker, maybe another centre half and then another player like a <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> or a <a href="james-maddison.html">James Maddison</a> who can play in wide areas as well as centrally. Then they’ve got a good chance of being title contenders again, without a shadow of a doubt</p>
