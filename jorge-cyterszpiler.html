<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Remembering Jorge Cyterszpiler, Maradona’s lifelong friend who tried to fix him up with the Princess of Monaco]</b> Maradona got to the point where he asked, and almost demanded, that Cyterszpiler convince <b>[former Barca president Josep Luis]</b> Nunez to organise a friendly in Monaco so he could make contact with the princess.<br /><br />We took care of everything based on friendship, without signing a single piece of paper<br /><br />As manager, perhaps I should have imposed greater diligence. But as a friend I felt there was a limit to how far I could go in controlling his money. The money was after all his. He would tell me: ‘Buy that house, or that car.’ And I had no choice but to buy it … High spending was part of Diego’s life<br /><br />I loved Diego, I love him and I will always love him. I do not speak poorly of him: that is my concept of friendship. You will never hear a bad word of him come out of my mouth</p>
