  <p><b>[Mamadou Sakho on the battle, during his final months at <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>, to partner <a href="thiago-silva.html">Thiago Silva</a> at the heart of the defence]</b> Did I feel inferior to Alex, <a href="marquinhos.html">Marquinhos</a>? No, never. I was once told, ‘You’re the number three’. I replied, ‘Yes, number three is my jersey number but I’m not number three in the hierarchy’</p>

  <p><b>[Mamadou Sakho is looking for a way out of Liverpool]</b> Since I started this incredible adventure abroad, in terms of football but also in terms of my family, because when I see my children speaking English I think it is a glorious thing that I have been able to give them. I think I have a few more wonderful years to experience abroad first. And PSG, why not, but afterwards. I think Marseille have a very good team. Bafe Gomis and Patrice Evra are friends of mine. But my answer to this might remind certain people about a song. When there is PSG, Sakho is with them.<br /><br />It is true that I turned up late. There was a rule that I should have observed. I do not at all see myself as above the rules, I respect everyone. I paid my fine, I was sanctioned, I apologised to my team-mates and my manager. Aside from that … I do not want to go into the controversies. I work a lot, I have the chance to train with the reserve team , which allows me to keep up. And beside that I have my trainer. So I work a lot to stay on top of my game</p>

  <p><b>[Crystal Palace defender Mamadou Sakho has revealed his desire to compete in the Champions League]</b> I’ve always been ambitious, and I’ve worked to reach the highest levels of football since I was a trainee. Today my ambition remains the same. I want to play in the biggest competitions possible. If I said otherwise that would tell you that I lack ambition, and that I am happy with what I’ve got. Why shouldn’t the Champions League be on my mind? Ask any Crystal Palace player and they will tell you the same thing. A footballer’s aim is to play in the biggest tournaments for the best clubs. If that isn’t the case you might as well play video games instead<br /><br />During the summer there were various roads I could have taken - to clubs in Spain, Italy and France - but I opted to stay in England. I don’t regret it. When I take a decision I put my head down and go flat out until the end, and I am proud to have made my choice. But I will take stock of my situation at the end of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Mamadou Sakho still considers Paris Saint-Germain to be home]</b> Paris is my home, it will always be that way. I believe in PSG and the Champions League. Like many, I have no regrets in my life and in my career, except that my father did not have the chance to see what I could accomplish. I like it <b>[at Palace]</b> but in life we ​​do not know what tomorrow holds.<br /><br />I do not think specifically about Euro 2020. But everyone who knows me knows that I am ambitious. The top target for any player is start in Ligue 2, Ligue 1, then the Champions League and the national team</p>

  <p><b>[Mamadou Sakho snubbed <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to make ‘dream’ £17m move to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> When I left <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>, I had a number of offers from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I choose <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> because they were one of the clubs of my dreams with a great history. I had the chance to spend four years there in the Reds’ shirt at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> with a fantastic crowd. I had very good relationships with my board and I played alongside great talents like <b>[Luis]</b> Suárez, <b>[Philippe]</b> <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a>, <b>[Daniel]</b> <a href="daniel-sturridge.html">Sturridge</a> or <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>. I lived exceptional moments with those players<br /><br />The goal is to come back very strong. I’m working hard to be in top shape. I want to play with <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> while having the national team in a corner of my mind. I’m only 30. As I say, when you’re born ambitious, you die ambitious. There are many talented players in France. We’re lucky to have an extraordinary pool. I’m first going to give my best for <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>, for the fans. Then, when you play well on the pitch, the national team comes with it. I’m very happy here. My children have adapted very well, and my two daughters are more English than French. They’ve learnt to read English. I feel at home in England. You can never predict anything in a career, but today, I’m happy and settled at <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> where I have a year-and-a-half left on my contract. I’m happy here for now, but we never know what tomorrow is made of. I don’t especially want to see elsewhere for now</p>
