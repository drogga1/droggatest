  <p><b>[It was a historic win for Mexico when it topped the United States in Columbus in November 2016]</b> You might find this hard to believe, but we don’t even talk about things like that. We knew we were coming up against a good side, who were at home too, and that we needed the three points to make a good start to the Hexagonal. So we just focused on the game and not on all the stuff surrounding it. We worked on the tactical, physical and mental side of things so that we could win a very important game for us, which is just what we did, without worrying about what was going on around it.<br /><br />Osorio is very adventurous in his approach. He likes to attack and he wants us to keep pushing forward the whole time. That boldness means he has a huge amount of confidence in the Mexico players and you can see that on the pitch, because he gives you a lot of freedom. He does a lot of preparation and he sets matches up in a way that allows us to be comfortable on the pitch and to play an attacking game</p>

We want to aim as high as we can because we know we have the potential. Every team in the World Cup has a chance and we want to do our best ever, to get to the final and even win the World Cup<br /><br />You cannot say which of those teams is going to qualify for the next stage. Germany is obviously the favorite, but all the other three will be trying to get through. We have a good preparation period over the next six months, with a lot of games in the month before the World Cup which will be crucial to help us be ready and be as fit as we can be to be at the top level at the tournament<br /><br /><b>[The Guadalajara native admitted his frustration at not getting more minutes]</b> Last year was unbelievable for me, talking not only in football but outside of the pitch in my personal life. It went pretty well and I’ve been very, very happy. The last month or two has been more difficult, first because I was injured and then because I’ve not been as involved as I wanted to be, obviously, but it was a great year overall. I became the all-time record goal-scorer for my national team, I broke 100 caps as well, played in the Confederations Cup and made a very good impression around the world that Mexico is improving as a football team. It was not a bad year at all and hopefully 2018 will be even better!</p>

Words can come and go. Your acts are going to speak for themselves. Now that the window is closed I am here and trying to achieve the main goals for the club, which is to be safe from relegation. Then, in the summer, we will see.<br /><br />I always want my old clubs to do well. But I have only one love in my life in football - my home club Chivas, in Guadalajara. The other clubs are my girlfriends. I love them in the moment. I love them, then we say goodbye. Are the other clubs just jobs? Not jobs. They are like girlfriends. You like them, you love them. You give them your best, they give you the best - but it doesn’t depend on them or me. You just ­separate. West Ham? They are my ­girlfriend right now!</p>

This is always the case against the best six teams, but you saw us produce pretty good performances against Chelsea and Tottenham recently, so hopefully we can do it again and take the three points. These types of games are the ones we all look forward to.

He’s a great human being, a great man, his character. He’s a very special character as well. I call him, in a way, like a genius because they live in a completely different world than ourselves. And a part of that, speaking about football, he has a lot of knowledge that even if you can speak five minutes with him about one game or one player, he gives you the way he sees football and the way he sees that player and it’s knowledge that you can learn if you want. He’s a great, great man with a lot of knowledge. I think he’s a very good man as well to trust. Those two parts for me, football and life, are very important.<br /><br />He’s a fundamental part like I am, like you are, like the critics are, like the president, like the fans - this is for them. It’s something I’d love for the people to be open toward. We don’t have to look for something like ‘Juan Carlos Osorio is the key’ or ‘Javier Hernandez is the key’ or ‘El Chucky is the key,’ no, look, I understand how the press works but there’s no secret formula here. We want to do is do everything possible to work and get things in our favor and deserve to win</p>

Having a master in football as a professional allowed me to learn the good and bad things, the pros and cons of this career and when you don’t have this guidance you will have to learn it along the way.

Being involved in another culture, another country, adapting to all that, to another language, sharing with colleagues from other parts in the world in such a complete, diverse squad with different cultures, religions, different tastes.

I swear to you, and I promise you that I did not feel any pressure, on the contrary, pure motivation, real responsibility, pure illusion, genuine happiness and a lot of gratitude to be there.<br /><br /><b>[A late winner against local rivals Atletico Madrid in the second leg of the Champions League quarter-final]</b> When I scored that night what I felt was the answer to what I had been doing during that year. The reward to all the work, all the training.

They organised it for me and I invited all the players to come. They all came apart from Jesus Corona, the goalkeeper, because he had a personal issue and he apologised to me and all the squad. We ate together and then afterwards a lot of people arrived and every player left at the time they wanted to. Another thing that makes me embarrassed and laugh and that I have to talk about now it comes to mind is that there were never escorts or anything similar.

  <p><b>[The importance of hydration]</b> Hydration is fundamental; it is essential, it is part of the training since one is an active training and the other is regenerative or more passive if you can call it that. I hydrate myself with Powerade, which is what I use. It has a lot of electrolytes so either in the gym or on the pitch it is my drink of choice. I use the same type of hydration when I go to the national team. They give us Powerade, which gives me the liquid and electrolytes I need.

Javier Hernandez can do achieve what he wants to achieve, he can get to where he wants to get to, but he’ll pass and other players will come. I’ve always said the important thing is the country we represent and that we’re very proud of. If I end up as the top goalscorer at the World Cup in Mexico history, it’d be great, but it doesn’t matter if I do that and, for example, we don’t advance to the next round.

  <p><b>[Javier Hernandez claims to be very happy and very motivated at West Ham]</b> I’m good, I’m very happy to be here in an unbelievable place. The lads told me that when they went to Switzerland it was great as well, so it’s been a very good pre-season. Next week, the season is going to start, so hopefully we can get a better one compared to the last one. After the last season ended, I went to Spain to work with my fitness coach before the World Cup. Then, the work in the World Cup was very good and we had a very good World Cup. Unfortunately, we couldn’t get further but that’s football. Sometimes it cannot be like you want. I spent some time in Miami and then some weeks in my hometown, in Guadalajara, and the last week I was working over there. I feel very good. Of course, I need to improve a little bit more in fitness and in football and hopefully I can get some minutes on Friday to help me be ready for next Sunday.<br /><br />It’s always once per year <b>[that I get to return home]</b> and it’s more difficult in the Premier League because there is no winter break, although next year they said there will be a winter break. It’s very good to see my family and my friends and spend some time in my hometown and be over there. It’s great to be back but of course it’s better because now, in my life, I know Guadalajara is like my holiday and not my home. Right now, I’m living in London, so that’s my home. I’m very glad, very happy and very motivated and with a lot of confidence that this season is going to be a lot better</p>

  <p><b>[Javier Hernandez is daring to dream of a top-four finish with West Ham]</b> The club is doing well with improvements in all the areas, in the team, but also in all the staff they have brought in with the manager. Top six, top four is the aim, as high as we can. I’m a dreamer. I work hard and my thoughts are always positive. I am always aiming as high as I can and if we can put West Ham in the Champions League why not? That’s the dream, that’s the idea and hopefully we can get it..<br /><br />The manager called me before the World Cup because he knew my situation was difficult at the end of last season, and he made me feel very good. He told me I was going to be an important player and would play an important role in this team, so he gave me a lot of confidence. I’m very motivated and I know I need to work hard to win a place in the starting line-up and then perform as well as I can to help the team with goals, assists and good performances to get the points to move up the table.</p>

I’ve played two games and the only way to get back to your best fitness, and back in your rhythm, is just playing. Thankfully I played 60 minutes in the last two games, so hopefully I can keep adding minutes to that from the start and keep getting better.<br /><br />It has been frustrating because when I got back for pre-season I tried to get as fit as possible but then I had the virus thing, which kept me off the pitch and away from my teammates for five weeks. That was very difficult because I had a starting point, then I stopped and had to start again. For two weeks I had to stop completely because I had to wait to get better. I could not go out from my apartment and I wasn’t sleeping well. I stopped completely, so it was more difficult when I came back<br /><br />We have so much to improve and so much to give. We are in the position the table we are, and we need to keep working. There are no words to make people feel better other than results, so we have another game on Saturday and another opportunity. It will be a decisive game in this moment, because both teams want the three points. We need that, and it will be a good game, a good fight and hopefully here in our home we can get the win</p>

I scored before with Manchester United in some other games, but that one gave me a lot of confidence in that moment. I was very young and in the early stages there, so I wanted to do my best and not have that period of adaptation. I wanted to prove that I could play in the Premier League as best as I could, as quickly as I could. So that goal gave me a lot of confidence and responsibility as well that I needed to keep working hard. Of course, we won the Premier League in that first season so that was a very good thing. Then at West Ham, it was my second match at this club <b>[at Southampton]</b>, so it’s a very good start when you come to a club and have a response that quick with two great goals. Unfortunately we couldn’t get any points out of it - we had a red card so it was very difficult and they won in the end with a penalty. It was a tough task, like this season, because we knew the games at the start were difficult, but that game was very important for me.</p>

I come back as a Mexican football legend, as much as some may be bothered by that<br /><br />To go from doubting whether to retire at <a href="chivas-fc.html">Chivas</a>, to playing at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> within a year and a half. To go through the retirement of <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a>, who most of humanity, and myself, thought would never retire from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. He retired when I was there. And I scored the last goal of his era.<br /><br />How do I imagine it <b>[at Galaxy]</b>? I signed for three years plus an additional one, hopefully there are four years and each year brings a title<br /><br />I’ve been playing in this country since I was 16 years old. I’ve won a lot of games here, and I’ve been treated with a lot of value and respect. I want that, and it’s coming from the best club in the USA. They came to get me, and that speaks of what they think of me<br /><br /><b>[Hernandez is well aware of the five-time <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> champions’ history of landing world-class players, reeling off his own list of favorites]</b> <a href="robbie-keane.html">Robbie Keane</a>. <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>. Giovani Dos Santos. Jonathan Dos Santos. <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a>. <a href="landon-donovan.html">Landon Donovan</a>. <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>, that’s the most iconic one, obviously. And then my name is over those. I’m just so blessed and so humble that I can be a part of all this</p>

  <p><b>[Chicharito says Scot not humble enough to succeed Ferguson]</b> To be honest, I’m always going to be a red. We didn’t ever have anything personal - <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a> and myself - but it was a mistake that they took him. It was a mistake. It was the first mistake but it’s still haunting them now. Not because of him, he was not a bad manager, but they thought they were going to take the replacement of the boss, of Sir Alex, so quick. It’s impossible. Not even now, even with <b>[Pep]</b> <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>, <b>[Jose]</b> <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> and <b>[Jurgen]</b> <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, they are not on the same level as the boss even now. They are on the way of trying to get there, to be those kind of managers and they could get there. But that changed careers that could have been better. <a href="rafael.html">Rafael</a>, myself, <a href="danny-welbeck.html">Danny Welbeck</a>, and a lot of players who needed to go away to play. They brought in <a href="david-moyes.html">David Moyes</a> and I’m not going to question whether he was a good coach, a bad coach but I don’t understand how it is possible - what’s the word, not humble - but to be at least half of what you are succeeding. He was the greatest of all time.<br /><br />I even went to speak to Sir Alex because he knew I was down. He knew I was going to be sold, not loaned to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, and we spoke about it and he told me the things I was thinking … ‘this is <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, man … ‘ And for a Mexican guy. My career lasted for years and my career at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> lasted one year. They had <b>[Ruud]</b> <a href="ruud-van-nistelrooy.html">van Nistelrooy</a>, <b>[David]</b> <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a>, <a href="michael-owen.html">Michael Owen</a>. I’d played for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and then <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. It was incredible. It’s still difficult to believe. I can accept being a substitute at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>. Sir Alex told me that one of his regrets was not to play me more and he told me he was going to speak to <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a> to tell him I needed to play more. He said I was an important figure for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>, I deserved more game time and then <a href="david-moyes.html">David Moyes</a> and (executive vice-chairman) <a href="edward-woodward.html">Ed Woodward</a> did not do both. They did not play me and they did not let me go. In the winter, there was another opportunity for me to go but he did not let me go because he was so stubborn and that’s why he only lasted seven months because he was not humble, he could not grow to be United.</p>
