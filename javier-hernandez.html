The reality is, when I broke it out for somebody, it was - with the transfer (fee) - about a $60 million deal. You’ve got to think about that from a business standpoint</p>

If this goal hadn’t come it would’ve been tougher.

  <p><b>[Why Chicharito is heading to MLS]</b> <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is getting very close. I think our country doesn’t want to admit that <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is getting very close. I’ve been out 10 years now, out of playing in Liga MX, and this is going to be my first time playing in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> so I cannot tell you what exactly is the way, but the way I see it from the outside, the explosion of <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> all over the world is not the same as Liga MX. I know it because my teammates, the coaches I have played for, they have more knowledge about <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> than Liga MX. Both leagues are improving, but <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is improving in bigger steps. Speaking about Liga MX, they don’t want to notice that. They don’t want to learn some things that <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> are doing good. I think one of the reasons <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is growing so good is because they are learning from Liga MX and other leagues to dream big and try and make this league as big as they can<br /><br />I come to the United States to play for the best club in the country. It’s a very attractive league and it has grown a ton even if others don’t want to accept it. Bigger than people say. I’m not here to retire or enjoy myself. The rumors are wrong</p>

And now, the LA Galaxy, the manager of the club and the league, are telling me, ‘Look, Javier, we want to give you all the trust, all the confidence to help us,’ and that’s why I’m taking this opportunity. I’m going to be able to play in front of a lot of Mexican fans, Galaxy fans, American fans. That’s what’s great about football. They give you a lot of opportunities<br /><br />Right now, my mind is completely on the LA Galaxy. I’m going to be playing. That’s what I want in my life.

It was the first mistake but it’s still haunting them now. Not because of him, he was not a bad manager, but they thought they were going to take the replacement of the boss, of Sir Alex, so quick. It’s impossible. Not even now, even with <b>[Pep]</b> <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>, <b>[Jose]</b> <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> and <b>[Jurgen]</b> <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, they are not on the same level as the boss even now. They are on the way of trying to get there, to be those kind of managers and they could get there. But that changed careers that could have been better. <a href="rafael.html">Rafael</a>, myself, <a href="danny-welbeck.html">Danny Welbeck</a>, and a lot of players who needed to go away to play. They brought in <a href="david-moyes.html">David Moyes</a> and I’m not going to question whether he was a good coach, a bad coach but I don’t understand how it is possible - what’s the word, not humble - but to be at least half of what you are succeeding. He was the greatest of all time.<br /><br />I even went to speak to Sir Alex because he knew I was down. He knew I was going to be sold, not loaned to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, and we spoke about it and he told me the things I was thinking … ‘this is <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, man … ‘ And for a Mexican guy. My career lasted for years and my career at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> lasted one year. They had <b>[Ruud]</b> <a href="ruud-van-nistelrooy.html">van Nistelrooy</a>, <b>[David]</b> <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a>, <a href="michael-owen.html">Michael Owen</a>. I’d played for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and then <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. It was incredible. It’s still difficult to believe. I can accept being a substitute at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>. Sir Alex told me that one of his regrets was not to play me more and he told me he was going to speak to <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a> to tell him I needed to play more. He said I was an important figure for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>, I deserved more game time and then <a href="david-moyes.html">David Moyes</a> and (executive vice-chairman) <a href="edward-woodward.html">Ed Woodward</a> did not do both. They did not play me and they did not let me go. In the winter, there was another opportunity for me to go but he did not let me go because he was so stubborn and that’s why he only lasted seven months because he was not humble, he could not grow to be United.</p>
