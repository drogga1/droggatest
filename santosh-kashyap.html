  <p><b>[Mumbai FC coach Santosh Kashyap sounded elated after his side’s dramatic victory against Churchill Brothers]</b> Great win, great comeback. As I told you before, it is going to be a tough match. Away games always pose many challenges. It’s very important to come back twice. We missed the penalty and morally won the game.<br /><br />With the foreigner, Churchill became a more dangerous team. With our foreigners, we will also become a stronger side. Churchill were playing more defensively in their own half in the first half and were more attacking in the second half, but we contained the situation well<br /><br />We started very well with the early lead. We lost focus especially in the midfield and conceded a silly goal. We rectified our mistakes in the second half but we could not put the ball at the back of the net<br /><br />I don’t want to say anything. You are in the better position to judge that. For me it was not a penalty, though the goalkeeper saved it<br /><br />Hopefully, the foreigners will come soon. Maybe not so soon. The Asian player <b>[Bektur Talgat]</b> will come tomorrow <b>[Monday]</b>. I am not sure of the other player <b>[A Kroma]</b>. The coach <b>[Joseph Afusi]</b> is also not sure to be arriving anytime soon</p>

  <p><b>[Mumbai FC versus newbies Minerva FC, were forced to share the spoils with their visitors in a goalless affair]</b> Football is a game of opinion. When Mumbai won two games the fans chanted, ‘Santosh Kashyap ki jay ho’ <b>[meaning ‘All hail Santosh Kashyap’]</b>. Now they are angry and I have to accept it and respect it. I believe, as a professional coach, Mumbai is an entertainment hub which includes malls, movie theatres, music shows, etc. And these guys, despite the six losses, chose the option to support us for 90 minutes. So, it’s my responsibility to give them back something. It takes a lot of courage and energy to shout for 90 minutes for anybody, either in positive or negative,’ he further opined. I know the fans are hurt by the results, I can understand their frustration for the losses. I respect it and I clapped for them. I hope things are improved.<br /><br />I have never lost six games in a row as a coach or as a player. Also, I have never ever sacked any players, for the three players - again the blame goes to me. I treat my players as kids. I blast at them, I take care of them, I motivate them. I do the same at home with my own kids<br /><br />I must have said that as a joke. It happens in anger. It has happened casually, don’t take it seriously,</p>

  <p><b>[After being put under pressure by the vehement protests by the Mumbai FC faithful, Mumbai FC management responded by recalling Steven Dias, Pratik Chowdhary and Allan Dias to the training session on Monday]</b> Also I have never ever sacked any players, for the three players - again the blame goes to me. I treat my players as kids. I blast at them, I take care of them, I motivate them. I do the same at home with my own kids<br /><br /><b>[This is]</b> just like how parents are not always wrong, it’s the children at fault too, at times. But that doesn’t mean you disown the children. You try to improve them by correcting their mistake and bringing them back. But here <b>[at Mumbai FC]</b>, I can’t say if such can be the case</p>

  <p><b>[Mumbai FC’s Santosh Kashyap - Top three finish is more like a dream now]</b> Lalchhawnkima has just recovered from a long term injury and was unfit to start. We gave him rest and he will play him in future games. Clyde’s substitution happened because of the U-22 rule. He is a left back actually and he impressed me in practice. However, he couldn’t do what I needed him to do despite me being confident and this was a tough away game. But that is okay.<br /><br />No, I want to go for the best line-up. I have previously played in a similar system but I like my defence to be strong. My attackers have very poor defensive quality. I want my defence to be strong but I like to play attacking football. You saw six defenders but all were not defending. Even Clyde was attacking<br /><br />It’s <b>[top three]</b> like a dream now I believe. Aizawl game is tough for away sides because of the travelling and high altitude. Yesterday, we were stuck in traffic for four and half hours because of a festival. So, fatigue takes place and we were supposed to train at 2 pm but started at 4:30 pm. I believe we tried hard. In the second half, we created 12 chances and football is about scoring goals and we couldn’t<br /><br />He couldn’t do much. He did well but today he was upset and missing passes because he is playing continuously and this happens to players sometimes. The players are very much under pressure and ninth place is not good. I am still building the team. My team is not fit. But the players are joining. Baljit <b>[Sahni]</b> played his first game. Thoi joined our team straight after marriage<br /><br />Congrats to Aizawl! This was such a swift game and what a crowd! They deserved to win the match</p>

  <p><b>[Santosh Kashyap questions Mumbai FC fans’ upbringing]</b> There’s no problem <b>[as of now]</b>, I believe. The management understands that I am putting my best and preparing <b>[well]</b> every match. The media is against me, the fans are against me but there is great support from the management. They understand the situation.<br /><br />They started chanting positively but ended up negatively. This is my perception. They were cheering up, not me, but the players. Later on, it was the same old story. I know they are hurt. What I want to say to the fans is that I expect better from them. In the last match against Minerva Punjab, for full 90 minutes they were abusing me. I am also an employee here, and I am trying my best. The coach only isn’t responsible for the situation. The players, the staff, the management- everyone is equally responsible<br /><br />I don’t expect them to protest this way. You must have a way to protest. They are abusing through the internet and also at the stadium. If they are uneducated and doing so, I can understand. But they are from good families so that’s disrespectful. I believe their upbringing is a problem. They should understand that you must respect everyone in this field. I am also trying my best</p>
