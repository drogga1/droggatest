<blockquote>
  <p>[Mumbai FC coach Santosh Kashyap sounded elated after his side’s dramatic victory against Churchill Brothers] Great win, great comeback. As I told you before, it is going to be a tough match. Away games always pose many challenges. It’s very important to come back twice. We missed the penalty and morally won the game.<br /><br />With the foreigner, Churchill became a more dangerous team. With our foreigners, we will also become a stronger side. Churchill were playing more defensively in their own half in the first half and were more attacking in the second half, but we contained the situation well<br /><br />We started very well with the early lead. We lost focus especially in the midfield and conceded a silly goal. We rectified our mistakes in the second half but we could not put the ball at the back of the net<br /><br />I don’t want to say anything. You are in the better position to judge that. For me it was not a penalty, though the goalkeeper saved it<br /><br />Hopefully, the foreigners will come soon. Maybe not so soon. The Asian player [Bektur Talgat] will come tomorrow [Monday]. I am not sure of the other player [A Kroma]. The coach [Joseph Afusi] is also not sure to be arriving anytime soon</p>
