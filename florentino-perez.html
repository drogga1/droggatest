President Florentino Perez is willing to enter negotiations with the Ligue 1 champions PSG and table an opening bid in excess of €100m, while Neymar would be offered a five-year contract with an annual salary of €25m per season. A possible return to Barcelona now looks to have collapsed, with Philippe Coutinho having rejected the opportunity to make a loan move to Tottenham</p>
