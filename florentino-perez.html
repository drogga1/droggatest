  <p><b>[From Beckham to Ronaldo, Madrid president Florentino Perez admits players are bought to sell shirts]</b> People understand the obvious - that we sign big players like Ronaldo, <b>[Zinedine]</b> Zidane and <b>[Luis]</b> Figo. But after the players there is the economic sports equation. In our model it is fundamental to understand that in the signing of every player, we have to have in our heads: what’s the income generated?<br /><br />In the year 2000, Real Madrid suffered a very big economic crisis. So big that it risked losing its status as a member-owned club. But the club has to belong to its members and not belong to just one individual</p>

If it depends on me, he will stay in Madrid forever, but that is not something we are discussing right now, but again, if it depends on me, he will stay here.<br /><br />Anything is possible, but we will not talk about players who don’t belong to Real Madrid.

His goal against Juventus was one of the most beautiful in football history, a wonderful goal by the best player in the world. What happened in Turin was very exciting and shows the greatness of Juventus as well as their fans.<br /><br />The great players of the past are Real Madrid’s main assets. Alfredo Di Stefano changed the history of football, as well as that of Madrid. He helped to construct the legend of Real Madrid all over the world. Cristiano is Di Stefano’s great heir and in him the values of Real Madrid are reflected. He’s our all-time top scorer and represents all that we are: talent, work, sacrifice, professionalism and ambition. Cristiano today is a symbol of Real Madrid</p>

Another of our great references is and always will be Zidane. As a coach, he has entered the history books as a giant of Real Madrid. He won nine titles in less than three years, with three Champions League triumphs. Zidane is Real Madrid and he knows, along with Cristiano, that this is their house forever. Thanks Zizou.</p>

We have to understand that this team had won everything there was to win in a unique and historic cycle which saw us lift 17 titles in the past nine seasons, an almost inimitable cycle. It’s been a difficult season and we’ve all taken stock where necessary, because we need to turn the situation around. Don’t be in any doubt that we will do just that. By placing great demands on ourselves, we must carry out the transformation required which will allow ‘madridistas’ <b>[Madrid fans]</b> to dream of new successes and titles. Our challenge is to keep winning on an international football stage which is increasingly complicated and competitive. And of course, we need to recover that hunger for success.
