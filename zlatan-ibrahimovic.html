I think the way you have to approach a player like that, where everyone is talking about the talent and what he’s able to do and what kind of potential he has, is to remember he still has a lot of time. It’s not like he needs to take over the world today, the club knows that, the coach knows that and the team knows that. We know his quality and what he’s able to do. What the world is seeing now, we already know because we see it every day. There is no need to rush to push him and put him in the heat zone and put a lot of pressure on him because that can have the opposite effect. Time by time, he will take over everything. It’s about having patience. I’ll help him every day, him and all the others, in any way I can. I’m happy it gives an effect but, even if I was not here, they would still do good</p>

  <p><b>[Ibrahimovic statue in Malmo set to be relocated after repeated acts of vandalism]</b> It’s a shame. They want attention and want the media to write about it - it’s at kindergarten level and we’re bigger than that. The statue was what it was, but that doesn’t mean that my story will be torn down, it will remain forever</p>

Let’s play and finish as best we can, then let’s see. There is no one as strong as Ibra. It depends on the club, not just me.<br /><br /><b>[Milan are expected to bring in <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> sporting director <a href="ralf-rangnick.html">Ralf Rangnick</a>]</b> I don’t know <a href="ralf-rangnick.html">Rangnick</a> and I don’t know if he is coming.
