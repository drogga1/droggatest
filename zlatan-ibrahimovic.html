It’s not like he needs to take over the world today, the club knows that, the coach knows that and the team knows that. We know his quality and what he’s able to do. What the world is seeing now, we already know because we see it every day. There is no need to rush to push him and put him in the heat zone and put a lot of pressure on him because that can have the opposite effect. Time by time, he will take over everything.

They repeat every day like that, and I could not do it. I did so many boring trainings every day, but mentally I became stronger<br /><br />After my injury, that was something new that happened in my career. I never had it. I played every game, every season, so let’s say 70 games a season. I trained every day, I played every day, because that’s me. I want to play, I want to be involved. When I got my injury, something new happened. I was suddenly in a new situation, from on top to bottom<br /><br />I just want to go out there, smell the grass, appreciate every time I put my shoes on, my football shoes, just to feel the ball. Just to touch the ball, to kick it, to pass it, to run. It took me back where I began to play football. That is what I felt. I appreciate every time I can go out and just do those things that I’ve been doing for the past 20 years<br /><br />Today, when we finished the training I just wanted to continue.<br /><br />I even asked the coach, can I go and shoot some balls there and he gave me the OK, so I went over and I shot.

There is another player who got injured in the first half - he was carried out. I was walking out because I said I’m not injured. And when I came in, I still said to myself, ‘I’m not injured, it’s just a small bruise or something’. But something felt different. Then the next day it was swollen, and we did MRI and it showed that everything was off. Then you hear all the comments: It’s all over. He will never come back. He will never be the one he is. So now the haters come out. And all this gives me energy, all those people that are speaking. So I said: ‘I decide when I stop football. I decide how I will finish this story.

And I feel the team is good - it’s progressing, becoming better. This is his third year, the players know more and more the way he wants to play and how he wants it - so I believe, yes<br /><br />Why is Mourinho so special? First of all because he’s a winner - he has this winner mentality. He does everything to win. He knows the game. He reads the game well. He manipulates, not the game, but the minds of his own players. I remember when he came first time in Inter, he made everybody give 200 per cent - but not for the team, not for the club, for him. And that for me makes him very special, because when he came out on the big stage he was something different. He was not that classical coach. I remember I had <b>[Fabio]</b> Capello. Capello was hard, was discipline, was respect. Mourinho brought that but at the same time brought something else: character. He had different character, this way of expressing himself<br /><br />He was confident, not arrogant, because people say ‘arrogance’, I have the same thing, people say I’m arrogant, but I don’t call it arrogant, I call it confident. Because when you are confident, it means you are not powerful, but you are pretty sure for who you are. That is not arrogance, it is different.

  <p><b>[Zlatan Ibrahimovic believes criticism of Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho has become personal]</b> Everybody criticises Mourinho and I don’t think it’s because of the results, it’s because of the character, because of the way he is. I see myself a little bit in that situation because we have our vision, we have our confidence, we believe in things, we say certain things in our own way and of course we get the blame. We get criticised more when it’s not going good. But when it’s going good and we win, the satisfaction is bigger than the other ones. We are ourselves, we believe in what we do and we do it until the end. That is what is going on there. Some critics I feel are personal. Some critics are exaggerating. Some because of the one he is, other ones are jealousy. All of this is part of the circle, so Mourinho has to just keep being himself, stand up for what he is doing, stand up for who he is and continue. He is there because he did it his own way, because he is who he is and won’t change for nobody. I am the same. The people out there who think they are perfect, they are the biggest problem<br /><br /><b>[On Wayne Rooney]</b> I think so far he did fantastic, he changed the team he came to and they have done good results. Before he came it was different results, but he has been playing good and scoring goals and he shows that he is Rooney. I don’t need to describe Rooney. Everybody knows Rooney and they know his quality, so it’s only for him to play the games and perform</p>

If we don’t we have no one else to blame but ourselves<br /><br />I came here and I think everybody had a lot of expectations.

I came back from injury and there were all these excuses that I would hear all the time but now I don’t hear anything because of my results and the way I’m performing<br /><br />Four games ago was the moment where it started being that either we want or we don’t want. If we want, we have to take points in all of the remaining games. So far, we’ve taken points and now we have everything in our hands. That’s easier to control than depending on other teams</p>

That gave me adrenaline. I liked the Premier League. I found it very motivating and very exciting. It gets a lot of attention, although I feel the quality is a little bit overrated - the individual quality, the technical part. But the rhythm is high.

We won, and I did what I did before I got injured. I had an excellent time - great memories. I’m attached to United forever. The supporters are amazing: wherever I went, I saw red shirts, which was fantastic. It’s a very important moment in my career. As I said when I was in England, you’re lucky I didn’t come 10 years ago, because if I did what I did at 35 years old, imagine it if I was 25. Then it would have been a different story. I came there and they said I came in a wheelchair. All the people that talked, in the whole Premier League, I put them in a wheelchair. That’s what I did</p>

I had a good time because I got to know everyone, I was the mature guy with all these guys who were not mature. Paul Pogba, I had never played with him before and I didn’t know him as a person. We have the same management and when I got to know him I got to find a fantastic person and a fantastic footballer, but someone who needs to be guided. He is a professional guy that works every game and never misses training or a game. Those are all the things that people do not see, you only get judged by what you can see on television or the 90 minutes in the stadium, that’s where you have to perform. When you click with someone it just clicks. The connection on the field was amazing, we helped each other very well, I needed him and he needed me. The first year at United we had a fantastic year. They made me feel like Benjamin Button. I was getting younger and younger, then unfortunately I got my injury.

If you do not do a good season people will say the rest of the things you did before were useless because you didn’t make it in England, but that triggered me and that’s the challenge I wanted. I went against everyone and said that’s what I wanted to do. They thought I was too old, I was 35 and I made the Premier League look old. It took me three months to convince everyone who I was.

This was a new challenge for me and I said I would come back when I was ready and I would play exactly as I did before. When I cannot do that I will not continue in football because I’m not here for charity. After my injury, when I was selected, I said to Jose Mourinho: ‘I do not want to disappoint you or my team-mates.

We won things, I ran out top scorer at a great club with a great atmosphere, plus the old guard was still there. They were an incredible group of players, with whom I was lucky to play and win. And I know what it means to win in Italy. Winning is everything. I’ve played for the three biggest clubs in Italy: Juventus, Milan and Inter. Milan treated me well: I came from Barcelona, where I’d experienced sadness, but Milan put a smile back on my face. I wanted to repay them. I won’t say ‘no’ and I won’t say ‘yes’. We’ll see … <b>[Gennaro]</b> Gattuso was a great player and is a great coach. When I watch Milan’s games, I see how all his players love him. When you win with people like him, and we’ve won the Scudetto and Supercoppa together, it’s wonderful. Good times.<br /><br />The first six months went very well, and then everything changed for the worse. Guardiola had a problem with me but he did not want to face it and I could no longer be myself, with his attitude he managed to make me doubt myself and my abilities.

Hopefully he can continue and be strong mentally because I don’t think it’s about the quality, it’s more in the head. I’ve always said 50 per cent is in your head. It doesn’t matter how good you are, if you can’t make it mentally, you will not survive<br /><br />From the national team, he is the only one playing for a big club, so he gets to feel what it’s all about.

  <p><b>[Zlatan Ibrahimovic admits he is unsure over his future at <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>]</b> I continue to play only if I can bring results. I’m not a mascot. Next year? Let’s see, I still have three weeks of <b>[my]</b> contract. Nobody started talking about the future, on my part or from Milan. Here nothing is known about the future now. Let’s play and finish as best we can, then let’s see. There is no one as strong as Ibra. It depends on the club, not just me.<br /><br /><b>[Milan are expected to bring in <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> sporting director <a href="ralf-rangnick.html">Ralf Rangnick</a>]</b> I don’t know <a href="ralf-rangnick.html">Rangnick</a> and I don’t know if he is coming. They didn’t say anything to us, I don’t know if it’s official</p>
