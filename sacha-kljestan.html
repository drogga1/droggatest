  <p><b>[On Dax McCarty]</b> Dax helped me a lot as a player, he enabled me to be a good attacking midfielder by finding me with very good passes between the lines. We’ll miss his ability to break up plays and recover balls in the midfield - he’s one of the best in the league at that. Having said that, Sean Davis is more than ready to play. I trained with him a lot this offseason and he’s motivated, he’s got an engine on him and he’s ready to work. You also have Tyler Adams, who is ready to contribute minutes in MLS this year.</p>

  <p><b>[Whitecaps hold edge after Red Bulls squander CCL first-leg opportunity]</b> I guess we’ll have to see what Vancouver does, and if they’re really going to come out and play. They’ve got an away goal so they’re in the lead. I like where we’re at, though, because we know we have to go there and score a goal, so even if we give up a goal nothing really changes from our game plan. They’re probably in the better spot right now, but I like our chances.</p>

  <p><b>[Sacha Kljestan is another option in central midfield, especially if Arena decides not to start Dempsey]</b> That was my attitude basically. For me, it doesn’t matter if I was the first guy called in or the last. The first time Jurgen <b>[Klinsmann]</b> brought me back in I think it was like last August, I wasn’t on the original roster but then I played 30 minutes off the bench in the first game and ended up starting in the second game and making a difference, so whatever role I’m handed I’m fine with. If I play 180 minutes I’ll be happy, if I play zero I’ll still be happy as long as we get some points. I’m just here to help the team and help us get back on track</p>

  <p><b>[USA ready for potentially frustrating task of breaking down Honduras bunker]</b> We’ve worked on it this week almost every day now, just trying to break down seven guys that are sitting in and when they are sitting in deep. Even if we’re playing nine against seven or eight against seven, it’s still hard to break them down because they just kind of clog up the space and they sit back in front of their goal.<br /><br />Sometimes shots from distance will open them up, sometimes just floating around and making quick combinations. Especially in a game like that, where teams sit back, any time you can create turnovers in the midfield and then go right away, before they can get back in their defensive shape, will be important.<br /><br />Obviously I think we’re probably going to have a lot of possession, which is something they’ll give up by having five in the back, which I think they’re OK with defending deep. The important thing is, when the ball gets wide, when you get these talented guys out on the ball, that they can take guys on one-on-one and put good balls in the box, whether that’s a cross or a cut-back to a trailing midfielder. I think crosses and 1-v-1 in the wide spots are going to be important<br /><br /><b>[On Andy Najar]</b> Andy’s special because he can play in pretty much any spot on the field. This season he’s played at left back in some big games for Anderlecht. I expect him to play on the right wing here, and I’ve told the left backs he’s strong 1-v-1 and that, despite his small stature he’s a very physically strong guy whose very good on the ball, dribbling, cutting, finishing plays off as well. He’s a handful</p>
