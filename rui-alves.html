  <p><b>[Nacional Madeira president Rui Alves says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> happy at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> for a few more years]</b> He seemed very happy at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>. I think and I hope he will remain there for a few more years. I want him to win the Scudetto, the Champions League and the Ballon d’Or in Bianconero<br /><br />I don’t think he comes here every day. Sometimes he will come in the morning, sometimes in the afternoon. It depends on his training programme. I found him super motivated and determined. The Madeiran air will have given him even more positive energy. He’s training hard. He’s looking forward to the end of this health emergency. First, for the good of the world and the people, and then because he has a great desire to return to play<br /><br /><a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> called us, and we were happy to give him this chance. We have complied with Madeira’s health rules and protocols linked to Covid-19, starting from the respect of safety distances. Cris was our boy and is now the best possible example for the Accademia del Nacional. He is a role model for the whole world. He is super professional and has remarkable human qualities. He is the pride of our club, of all of us. The best footballer in history was born on our small island</p>
