  <p><b>[Kasper Dolberg on his own development]</b> I feel that my body has become much stronger in the last two months. I was obviously not used to playing at this level</p>

  <p><b>[Kasper Dolberg has emerged as a hot prospect at Ajax but believes it is too big a step for him to join Manchester United or City at this stage]</b> No, it’s too big a step to go to City or United now. It’s important to keep on playing, as I don’t know what could happen in the future. I have not got a dream league. It’s important which kind of club is keen - in terms of playing style and also how it is at the club. You look at the whole package</p>

  <p><b>[Ajax sensation Kasper Dolberg breaks fan’s arm with wayward shot. Stijn Udo, the supporter in question, said]</b> It was going very fast. The ball hit my wrist very hard. At half-time, I went to the first aiders, they gave me a bag of ice, but I did not want to miss the match. Ajax could have become champions!<br /><br />After the match, I went to the hospital. First I thought it was a bruise, but after taking x-rays, it turned out that I broke my wrist in two places<br /><br />They will send me a little something, but I do not know what yet. Two tickets for the final on Wednesday? Yes, that would be nice, though it will be difficult because I cannot drive with my wrist</p>

  <p><b>[Ajax teen sensation Kasper Dolberg says he has no plans to follow his former coach to Borussia Dortmund]</b> There were rumours about players who might leave, but I was not expecting the coach to be the first, and that was a big surprise. There are no plans to go to Dortmund. Bosz believed in me, even in stages where I played worse, which is the most important thing a coach can do for a player</p>

  <p><b>[Nice teenager Diaby-Fadiga sacked after stealing Dolberg’s €70,000 watch]</b> <a href="nice-fc.html">OGC Nice</a> and Lamine Diaby-Fadiga parted ways on Tuesday. Following the theft of Kasper Dolberg’s watch from the professional first team’s changing room, and the subsequent admission of the player, the club decided to cancel its contract with the 18-year-old forward with immediate effect. Above and beyond all sporting and financial consideration, <a href="nice-fc.html">OGC Nice</a> cannot and will not accept such behaviour that betrays the confidence that unites all the club’s employees and all the members of the Rouge et Noir family</p>

  <p><b>[Lamine Diaby-Fadiga says that jealousy was the reason that he stole Nice striker Kasper Dolberg’s watch last month, prompting his sacking by the club which he views as the greatest possible punishment]</b> After several days of an unprecedented media storm for me, I have decided to give myself a voice via communication.<br /><br />I would like to first of all apologise to the fans and those who love Le Gym. A lot of them supported me and showed me kindness since I made my professional debut, as a youngster from the local region who joined the club when I was 14. Their reactions embody the level of disappointment that they feel towards me and I owe them an explanation. I proudly wore the club of my childhood’s shirt last season in <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a>. I was unfortunately injured for several months and my return to competitive action was further delayed following a red card I picked up whilst playing for the U19s. That affected me mentally and my difficult situation contrasted starkly the success and aura of Kasper, my team-mate. I took it out on him without having any reason to do so, maybe a bit because of jealousy. Instead of trying to battle on the pitch to provide him with competition for places, I reacted stupidly towards<br /><br />My actions were not taken out of an appetite to gain something from it, but out of disappointment, frustration and feeling discredited. Of course, I am only 18, but my age excuses nothing. I therefore owned up to what I had done to Kasper, Mr Fournier, the Director General of the club, <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a>, my coach and Dante, my captain. One by one, I apologised to each one of them. I also took on the responsibility of reimbursing my team-mate fully, which I have now done. I wish him a lot of success at <a href="nice-fc.html">OGC Nice</a> and in his career. Maybe one day we will come across each other on a pitch and this affair will be merely a bad memory. Now, I am leaving the club where I had always wanted to succeed and enjoy myself, which for me is the greatest possible punishment. I thank all those who believed in me. I hope to be able to prove one day that they were right and that I am worth more than what has happened. Redemption for me will come on the football pitch and I now want to concentrate on my passion: football</p>
