  <p><b>[<a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> have appointed Gianluca Petrachi as their new sporting director after reaching an agreement with <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> rivals <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a>]</b> Coming to Roma is an exciting and stimulating opportunity for me. Roma are an ambitious and incredibly stimulating adventure for me. I know well the expectations of such an important club. That’s why I immediately accepted this challenge.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> have announced the signing of Spanish goalkeeper Pau Lopez from <a href="real-betis.html">Real Betis</a>, for a fee of €23.5 million]</b> I am very pleased with the arrival of Pau Lopez to the team. Despite being a very young boy he still has 100 appearances in a competitive championship like <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>. I am convinced that he will be able to do well also with us and grow a lot thanks to the staff of Mr. Fonseca</p>

  <p><b>[When asked about Franco Baldini’s recent trip to London and <a href="toby-alderweireld.html">Toby Alderweireld</a>’s purported buy-out clause]</b> Baldini can be a resource for us. I realise there is a release clause for <a href="toby-alderweireld.html">Alderweireld</a>, but Baldini has a strong rapport with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> directors, he worked there for many years and can support Roma in signing <a href="toby-alderweireld.html">Alderweireld</a>. If you want to say that Baldini negotiates on our behalf, then that is incorrect. I want it to be clear that he is of support to Roma and in the specific case of <a href="toby-alderweireld.html">Alderweireld</a> is an idea to help us save a bit of money. We’d be happy if we could sign him tomorrow without paying the release clause.<br /><br />I don’t like to talk about specific players, but obviously with Ivan Marcano and Kostas Manolas sold, we need two centre-backs and that is the priority. We are working on several fronts and have clear ideas on what we intend to do<br /><br /><b>[The <a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> director was also asked about the recent claims that <a href="nicolo-zaniolo.html">Nicolo Zaniolo</a> and <a href="alessandro-florenzi.html">Alessandro Florenzi</a> are available for transfer, something he denied]</b> It’s not right that every word we say gets built up into some giant story. I understand your point of view, but I never put <a href="nicolo-zaniolo.html">Zaniolo</a> on the market. I can’t rule anything out either, because nobody thought <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> would sell <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> and yet they did. What I can say is that today <a href="nicolo-zaniolo.html">Zaniolo</a> is not on the market. We evaluate everything, but must also be clear. As for <a href="alessandro-florenzi.html">Florenzi</a>, he is the captain of Roma and I never put him on the market. If offers arrive, they will be evaluated, but I never called anyone to say he was available</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> have confirmed they have tied down Cengiz Under to new long-term contracts]</b> We really wanted to complete this renewal, because we all see the talent Cengiz has. We are certain that over the coming years he will make a huge contribution to the quality of the team, realising his great potential here in Rome - the perfect place for him to continue to improve</p>

  <p><b>[Roma’s sporting director Gianluca Petrachi on Federico Fazio]</b> Federico is a key player within our squad, and because of that we are delighted to be able to extend his contract. We will be relying on his ability and his experience, qualities which will also be hugely important in the growth and development of our younger players. Federico will be a mentor for our defence and for our lads</p>

  <p><b>[Roma sporting director Gianluca Petrachi claims Mkhitaryan has given up lots of money in swapping <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Emirates Stadium</a> for Stadio Olimpico]</b> The idea was to invest in important young people. In situations where we found ourselves at the end of the market, we made investments in young people or operations like those for Micky. He is a top player with very high costs, the boy has given up on lots of money to come to Rome. Time will tell if we have the chance to keep players like that</p>

  <p><b>[Gianluca Petrachi admits permanent Smalling deal with <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> but will let on-loan defender decide]</b> There is a chance. The player will choose what to do. If he really wishes, we will be happy to have him with us permanently. We are very happy with Smalling and he knows it. With <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, the relationship is excellent, we have an excellent feeling with the club<br /><br />The boy is charismatic. He loves Rome and the Italian lifestyle. Smalling finds himself very peaceful in Rome, lives comfortably and has returned to great levels. He follows an Italian course to improve his grasp of the language. This made me very happy because it shows that the boy is intelligent. Technically he is very strong. I think it is fundamental for a sporting director to understand how some players can do well. I thought this move could work and I’m happy that the results prove me right<br /><br /><b>[Petrachi played a leading role in identifying Smalling as a top target for <a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> in the summer of 2019]</b> My characteristic has always been to choose guys with determination and desire to do well. Smalling wanted to demonstrate his strength. My goal is to make people play better and create harmony around them. He needed that. I was looking for an aggressive central defender to support a young man like Gianluca Mancini. Smalling was perfect for my football idea to help Mancini to grow rapidly. Smalling is a serious and professional guy, a good person</p>
