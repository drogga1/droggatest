  <p><b>[Andrew Cole laments lack of black coaches]</b> There’s always been something put in front of you. You’ve got to get through the barrier, start again and something is always thrown at you..<br /><br />People looking at what I achieved in the game might say: ‘why am I not in coaching?’; that I’ve got too much to offer. I might believe I’ve got too much to offer but can I go through that system that a lot of the guys have been through? I don’t think I can. I said to myself I think there’s going to be far too many obstacles for me. I’m at Manchester United working in an ambassador role. I’m fortunate that they’ve been able to do that for me. Other players who are black and ethnic minority might struggle getting into one of those kinds of roles. It’s very, very tough<br /><br /><b>[For Cole there remains an old boys network in the English management game]</b> Unfortunately, that’s the way it goes. We try and deal with it as best as we can do. It’s not nice to lose your job at any level. Not being able to get back on the merry-go-round so to speak when you do lose your job that’s a bitter pill to swallow. I would like to see we should all be judged as equals. Forget the colour of your skin. ‘He’s my best mate that’s why I’m giving him the job…’ for me that’s wrong straightaway. If he’s not the right man for the job, or credible enough or you don’t think he’s a good enough coach he can’t have the job. Let’s put the best man for the job in. Until we start changing things like that we’re going to be stuck in a time warp<br /><br />Everyone goes in believing they might be the one and rightly so. I’m no different to anybody else. I’d like to change things as well. When they do go in and find how difficult it is, a lot of them turn around and say it’s not for me and end up doing something else which is naturally very disappointing. Generations are lost<br /><br />There’s loads of ex-black players that would love management or would love to coach. They might have the same thought process as me. I want to see the people who’ve played before me be given the opportunity. If I look at those people who have gone before me given the opportunity then I would consider it. Some fantastic black players before me tried their hand at management but have been knocked back for whatever reason. Until I see changes do I see any point in doing it? I don’t know<br /><br />When people talk about the Rooney law I scratch my head. Quotas, targets, it’s still a farce. If people want to do things, they’ll do it. That’s the world we live in. We can all have an interview. But what does that interview actually mean? It doesn’t mean a lot. We can all sit down and speak as individuals but it’s only an interview<br /><br />Fair enough in the last 12 months there might have been a little progress. But we’re not talking 12 months. We’re talking about a numerous amount of years. Twelve months is good to go by in their eyes but I can’t see it. Twenty black managers? I don’t think it’s going to happen in my lifetime. I would be very surprised<br /><br />At the lower level, it’s tougher. The lower level gets disregarded a little bit more because not as much of the limelight is on it.<br /><br />It would have been easier for a European black ex-player to come into England and get a managerial position than a British-born player who’s played in the Premier League to get a manager position. For me it made no difference. Black is black, whatever club he’s played for previously for it still equates to the same skin colour. But they looked at it as a bit more glitz and glamour around that<br /><br />I’ve always said if I have the opportunity to work with the younger generation I’d never turn it down. If people believe I’m good enough to give something back to the younger generation of course I’m going to do it. If I said no I’d believe I was being selfish. Knowing my struggle to get to the highest level, how tough it’s been, if I could help someone else to get to that level I’d do it all day long<br /><br />Those guys went in with their eyes open, they were fortunate enough to get jobs, they’ve all done well in those jobs. I’m not going to stand here and say those situations would have been denied to me. I don’t know because I never put myself in that position<br /><br />When black players play at the highest level what they expect is to be given the same opportunity as their white counterparts. It’s as simple as that. Where we find difficulty in leaving the game and trying to get into coaching and trying to get into management, it’s very disappointing.<br /><br />When you see so many black ex players turn their back on football everyone asks the question why have you done that. It speaks volumes if you’re not given the opportunity. People need to open their minds. We’re not just black players or black coaches. We’re individuals. I never thought of my manager or coach as a white coach or a manager. I thought he’s my coach, he’s my manager. The perception about us is totally different. Until the mindset changes on individuals then we’re stuck</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United striker Andrew Cole has backed Anthony Martial to become a world-class talent at Old Trafford]</b> If you look at the talent that kid’s got, it’s absolutely frightening. He’s got great feet, scores goals and creates goals. He’s had his ups and downs with the manager already but I think he just wants the arm around the shoulder - a bit of loving and you’ll definitely get the best out of him. I’m hoping he is going to be there a long time.</p>

  <p><b>[Romelu Lukaku has impressed for Manchester United]</b> I think what he’s appreciated now, being at Manchester United, is that it’s not possible for him to take a weekend off - because every game is intense. Maybe at Everton he could have taken a weekend off and still nicked a goal but at United everyone wants to beat you and I think he’s realised the level of intensity that’s required. The magnifying glass is always on the centre-forward at United and I think it’s fallen on him ­massively this season. He’s not had too much rest, he’s played virtually every match and not had much time to recover, because of the injury to Zlatan Ibrahimovic. But he’s done really well. He came with a big price-tag, but he’s done well. It’s not been an easy first ­season. There’s been a lot of ­pressure on him with Zlatan injured and Marcus Rashford in and out, so he’s been the only recognised centre-forward. But you can’t take anything away from what he’s done since he arrived. He’s scored goals, which is his job. Being one goal away, if he gets it at the weekend or he doesn’t, he’s going to get there at some stage because he’s been good enough to score 100 goals in the Premier League.<br /><br />He got one against Chelsea but that question is still going to be thrown at him… that he’s not scored enough against the big teams. When you play against Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and City, those games are naturally tighter because they’re the better teams and your chances are maybe more limited. If you get a half-chance, you have to take it. He’s going to take a lot of flak at United because that’s the nature of being at such a big club. He said he doesn’t feel he’s given enough credit but he’s got to take it on the chin because that’s what happens. You just have to get your head down</p>
