  <p><b>[Riyad Mahrez’s self-imposed exile after failing to secure a move to Manchester City leaves him running the risk of not getting paid]</b> It’s about practicalities. If he’s not in at the club he won’t be paid. Footballers want to play. At the moment that’s not the situation and in the past we have resolved such situations. Mahrez has been unsettled by approaches. He’s a human being. We’re ready to act if we’re called in. We offered our services last week to the club but I’ve not heard anything back.<br /><br />You can’t get a solution by telling people who’s wrong. I’m not saying it’s a culture which can be embraced but it’s reality, it’s what happens. The game is all about dealing with players and clubs in a practical manner. He needs to get into the right frame of mind for both the club and the player</p>

  <p><b>[How much does Gordon Taylor earn?]</b> I don’t see why I have to defend it. It is decided by the players as a salary for their union leader.<br /><br />Why is it a problem if you get a good salary because you are a trade union leader as opposed to a captain of industry? Mine pales into insignificance compared to the bankers’</p>

  <p><b>[Gordon Taylor insists <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players are not stupid in the row over pay cuts]</b> I found it astonishing that Matt Hancock could come out like that when he’s got his own issues with trying to get the necessary protective health equipment for our NHS workers and didn’t have the tests in place either. I think if the clubs can’t do that <b>[provide details on where the money will go]</b> and explain the position fully then they have every right to expect players to mistrust what is happening<br /><br /><b>[On whether players were concerned about that point specifically]</b> Exactly that. They want the complete due diligence. They’re not stupid. They’ve not just got their brains in their feet. They want to know the reasons for it and where it’s going</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> chief executive Gordon Taylor has no plans to cut £2m-a-year salary]</b> The <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> will make donations and the <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> is involved in the players’ charity. At the moment the <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> position is that we will continue to be paying all our staff of over 60 in full<br /><br />What <b>[the players]</b> are saying is that it needs every club in its own locality to work things out for themselves - you can’t have one suit fitting all sizes because there is such a variance in income and expenditure<br /><br />It needs to be round the table with all the facts revealed and then I can assure you that players will come to a position that is mindful about keeping their club alive and in good health as well as their jobs alive</p>

  <p><b>[Gordon Taylor criticised the government of the United Kingdom for putting <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players into a corner]</b> <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players felt that they were being put into a corner - particularly by government. They also saw the irony that even if they took a pay cut <b>[…]</b> that money would be lost to the government … and that would be counterproductive<br /><br />Players are prepared to play their part. They were concerned that they were being put into a corner to take cuts, when we’ve always worked on wage deferrals<br /><br />I find it quite extraordinary that government doesn’t realise - and it should do, because of what the game puts back into the economy, the money that football spends on its community initiatives, the tax it pays. And just to highlight footballers when there are many other sportsmen, bankers, hedge funds - I could give you a long list of people in jobs for life whose income is more. Footballers have reached the top of a mountain that has took a long, long time to climb - and they get what they deserve<br /><br />For us, we want to help in the best way possible and getting money to the right places is a massive thing. It took a lot of time, a lot of conversations between the players and we came to a decision that this was the best way to do it. The club have supported that, so everyone is happy. You can get some backlash if you try to help but don’t do it in the best way possible, so we wanted to take our time with the decision, and we did that</p>

  <p><b>[Gordon Taylor has revealed playing less than 45 minutes per half has been proposed ahead of the return of football in England]</b> We don’t know the future, what we do know is what propositions have been put, what ideas have been put, the possibility of having more substitutes, games possibly not being the full 45 minutes each way. We’ve talked of neutral stadiums, there’s lots of things been put forward, try and wait and see what the proposals are and then have the courtesy to let the managers and coaches and players come to a considered view<br /><br />I wouldn’t expect games to be played, if everything was positive and promising, you wouldn’t be thinking of matches being played until around about the middle of June<br /><br /><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> striker <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> said players are scared to return]</b> Sergio is a top-class player and is entitled to his opinion of course. It’s not a question of being scared, it’s a question of being fully informed and for the relevant authorities to try and make sure it’s as safe as it possibly can be to return, and to pick out any particular statements or choose any parts of that process is not really fair until we’ve looked at the whole menu<br /><br />They are professional sportsmen and professional sportswomen and of course they are concerned about their own safety, they are not stupid and neither are they naive, so they have to be satisfied that it is safe to return and it is their choice</p>

  <p><b>[Gordon Taylor says <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players do not want to be seen as guinea pigs in the Project Restart plan]</b> It’s never easy when we’ve had over six weeks of being told to stay inside, and the next minutes it’s the start of what’s being perceived as the easing of these restrictions. The players don’t want to be seen as guinea pigs and that will apply to everyone in professional sport. It’s about getting the balance of safety and also trying to get back to normality as much as possible<br /><br /><b>[Asked about the issue of protecting BAME players]</b> We need to make sure our BAME players are properly protected if there is an incidence of higher rates with those players. We need to give everyone confidence that every single safety measure has been taken on their behalf<br /><br />Thinking about returning to training, it’s going to be a staged process. There’s going to be five steps and it’s caution all the way. We’ll put our toe back into the water as things are eased back in, mindful that there could be a backbite and that’s where the medical experts come in</p>
