  <p><b>[<a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>’s Thomas Delaney has backed his side to learn from their mistakes in the 2018-19 season]</b> We had moments <b>[last]</b> season where we didn’t hit our level. We had moments when we had a lot of pressure on us, and we didn’t come through, and that’s something we need to improve on. With the young players we have, we’ll only get better, and you only learn by failing. In some regard, we did. You can’t just train for big matches. You have to feel them, you have to make mistakes, You have to do great things in order to learn. When I arrived, the club had a plan. They wanted to improve and get back to the top of the table. They had a good team, but they had had a disappointing season before that. <b>[The new signings]</b> is just another sign that the management knows what they’re doing and they’re preparing, and I welcome that. There will always be competition, and that’s only for the benefit of the team, so I see that as a major plus<br /><br /><b>[On whether <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> will push <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> all the way]</b> Of course. We want to stay up there. What matters most is a top-four finish, and then we’ll see what happens. I have high hopes for us. We have the confidence, we have learned some lessons, we have improved with the new players, and even played together as a team more, so I’m very optimistic</p>

  <p><b>[Thomas Delaney, <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a>’s former team-mate at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>, believes the American will bring an X-Factor to England following his £58million switch to Stamford Bridge]</b> Yeah, I’m pretty sure he will be a success. He’s got big shoes to fill in terms of Eden Hazard, of course, but as far as I know him, he’s a hungry player with a high level, and it seems like he has the support from the manager and the club, which every player needs. This guy can pull things out of the hat at any time, which is always a great skill to have. I think the Premier League will enjoy him<br /><br />Christian is an amazing player and he did well for us. He had a difficult last half-year I think, because he’d already signed for Chelsea. We will miss him, because he has that X-factor. I don’t know too many players that can get away from three defenders like him. But we have a wider squad now, with some big quality and the hope now is that we are able to cope when players are out, and still have that quality in the team.<br /><br />Just the presence alone is something big. I have played against him many times, and his expression is just that of a winner. He wears himself very, very well on the pitch, and that’s contagious, it spreads to the other players. And in terms of his qualities as a footballer, we don’t need to say anything about that. He’s a very good signing for us<br /><br />When we hit our top level, we play very decent football. But we want to be more stable. The people want to see offensive football, of course, and we enjoy playing that way, but last season we had some problems with keeping clean sheets. We didn’t let in many goals, but if you want to be champions then you have to be very sharp in that department. In that regard, Mats is a big signing<br /><br />We weren’t happy with what we did in Europe last year. We lost it all in 20 minutes in London, really. We want to take the next step this season and keep competing in the Bundesliga as well, that’s the target. The new players have been very good. Most of them have already played in the Bundesliga before, of course, so they know us and we know them, which is always beneficial. A lot of people know how we want to play football, the style we have, and we have signed some top players. They have all settled in well and we’ve enjoyed welcoming them into the squad. We want to improve. Of course it’s nice to play every game, but we need that competition. We need new energy in the team, new skills, because we want to improve on last season. We did good last season, but not good enough.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>’s Thomas Delaney has played down the impact he had in his side’s 4-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday]</b> I’m not <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, I can’t dribble as nicely as he does, so I have to do other things on the pitch. It’s a good performance if I win a lot of duels and play good short passes<br /><br /><b>[For Delaney, he feels the impressive win over Leverkusen puts the German outfit in a good frame of mind ahead of the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> showdown]</b> I don’t want to say that Leverkusen are <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, but the game today was a good test for us. Leverkusen are one of the teams in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> who play the most beautiful football. We needed a good performance and I think we played well defensively today as well. There have been long periods without the ball, but we have moved very well. That may also be important against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. We are now feeling confident<br /><br /><b>[Delaney is also looking forward to locking horns with the four-time European champions in midweek]</b> I played against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> a couple of years ago. At that time we played at home and drew 1-1 - that was not bad<br /><br /><b>[The victory over Leverkusen was even more important after the shock defeat to relegation candidates Union Berlin just before the international break]</b> We all know that it was disappointing in Berlin. You can not do that often in a season if you want to become the league winners. For that we needed a great performance today. It was really a great day</p>

  <p><b>[Team-mate Thomas Delaney says <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> is feeling the pressure of expectations at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>]</b> Clearly, one of the biggest talents that I’ve played with. With that talent comes a lot of pressure and I think he slowly starts to feel that from the England national team and clubs surrounding him now. Up until this point he’s been a talent performing very well, performing better than what he is expected to do but there was always going to be a next step and that’s going to be interesting. Next step in his career and his development. Only looking at his skills, he definitely has what it takes to become one of the five biggest players in the world. You see big talents go to waste and I would say that he’s already done enough to prove himself. He’s 19 and he’s got the most goal involvement in the league together with <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> and <b>[Robert]</b> <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a> which is amazing but he should strive for more.<br /><br /><b>[Delaney went on to praise <a href="erling-haland.html">Erling Haaland</a> and <a href="giovanni-reyna.html">Gio Reyna</a>, two more youngsters who have made a big impact since arriving at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>]</b> I see a young man <b>[<a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a>]</b> that does everything to improve. This guy is annoying sometimes because everything has to be on point with more training and eating better. I think he’s benefited from having people around him, especially his dad, that knows how things work in football. With Erling, I don’t even have to mention the stats. With Gio as well, just coming in, an American kid last year, travelled a lot back and forth and still has his breakthrough to come but he’s a player you can expect more from him because in training he’s on a level</p>
