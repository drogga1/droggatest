  <p><b>[Borussia Dortmund midfielder Thomas Delaney does not believe there is a crisis at Bayern Munich]</b> I think we only have to go back one year and we will see the same situation for Bayern Munich. It is too early to say that <b>[there is a crisis]</b>. I wouldn’t stand here and say that we now go for the title. Of course, we have done well. We have sometimes been a little bit lucky, we had the results with us. But in the end, we are a new team, there are a lot of new guys, a lot of young guys, a new coach, but we are very satisfied so far.<br /><br />It’s good. It’s a different level. It’s been challenging. You talk a lot about how it’s easier to play football for a good team, but there is also more expected from you. I feel that. There are very good players there. We have an 18-year-old who plays for the England national team in Jadon Sancho, Christian Pulisic has 100 games in the Bundesliga and is just 20-years-old. We have an amazing bunch of not only young guys, but young guys with great talent<br /><br />It is difficult. You see a lot of rotation due to the talent we have. If you look at the holding six-eight position, we maybe have four players who are more or less equal and more or less in the same boat not just in their own personal opinion but by the club, and they all think they should play because of what they have done. You have <b>[Mahmoud]</b> Dahoud, you have <b>[Julian]</b> Weigl who have both been dominant in the league. You have <b>[Axel]</b> Witsel who plays in the Belgium national team and me, and we’re a little bit older. It’s a tough situation, but it’s very nice to be a part of</p>

  <p><b>[Jadon Sancho is a great player]</b> You can see straight away that he is a great player. He plays with a lot of joy - he is a very positive player. He doesn’t see boundaries, he sees opportunities, and you see that in his style of play. He is always seeking a challenge, always a one versus one or one versus two. I am sure he will be a bright star in the future. He is very relaxed as a person. There is big pressure at a club like Dortmund, but maybe he has come at the right moment where maybe there is not that expectation to win a trophy, but to build the team. From my own experience, a national team is a little bit different than playing league football, but he is performing at Dortmund, and that gives you every tool in the box to perform at international level. He is 18 years old, and it’s crazy to say that you expect so much of him to perform in the national team, but I am sure he will. If not now, then later, because he is such a big talent.</p>

  <p><b>[England have been accused by Borussia Dortmund midfielder Thomas Delaney of hyping players such as Jadon Sancho]</b> Jadon is a big, big talent and with talent comes opportunities and he has them for sure. But he is still 18 years old and he’s done amazingly at the moment but I think he’s not where he is supposed to be. He’s a rough diamond and he’ll get there. I feel a bit of responsibility for keeping him on the ground because I know, now we are here in England, you are world famous for hyping your own players. So we try to keep him on the ground because no doubt he has a big, big future in front of him. He’ll make great things but it takes hard work, it’s taking everything seriously and trusting the process because he’s very young.<br /><br />He hasn’t told us much. I personally, and I think my team-mates, don’t have to prepare for a game like that against Tottenham. We see the players, we all know these guys, so there’s nothing to prepare for that in that regard. They are all well known players with a high level</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>’s Thomas Delaney has backed his side to learn from their mistakes in the 2018-19 season]</b> We had moments <b>[last]</b> season where we didn’t hit our level. We had moments when we had a lot of pressure on us, and we didn’t come through, and that’s something we need to improve on. With the young players we have, we’ll only get better, and you only learn by failing. In some regard, we did. You can’t just train for big matches. You have to feel them, you have to make mistakes, You have to do great things in order to learn. When I arrived, the club had a plan. They wanted to improve and get back to the top of the table. They had a good team, but they had had a disappointing season before that. <b>[The new signings]</b> is just another sign that the management knows what they’re doing and they’re preparing, and I welcome that. There will always be competition, and that’s only for the benefit of the team, so I see that as a major plus<br /><br /><b>[On whether <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> will push <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> all the way]</b> Of course. We want to stay up there. What matters most is a top-four finish, and then we’ll see what happens. I have high hopes for us. We have the confidence, we have learned some lessons, we have improved with the new players, and even played together as a team more, so I’m very optimistic</p>

  <p><b>[Thomas Delaney, <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a>’s former team-mate at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>, believes the American will bring an X-Factor to England following his £58million switch to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>]</b> Yeah, I’m pretty sure he will be a success. He’s got big shoes to fill in terms of <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a>, of course, but as far as I know him, he’s a hungry player with a high level, and it seems like he has the support from the manager and the club, which every player needs. This guy can pull things out of the hat at any time, which is always a great skill to have. I think <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> will enjoy him<br /><br />Christian is an amazing player and he did well for us. He had a difficult last half-year I think, because he’d already signed for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. We will miss him, because he has that X-factor. I don’t know too many players that can get away from three defenders like him. But we have a wider squad now, with some big quality and the hope now is that we are able to cope when players are out, and still have that quality in the team.<br /><br />Just the presence alone is something big. I have played against him many times, and his expression is just that of a winner. He wears himself very, very well on the pitch, and that’s contagious, it spreads to the other players. And in terms of his qualities as a footballer, we don’t need to say anything about that. He’s a very good signing for us<br /><br />When we hit our top level, we play very decent football. But we want to be more stable. The people want to see offensive football, of course, and we enjoy playing that way, but last season we had some problems with keeping clean sheets. We didn’t let in many goals, but if you want to be champions then you have to be very sharp in that department. In that regard, Mats is a big signing<br /><br />We weren’t happy with what we did in Europe last year. We lost it all in 20 minutes in London, really. We want to take the next step this season and keep competing in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> as well, that’s the target. The new players have been very good. Most of them have already played in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> before, of course, so they know us and we know them, which is always beneficial. A lot of people know how we want to play football, the style we have, and we have signed some top players. They have all settled in well and we’ve enjoyed welcoming them into the squad. We want to improve. Of course it’s nice to play every game, but we need that competition. We need new energy in the team, new skills, because we want to improve on last season. We did good last season, but not good enough.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>’s Thomas Delaney has played down the impact he had in his side’s 4-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday]</b> I’m not <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, I can’t dribble as nicely as he does, so I have to do other things on the pitch. It’s a good performance if I win a lot of duels and play good short passes<br /><br /><b>[For Delaney, he feels the impressive win over Leverkusen puts the German outfit in a good frame of mind ahead of the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> showdown]</b> I don’t want to say that Leverkusen are <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, but the game today was a good test for us. Leverkusen are one of the teams in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> who play the most beautiful football. We needed a good performance and I think we played well defensively today as well. There have been long periods without the ball, but we have moved very well. That may also be important against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. We are now feeling confident<br /><br /><b>[Delaney is also looking forward to locking horns with the four-time European champions in midweek]</b> I played against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> a couple of years ago. At that time we played at home and drew 1-1 - that was not bad<br /><br /><b>[The victory over Leverkusen was even more important after the shock defeat to relegation candidates Union Berlin just before the international break]</b> We all know that it was disappointing in Berlin. You can not do that often in a season if you want to become the league winners. For that we needed a great performance today. It was really a great day</p>

  <p><b>[Team-mate Thomas Delaney says <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> is feeling the pressure of expectations at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>]</b> Clearly, one of the biggest talents that I’ve played with. With that talent comes a lot of pressure and I think he slowly starts to feel that from the England national team and clubs surrounding him now. Up until this point he’s been a talent performing very well, performing better than what he is expected to do but there was always going to be a next step and that’s going to be interesting. Next step in his career and his development. Only looking at his skills, he definitely has what it takes to become one of the five biggest players in the world. You see big talents go to waste and I would say that he’s already done enough to prove himself. He’s 19 and he’s got the most goal involvement in the league together with <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> and <b>[Robert]</b> <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a> which is amazing but he should strive for more.<br /><br /><b>[Delaney went on to praise <a href="erling-haland.html">Erling Haaland</a> and <a href="giovanni-reyna.html">Gio Reyna</a>, two more youngsters who have made a big impact since arriving at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>]</b> I see a young man <b>[<a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a>]</b> that does everything to improve. This guy is annoying sometimes because everything has to be on point with more training and eating better. I think he’s benefited from having people around him, especially his dad, that knows how things work in football. With Erling, I don’t even have to mention the stats. With Gio as well, just coming in, an American kid last year, travelled a lot back and forth and still has his breakthrough to come but he’s a player you can expect more from him because in training he’s on a level</p>
