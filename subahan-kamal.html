  <p><b>[Selangor FA up in arms over state government’s asset grab]</b> The complex has been taken over, we can’t use the facilities. We then took the step of sending a letter <b>[to the state]</b> asking that the complex be handed back to FAS. However, they wrote us back saying that the state’s executive committee has declined to do so. I think this is an utterly heartless action.<br /><br />When Selangor win trophies everyone wants a chance at lifting it, but no one wants to look after the welfare of FAS. We are not asking for much, just our own place to run our operations and for the team to practice</p>

  <p><b>[Improved professionalism the aim of FAS president Subahan Kamal]</b> My priority is not to win titles, it is to put the house in order. My aim is to get a new office for FAS to replace our run down current headquarters, and a proper training ground. The current FAS executive committee <b>[exco]</b> members are professionals. I am an accountant by profession. Although I used to be a lawmaker, I am not involved in politics anymore. The team is already being professionally run<br /><br />We have began discussions with Deloitte to work with us, to look into our finances. That means looking for excess spending, how to implement sustainable spending, accounting flows and processes. We are behaving very professionally<br /><br />All the exco members, we are all businessmen, we use our own money. You cannot run a football team on this basis, you need long-term planning. This is not something new, this has been the way it’s done for a long time. The previous presidents and vice-presidents have always forked out their own money. But this should stop, and at the same time so does the dependence on state funding. We need to find our own funds. This year we will look into how to start financing FAS on a long-term basis<br /><br />The issue with Zainal <b>[former head coach Zainal Abidin Hassan’s termination and severance pay]</b> has been solved. The player salaries for November 2016 that they <b>[state government]</b> should have made, have all been paid by us<br /><br />God willing, on the 100th day mark I will call all the press, affiliates and fans to table my 100th day action plan. We will reveal our plans, direction and how we will run the association<br /><br /><b>[On the status of the Red Giants’ AFC Club Licensing application status]</b> There are no issues there. We have complied with 85% of the requirements. That is the least worry that Selangor have. We should be able to comply fully</p>

  <p><b>[Dato Sri Subahan Kamal has vented his frustration at the seemingly continuous chorus of dissatisfaction over the Malaysia national team]</b> I see the Lebanon game as a tough one. I hope the critics understands that we at FAM, we have a new president who has taken a huge responsibility to be the head of the management of the national team. The role of HRH is not for himself but for all the Malaysian fans, to give pride back into the national team.<br /><br />The critics out there are only good at criticising. This is the time when they actually should throw their support for the new president. Rather than just criticising, they should give their support to the new president to make the changes. But such is the way it is, this is the syndrome that is happening in Malaysian football. I dare to speak because i’ve been one of the longest managers of the national team.<br /><br />The choice of the president is correct and I don’t doubt the quality of Nelo even though I’ve only been with him for a short time. He’s a coach that has a lot of experience and he’s the kind of approachable coach and players are comfortable with that. We hope to win but we have to understand that this is our first game. But what is sure is that after this game, Nelo together with Tan will be around to look at matches and see which players can fit into the team. Success will not come immediately and we’ll have to give the coach at least two years. In these two years, I’m confident that we’ll see big changes and we can further improve the rankings that we are at now</p>

  <p><b>[Selangor have fallen further from the Selangor state government’s grace]</b> We have sent a lawyer’s letter requesting that we be given back the training ground <b>[the new training complex]</b>, because it is by right ours. Last week we received a letter by the SUK pitch operator, stating that our President Cup and Youth Cup teams cannot train on the pitch anymore beginning June 1. Now we are working on it as the <b>[youth]</b> players are still on a break, but when they come back we will find them another pitch to train.<br /><br />This should not be happening, as the teams are the future of Selangor. For me, I want to see the President’s Cup boys getting promoted to the senior team next season. But when they evict us, where will we go? And I hope the same fate will not happen to the senior team soon. They <b>[state government]</b> are acting very immaturely and victimising us. It’s bad enough that they have stopped funding us, now they are booting us from the training pitch. I’m very disappointed.<br /><br />I’ve seen that the pitch at the new complex has been used by a private party, I was made to understand it is supposedly formed by a group of ex-players, to hold paid football lessons to children. It has been turned into a business, which is not right. Whereas for us, our plan is to work together with the National Football Development Programme <b>[NFDP]</b>, who will be our coaching partner in terms of junior development, and we won’t charge any fees. We intend to use the complex to develop young players, but they’ve taken it away from us rather heartlessly, taken away our current training pitch, barred us from returning to the stadium <b>[Shah Alam]</b>, and turned the new complex into a money-making scheme</p>

  <p><b>[Selangor president Subahan Kamal said that the club would try to fill half of the Shah Alam Stadium capacity, should they be allowed to return]</b> I’ve been informed by club secretary-general Mr. Rosman <b>[Ibrahim]</b> that MBSA has sent us a letter stating that our application has been postponed, pending the next state executive-committee meeting. This is utterly disappointing to us, but I guess the dream needs to wait a little longer.<br /><br />Even if they do not want to help us financially anymore, at least let us return to Shah Alam<br /><br />In terms of attendance, at Selayang we can get at least five or six thousand fans every match, our most loyal fanbase. God willing, if we return to Shah Alam our spirit will improve, the players will perform better, and we will try attracting a bigger crowd. Even if we can’t fill the Shah Alam Stadium, we’ll try to fill half of its capacity. And I had been hoping we could begin our Malaysia Cup campaign this year at our former home ground, but that’s not going to happen it seems. So the fans will have to make do with Selayang</p>

  <p><b>[Malaysia team manager Datuk Seri Subahan Kamal has revealed that the Malaysian FA has planned three friendlies for the Malayan Tigers ahead of their Asian Cup qualification group match against Hong Kong]</b> There are a few test matches that the national team department is arranging. Rest assured that the one that is confirmed is an away match on the 25th <b>[August]</b>, against Macau. On the 26th we will be flying off to Yangon, Myanmar and on the 29th we will play Myanmar. Then we will come back and have a short Aidiladha break on the first <b>[of September]</b>, the boys will come back on the second, and we will have the game <b>[against Hong Kong]</b> at the Hang Jebat Stadium in Melaka on the fifth of September.<br /><br />We’re trying to talk to Syria to get them to play against us on the 22nd, so coach Nelo <b>[Malaysia head coach Nelo Vingada]</b> has three matches <b>[before the Hong Kong match]</b><br /><br />On the 14th <b>[of August]</b> the team will arrive for the central training camp in Melaka. This time Melaka will host it as most of the stadiums in Kuala Lumpur will be occupied by the SEA Games which will end on the 30th<br /><br />Macau is ranked lower than us <b>[in the FIFA ranking]</b>, but last year we played them also in Melaka and it ended in a 0-0 draw. So we can compare. Also, Macau and Hong Kong are near, I have been to both countries and the football is not too different. Myanmar are also good, and they too played against us last year. We will then have two references according to the results. Syria will be tough, but it will be a challenge to build our capacity. Syria have not been able to play at home, but they drew against Iran, they beat Uzbekistan, and drew against China</p>

  <p><b>[The Selangor FA has issued a plea to the Selangor state government to help out with the Red Giants’ finances for the season]</b> Today I’ve been informed that the Selangor has <b>[RM]</b> 4 billion in reserves. Can’t they help us out? Last year they funded us to the tune of RM 25 million, this year we’re only asking for 5 million. I’ve slashed this year’s budget to RM 15 million, and we’re only asking for a third of this amount. What’s 5 million to the 4 billion in reserves?<br /><br />It’s not fair, not to me, but to the players who have been playing their hearts out. I salute them, such as Razman <b>[Roslan]</b>, Raimi <b>[Noor]</b>, Amri <b>[Yahyah]</b>, and even Azhan <b>[Khairul Azhan Khalid]</b> who gave their best for the state, which I appreciate<br /><br /><b>[When asked whether state funding is the right way to go in the midst of the M-League push for increased professionalism]</b> You tell me which club in this country is not funded by the state? Every club in the country is funded by the state. Some get 100 percent, some receive 70%. But at Selangor we’re moving away from that. We don’t want to be dependent on the state, but <b>[it’s hard]</b> if you cut the funding from RM 25 million to zero overnight. We’re not complaining, but we’re hoping for some token amount. If they can’t give us the five million, then give us three <b>[million]</b>. But rightfully, we’ve already been self-funding. We’ve been running the association without any assistance for seven months. Hopefully within this one or two years, we should be self-funded and get proper corporate sponsorships<br /><br />We really hope that somebody will come forward, to help us and see how you can support us. We’re running the team well, and we’ve surprised many even with the financial constraints. I am not ashamed as the FAS president, to plead so that somebody will come forward to <b>[financially]</b> support the Red Giants</p>

  <p><b>[Selangor president Subahan Kamal is not concerned with the departure of the Red Giants’ star players to other clubs]</b> We’ve got a large pool of talent, we never fail to unearth them. Even if our players are scouted by other players, we are happy. We have good people here like Mr Omar <b>[Omar Ali, introduced as the technical director in the press conference]</b>, Rauf <b>[team manager Abdul Rauf Ahmad]</b>, their job is to develop <b>[young]</b> talents. Even our President’s Cup and Youth Cup teams are doing well, and we have a pool of talent. We are a factory.<br /><br />I believe that next year, having a few young talents, we will be banking on more young players. Because the Malaysian FA <b>[FAM]</b> is facing an issue now, for example Vingada <b>[Malaysia head coach Nelo Vingada]</b> recently said that the country doesn’t have strikers. We will take the lead, Selangor will see how we can support <b>[the country]</b> by having more local players play in the league. Maybe we will not win titles but it’s okay, we will sacrifice for the country. We will make sure we have enough strikers. We hope one day they will be a good Selangor striker, a local boy who will be able to score goals like what Vingada is expecting</p>
