  <p><b>[Real Madrid are interested in Igor Gomes but Sao Paulo have received no official approach for the midfielder]</b> There was no official approach from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> or any other club. What we do know is that <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> knows and follows Igor, just as they certainly follow many other young talents around the world, including in our own squad. Also due to the possibility that Igor could get a Portuguese passport in the next six months, which would mean he would not take up a foreign player spot in a European club. But there is nothing going on<br /><br />Since the signing of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> <b>[by Corinthians in 2008]</b>, there have been many signings in Brazilian football that many people did not believe in in the beginning, and then they become viable. But I think the big difference, what we have to make very clear, is that at the moment there is nothing</p>

  <p><b>[Sao Paulo director Alexandre Passaro said they have not yet been notified that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> wish to purchase Maia]</b> Whether he will go to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or not, we can’t be sure, because they have until June 30 to notify us and they still haven’t. The last time I spoke to them they said everything is very uncertain. <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> set the restart of games for June 11. Who knows, they may give us a signal in the next 30 days to find out whether Maia is going or not</p>
