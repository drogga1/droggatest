  <p><b>[Arsenal don’t need Alexis Sanchez]</b> Arsenal don’t need Sanchez, especially if Mkhitaryan comes. Here’s the conundrum. Will they tie down <b>[Mesut]</b> Ozil? If Ozil doesn’t sign then Mkhitaryan is really that playmaker. But Ozil and Mkhitaryan in the same team - can it work? I think there is going to have to be a serious plan of how to shore up that central midfield area because Arsenal can be gung-ho. They can leave the midfield wide open so there has to be some groundwork - a defensive player in there to be able to combat and compliment those two players<br /><br /><b>[On Alexandre Lacazette’s signing]</b> You’re going to have to <b>[play them all]</b> because if they come to the club they are going to have to play. You can fit them in but you have to organise the back four and the midfield defensively. You need world-class players. You need a world-class centre-half and a world-class defensive midfielder in order to compliment those world-class players</p>

  <p><b>[Aaron Ramsey may be yet to commit his future to Arsenal but the midfielder ‘ticks a lot of boxes’ when it comes to choosing the club’s next captain]</b> You’ve got to look at the time and the players who were there. The leader had to be strong and had to be someone who was fierce and fearless. Because as a team we were fierce and fearless. So your leader couldn’t be soft. Your leader had to be tough and a permanent member of that squad. But for the last four, five years, Arsenal went soft, and it’s showed itself in the league standings. Aaron Ramsey ticks quite a lot of boxes <b>[as captain]</b>. He’s one of the longest-serving players in the first team. If there’s a structure, Aaron Ramsey could be that guy. But I wouldn’t put it past Unai Emery going out and finding a player that fits his criteria, who can come in and lead the football club.<br /><br />If you don’t see a captain type figure within that club, then you have to go out and recruit one. They need experience and toughness. Because that is everything that Arsenal have lacked. That experience and that toughness and being able to go away and grind out a victory at one of your rivals, Arsenal haven’t done that in years. So that type of experience and knowledge is key.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal have been urged to snap up another centre-half this summer]</b> I’ve said it all along, he’s done okay at times but moving forward, I think Arsenal need a centre-back. I really think they do. Rob Holding I think is a very good player. He’s been out injured so he’s to come back. They need somebody there. <b>[Dominic]</b> <a href="dominic-calvert-lewin.html">Calvert-Lewin</a> caused too much trouble, on his own. They need a quick one.

  <p><b>[Arsenal have 10 players who aren’t good enough]</b> I think there’s probably 10 players who aren’t good enough. I’m not just blaming Mustafi for what happened at Crystal Palace because I think it was a team thing, although he made a mistake. There are 10 players who Arsenal really need to look at getting out of the club.<br /><br />I think the fans need to not fall for the name on the back of the shirt. What the fans have to do is see what the players do on the pitch and can they fight and have the desire for the club. It may not be a world-class name but we got showed up by Wolves and not many people knew who these Wolves players were at the start of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal should be looking to sell Mesut Ozil this summer]</b> If it was up to me, he’d be gone. I don’t think he can contribute enough to Arsenal. With the set-up and the way the Premier League is going, I don’t think he does enough. Is he a wonderfully gifted player? Of course he is. But the way his talent is going, he doesn’t do enough for me. On his wage, that could bring in four players. And it might be four versatile players. On one person’s wage you get four opportunities to improve the squad, that must take priority. More functional players get the better of Arsenal and are undoing them. That should never undo Arsenal because the club should have that in abundance. Arsenal haven’t had that type of player in recent years and they need to get that back</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal will be favouring functional players over star names]</b> I think Unai Emery knows what he wants already. He’s very meticulous in his planning and if I’ve gathered anything from listening to him and seeing how he prepares, he will know the targets he wants to attract. It may not be these star names, the world class players, but Arsenal could do with some functionality and being tough to beat and having players that will put a shift in. It’s not the name on the back of the shirt, it’s more the front of the shirt and the heart to get the team moving forward. Unai Emery is going to batten down the hatches and bring in an influx of players that are going to be functional for him<br /><br />He’s <b>[Emery]</b> going to need funds without a shadow of a doubt, it’s key to how well Arsenal do moving forward. We are going to find out if they want to compete not only by how much money is available, but how much backing he gets. This is a real crucial summer for Arsenal and if they want to compete in the next five years they have to get this transfer window right</p>

Laurent Koscienly has been a real servant to the club but he’s approaching veteran stage and needs to be replaced. <a href="nacho-monreal.html">Nacho Monreal</a> is 33 years old and not be getting any younger while it’s fair to say <a href="shkodran-mustafi.html">Shkodran Mustafi</a> hasn’t played well. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> need to solidify their defence.

I’m not saying I like defeats, I said I could take a defeat if the team perform and get beat. But when they don’t perform, and they’re not performing, and they’re throwing away leads on a regular basis, for me, sorry, there’s got to be change and there’s got to be change now.<br /><br />As far as I was concerned, the board would need to act now to rectify and to steer the ship in the right direction because the players to me look as though they’re not focused - they’re unfocused. They look like they haven’t got that togetherness, like you see with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>.<br /><br />Even though they’re 3-0 down, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> are grafting, they know exactly what to do, they’re sticking to the game plan. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> look like they’ve got no game plan.

  <p><b>[<a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> would’ve been Kevin Campbell’s first choice as <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> boss]</b> I’ll be honest with you, <b>[<a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a>]</b> wasn’t my first choice. I went for the <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> thing because of the way he sets his team up and the discipline of his teams. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> lacked so much discipline before then that I just wanted someone to come in and bolt this thing down and get defensive again and not conceding goals<br /><br />When <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> came in I said ‘I’m going to give him a chance, definitely, let’s see what he can do’. And I’ve been really impressed, from his first interview where he said there’s no easy rides and there’s some things you have to do, the players have to do, you have to run, you have to tackle, you have to love the shirt and we have to build a bond with the fans. That for me as an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fan meant a lot. These are the basics but you think it’s normal - it isn’t normal, especially in that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> team.<br /><br />So I’m really impressed with what <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a>’s doing, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are now playing on the front foot, he’s improved a lot of the players so far, the much-maligned defence is even keeping some clean sheets, which is fantastic for us. Two clean sheets, it was none before! So give me some clean sheets and I’ll take it. But the point I’m trying to make is he is actually making these players that were underachieving better. They still need addressing, I still think there’s stuff that needs to be addressed. Bringing this <a href="pablo-mari.html">Pablo Mari</a> in I think is excellent business</p>

He’s not the finished article, that’s for sure. But he’s proven that he can be a match winner and he’s a difference maker.

Probably one of the most important signings <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> has ever made. He’s the first manager in recent years who’s come in with a truly impressive track record.
