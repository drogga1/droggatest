<blockquote>
  <p>[historical Ajax backed to go all the way in the Champions League] A club without DNA or that doesn’t appreciate its history and brings it to the current setup then it doesn’t have much of a future<br /><br />Christian was a fantastic player, his ability on the ball was unquestionable, and it helped a lot that Frank de Boer was becoming the first team manager as he knew him from the academy very well. So they came together and grew together. He trusted him a lot and it’s a great boost when the coach trusts you so much. That was a big chance for him but the talent that Christian has, which he’s proved in Europe and for the national team, is something that you cannot miss. I think with him in the first team it made Ajax have a greater impression on the pitch<br /><br />Vertonghen was loaned out for a year and then he came back to Ajax, but came back to the club and proved himself to become the club’s captain at a young age, while Alderweireld came straight into the side. At the time Stam and Heitinga blocked the pathway but you could see when they were coming through that they had the physical and technical capacity to make it into the first team and it was just a case of deciding when it was the right time for them to take a step further - and that is the Ajax way<br /><br />I think it is connected to the culture and connected to the history. I think for them Johan Cruyff made the difference. Once you meet Johan and see the way he sees football, how he constructed this club, then you want to go back there and continue what he started as he’s a phenomenon. For them they grew up in the academy, they were part of one of the club’s greatest moments [winning the European Cup in 1995] and it’s normal for them to go back and continue to the ‘normal’ level for Ajax, this is how clubs should proceed, bringing back the successful players to connect to the younger generations. So to have this bridge it makes it possible<br /><br />You cannot anticipate this level of success in the Champions League, it is something else - even with such talented players it is tough. De Ligt was impressive, De Jong was great, they all were, and you knew they would be able to make the difference in any game at any moment. In the second team we scored more than 100 goals in the season, which shows their potential and we almost won the league with all these youngsters but you could not predict they would go this far in the Champions League<br /><br />I think at this point all the credit can go to Overmars, Van der Sar and the scouting department, who made these right choices, who bought these players like [Dusan] Tadic and [Nicolas] Tagliafico, Neres, [Andre] Onana before other clubs came in for them. They brought them and put them in the team in positions in which they didn’t have players coming through the academy. Now they play a style and a system which shows the best qualities of Ajax and has put them back among the top teams in Europe<br /><br />It is sad that you have to sell these players as you’re not at the level of Barcelona, so you can’t keep the players and next year you have to try and repeat the same performance when the fans are getting used to this level in Europe - but this is the Ajax business model. They have a lot of talent coming through and they need the chance to progress, so it has to be managed and coped with<br /><br />It is surprising if you look at the names and budgets that they have outplayed Real Madrid and Juventus and beat them away. But it is not surprising when you look at the games themselves, when you see how they play on the field, then I think Ajax could beat anyone at this point. They can beat Spurs and even if they make it to the final and play someone like Barcelona, everything is still possible</p>
