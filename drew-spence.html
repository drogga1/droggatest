  <p><b>[Drew Spence thinks that the club’s new signing <a href="sam-kerr.html">Sam Kerr</a> has settled in well]</b> She is a really chilled out girl and she has been with us for a couple of weeks now. She didn’t have a lot of sessions before playing that first game. She is waiting for that first goal to go in (which she has now scored) but I am sure when it does that she will feel calmer. She has fit in with everyone. We are a very relaxed group so it is probably the best team to go into. She is doing well in training, she has lightning pace to get in-behind and she is doing that already. She has settled in well</p>

  <p><b>[FA today categorically denied that the Sampson issue has anything to do with Drew Spence’s omission from the national team set-up]</b> Players are only ever picked on merit and all English players in the WSL are watched and considered for selection</p>

  <p><b>[When Chelsea’s Drew Spence eventually hangs up her boots, she’ll do so with few regrets]</b> Phil <b>[Neville, current England coach]</b> hasn’t spoken to me once. It’s a funny one really because I feel like I’ve deserved a chance, a least a chance to go to a camp or something like that. To not be given that chance makes me question, ‘Is it because of what happened?’ I think it is because of what happened if I’m totally honest. I think I’ve only been called in once since it happened and that was the camp straight after so that probably was to make them look good in the media. The reason why I didn’t speak out straight away was because I was worried, I was stressed at the time. There was a lot going on behind closed doors<br /><br />My main concern was whether it would affect me playing for my country. I’m happy with the decision I took, I didn’t speak out then, morally it wouldn’t have been right, but it is what it is. If I get a chance in the future then great, but if I don’t, I’m not losing any sleep over it. I’ve got a good career at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, we’re winning titles, we’re challenging every season, so I’m happy with my status at the moment. If I wasn’t winning trophies here maybe I would be more down about it. If I wasn’t at such a successful club maybe it would play on my mind a bit. But I’m really happy with where I am at this stage of my career. There’s so much more I want to achieve but I’ve just got to carry on working hard and see what happens<br /><br />If we don’t win it within the next two years, I feel like it’ll be a massive failure to be honest<br /><br />The team that we have at the moment can easily win the Champions League. I think everyone knows that. With the depth that we have, we should be challenging. Hopefully we can finish the season this year, get in the top two spots, and then next year it’s all guns blazing really<br /><br />I think it’s difficult for me because a lot of people always write me off. Every year, I’ve got to push myself. I know there’s going to be signings coming in every year. Emma’s made that clear every season really, to make sure that the squad is pushing again and pushing to another level. It’s just really believing in yourself and making sure <b>[you’re]</b> doing everything right in training every day and competing with the players that come in. I think at the beginning, I didn’t have as much confidence as I do in myself now, but thankfully Emma had that faith in me and just stuck by me. She was brutally honest and told me what I need to improve on. I think sometimes you just need honesty. I think that’s what I needed from a younger age. If you have someone that believes in you, but they’re also honest with you, I think that helps massively</p>
