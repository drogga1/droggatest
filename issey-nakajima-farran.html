  <p><b>[Canada international Issey Nakajima-Farran scored the equalising penalty in Terengganu’s 1-1 draw against Selangor]</b> It’s the first game in the Malaysia Cup, it’s a good result for us. It’s an away game against a Super League club, a big club that has very good experience in the cup. To get one point playing away from home is amazing, it’s big for us. And we’re only two games in with the new guys <b>[mid-season signings]</b>, so this is a good result for us.<br /><br />We have to plan and aim for which games we should be collecting points, because Malaysia Cup is about collecting points. It’s not a league competition, it’s a different style of points-accumulation. For this we should be focusing more on our performance rather than collecting points, but it’s a home game so hopefully we show a good performance. And if we squeeze in some points, it’ll be fantastic obviously, but it won’t be an easy game</p>

  <p><b>[Canada international Issey Nakajima-Farran had been the darling of the Terengganu fans when he arrived at the side in the 2015 mid-season transfer window]</b> There has been a lot of shit being said about me by the fans and the media. It has been a tough month for me, but I believe I’ve kept professional and kept my reactions to myself. There are haters everywhere. But I believe I’ve put in a decent performance today and I hope to keep that up. Because you know, at the age of 33, a lot of people are going to be questioning.<br /><br />That’s another story of the game today; losing my captaincy. That wasn’t a nice feeling, that wasn’t such a nice feeling. But all I can do is keep fighting, and keep proving my point<br /><br />I’m a player who’s not going to take on five guys. I’m not a player who’s going to flip the whole opposing team upside down, I’m not Messi, I’m not Cristiano Ronaldo. But I’m a player who makes diagonal runs, I like to receive the ball in the space. And if my runs are not utilised, what use am I? One-two passes for me are also the best attacking strategy but that requires chemistry between the players, and today’s game was the second time I got to play with the new boys. I’m sure as we go on, that connection will become stronger. Until we solidify this chemistry between us, I will keep making my runs and keep fighting for the team</p>
