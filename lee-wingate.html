<blockquote>
  <p>Under Rose, Salzburg would consistently line up in a 4-4-2 formation with a narrow diamond in midfield. Under <a href="jesse-marsch.html">Marsch</a>, they favour a 4-2-2-2 formation, with a double-pivot at the heart of midfield and two wider midfielders further forward supporting the strike partnership.<br /><br />The attacking play is similar to Rose’s tenure in that Salzburg look to transition from defence to attack fast and through the middle; the main difference is that they are not averse to playing balls into the box from the wings - as in the Genk game when they scored twice from crosses. The pressing is also different: the wide midfielders join the centre-forwards in pressing the opposing backline, which often creates a four-on-four situation and leads to possession turnovers.<br /><br />Unfortunately, their best defensive midfielder - in my opinion - Antoine Bernede suffered a broken shin in the cup against Rapid Vienna and will miss the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> game.<br /><br /><b>[Perhaps the central question tomorrow night is whether Salzburg, who spend so little time defending domestically, have enough nuances to their style to get a result at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, where <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> haven’t lost in European competition since October 2014]</b> This will be the first game in any competition under <a href="jesse-marsch.html">Marsch</a> in which Salzburg have been the real underdogs.<br /><br />Whether it was at home to Genk in the Champions League or away to Rapid Vienna in the Austrian Cup, they have always been strong favourites and have stuck to their approach - seen as attacking by some and gung-ho by others. However, they did organise two pre-season ‘glamour friendlies’ against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> to prepare them for the Champions League.<br /><br />They largely adopted the same approach against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and were caught out defensively a number of times as they lost 5-3. Against <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, by whom they were beaten 1-0, they shored up the defence but this came at some cost to their attacking threat.<br /><br />Ultimately, it’s impossible to say whether Salzburg will compromise their approach, but <a href="jesse-marsch.html">Jesse Marsch</a> does not seem like the kind of coach willing to sacrifice his style too much to counteract opposing teams. My prediction is that Salzburg will try to attack <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - but mainly on the counter.</p>
