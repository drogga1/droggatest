  <p><b>[Brazil international Anderson Talisca has dismissed suggestions his move to China could halt his Selecao progress]</b> <b>[World Cup 2022]</b> is not a wish, but a dream. For that dream to be accomplished. I am confident, I have quality and I have what it takes to do a good job for the Selecao<br /><br />I do not regret anything. I came here to evolve, not only for the money. People think I came to China just for the money, but that’s not the case. Here we live well, we eat well, we have security here, just as anyone has in Europe<br /><br />he city is incredible, I’ve never seen such a city. It is a cosmopolitan city with a lot of foreigners. Where I live, there are lots of Brazilians, Germans, Italians. It has Brazilian, German, Spanish and Italian restaurants. This city has a lot to offer. I’m doing well here, so at the end of the contract, in December, you’ll know <b>[what happens next]</b>.</p>
