  <p><b>[Quotes on Zlatan Ibrahimovic]</b> It is really sad he never played in England. He would have been brilliant for the game. He’s bright, he’s got unbelievable charisma, he’s a gentleman and unbelievable talent</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on Zlatan Ibrahimovic]</b> <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> has tremendous leadership qualities. He was the hardest I’d ever seen on his own team-mates about standards, whether the kind of ball, the effort, off-the-field stuff. <b>[. . .]</b> That’s a big part of why he’s got to where he is. He’s so arrogant he’s actually likeable</p>

  <p><b>[Claude Makelele agrees new contract to remain as <a href="paul-clement.html">Paul Clement</a>’s assistant manager]</b> We are very happy that he is going to be staying on because he is very popular. He is a quiet, humble man considering what he did as a player. He has great experience and he has passed that on to the players.</p>

  <p><b>[Swans boss Paul Clement was also enamoured with the deal, but was cautious not to put too much pressure on the Portuguese wonderkid as he looked to returned to form]</b> Bayern wanted him to play more regularly, I want him to play regularly and he wants to play regularly. He’s still a young player so we have to be careful we don’t put loads of pressure and expectation on him. At the same time, if anyone saw during Euro 2016 for Portugal you could see what kind of a talent he is, technical ability, his personality, his physical quality and he was good enough to play in that team that went on to win the Euros</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Clement has seen first hand what makes superstars like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> so special]</b> Two special people and characters as players were <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>. Of course, everyone can see the special talents they are on the pitch but on a personal level they are also interesting, funny and confident.<br /><br /><a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> does it very openly, speaks very confidently - and at times it is arrogance, but that is what he is. He used to be like that on a daily basis and would ask me questions such as: ‘What is <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a> like?’ I would go into detail about what he is good at and <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> would be like, ‘He is not as good as me’ and would make you laugh.<br /><br />They were both very professional on and off the field. The way they looked after their bodies with recovery, knowledge of nutrition. At his house in Madrid, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> had special recovery facilities that you would find at a club or a health spa. He had a cold plunge; he really invested in his profession and health. Those type of people go the extra mile<br /><br />I remember how strong <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> was with his team-mates <b>[at PSG]</b>. I have never seen anyone demand so much from his team-mates. Brazilian left-back <a href="maxwell.html">Maxwell</a> was an example of that - someone who he played with at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>, Inter, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. When <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> had a go at <a href="maxwell.html">Maxwell</a> about something in a game or in training, he would just tell him where to go. Some other players were like shrinking violets and I felt for them. They were shaking in their boots when <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> had a go at them</p>
