  <p><b>[Claude Makelele has joined Swansea City as assistant coach to new boss Paul Clement until the end of the season]</b> Swansea City is pleased to confirm that former French international Claude Makelele has joined the club’s coaching staff. The 43-year-old, who has signed a deal until the end of the season, reunites with head coach Paul Clement, who he worked with during his playing stint at Chelsea and as a coach with Paris Saint-Germain. The former Real Madrid, Chelsea and PSG midfielder has been named as an assistant coach… Makelele will get his first taste of the Liberty on Saturday when he’s in the dug-out for the Swans’ Premier League fixture with Arsenal.</p>

  <p><b>[Swansea boss Paul Clement feels that attacking midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson has the talent to flourish at any top club in Europe]</b> I’ve seen worse players than him playing at that level. He’s a very good player. I see someone who is fully committed to this club and team and himself, working everyday to be the best he can be. He is a player, not dissimilar to Frank Lampard.<br /><br />He is a good professional, he works very hard in training. Obviously the transition from La Liga to the Premier League has been a difficult one for him for lots of different reasons, but I see him as someone who is focused on his job and wants to help this team stay in this league. He clearly has some talent and ability and we have to work together to find that confidence and have him deliver for this team</p>

He is hungry and he is proving what he is capable of with Ghana at the moment. His performances at Aston Villa were mixed I think, but we see him as someone who has talent and who can have a big impact here. He is quick, he can run with the ball and he can score goals</p>

  <p><b>[Swansea have rocketed up to the heady heights of 16th place thanks to their victories under Clement - including one against Liverpool at Anfield]</b> Going into this game we know it is very important for both teams. We’ve got a slight advantage on Hull, but not much. When I came here in January there were four teams in it at the bottom, now it is seven but it could become four teams again, and it could quite easily become nine.<br /><br />I could have stayed at Bayern as an assistant, but I’ve chosen to come into a very challenging situation. It excites me to do that and that’s the attitude I want the players to have</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli would have no problem adapting to life at Real Madrid were he to make a switch this year]</b> Why can’t he make the step up? He’s still so young. All the best players get linked with Real Madrid, Eden Hazard is another one who is being linked at the moment. But if these teams want to do well and challenge for trophies, they’ve got to try and keep their best players. Like any player, the more consistent you are, and you’re challenging at the top, then you’re going to be of interest to arguably bigger clubs.</p>

He’s still a young player so we have to be careful we don’t put loads of pressure and expectation on him. At the same time, if anyone saw during Euro 2016 for Portugal you could see what kind of a talent he is, technical ability, his personality, his physical quality and he was good enough to play in that team that went on to win the Euros</p>

Now it is time to get going and every game we play now there is a lot at stake. Everyone wants to do really well in the first game, we’re up for it, we’re focused and we’re ready.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Clement says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> was not ‘comfortable’ when asked to play as a striker by <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> had an idea that <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> would play as a striker, either with <a href="karim-benzema.html">Karim Benzema</a> or <a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a> would come into the game. He wanted to free him up more so he could become more of a goalscorer and have less responsibility because when you play wide you have to track back. He started it off like that in the pre-season, I’m not sure if it actually went into the season but certainly the early part of when we were there, but he said to Carlo: ‘I’m not comfortable of playing in that position because my back is to goal and that’s not my strength’. He said: ‘I prefer coming in from the left, running at defenders and shooting or providing crosses’. And a great sign of Carlo’s management is that he didn’t say: ‘You’re going to play as a striker and you’re going to do great there, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> you need to be comfortable’. So he played him on the left and then what he did was organise the team to allow <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> to use his offensive skills so he wouldn’t have to track back on the left side. We played 4-3-3 and on the left side of midfield, he played <a href="angel-di-maria.html">Angel di Maria</a>, who could run and run and run. We knew that if <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> went forward that Angel would have the ability to come across to provide cover and help <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a>, who was at left-back. We knew what he liked and what he was good at and Carlo gave him the opportunity to go and do that</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Clement has seen first hand what makes superstars like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> so special]</b> Two special people and characters as players were <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>. Of course, everyone can see the special talents they are on the pitch but on a personal level they are also interesting, funny and confident.<br /><br /><a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> does it very openly, speaks very confidently - and at times it is arrogance, but that is what he is. He used to be like that on a daily basis and would ask me questions such as: ‘What is <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a> like?’ I would go into detail about what he is good at and <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> would be like, ‘He is not as good as me’ and would make you laugh.<br /><br />They were both very professional on and off the field. The way they looked after their bodies with recovery, knowledge of nutrition. At his house in Madrid, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> had special recovery facilities that you would find at a club or a health spa. He had a cold plunge; he really invested in his profession and health. Those type of people go the extra mile<br /><br />I remember how strong <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> was with his team-mates <b>[at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>]</b>. I have never seen anyone demand so much from his team-mates. Brazilian left-back <a href="maxwell.html">Maxwell</a> was an example of that - someone who he played with at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>, Inter, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. When <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> had a go at <a href="maxwell.html">Maxwell</a> about something in a game or in training, he would just tell him where to go. Some other players were like shrinking violets and I felt for them. They were shaking in their boots when <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> had a go at them</p>
