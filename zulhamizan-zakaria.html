<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Zulhamizan Zakaria, coach of Kuantan FA admitted that his team were punished for their lack of focus in the dying seconds of the game]</b> I must congratulate my counterparts at PKNP for making it to the next round. I must congratulate my players for making a comeback from 4-0 down to equalize the game 4-4. But, this is football. We lost our focus at the last minute after we worked so hard and we were punished by it.<br /><br />Our backline didn’t do their job well in the first half. They were playing offside trap strategy which we did not instruct and hence I had to make some changes and it worked. I told my players, FA Cup is different from the league. We need to go out and pressure them. We did that but we lost our conceentration. It hurts to be punished that way, I must say. In football, you lose your focus, you will get that kind of punishment</p>
