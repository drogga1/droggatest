<blockquote>
  <p>[Kenyan defender Cliffton Miheso has confirmed to the South African Football Players Union that he was forced to sign a contract at gun point by PSL club Lamontville Golden Arrows] I am in constant contact with the player and the last time I spoke to him was on Thursday. He confirmed to me that he was forced to sign a contract and I believe he is talking the truth. We want Safa to give a firm commitment and timeline that they will investigate this matter. If they don’t have the capacity or the will to investigate the matter we will have no choice but to seek help from Fifa. Safa are the custodians of football in the country and they must act when things like this happen because it has international relations implications. The problem we are facing in our football is that you have a painful situation where a CEO [Madlala] of a club who occupies a similar position at the PSL‚ which in this case has led to a contradicted stability.</p>
