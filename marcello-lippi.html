  <p><b>[Italy coach Marcello Lippi was satisfied with his players following the 2-1 win in their World Cup qualifier against Montenegro tonight, which allowed him to equal legendary two-time World Cup winning coach Vittorio Pozzo’s record 30-match unbeaten streak]</b> I am proud of all the players, both those who made their debut and the veterans. We had been working very well for the last ten days, and now have four points more. We may get criticism, but that is all that matters to me. Montenegro are a team who will cause problems to many teams, they came here to play football and did well. Also, they were in a better physical shape because they hadn’t played last weekend<br /><br /><b>[On equalling Pozzo’s record, Lippi said]</b> It’s great to have equalled the record of an icon like him, but what matters most to me is that these 30 matches without defeat have earned us a World Cup, and now we are building a new team. Personal records don’t matter to me.</p>

  <p><b>[Marcello Lippi has suggested that the likes of Italy should be guaranteed a World Cup spot once the finals are expanded]</b> Italy and Netherlands failing to qualify for a World Cup is a low-probability event. FIFA’s current plan to expand the tournament to 48 teams is quite reasonable because it serves to reduce the likelihood of such low-probability events. I recommend eight European teams and eight South American teams are allowed to automatically qualify for the World Cup.<br /><br />A World Cup is not complete without such strong teams. We need to respect the fact that the World Cup has a history of hosting traditional superpowers. Argentina qualified for the World Cup in the last round. Just imagine a World Cup without <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi. Something doesn’t seem right.<br /><br />I hope China make it to the World Cup in 2026 and I will be 82 years old by then. If China could only qualify for the World Cup in 2030, I will still have a celebration, even on crutches</p>

  <p><b>[Kylian Mbappe’s emergence on a World Cup stage with France shows that Gods are being born]</b> One thing I don’t agree with is the ‘Fall of the Gods’. Messi and Ronaldo have not fallen, they’ve been the best for 10 years and will still be at the top. If anything other Gods are being born, like Mbappe.<br /><br /><b>[Kylian Mbappe has been drawing comparisons to Brazil legend Ronaldo]</b> Yes, he looks like him. He runs at that extraordinary speed with the ball at his feet. He has incredible quality and - let’s not forget - a strong team around him from <b>[Antoine]</b> Griezmann to <b>[Paul]</b> Pogba<br /><br /><b>[On Paul Pogba]</b> He does things a little differently from when he was at Juventus, but he’s admired by the group. That’s what Messi didn’t have. He didn’t fall, it’s Argentina who aren’t a great team anymore<br /><br /><b>[A play-off defeat to Sweden has left the Azzurri watching on from afar]</b> Does that increase the regret for Italy? Unfortunately yes. They would have done well, because they still have quality. There are 1,000 reflections you could make on the defeat to Sweden, but in 90 years we’ve failed to qualify twice while we’ve won four World Cups, losing one on penalties. And for the future there are good young people and an intelligent coach like <b>[Roberto]</b> Mancini, who can do important things</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo’s dismissal for Juventus against Valencia was absurd]</b> The red for Ronaldo was because a person had a hallucination. You can’t risk compromising a game and, above all, a competition with a moment like that, which could result in a two-match ban. Now UEFA should come out and say, ‘gentlemen, we were wrong.’ You can’t go back on it because Ronaldo has already been sent off and the game is over, but a ban would be absurd. Therefore, there shouldn’t be one and we immediately implement VAR in the Champions League. Juventus are prepared for everything and any eventuality. They’re the favourites for the Champions League, together with Real Madrid, Barcelona, ​​Bayern Munich, Manchester City and PSG. Let’s say that compared to the last few years, Juve are in that group of clubs. Could Ronaldo have completely avoided Murillo? We’re talking about a champion who, before the other night, had never been sent off, and Cristiano had played 154 matches in the Champions League. He did nothing wrong against Valencia. The world rightly considers Ronaldo a star, but first of all he’s a lad who is always respectful and very helpful. His tears at Mestalla confirmed that.<br /><br /><b>[Douglas Costa also caused a storm after he was sent off for spitting at Federico <a href="eusebio-di-francesco.html">Di Francesco</a>]</b> It was wrong, at certain levels we must know how to contain ourselves. The case is closed, he’s been punished and now he must keep quiet. I see no connection with that and Ronaldo’s red. One was guilty of a gesture that wasn’t justifiable, while the other did nothing wrong</p>

I enjoyed the way they dominated in one of the most difficult and glorious stadiums in the world. In the most complicated game, they showed the personality that confirmed their growth. On the other hand, I was surprised by the non-play of Manchester United. United can’t stand and watch another team for an hour, even if it’s a super Juve. Jose Mourinho? I agree with his comments that Bonucci and Chiellini could teach defence at Harvard. But I repeat, a team with that technical quality remained closed, as they’d already done for a long time against Chelsea.</p>

Well it’s a difficult decision to make, but perhaps they are waiting for a certain competition to end. We’ll see if their new coach comes from those involved in either of the all English Finals, then we will understand the reason for the delay of the announcement. This year the English clubs are the best in Europe, but these things go in cycles. I think Sarri has a great chance at winning the Europa League, then there is Pochettino whose family is from Piedmont</p>
