  <p><b>[Italy coach Marcello Lippi was satisfied with his players following the 2-1 win in their World Cup qualifier against Montenegro tonight, which allowed him to equal legendary two-time World Cup winning coach Vittorio Pozzo’s record 30-match unbeaten streak]</b> I am proud of all the players, both those who made their debut and the veterans. We had been working very well for the last ten days, and now have four points more. We may get criticism, but that is all that matters to me. Montenegro are a team who will cause problems to many teams, they came here to play football and did well. Also, they were in a better physical shape because they hadn’t played last weekend<br /><br /><b>[On equalling Pozzo’s record, Lippi said]</b> It’s great to have equalled the record of an icon like him, but what matters most to me is that these 30 matches without defeat have earned us a World Cup, and now we are building a new team. Personal records don’t matter to me.</p>

We are a united unit and whoever I choose to start has an equal right to represent the nation by wearing the Azzurri shirt. My men I chose this evening had the benefit of three extra days rest and that was evident in the performance tonight<br /><br /><b>[The coach was then probed on his views regarding Rino <a href="gennaro-gattuso.html">Gattuso</a> who rolled back the years with a spirited performance in the middle of the park]</b> We all know what Rino is capable of. He never holds back and can still provide a great contribution to this group.</p>

Nobody could expect such a game. The same goes for Roma <b>[against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b>, to be honest. But <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> and Roma were exceptional.

  <p><b>[Lippi sees De Ligt as ‘best signing’ <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a> can make]</b> I believe that the player who would be the best signing for <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> would be De Ligt. I think he is really strong. He’s physically imposing and has great football intelligence, he gives you a good balance, is technically strong and also scores a lot of goals<br /><br />From <a href="alessandro-nesta.html">Nesta</a> to <a href="franco-baresi.html">Baresi</a>, from <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Maldini</a> to <b>[Ciro]</b> <a href="ciro-ferrara.html">Ferrara</a>, from <b>[Fabio]</b> <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Cannavaro</a> to <b>[Marco]</b> <a href="marco-materazzi.html">Materazzi</a>, I have seen so many exceptional defenders, but never one like this in relation to age. Yes, he can make the difference. <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> with De Ligt would make a further leap in quality, putting him beside <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Giorgio Chiellini</a> and <a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Leonardo Bonucci</a> would be the key to making a strong <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> even stronger. They would be capable of achieving any target, even the Champions League<br /><br /><b>[The 71-year-old is in his second spell as China coach following his reappointment in May, and intends to end his coaching career with Team Dragon]</b> I was close to Roma several times in my career, including recently. I was about to go there when <a href="eusebio.html">Eusebio</a> Di Francesco was fired. They called me and asked if I was available to be the coach of Roma, but I said no. I thanked them, saying that my time in club football is over. After China, I am going to retire</p>

  <p><b>[Lippi says I turned down <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> because I didn’t speak English well - but neither could Sir Alex!]</b> Yes, I was very close to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> when I was coaching <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. They were very nice to me by contacting my son Davide. But I didn’t feel like leaving <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a> and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. For me, <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> was like <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> for Ferguson: a unique club that I loved to bits. I didn’t speak English well and that was also a reason I declined. Someone told me that Ferguson also didn’t speak English well because he was Scottish!<br /><br />I loved <b>[Roy]</b> Keane. He was very close to moving to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> but then failed to negotiate. I also loved <b>[Paul]</b> <a href="paul-scholes.html">Scholes</a>. He would have liked it anywhere and always played.<br /><br /><b>[The Italian also wished current Red Devils boss <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> well in his quest to restore United to their former glory]</b> <b>[Ole Gunnar]</b> <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> was very good as a player and I hope he will do very well as a coach. He deserves it.<br /><br /><b>[Lippi discussed the bond he shared with the legendary Red Devils coach and says the pair’s love of wine brought them together]</b> He was almost like a brother to me. We exchanged many gifts. I brought him the <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a> gianduiotti <b>[chocolate]</b> for his grandchildren but he ate them in the end. Even the wine, the good one from my Tuscany. He loved sending me the Matrioskas, the Russian ones, with boxes in the boxes containing his 1971 Whiskey Maccallan. One day I have to call Alex and ask him for another box. We used to send wine suggestions by mobile phone. He was in love with a wine he called ‘Tigno’. In reality it was called ‘Tignanello’ but he was convinced it was wrong. We made a bet and called the sommelier of that restaurant. I won!</p>

There have been dark years but the club is fantastic, from the backroom to the players, everyone can say what it means to play at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>.

He is prepared and shrewd. He reads the game with great ease. He loves challenges and I respect him a lot, I think he is serious and prepared, I think he is a humble person.

  <p><b>[World Cup winner Lippi resigns from China managerial role]</b> I don’t want to talk about this game. A team should give everything on the pitch. The tactics of the head coach should be carried out. If the player is afraid of losing the game, then there is no fighting spirit, desire, guts. It is my responsibility, the head coach’s responsibility, although we defeated Guam and the Maldives, but the team that we played against today was better, more coordinated and organised than us. My annual salary is very high. I am fully responsible for this loss. Now I declare that I officially resigned</p>
