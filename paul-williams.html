  <p><b>[Paul Williams interview: Black coaches have qualifications but need opportunities too]</b> I wrote to a club when I finished playing. Maybe it was naïve of me but that is how I thought you were supposed to get a job. I got a letter back telling me that I was not qualified. I still have the letter today. It is kind of a motivation for me, if I’m honest. So I proceeded over the next six or seven years to get my qualifications. I was constantly at St George’s Park doing every course that was going. I have my Pro Licence. I have my advanced youth award. I have all the badges that the <a href="fa.html">Football Association</a> offer. Two years ago, I was applying for jobs again and the replies started to come in. Now they were telling me that I was overqualified. You just cannot win, can you?	<br /><br /><b>[Just the other week, Williams, now 49, was listening to a popular radio phone-in in which one of the regular guests was forcibly making the case that credible black candidates just were not out there. His line was an old one - get the qualifications and come back to me]</b> How many black coaches have their qualifications? I could name you plenty right now. You hear about equality, but then there are coaches who haven’t got their Pro Licence and they are still getting jobs ahead of them. These things don’t sit well. When you feel you have a lot to offer and are not getting the opportunities, that is hard to take<br /><br /><b>[Williams cites horror stories about pyramid schemes and agents ripping off their clients]</b> You hear so many stories. The dark side of football is not being taught in academies and they need to be aware of it. There is an opportunity for someone like <a href="andy-cole.html">Andy Cole</a> to go and talk to them. We are trying to put a bit back really. If I can help people when I am not in work then I want to do that. But I want to get back in. I am hoping that this surge of awareness will help change perceptions<br /><br />I am in total awe of <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> and <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> for speaking out. They are role models, torches for the next generation, and my son loves them for what they are doing. I am quite buoyant about the fact that people are speaking about it because that is a fantastic thing. At the back of my mind is the concern that no real action will be taken. <br /><br />I have some sympathy with the clubs. They just want the best person for the job so it does not sit right with me that I get an interview just because of the colour of my skin. It is more about changing the perceptions of black coaches. The problem though is how do you change those perceptions without getting in front of people? If you get that interview perhaps you will stick in their mind for next time<br /><br />I was called names by the teachers. There were times when I felt like I had to just take it on the chin. If you said anything then you had a chip on your shoulder. They call it banter but it is used to keep them high and you low. The football dressing room could be a challenging place too. There was a perception that if you stuck your head above the parapet then it did not bode well for your future and that has ramifications for your family life. These are things I have been conscious of. Growing up, I just had to stick in. My dad had always told me that I would have to be better than most just to get a fair crack at it. I took that mentality into life.<br /><br />If they had packed up then I would never have stepped onto a football field because I would never have believed that it could be done. They were the people who inspired me. I am so privileged. I am a kid from Burton-upon-Trent who got to share the same pitch as <a href="john-barnes.html">John Barnes</a>, Michael Thomas, Paul Davis and Cyrille Regis. Players who gave me belief. This is personal to me. This is a time when we need to step up as BAME coaches and make it feel viable for the next generation. Give them the belief that those players gave me</p>
