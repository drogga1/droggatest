  <p><b>[<a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> should auction off Black Lives Matter shirts]</b> We welcome <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s decision to feature ‘Black Lives Matter’ on the back of players’ shirts but would like to offer the suggestion that the shirts are then auctioned off to raise funding for anti-racism organisations. My suggestion would be that the money raised could be split equally three ways between SRtRC, Kick It Out and community departments of each football club. The community departments would be asked to undertake anti-racism projects or work with local anti-racism groups. Race hate crime has doubled over the last five years and the demand for SRtRC’s education work has never been greater. Our model has proven impact across the UK over the last 25 years, using the high profile of football to deliver high quality and effective anti-racism education</p>

  <p><b>[Show Racism The Red Card tries to reach 50,000 youngsters every year, going into schools to educate children about discrimination]</b> We are lucky to have the support of <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> and the England team. We think football is a great way of engaging with young people and changing attitudes<br /><br />If you look at football, some of the best footballers in Britain at the moment are Muslim and yet there is a huge growth of racism, Islamophobia and anti-Muslim prejudice. Using footballers like <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>, we know he has had a big impact in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and using footballers to talk about what racism is, how it divides people, how it’s not just about skin colour, it’s about religion and culture is a key part of our message</p>
