I work hard every day to give my best and I believe that the fans, the coaching staff and the board recognise my delivery by wearing that shirt. I’m very happy here at Liverpool and I do not see myself out of that club for years to come. I believe I am living one of the best phases of my career and I owe much to the trust that the club has placed in me from the beginning. I feel very good here in Liverpool. I am very adapted to the city, the club, and the warmth I receive from the fans makes me even happier with the work we are producing. And all this support makes me even more willing to conquer great things wearing the shirt of Liverpool<br /><br />In every transfer window we hear a lot of speculation, but nothing concrete has come to me until now. I am very happy here at Liverpool and my thinking is to build a history with many victories and titles with that club. I have a contract with Liverpool until 2020 and I hope to keep it.</p>

It is our job to deal with greater responsibility and I think we have done that so far. I’m going to do what I can to help <b>[Salah]</b> score goals and to help all the team. I also want to help myself to make a good season. I don’t know if Porto are going to be afraid but we are going to make their life difficult and make them suffer.</p>

I did not use any language that referenced race. I did not - and would never - reference a person’s skin colour or culture, by means of insult, during a dispute or an argument.

We feel we have played well against the top English clubs and shown we can beat them.<br /><br />We are not concerned who we get. We don’t mind. We are not afraid.

  <p><b>[Roberto Firmino has insisted that he doesn’t feel any pressure to score more goals]</b> No way! We have very good chemistry here at Liverpool. Many speak of the strength of our attack, which also has <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane, but we have a team full of great quality that is effective in attack. We have to think collectively. The more players score, the better. Liverpool are the ones who win in this situation.<br /><br />It’s the best moment of my career. I’m happy because things are very positive in my life; on the personal side and also on the professional side. The good moment our team is in helps a lot too, the team fits together very well. Klopp is a great tactician, and a great coach<br /><br />We changed the way we played after his exit. Which team in the world would not like to have a player of the quality of Coutinho? But he continued his life at Barcelona and Liverpool remained strong, as we always were. I do not dwell on that <b>[Coutinho holding the record as the highest-scoring Brazilian in Premier League history]</b>. I just worry about playing well and helping Liverpool go as far as possible in the Premier League. If that is achieved by me scoring goals, even better. Thank God, the goals are coming! Winning the title is difficult this season, so we will fight to secure a Champions League place again. That’s one of the goals<br /><br />I always felt calm about it <b>[the allegations]</b> because I knew I had not said what they were accusing me of. I have suffered racial prejudice and I know how painful it is. People need to take this issue more seriously and engage in this fight against racism<br /><br />Man City have a very attack-minded team, just like ours. We are the two teams that have scored the most goals so far in the Premier League. City are a very difficult team to beat. They have won 26 out of 30 games and have opened up a very big lead. They are very agile team, the players move a lot around the pitch. City, like Liverpool, are built in the image of their coach. Pep Guardiola had some great clashes with Klopp in German football, they know each other well. We have great players in English football, it’s hard to select one as the outright best. That’s why it’s the most popular league with many quality teams. We can talk about the goalscorers Salah and Harry Kane. We also have Gabriel Jesus, Kevin De Bruyne and Ilkay Gundogan in Manchester City, Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku at Manchester United, Moussa Sissoko and Mousa Dembele at Tottenham, Willian and Eden Hazard at Chelsea, Mesut Ozil at Arsenal. Not to mention Mane, Emre Can, Dejan Lovren and the many other good players we have here at Liverpool. It is a league with great stars. Virtually everyone I mentioned will be at the World Cup. The level is very high</p>

  <p><b>[Roberto Firmino admits to enjoying his best year as a professional footballer in 2017-18]</b> Am I happy with having scored 10 goals since the start of the group stage? Very, very. Although I am a little bit annoyed, because I always want more and I am never satisfied. However, you cannot beat yourself up about these things all the time and you must always keep moving forward. It is my first season in the Champions League and I am one of the leading scorers, alongside Cristiano <b>[Ronaldo]</b> and <b>[Mohamed]</b> Salah. This is my best year as a professional footballer.<br /><br />We know about Real Madrid. They are always winning titles in the Champions League and in the Spanish league too. I’ve never played against them, but I’ve watched their games and they’re very competitive. However, this is a final; a one-off game, a one-off moment. They’ll also be up against Liverpool - a team and a club with a great pedigree. We are going to fight until the end<br /><br /><b>[It would be]</b> a unique moment. It’s a very special trophy. If we’re fortunate enough to be able to win it, it will be a very emotional moment for me and the whole team.

  <p><b>[Roberto Firmino remains unfazed by his lack of superstar status in Brazil]</b> I can’t really explain it. It could be because I didn’t play for very long in Brazil before I chose to move to Europe. I left my home when I was young so I think that’s probably the main reason - they haven’t seen as much of me compared to other players. I may have a better status outside Brazil, but I don’t worry about it too much. What matters to me is that I’m doing my job at my club where I’m very happy at the moment. Everything else will follow.<br /><br /><b>[On Philippe Coutinho]</b> Everybody knows that Coutinho is a great footballer - here in England they call him ‘The Magician’. He made his decision to join Barcelona but every time we meet and play for the Selecao we have a good chat and maintain that friendship. He is an exceptional guy and one of the best friends football has given me</p>

In my whole life, I never thought that I would get treated like I do here. It’s a huge ­responsibility and we can only give ­everything back to the ­supporters that we can. The Premier League is our main challenge, but also Europe, after ­reaching the final against Real Madrid and falling down last season. That left us with a bad taste in our mouths, but we have to be patient and go game by game to achieve what we really want this time.<br /><br />When people ask what my ­ambitions are for the rest of my career, I always say that I live in the present. I don’t look at more than what we have in front of us in the next few days. I’m only interested in Liverpool and winning everything I can with them. We have the best supporters in the world here, they are amazing - and there are Liverpool fans in every part of the planet. So we know what it would mean to be champions</p>

Your eyes are very important as a professional footballer. Thank God everything is OK now. I was frightened, but the pain gradually passed after the doctor gave me a painkiller and it got better. When the incident happened, everything was blurry and I couldn’t see out of my left eye. It’s much better. The pain has gone and I can’t feel anything anymore. It’s still a bit red, but I hope that clears up over time</p>

  <p><b>[Roberto Firmino says Liverpool have the strength in depth to challenge Manchester City for silverware this season]</b> We have the team and squad to fight for the titles of both competitions. Last season it was like that, when we reached the Champions League final and also did very well in the Premier League, although City managed to open a good lead and did not give anyone a chance to catch up. But the club knew where to strengthen and brought important players, including them Alisson, Fabinho and <b>[Xherdan]</b> Shaqiri. We have everything we need to have another great season.<br /><br />The season is just beginning. Still, the team has maintained a good level of performance. The fact is that our attack really made a lot of goals and stood out last season and it is normal that the level of expectation increases. Everyone looks at Liverpool in a different way, always expecting great games and many goals. We have experienced players who know how to deal with any type of criticism<br /><br />I have evolved a lot as a player working with Klopp, who is a very tactical coach. He’s close to everyone, which makes the environment fun. He’s managed to build a team that is not just strong in attack. It’s helped the team develop and return to being one of the title contenders here in England and one of the main players in Europe</p>

I needed to improve my own game, to try to be the best footballer in the world.<br /><br /><b>[On Klopp]</b> We get along so well. He’s an excellent coach, an amazing person, so passionate on the pitch. When he says that, to me, it’s a sign that I’m giving back what he wants. It motivates me to keep going, to do the things he asks.<br /><br />I was a midfielder, though for a while I even played as a central defender. But whenever I got the ball, I would start to dribble and to nutmeg people and join the attack. So every year I evolved a little bit further forward up the pitch. Once I got to the U17s, I became a No.10, which was the position I held up until recently - when I established myself as a centre-forward. It was Klopp’s idea to fix me as a No.9. But I accepted this role and adapted to it. Now I want to continue in this position until the end of my career</p>

It’s a classic, a great game, and we will have to be 100 per cent switched on, focused on the game, and do our best - that is the most important thing. Chelsea are a great team, they had an excellent start to the season, but unfortunately couldn’t continue that run of results and fell away a little. But they are still fighting for a top-four spot, Chelsea are a great team, regardless of who they may have lost to recently. So it’s going to be a great game, and I hope we are alert and can win the game.<br /><br />It was a really decisive goal, a comeback goal, and then we obviously went on to score the third. It’s very important for him to take confidence from that in the league and the Champions League. It’s also very important that he’s scoring and helping us win games. It was really important for him to get back to scoring because it had been a while since he scored<br /><br />In my view, I am good, I’m 100 per cent and I feel great. I’ve got a lot of belief, and I just want to help my team-mates win games, giving my all out on the field. I hope we can do our best, achieve our goals, and that I can continue helping my team</p>

Today we are what we are, not just because of him but he’s responsible for a large portion of our transformation, so I’m really happy to be playing under him, he’s a great coach</p>
