I find it quite normal before the game to greet each other, ask how they are doing. That’s all. Nothing more than that. But, on the pitch, they aren’t friends, each one defends his club to the best of his ability. Then the rivalry increases on the pitch</p>

It ends up being more special because it is the two teams fighting for the top of the table. <b>[It’s]</b> a match where we have to be careful, playing against a big team that we know really well, and they know us well too. We have to be careful and focused on the game to perform well and try to win. It is a big game between two big teams that are fighting for the top. We have to be careful not to give the opponents many chances. Of course, it is a match worth six points, and we have to do our best: defend well and play good football<br /><br />We already had good experiences here against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, in the Champions League and in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> also, last year. I hope our fans can be that extra player and that they can support us during the whole match. On the pitch, we will try to do our best and of course, perform really well and win the match</p>

  <p><b>[When quizzed on the changes to his game since arriving in England back in 2015]</b> I think I improved a lot in every way: physically, tactically, mentally, I learned a bit of every aspect. But I do not want to stop here. I want to keep improving - I always want more, I have big goals, I want to keep winning titles with this club and that is it<br /><br /><b>[Firmino is a star in his own right at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, but has to share an attacking spotlight with <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> and <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>]</b> That is just me, my personality, to try to be a good and humble guy. To try to help my team in the best way with assists and goals. I like that, I like to win all the time, and for that I will always be like this. I am a guy who respects my position on the pitch. Where the team needs me, I will play. As a No.9, but sometimes I play as a No.10, and I try to give my best. As I mentioned before, I always want to help my team as best as I can and to always be chasing the win, always winning games. That is what matters the most<br /><br /><b>[Firmino will also continue to give all he has for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> boss <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>]</b> I am never tired of praising <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>. He has so many good things on and off the pitch. He really helps us on a daily basis, we learn so much from him in every way. He is able to have the team with him. We have been doing things well and learning a lot from him, and we have been showing on the pitch that we can grow more and more each day and do our best</p>

  <p><b>[Firmino admits there is a determination within <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s ranks to deliver more major silverware]</b> Last year we hit the post in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, we were upset of course that we didn’t win. We have a chance this season, it’s in our hands. We need to keep it up, working hard, following this path with our heads in the right place and a winning mentality. We’ll take things game by game and keep this strong champions mentality up until the end and see where it takes us. Of course we’re more confident this season. We’ve been winning all our games, this increases our confidence game by game. We have to continue with this momentum<br /><br /><b>[Firmino said of his boss]</b> I knew <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> from playing against <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> in Germany. I was happy, of course, when I found out he was coming here, as he was German and I’d played there as well and I have a bit of the German mentality. He changed the club a lot generally, in every way, tactically, mentally. Today we are what we are, not just because of him but he’s responsible for a large portion of our transformation, so I’m really happy to be playing under him, he’s a great coach</p>
