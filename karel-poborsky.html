  <p><b>[Karel Poborský on his goal in Euro 96 vs Portugal and take the Czech Republic into the semi-finals]</b> Victor Baia was well out of his goal so I thought the easiest thing to do was to lob him which I managed to do really well. The ball went so high that I thought it couldn’t end up in the goal. But then it did<br /><br /><b>[Poborsky had <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> in front of him and he did not enjoy his two seasons at Old Trafford]</b> It was really difficult for me there. I didn’t speak English and I was still young. Plus, the United team was already full of great players</p>

  <p><b>[Karel Poborsky admits that a young <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> contributed to his struggles at Manchester United]</b> Moving from Slavia to United in the mid-90s, it was like two different worlds. It was a massive step in my career, and in my life. United had a great squad, but I didn’t speak English and the language barrier was the biggest issue. Growing up in Czechoslovakia under the communist regime, English wasn’t taught in grammar schools – we only learned Russian. It was easier for players who arrived from other countries and could speak English. That was the case for <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>, who joined United that same summer.<br /><br />When you go somewhere new, the first two or three months are so important to make a good impression. It’s not ideal when you can’t communicate properly. Ole was friendly, and many of the players were helpful. <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a> was one of them – a cool guy, and very calm in the dressing room. He always told me that if I needed something, he’d help me. Sometimes the better the player, the more normal the person – and what a player he was. A genius. In the end, I was there for just 18 months. It was almost impossible for me to secure a regular place in the starting line-up ahead of <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>, at the beginning of his amazing career. But I don’t feel any bitterness. The players accepted me and I always tried my best, even though I only came on for the last 20 minutes of games. I didn’t have a problem playing for the reserve team – <a href="jordi-cruyff.html">Jordi Cruyff</a> refused to. When I got a chance to play for the first team, I tried to convince the manager of my qualities. My best match was probably against <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> – I scored one goal, later voted goal of the month, and set up a couple. But every match at Old Trafford was special. We won the league title and I loved the celebrations. <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> gave us a guard of honour and Pavel Srnicek, my international team-mate, congratulated me. But I wanted to play regular football. There was massive expectation on me when I played for the Czech Republic. People expected miracles from me, because I was playing for one of the best clubs in the world, but I lost my rhythm and my performances weren’t at the same level. We didn’t qualify for the 1998 World Cup. I sat down with Ferguson and told him that even though I was at the best club in the world, it didn’t make me completely happy – I longed to play regularly. He understood and tried to find me an English club on loan – like <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> or Sheffield Wednesday – but I signed for Benfica</p>
