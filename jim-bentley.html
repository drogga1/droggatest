  <p><b>[AFC Fylde manager Jim Bentley to undergo heart bypass surgery]</b> The club will remain in regular contact, supporting our manager in every way it can. It is a concerning time for all at Mill Farm as we send our very best wishes to Jim and his family, who is remaining in a positive mindset about the situation whilst receiving the best care possible. We ask that Jim and his family have his privacy respected at this time, whilst welcoming the many well wishes already received from the footballing community</p>

  <p><b>[AFC Fylde manager Jim Bentley to undergo heart bypass surgery]</b> At the start of the year I had some chest pains whilst doing a bit of training. After getting checked out I was told I had a blockage in one of my arteries. I had some more tests and was placed on medication to help my condition<br /><br />Due to the COVID situation, I haven’t been able to get into hospital but I finally went in to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Chest &amp; Heart hospital this week to have a Coronary Angiogram and stent fitted, but whilst the doctor was carrying out the procedure he noticed that my condition was a bit worse than first thought<br /><br />It was then recommended I have a heart bypass instead. It’s not the news I wanted but I am thankful I got checked out when I did as this could have been a lot worse. I’m looking forward to getting sorted and being back fit doing the job I love as soon as possible</p>
