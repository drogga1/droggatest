  <p><b>[Diego Simeone has stressed he wants to remain at Atletico Madrid next season]</b> My dream is to stay at the club and accompany the growth it is in. I still see many good things for the club to keep growing. Atletico is still a virgin. I see many ways for improvement. I see many young players that will give us balance to have a good squad. I am still excited about collective efforts, it keeps me alive. My vitamins are the players and if they respond as they did the other day against Sevilla, how am I going to go?<br /><br />We won a Liga title that will always be remembered here. With Real Madrid and Barcelona, it is very rare that a team that is not one of those two does not finish between 10 to 15 points behind in third. We won the league at Camp Nou and last year we finished three points behind champions Barca. When I was young I watched Diego Maradona’s Serie A-winning Napoli, it’s like that fight he had with the best Inter, Juventus and AC Milan. We grow as a club. We are close to having a new stadium, which is going to be wonderful and the club will grow. The difference is with the history of Real Madrid and Barca. For them, the Copa del Rey or the Supercopa de Espana must be won, the Champions League too. It is very difficult to compete with them because they have a power beyond the budget. Real Madrid, Barca and Bayern Munich have an incomparable power with anyone, even with those who have a lot of money like PSG or Manchester City<br /><br />It would not be healthy to live with the imagination of reaching the final when we have a rival like Leicester who has eliminated Sevilla that everyone said was the best in Spain at the moment. For the morbid it might be good but it would be dangerous to imagine</p>

Giovanni has had a fantastic year at Genoa and scoring 11 goals in Italy in your first year isn’t easy.<br /><br />Thinking about seeing him in one of my teams would mean giving him a responsibility that wouldn’t be good for him. Giovanni has qualities that I like a lot and with effort and hard work he will definitely become a big player, but not with my team. There are a lot of clubs that can give him great opportunities</p>

It’s clear that the objective is to win. If you’re on a national team you can choose how you play but when you’re at a club where the budget varies from one number to another, it’s clear that first you have to work to win. If we all had a Ferrari that’d be one thing, but sometimes you have a Peugeot. We’re all right in football and the path can be reached in several ways. Then there is what you like and you can’t be angry with the opinions.<br /><br />There is no wrong way and no right way to play the game and If we all played the same way it would be very boring</p>

The greats are Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Real Madrid. But from a sporting point of view we are definitely competitive. When I say we are not one of the greats I mean in that sense, not in a sporting sense.<br /><br />It is great to be in the semi-finals for the third time in four years. Looking back at the first day I arrived at the club I said my desire was to make Atletico Madrid competitive against every team we played against. It is satisfying now to say we are a competitive outfit<br /><br />In terms of the way forward for ourselves, we are just going to keep trying and trying and insisting and keeping going</p>

Anarchy, no leadership from the FA or the people in charge. I do not see anyone leading. There is no leadership, either from the coach, who should be leading, or the players, who should be led. I see that the team is lost. It is clear that in the dressing room players are beating each other up but in these situations, you need someone to fight. We all say the players are the most important part of the game and the coach usually play it down when players mess it up, but the Coach is also participating in this<br /><br />He picked the wrong team and tactics, too. He should have started the weaker team against Iceland, in the way he played against Croatia, because they are a much weaker team. And the other way round - the way he played against Iceland was how he should have played against Croatia. When the coaches screw up, it’s worse than when the players shit it. So it has to be down to the coach. It’s on him. I think it will happen. Nigeria is going to beat Iceland and there you will have the chance to beat Nigeria and pass, as long as Iceland does not win against Croatia</p>

It was such a tough game, we fought so hard and Diego Costa worked really hard when he wasn’t 100 per cent fit. I had to show what I was feeling.

The first leg is one moment, the second leg is another. Everyone tries to prepare and organise, but football is about details that cannot be explained or predicted and that’s what makes this sport fantastic.

  <p><b>[Diego Simeone has hit out at critics of Barcelona and Argentina star Lionel Messi]</b> The criticism towards Messi is not fair, not at all, especially in Argentina. They all ask with Messi ‘why in Barcelona yes and in Argentina no?’ It is not difficult to know why, it’s easy. In Barcelona there are some players and a team that supports him and in Argentina there are no such players, as happens to Cristiano Ronaldo in Portugal, because Portugal is not Juventus or Real Madrid. The teams strengthen the great player, it’s easy.<br /><br />I respect everything, everyone has an opinion. Messi was close to winning the World Cup, he did not win it unfortunately. Some people criticise him constantly, but Messi is extraordinary. How many Ballons d’Or has he won, how many goals has he made? How many times has he managed to give Barcelona a certain way to play? Without him, it would not be the same<br /><br />It’s very difficult to talk from the perspective that I’m not in that place. If I ask that question to a fan, what would he do in that situation, he would not know what to do if one day he is a coach. Being a team manager is one thing, being a national manager is another, there is a whole country behind it with a ruthless football and passion culture.

  <p><b>[Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone does not believe a manager can be successful with one style of play]</b> You’ve always heard me say this, the criticism is part of this profession, the opinion too. What I’m trying to say is that within the styles, first, there’s something clear: the style is given by the players on the roster. I do not have a style to go to a smaller team and practice my supposed style, I have to adapt to the club that hires me, empower those players and as an employee, make the club grow. That is to be a good coach for me. He who brings a style to a club that can’t carry it out, he is not a good manager, because he is attacking the club that hires him.<br /><br />There are those who discredit a style or a way of playing and those who accept all the different styles. What hurts and does not meet the conditions for this ruthless criticism in football, are those that discredit a way of playing. I do not hear people speak ill of a super-possession team, of association football, of people who come out to play in a different way, of a style of touch. Of those teams, nobody makes a ruthless criticism. Now, I’ve always listened to those who like the style of possession disparaging other styles and coaches that defend another idea. My question is why? Why?<br /><br />He’s an animal, Diego Costa is an animal! He made us suffer in a game against Barcelona when we needed his characteristics, sure, he is a player that we needed for that game, but I am not one of the coaches that generates negative sensations from an episode. I value everything and with Costa there is more positive than negative</p>

I spoke with Antoine before meeting with Miguel Angel <b>[Gil, Atleti’s chief executive]</b> and Andrea <b>[Berta, their sporting director]</b>. I told him what I thought with affection and fondness and this was between us only. When you give everything, as Antoine did, we are calm. Antoine is taking a step towards a new place. We have all participated in that growth over these five wonderful years. He is one of the best scorers in our history. Players are always looking for important teams, like Lucas Hernandez with Bayern Munich, Barcelona… historically there are better clubs and that growth is sought.<br /><br />I do not aspire to convince anyone to stay. Staying at Atletico is a source of pride for the players who do it. It’s been almost 10 years since Quique <b>[Sanchez Flores]</b>’s time when we started competing well and winning titles.

  <p><b>[<a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> strikers Costa and <a href="alvaro-morata.html">Morata</a> cannot currently play together]</b> We manage different situations and Marcos gives us important alternatives, where we can play with three in the middle and <b>[Yannick]</b> <a href="yannick-carrasco.html">Carrasco</a> as striker. I think that Marcos has a very good physical condition and good finishing from behind the striker. He already showed it when some people thought taking out Costa for him at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> was a defensive change and he was key. On the possibility of putting Costa and <a href="alvaro-morata.html">Morata</a> together, it is not the same as in pre-season. Now I cannot take advantage of both together because I do not have a team prepared to sustain the two forwards. I prefer to harness the power that each one has separately until at some point they can play together. That’s why I explain why Alvaro and Costa do not play when Alvaro is available<br /><br />I have absolute gratitude to German, he is essential. I am grateful for the time German has given me and we have shared professionally and personally. It’s a very important decision and he will face many challenges that will motivate him. Some of the players have already commented on what German has given us and when he finishes, we wish him the best</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Simeone challenged his <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> players to treat every remaining <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> match like a final after a 1-1 draw at Athletic Bilbao hindered their top-four hopes]</b> The aim for the two teams was to always try to win, we started well in the first 10 minutes, then they positioned themselves better and they won the second ball and they did not let us attack. The goal came, the reaction, after a very well-constructed play. In the second half we were closer to that victory. Santiago Arias’ chance was the clearest. He could have allow us to take the victory in a stadium where you always have to work to win. We have one final left in each match</p>

He had a great pre-season, a very good start, then he had an injury. It was difficult for him to return because of the rhythm and the association with his new team-mates.

Although the defender has made progress since the previous tests he underwent last week, the area requires maximum caution and he will continue to train and be assessed individually</p>

We must try to be focused and, with the best security we can offer the team, we have rotated. I am still convinced that the team’s strength is the emotional convention of the group.

  <p><b>[Diego Simeone says <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> still believe in <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a>]</b> He is a different player, but we have always valued his talent as we have seen him in training and matches. Surely, when he grows older and can spend more time in situations that are decisive for the team and he will evolve as a player. He has all the important attributes that can make or break a game, and with his growth in matches he will develop even more as a footballer<br /><br />It seems to me that it gives footballers a greater chance of playing. With three changes not everyone on the bench can be involved, but now we’ve discovered something new and the people who make decisions will decide if it’s convenient or not. There are more options for players to play, but it’s not up to us to make these decisions</p>

I just make an opinion on ours. We need to keep it protected, always take care of it and always manage the feeling of the players, which is the most important for a squad. The most important thing is to manage, in my team, the emotional part, which I consider to be the key part<br /><br />I wouldn’t tell you, and I would try to solve it naturally in our camp, which is the dressing room or the training session.

I think it is normal they are always looking for the best players as we have many in our team.
