  <p>[Liverpool youngster Bobby Adekanye has revealed that he will not be signing a new contract] I expected that I would get a chance at Liverpool sooner. Before I came, we talked about it. They said that if I had a good first season, I had a good chance of joining the first team. Due to injury, that did not come true. I had to undergo surgery at the start of my second season and then it is difficult to return. Jurgen Klopp spoke to me and gave me tips. He said ‘keep doing your thing’. But, in the end, I don’t think I appeared in his plans. If so, I have to look for something else. That is disappointing and it has helped me decide not to renew my contract<br /><br />That I would sign with Lazio is not at all the case. It’s not over yet. They are one of the clubs that is interested, but it is not yet 100 per cent decided. I also heard from Barcelona. In the Netherlands, Willem II came by. I can’t name the entire list of clubs now, because then we will be busy tomorrow. But there is interest from, among others, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain. In the summer I am going to talk about it with my family and business manager Junior Minguella, I am not worried that I will have no club</p>
