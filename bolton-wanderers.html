Manchester City have signed young striker Daniel Ogwuru from Bolton Wanderers for around Â£100,000</p>

<p>: 2019 06 29
Celtic have completed the signing promising midfielder Luca Connell from embattled Bolton Wanderers on a four-year deal</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Paul Appleton says Bolton Wanderers face liquidation this week unless a deal to buy the club can be resurrected by 17:00 BST on Tuesday]</b> At 5pm on Friday August 23, the completion of the sale of the football club and the hotel had been agreed by all parties and undertakings had been issued by all solicitors except those of Ken Anderson. Devastatingly, on Saturday morning that deal collapsed. At this stage, there seems little point in apportioning blame because that makes no difference to the staff, players, management, supporters and the community who have once more seen their club taken back to the brink</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Bolton Wanderers face liquidation this week unless a deal to buy the club can be resurrected by 17:00 BST on Tuesday]</b> The EFL have made their position clear by insisting on a 17:00 BST deadline on Tuesday for a deal to be completed or give compelling reasons for an extension. They have also written to everybody concerned in the process to underline that sense of urgency. On Sunday evening, there was some tentative dialogue, but we are still some way from reaching a solution. Therefore, I am appealing to those parties whose position seems intractable to do everything to reach a compromise.<br /><br />In just over 24 hours, the club will have its membership of the EFL revoked. Over and above that, the club is currently not in a position to carry on trading and, as such, the process of closing down the company will commence on Wednesday. This will ultimately lead to its liquidation, the expulsion of the club from the EFL and the inevitable loss of over 150 jobs. More than that, it will devastate a community for whom the football club is a beacon of hope and expectation</p>
