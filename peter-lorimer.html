<blockquote>
  <p><b>[To complete a night of disaster for United, hordes of their 8,000 supporters rioted inside and outside of the ground, actions which cost <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> a ban from European competition]</b> <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> dominated the opening exchanges yet were denied an early lead when French referee Michel Kitabdijan waved play on after German international <a href="franz-beckenbauer.html">Franz Beckenbauer</a> appeared to up-end Clarke in the Munich box. ‘It most certainly was a penalty when <a href="franz-beckenbauer.html">Beckenbauer</a> brought me down,’ said Clarke. ‘I saw him fifteen years later when he admitted that we were far and away the better side and, yes, it was a penalty. Fifteen years later you can say that. It won’t alter the result.’ It was <a href="franz-beckenbauer.html">Beckenbauer</a>’s first intervention in a game he was to have a dramatic effect on. <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> controlled the first half and continued to make headway in the second half. Only the brilliance of German international goalkeeper <a href="sepp-maier.html">Sepp Maier</a> kept <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> at bay…until the sixty-seventh minute. <a href="john-giles.html">Johnny Giles</a> floated in a free-kick, the Bayern defence failed to clear their lines and Lorimer hammered it home. The referee awarded a goal, the players celebrated and the fans went wild, but the Germans protested, claiming Billy Bremner was offside. The officials conferred and United hopes were dashed with an about-turn.<br /><br /><a href="franz-beckenbauer.html">Beckenbauer</a> was involved in both major incidents in the game. He went straight to the linesman. He was held in such stature that he could dominate officials. I’d looked at the referee to see if he had given it and he pointed to the half-way line, but <a href="franz-beckenbauer.html">Beckenbauer</a> protested and he changed his mind. Had he given that we would have won, no doubt about it</p>

  <p><b>[The goal was disallowed after the referee had given it and only after <a href="franz-beckenbauer.html">Beckenbauer</a> interfered]</b> I think it was the start of the frustrations of the <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> fans. They knew we’d been robbed. We’d had Ray Tinkler cost us the title a few years earlier, then, we had Milan. Then we had another situation where we lost a game that we should have won</p>
