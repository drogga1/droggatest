  <p><b>[Manchester United have completed the signing of Porto teenager Diogo Dalot for a fee of around £19 million]</b> Joining Manchester United is an unbelievable opportunity for me. I have grown up in Porto’s Academy and I am so thankful for everything they have done for me. But the chance of coming to the biggest club in the world is something I just couldn’t turn down</p>

The team-mates have received me very well and I’m so thankful for that. It’s very good to be here. It’s a first experience for me, but I am ready for it. I am trying to recover well <b>[from my injury]</b>. Hopefully I’m ready to know them better. They are a great team<br /><br />I hope to be a better player and a better man, to grow up and win. I just want to help the club and my team-mates. Hopefully in 12 months, <b>[I can]</b> get better things like I have in the past<br /><br /><b>[On against Real Madrid at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Garden]</b> It’s going to be a tough game. They have great players for sure but we’ll be ready for them. We are preparing and we will hope we can finish the tour with a win.</p>

  <p><b>[Diogo Dalot is looking to make a similar impact at Manchester United to that previously enjoyed by countryman Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> Cristiano, I don’t need to describe him because you already know him. For me, since I remember, he was the inspiration to play football and of course, if you asked me if the fact he played here was also an influence to come, then of course I say yes. The way he played here, the way he developed, was unbelievable. I want to make that step too, to improve and play for many, many years here. He is an inspiration for everyone, for every player, for every young player. To have a player like that in the world, we just have to enjoy it for as long as he stays with us, playing and giving us the opportunity to enjoy his football. It was a proud few years for Manchester to have him here and, hopefully, one day the United fans will say it was good for them to have Dalot here.<br /><br />Jose was a big influence on me coming here. He was very important. His history speaks for itself, the way he is coaching and the way that he has made football change. It is the fact that is he is Portuguese too. The relationship that he has with the players is very good, and it was quite impressive to me. He pushed me to come here and the way that he believed in me was very good. That is why I am here. He is a big reason why I came</p>

  <p><b>[Diogo Dalot is looking to spend many, many years at Manchester United]</b> It’s a massive learning curve. I think the first part of the season was tough because I had injuries, and I only started playing and training with full fitness from December on. This year was a learning year for me, and I will keep learning more until the end of the season. <b>[I’ve learned]</b> more mentally to be ready for this kind of situation, to get an injury, to not play, to start getting fit again. For me, to learn that was a big achievement, and I think I am doing pretty well. I’m enjoying it. I came to this club and knew it would be difficult for me, I have good players in my position and I can learn a lot from them. I think I can have the opportunity to play many, many years here.<br /><br />The biggest difference was the atmosphere we had inside the locker room.
“I think the tactical parts too, the game we are playing, we play more to the forward part, so I think we changed a couple things and hopefully we can still change a little bit more because we are not perfect. It wasn’t wrong, but I think when you change coach there is something which changes for itself, it’s not something about the coach, something <b>[you think]</b>: ‘We changed the manager, OK, now we need to change ourselves, too.’ I think we changed for the better when we get the results we’ve got<br /><br /><b>[He said of the Neville comparisons]</b> <b>[It]</b> brings responsibility, but I wouldn’t accept it if I couldn’t be at the top, and for me, it’s a pleasure being compared to those types of players. They are words of Mourinho, I need to build my own history here and that’s to always keep improving, and hopefully I can be here for many years to play for United</p>

  <p><b>[Diogo Dalot is willing to do whatever it takes for resurgent Manchester United]</b> I just enjoy playing. It can be on the right wing, left wing, in goal, I just want to play. Now Ash <b>[Young]</b> is playing more at right-back and the manager knows I am able to play in other positions I need to be ready for whatever he wants from me.<br /><br />This is Man United. When you’re 1-0 down we know the crowd always pushes for us and we wanted to win it. I think the badge speaks for itself when we talk about comebacks, desire and attitude, and for us it was just another game that we gave everything in. It was like a two-second punch in the stomach when we conceded that second goal, it was a good goal too which David <b>[De Gea]</b> had no chance with. But we knew we had maybe 10 minutes more and, like I said, it’s Man United and we wanted to win it, and Rom got us the other goal. It’s always a pleasure to play in this stadium and what a game to win with such a great comeback. It was unbelievable<br /><br /><b>[United is a Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain]</b> We have no pressure on us because we are 2-0 down but we know in football anything is possible and in this club you know that even more. We feel that if we can score a goal then they will be worried so we will focus on doing that</p>

He was my idol from day one. Not because he’s Portuguese, or his style of playing, but for his hard work. When you think of an athlete, a complete athlete, a complete footballer, you need to choose <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>. For me, he was the main inspiration to start playing football. Not because I want to be like him, I want to take my own path, but to get to know him and see how he works is unbelievable.<br /><br /><b>[He added, after making 23 appearances in 2018-19]</b> Of course it’s hard to get to a big team. But then it’s harder to stay there because you are competing with a lot of footballers that are such hard workers. When you get to the big clubs, to the big leagues, you know that every day you need to get better and better and better. For me, I think the hard work is the main thing. Work hard and stay humble<br /><br /><b>[He said of his future ambition]</b> I don’t like to think too big for now. I used to say ‘step by step’. Now I just try to focus on getting my opportunities and getting my minutes, and showing the manager what I’m capable of, that I can play here. Of course, when you lay down on your bed and you dream of the future, you dream of being one of the best right-backs in the world, being a reference for everyone. But that’s when you are in bed. When you wake up, you just need to put your feet on the ground and start working again, because every day is a fight for me. I think that’s the right way</p>
