  <p><b>[A right-wing cross from the by-line to the far post by Jairzinho saw Banks, guarding the near post, swiftly reassessing the situation and his own positioning as <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> rose to meet the ball with a header, confidently shouting ‘Goal!’ as he did so. In his autobigraphy, Banks recalled]</b> <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> got above the ball and powered it low and hard towards the corner of the net. It was the perfect header. I was now into a dive to my right and as the ball hit the ground just in front of my goal-line I flicked it with my outstretched right hand as it came up</p>

  <p><b>[Gordon Banks says England Would Be Wrong To Start <a href="joe-hart.html">Joe Hart</a>]</b> Our goalkeepers are much of a muchness. They make fantastic saves but then again they may make the odd error.<br /><br />The ball is detrimental to the art of goalkeeping. Sometimes a keeper thinks he can catch it but he doesn’t quite get hold of it, and it bounces out and is an easy goal for someone to go in and score<br /><br />I think Mr <a href="fabio-capello.html">Capello</a> has got a very hard choice between James and Green. I don’t think <a href="joe-hart.html">Hart</a> would come into it in this moment in time because he hasn’t played a full match for England and to thrust him in at a World Cup would be a little bit wrong to be honest<br /><br /><b>[Banks also feels the influx of foreign managers and players into the game is affecting the progress of young English keepers in a ‘problem position’]</b> We’ve got a lot of foreign managers who don’t want to take a chance on a young kid playing in the reserves</p>

  <p><b>[Gordon Banks speaks about his famous save against <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> in 1970, as he turns 80 years old]</b> I saw <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> racing to the edge of the box. I had a quick look before their winger Jairzinho crossed the ball - <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> had got in front of Alan Mullery. Jairzinho centered the ball, but I could not come out for the cross. I knew from the penalty spot it would have to be a fantastic header to beat me. But the ground was hard, so I thought I should get off my line, and as I dived, I had to anticipate how high it was going to bounce. I got a hand to it, the ball actually hit the top of my hand and looked as though it was going into the top of the net. As I hit the floor, I saw that the ball had missed the goal. At first, I thought ‘you lucky so and so’, but then I realised it has been a bit special. I’ve met <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> many times since and we often have a chat about it. He thought he’d scored</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="alf-ramsey.html">Alf Ramsey</a>]</b> He was in a class of his own. Some managers are tactically aware. Some excel at coaching. Others are good at motivation and man-management. Alf was superb at everything. That is what made him so special</p>
