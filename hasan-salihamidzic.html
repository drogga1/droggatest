That’s where the focus lies<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he was worried about other clubs potentially looking at the stars coming out of contract]</b> No. Sure, this can happen with top players, but we have had good experience with concentrating on the competitions first and that’s what we will do.

  <p><b>[Hasan Salihamidzic was also impressed by Davies’ performance but noted his extreme speed can be both a blessing and a curse if not used right]</b> He fitted in very well, of course he has the speed that helps him. Of course, he relies on this and therefore makes one or two technical mistakes. We are working on it in training with him. We take him with us, try to take care of him and do everything around it so that he can perform on the pitch. He does it very well and is very clear. But you can’t put the boys in cotton wool. You have to make sure that they stay tuned and continue working. He is very professional</p>
