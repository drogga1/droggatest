  <p><b>[Liverpool’s struggles at the back this season can be put down to a lack of concentration]</b> I think Jurgen Klopp has always been faithful to his thoughts about the game and the way he wants to play. His fundamental idea is that as soon as we lose possession we must do everything we can to surround the ball and win it back as quickly as possible. It’s pretty much the ethos that he set out with at the beginning in Germany. His approach has always been to try and defend well, but when we attack to make sure we attack in numbers.<br /><br />These days a lot of football is based on attack-minded full-backs, but my instinct is first and foremost to defend. Obviously you want to help the team as much as you can by getting forward and creating chances and to do that requires a physical effort. That’s what we work on in training, to be able to last the 90 minutes, or however long it takes. But although it is important to last the whole game physically we have to do it mentally as well. You can put a lot of the goals we have been conceding down to a lack of concentration more than anything else. Just at particular moments, maybe from a quick throw or the second ball coming back at a corner, we have not managed to clear. That’s where we need to tighten up if we are aiming to keep clean sheets.</p>

  <p><b>[Alberto Moreno insists that he never considered leaving Liverpool]</b> I couldn’t be happier with the way things are going this season. Things were bad over the summer. The word was that I would be leaving and I should not try to stay, but at no point did I agree with that assumption. I wanted to stay. I wanted to fight for my place in the Liverpool team and that is the mindset I had when I came back for pre- season. I wanted to fight for my career and my future at this club. It is a club I love and a city I love as well, so all my critics, the people who were saying I should leave, should shut their mouths now I am back in the team.<br /><br />Last season was a bad one for me, I spent almost a year without playing many games. It reflected badly on me and my family, because they weren’t having a good time either. When I came back this summer I asked for a chat with the manager. I just told him honestly that I wanted to stay and asked him what I could do to win back my place in the side. In return he was very sincere with me, very honest, because he said he couldn’t promise me anything and told me he was signing a new left-back <b>[Andy Robertson]</b>.<br /><br />But the manager encouraged me to keep working and see how things went in the early part of the season and that is what I did. It enabled me to focus on working hard to get back. I had offers from other clubs but at the forefront of my mind was always that I wanted to stay here</p>

  <p><b>[Alberto Moreno claims to live for Liverpool]</b> I’m happier now things are going well for me and I’d say so far this has been a decent season for me, if not the best in my career as a professional football player. I’m nearly at my best, but none of this comes without very hard work. Helping the side has its roots in the sacrifices you make, the hard work in pre-season and the battling to get back in contention. All that is because of my desire to be here at Liverpool, one of the best clubs in the world. I live for Liverpool. I love Liverpool. I always want to win when I’m wearing the shirt of Liverpool.<br /><br /><b>[Liverpool are set to face Sevilla in their next Champions League fixture on November 21]</b> It will be a special game, if I’m selected to play. Lots of family and friends will be going to watch. Irrespective of the occasion, we’ll be going there to win. I’ll fight hard for victory, like I do every time I pull that shirt on. I’ve only played in the group stages of the Champion League, so to get through to the next round would be really special, as I’m sure it would be for everyone here. It’s been a few years since we got through as a club to the knockout stages. The fans deserve a happy event like that</p>

  <p><b>[Alberto Moreno admits being forced to pay second fiddle to makeshift left-back James Milner at Liverpool in 2016-17 was fucked up]</b> It has been strange. He <b>[Klopp]</b> arrived and I played every game, then at the start of the next season I disappeared. In the summer I saw that the season was going to be fucked up and that’s how it was. I cannot find a reason for what happened.<br /><br />When I saw James Milner, a right-footed midfielder, at left-back I knew something was happening. He did not give me any explanations. There came a point where I trained, looked around and knew that no matter what I did, they were not going to play me. He told me the team was fine, that I should continue working. I did, but the opportunity didn’t come. I went to talk to him five or six times and the message was the same but nothing changed<br /><br />My idea was to stay, work hard and earn my place. Klopp told me he was going to sign a left-back and that he couldn’t promise me game time. I thought this was wrong, I spoke to my agent but he told me just to keep working</p>

  <p><b>[Alberto Moreno’s Liverpool revival]</b> I always talk about my family, my daughter, my parents, how much they have helped me, and it’s true but in the end, it’s the player who does it, who changes the situation. He’s the one that goes out there in front of I-don’t-know-how‑many-thousand people.<br /><br />Last year was useful for me: to think, to change things, to say to myself: ‘Alberto, what can you do better?’ And the first thing was: defend. I’m a defender. And I’ve changed that.<br /><br />I’m more focused - I think you can see that - and thankfully I haven’t made any mistakes. Maybe in my first few years at Liverpool, I was always thinking: ‘Attack, attack, attack.’ Confidence is vital for a footballer but I’m <b>[also]</b> more settled, more focused. Now I’m like, ‘First, let’s defend, keep a clean sheet and, then, let’s go forward.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool left-back Alberto Moreno has spoken out against manager Jurgen Klopp after being dropped for Andy Robertson]</b> I didn’t feel <b>[the decision to stick with Robertson]</b> well, I was injured giving my best for our team. I disliked Klopp’s decision because I was training but when I returned he only wanted Robertson. My relationship with Klopp hasn’t changed but since this injury, I didn’t have a meeting with him but our relationship is normal. I disliked the way that Klopp has treated me but I understand his situation that he can’t change <b>[Robertson]</b> because the team is winning.<br /><br />The dressing room is very close, we are a family<br /><br />Liverpool has proposed renewing me but no agreement has been reached, in January the market opens and we will see. To this day we have nothing closed neither with Liverpool nor with other clubs</p>

  <p><b>[Alberto Moreno has paid tribute to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and their supporters following his release]</b> Hi Reds. Life goes in cycles, and mine at my beloved <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool FC</a> has drawn to an end. Upon reaching this point, I would like to thank the entire <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> family: my dear teammates, with whom I have shared five marvellous years and who I will forever think of a family, and of course, the owners, directors, coaching staff, doctos, physios, kitmen, and each and every person at the club.<br /><br />Thank you for making me a better footballer and, above all, a better person; for helping me fulfil one of my childhood dreams by winning the Champions League and, in doing so, to become a small part of the history of this great club. My gratitude too to the city, which embraced me as one of its own from day one and which will live on in my memory whenever I look at my son, Alberto Jr., a Liverpudlian himself. Finally, a very special thank you to the club’s superb fans, who always supported me. I wish you all at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool FC</a> the greatest successes. Wherever life takes me from here, I will always carry you in my heart and forever be a fan</p>
