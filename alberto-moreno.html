  <p>[Liverpool left-back Alberto Moreno has spoken out against manager Jurgen Klopp after being dropped for Andy Robertson] I didn’t feel [the decision to stick with Robertson] well, I was injured giving my best for our team. I disliked Klopp’s decision because I was training but when I returned he only wanted Robertson. My relationship with Klopp hasn’t changed but since this injury, I didn’t have a meeting with him but our relationship is normal. I disliked the way that Klopp has treated me but I understand his situation that he can’t change [Robertson] because the team is winning.<br /><br />The dressing room is very close, we are a family<br /><br />Liverpool has proposed renewing me but no agreement has been reached, in January the market opens and we will see. To this day we have nothing closed neither with Liverpool nor with other clubs</p>

  <p>[Alberto Moreno has paid tribute to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and their supporters following his release] Hi Reds. Life goes in cycles, and mine at my beloved <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool FC</a> has drawn to an end. Upon reaching this point, I would like to thank the entire <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> family: my dear teammates, with whom I have shared five marvellous years and who I will forever think of a family, and of course, the owners, directors, coaching staff, doctos, physios, kitmen, and each and every person at the club.<br /><br />Thank you for making me a better footballer and, above all, a better person; for helping me fulfil one of my childhood dreams by winning the Champions League and, in doing so, to become a small part of the history of this great club. My gratitude too to the city, which embraced me as one of its own from day one and which will live on in my memory whenever I look at my son, Alberto Jr., a Liverpudlian himself. Finally, a very special thank you to the club’s superb fans, who always supported me. I wish you all at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool FC</a> the greatest successes. Wherever life takes me from here, I will always carry you in my heart and forever be a fan</p>
