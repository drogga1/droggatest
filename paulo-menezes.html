<blockquote>
  <p>[Defending champions Aizawl FC appoint Portuguese Paulo Menezes as head coach] I have learnt about Indian football since 4 years ago and I have spoken to many people about it and how much it has grown over the years. I want to be part of this and Aizawl FC is right at the heartbeat of this crescendo of development.<br /><br />Clubs must be receptive to the idea of developing many departments- scouting, marketing and the most important thing, a youth academy. I believe that in order to be the best club in the country or this region, it is a must to build a strong academy<br /><br />I will like my players to play the offensive game with a high level of ball possession so that they can create many scoring chances. Depending on the game situation, we will vary the tempo of our attack but the main focus is on ball [retention]<br /><br />I will like to help the players improve their skills- be it technically or tactically, so they can become more competitive and maintain a strong mentality before and during the game. I believe I can contribute to Indian football by getting as many of the local players into the National Team as possible. I derive an immense sense of pride whenever I see my players put on their national colours</p>
