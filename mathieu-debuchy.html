  <p><b>[Mathieu Debuchy says <a href="william-saliba.html">William Saliba</a> is being backed to be a great player for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> He’s a great player. I’m so happy for him to play next season for a big club like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. He improves every game and I think he is a great player. He’s strong with good technique. He’s quick, too. I think he has a lot of quality to play at Arsenal<br /><br />He’s like a big man - he’s only 18 but he’s like a big man. The way he plays, him and Wesley Fofana are both fantastic. The future looks bright for them and I hope they continue in the same way. He’s strong and hopefully he will adapt himself really quickly. In a club like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> with French players I think he can do really well</p>
