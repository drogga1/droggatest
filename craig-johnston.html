  <p><b>[Craig Johnston says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> should be mentioned in the same breath as <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> icon <a href="bill-shankly.html">Bill Shankly</a> after the club’s stunning Champions League comeback]</b> I was at the club for a long, long time and the name <a href="bill-shankly.html">Bill Shankly</a> would always come up. There’d always be a story from the old guys there like <a href="tommy-smith.html">Tommy Smith</a>. Having seen dozens of managers come through, two words come to mind: <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>.<br /><br />You’re mentioning him in the same breath as <a href="bill-shankly.html">Bill Shankly</a>. You don’t have to say much more. When talking about <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, I think heart, love, desire, passion, knowledge, craft, team spirit, fantasy because he has a touch of the fantasist about him and so do the Scousers. He has a sense of humour. He’s genuinely funny. He recognises the Scousers like <a href="bill-shankly.html">Shankly</a> did. He wasn’t a Scouser<br /><br /><b>[Asked if <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is already a legend at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, Johnston replied]</b> Yes, because I think they’ve overperformed. If I had to say something else, if you look at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s team, they’ve underperformed. When you think about the stars on the field <b>[against]</b> <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> last night … <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> was man of the match for me. That’s guts. He was a star and held it together. Is Jurgen a legend? Absolutely. Even if they don’t win anything, God forbid that won’t happen. They’ve won so much, imagine all the hearts around the world won last night. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> will love us now. He’s an absolute legend<br /><br />What you have to understand is this is a very unique city with unique people. They’re not Mancunians, Londoners or Geordies. They have this really romantic vision of life sometimes and ironic sense of humour. They’re different and incredibly hopeful and they always punch above their weight.<br /><br />I haven’t seen it in too many other cities like it is in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Firstly, it’s the people and then you have a fortress like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> and that’s what it is. <a href="bill-shankly.html">Bill Shankly</a> said ‘I’m going to build a fortress’ and ‘give me an army full of Scousers and I’ll build you a team to beat the bloody world’.<br /><br />So you have the history, the people and the fortress. You have history and track record of winning and turning things around. It’s David v Goliath and whenever <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are the little guys, they come up big.<br /><br />If you look at the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team without <b>[Mohamed]</b> <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> and <b>[Roberto]</b> <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> and you’d said before the game, ‘How many would get into the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> team?’ You’d go ‘I don’t know’. After the game, you’d say all of them.<br /><br />The funny thing in our day when we were winning everything, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> had the best players and stars, we had <b>[Kenny]</b> <a href="kenny-dalglish.html">Dalglish</a>, <b>[Ian]</b> Rush, <b>[Graeme]</b> <a href="graeme-souness.html">Souness</a> and <b>[Alan]</b> Hansen down the middle. But we had a lot of grafters, like last night. That was a grafter’s performance against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. It created an energy that even <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> just went ‘oh my goodness’ and got a touch of the scaredy pants half way through and started to make mistakes.<br /><br />The other thing is <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> actually played well. That’s the remarkable thing for me is they played incredibly well. That just shows you how good <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were.</p>
