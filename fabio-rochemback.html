  <p><b>[Former Barcelona and Brazil midfielder Fabio Rochemback was taken into custody at the weekend for allegedly participating in an illegal cockfight. Promoter Marcos Eduardo Rauber said]</b> It was a huge event, an inter-state affair, with people from Santa Catarina and Parana. There were a lot of people and a lot of money moving around. Everyone was caught in the act, some betting, others just watching. The participants will now be exposed, but everyone was arrested for environmental crimes.</p>
