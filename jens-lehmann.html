  <p><b>[Jens Lehmann says Germany Should Aim To Win 2014 World Cup]</b> Before the World Cup, nobody really knew for certain what the current team was capable of, so what then happened was a positive surprise. Not only was the dynamism and general play pleasing, but the emergence of the likes of <a href="sami-khedira.html">Sami Khedira</a> and <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Oezil</a> was a real bonus. They had not really starred on the big stage up to that point, and came up trumps in South Africa. Now they’re both at one of the biggest clubs in the world, and you have to admire them for that. However, at the end of the day, it wasn’t actually an improvement on the World Cup in 2006, because Germany finished third again. That’s where work still needs to be done. It’s not enough just to play attractive football and go a reasonably long way, you have to win trophies from time to time. After losing to Spain in the final at the EURO and the semi-final at the World Cup, you have to be aiming to beat them next time out. Germany should aim to win the 2014 World Cup. We’ll have to wait and see just how far the key players are prepared to push themselves</p>

  <p><b>[Jens Lehmann has revealed that he introduced a yoga teacher to Arsenal]</b> When I came here in 2003 my wife went to yoga and took me there. I thought it was really good and I’ve done it once a week since. When I left in 2008 I was in much better condition than when I arrived but that was also down to a different training routine and gym exercises. After leaving I introduced a yoga teacher to Arsenal - she is a good friend of my wife and always went there to give classes. At the beginning there were two or three <b>[players]</b> and now there are a lot of players doing yoga.<br /><br />Tony Colbert introduced some full body exercises to me which was very helpful. We had a change in the German national team when Jurgen Klinsmann brought in Mark Verstegen from Athletes’ Performance. He’s regarded as the guru of fitness in athletic coaching and has the same approach. He’s offering his services to a lot of clubs in Europe and across the world right now. The change was big. For me it was fantastic because the German players didn’t know about it. I had this advantage over German goalkeepers like Oliver Khan and others because I was training differently.<br /><br />I think there was <b>[nutritious]</b> food that’s been discovered by teams in recent years. When I came to Arsenal it was Arsene Wenger who was focused on that as well - the same food for the games. He was very focused on good food after training. They recently brought in a German chef who has brought in something new<br /><br />I liked to have fish, chicken and vegetables before a game. We had many pre-match meals throughout the season and it was only about the quality - it was always the same<br /><br />I play football, I do yoga. I play in a team with guys between 25 and 55. There’s one guy who is 58 and really fit. I have my own group of ex-pros who play as well. I train once a week on average. I think if I were a player I would do more. If you look at Cristiano Ronaldo he’s a fantastic athlete, he understood the major part of his game is his athleticism. Some other players don’t know about it or are probably too lazy to do it<br /><br />I haven’t seen him <b>[Mustafi]</b> that many times because he’s been playing in Italy and Spain but he’s doing really well. I need to ask him how he adapts to the English way and adapts his physique. Mesut Ozil realised when he came here that he needed to adapt physically because he was a guy with arms like sticks and he’s improved now which is impressive<br /><br /><b>[Mustafi revealed that his experience playing in other countries at a young age has helped him mature as a player and person]</b> It’s fantastic for his personality. Not that many German players did that. I was in Italy and it shaped my personality as well. You have to be modest and always accept that there are other good players because most of the time you go to a big club, not an average club because then you can stay in Germany.<br /><br />It was a great way to develop your character particularly when you come back to your own country. When you make it as a national player in your own country everybody thinks you’re great but when you go someone else you find out ‘oh, I’m small!’</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez would fit in at Bayern Munich]</b> He would fit in at Bayern, although he is not the typical wide player they are seeking. He likes to cut inside, I have seen players that make better decisions on the pitch, but perhaps he can learn that. He is a street footballer, you notice that when he is on the pitch. Playing him in a system is not so easy but it would be nice to see him in the Bundesliga.</p>

  <p><b>[What <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> told me after Champions League final heartbreak]</b> The manager from whom I learned the most is <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsène Wenger</a>. He is a perfectionist, who does not only know how to defend but who has an exact idea of the game’s movement when going forwards. The possibility of training moves and automatisms forwards as well as backwards appears not to exist in some managers’ awareness. That concept has found its master in <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>, who, over a longer period, has always been successful with his analytical and perceptive way of working. Not for nothing has he won big titles in all his jobs in France, Japan and England - only the Champions League trophy has eluded him so far, unfortunately<br /><br /><b>[…]</b> The club’s politics dictated a maximum of year-long contracts for over-thirties; <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> believed it to be the only way of meeting <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s enormous physical standards. To my luck, being keeper made me an exception, and in any case, at 33 I was already the oldest player <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> had ever signed. When, eventually, my age and the successes of the previous years meant I was becoming too dominant, I had to leave, so as not to stand in the way of a new team hierarchy - a tough decision but a reasonable one at that. Aside from his eloquence, <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> is someone who does not speak a word in excess. He does not argue loudly but rather builds incredible pressure through his silence and perfectionism. Occasionally, during shooting practice, he would stand motionless behind my goal, his arms crossed. When I failed to save a shot, I knew that he was raising an eyebrow in utter disdain<br /><br /><b>[…]</b> As a result, I always tried to build myself up beforehand: there are twelve players coming up, each of whom is going to aim at your goal two or three times. Don’t let a single one pass, or the boss is going to wonder immediately whether you’re too old now. Situations like this required some getting to grips with, as did sentences like this: ‘Jens, the next half a year needs to be perfect; only then can we still achieve something.’ When the reporters kept asking me in the build-up to the 2006 World Cup whether the fight for number one was putting me under too much pressure, I always said, ‘The real pressure is at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. This here, this is incidental</p>

  <p><b>[on winning ugly]</b> After we had won <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> on penalties, he once said that he never actually enjoyed the win, because our success had not been based on his way of playing but rather on ‘winning ugly’, as they say in England. Dirty victories were not his cup of tea. On the return flight from the Champions League final in which I had been sent of and we ended up losing 1-2 to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, he sat next to me and said, ‘I knew that if they scored one, we could no longer win.’ I was confused: we had gained a 1-0 lead after my red card; surely, conceding did not mean all was lost. It merely meant parking the bus and pulling the handbrake, followed by winning on penalties</p>

  <p><b>[How <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal FC</a> treats seasoned players]</b> Notwithstanding all tactical brilliance, needless to say that I have suffered under him on occasion: after all, he removed me from goal twice.

Time and again, the boss viewed the statistics, and as soon as he noticed a player’s running time or playing time decrease, he would rather sell him at once and at a handsome profit, than let him enjoy pleasant footballing twilight years in London</p>

It’s a different style of game, a different expectation, and obviously a different competition. Sometimes these guys aren’t used to that competition. I don’t know how he’s doing in training, but it tells you something if a guy who cost £20m, and has been chosen by the new manager, is not playing. That’s the strength of the squad, a misjudgement probably, but no-one knows because we are not there in training. We don’t know who the coaches like. If he tries a new player out, if not the other guy is playing. Bernd is a good ‘keeper, no doubt about that. The question is: can he show more than he did in the past?

  <p><b>[While <a href="petr-cech.html">Cech</a> was favoured against City, the veteran 36-year-old looked far from comfortable at times in his efforts to embrace Emery’s philosophy of playing out from the back]</b> He is still a fantastic goalkeeper and apparently he had to change his style, but sometimes the game tells you what to do and not the other way round. I was a bit surprised that every time he tried to play out, which is not possible, nobody can dictate to you when to play out. He is very intelligent so he knows when to play out and when not to. Petr has played hundreds of games and I think sometimes he would have kicked it long before, now he is under pressure this year. The game dictates what to do and not a certain style you have to play. Even at the age of 36 you can practice and improve, but it’s the amount of passes you have to do.

Not easily, but we would have won because we had more individual class than what <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have. It’s very hard to compare but when I look at the individual quality we had and the pace we had, then I think we would have had the edge</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> goalkeeper Jens Lehmann has backed the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>’s upcoming return, saying that the coronavirus isn’t a ‘big concern’ for healthy, young athletes]</b> In the end, you have to live with it, because the only thing that this lockdown is based on is the hope that eventually we are going to find a vaccine or some medicine which cures it. But there’s only hope. So far we don’t have anything. Because of that, you cannot shut down everything. So you have to get on with it. As long as the symptoms are not that bad, I think players have to cope with it. We have plenty of players who were actually infected, and most of them did not even show any symptoms. So I think for young, healthy, people with a strong immune system it’s not such a big concern</p>

  <p><b>[Jens Lehmann says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> made a mistake appointing Emery]</b> I was there as an assistant coach two years ago but then Arsene has left and they have changed the whole managerial team and I think they made a mistake by choosing the wrong guys. The people at the top sometimes don’t know what I know about football and they didn’t experience how to win things. So it’s not easy for them. I think he wanted to bring his own staff who couldn’t even speak English. Then a guy like me, who was a player for them, I think he just didn’t want us. I think it was a big present to him that he was picked as a manager for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because I think he was not good enough because he had this lingual problem. He may have some good ideas in Spanish but he never came across as being transferrable to English football</p>
