  <p>[Tom Davies showed Manchester City’s under-performing stars just what kind of spark they’re missing right now with a stunning solo strike in Everton’s 4-0 rampage] Rom’s trying to claim it, but it’s definitely mine. I had a chance and managed to take it thankfully. It was surreal being with the first team in general. It’s a great feeling.</p>

  <p>[Everton star Davies hoping to shine at Old Trafford] It’d be nice, eh? It’s a very good chance for us to get a result. They’re in a bit of a sticky situation and we have to try and take advantage of that and make life hard for them. They’re not doing so well, and we’ve come off the back of three wins so our confidence is very high. We’re going there looking to get the three points.<br /><br />[And to enjoy it, too?] Of course! I love playing there. The games I’ve played there, we haven’t got the results. But I love the stadium and I love playing there. Fingers crossed I’ll get the chance<br /><br />[On mental health] It was an eye-opener for me, to be honest. People need to start recognising that it’s not a problem. It’s something that we can deal with. Football can instil that type of environment at times, where you don’t want to show any sign of weakness. I know I’ve always been like that myself. You try to deal with things as they go. But at the same time, it doesn’t have to be seen as a weakness. I know I have people in the team who I can go to if I’m struggling. Even the [young] lads I came through with, we can speak about these things and to me that’s only a good thing. The awareness is growing<br /><br />I learned a lot. The last year was difficult, and I didn’t get much of a kick to be honest. There were a lot of changes and it never seemed like I could get my performances going, or get settled into a routine. I found it tough, but I’ve come through it and definitely learned from it. This year I’m re-focused and looking to kick on again<br /><br />Possibly, yeah. I set the bar so high and people want you to reach that again straight away. It was difficult for me to do that last season, but I feel like I’m getting back to it now<br /><br />[Davies was handed the captain’s armband] It was a bit mad, really. I didn’t find out until we got into the changing room. I’d been captain in pre-season against Porto when Ashley Williams went off, so I did kind of have a thought that maybe if it was up for grabs then I’d be one of the players in the hat. But I didn’t find out until just before kick-off. Obviously playing with Kieran [Dowell], Dom [Calvert-Lewin], Jonjoe [Kenny], all the lads I’ve come through the academy with, and I’m there to be the captain of the side, it was unbelievable. And then from there, to captain Everton in the Premier League [against Arsenal, Fulham and Leicester], it’s one of those things you can’t really describe. I was so proud<br /><br />[Tuttosport’s Golden Boy shortlist, alongside the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Christian Pulisic and Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold] It was a surprise, but a great achievement for me. But I just want to continue on. It’s good to be named on something like that, but you can always do better<br /><br />[On Alexander-Arnold] I see him out and about and we speak. He’s doing brilliantly, credit to him. He’s another one you can look to. You see him doing so well and you think ‘why can’t I?’ I can take a lot from him in that regard<br /><br />Why not? My ambition with Everton has always been to win something, that hasn’t changed. And as a kid I always wanted to play for England - to reach that level is something everyone dreams of and I am no different. I’m just working hard and waiting for my opportunity. All I can do is what I’m doing here, and hopefully one day I’ll get that shout. Then it’s up to me to take it</p>

  <p>[Tom Davies says Sunday’s massive Merseyside derby will be an opportunity] It’s a massive game. The whole city loves them and I’ll be up for it so for me it’s a big game and a chance to show everyone how good you are. They’re doing well, they obviously need to keep it up and we’re looking to keep going in the league and try to beat them so it’ll definitely be one they want to win and we want to stop them from winning. It’s a game that can go any way, form goes out the window and it comes down to the game really. We’ll definitely be up for it, as Liverpool will as well, so it should be exciting to watch. It’ll be a massive game and I can’t wait for it.<br /><br />Yeah of course. It’s the team I’ve grown up supporting and I love. There’s no reason for me to move and I love being here, so for me it’s definitely somewhere I want to stay. We’ve got a few leaders in the dressing room and it’s something I’d like to do myself one day, especially as I’ve had my time being captain, so I’d like to be like that in the dressing room definitely<br /><br />We know we can do better. We’ve had a lot of changes in the last few years, this year has been about getting a bit of stability back. We’ve shown some good performances and some not so good so it’s just trying to find that consistency for the rest of the season now and we’re just going to try to win as many games as we can. If there’s a lot of change it’s hard for people to get in the groove. For me playing it’s been like that, it’s been tough to find my form really with all the changes going on and being in and out of the side, so yeah I don’t think people take that into consideration, how many changes we’ve had. I think we just need a bit more time to figure out our playing style now and get that going on the pitch<br /><br />You learn a lot from each different manager really and they’ve had a lot of different styles, types of play and ways of managing and how they want you to play. For me it’s been good, I’ve learnt a lot about myself really, by being in those situations so it’s all there for me now in the future<br /><br />I definitely learnt a lot from a lot of players, but I would say Gareth Barry, he helped my game a lot really just by having him behind me and playing with him. He would always talk to me and tell me, bring me that calmness that I needed in my game. He would always be there if I was beaten or if I’d mess up, he would always help me out. And likewise when attacking, if I was in position he would find me. For me he’s been a big one, he’s one of those where you don’t realise how good he is until you play with him. Whenever I played with him he stood up for me, I could go forward as much as I wanted and he would always be behind me</p>
