<blockquote>
  <p>[Emerson Palmieri and brother Giovanni out to conquer the world] Each one of us followed our path according to the opportunities we had at those moments. It is normal for us to have differences in our trajectories. Most importantly, we are very proud of the path we have taken to get to where we are today. We went through a lot. I think our parents and our family are very close. Our parents always did all they could so we had what we did to eat, they helped us to grow up with an education and so we could fight for our dreams. To me, they are my biggest references and bigger than any former player. While it is a dreamy childhood, when you imagine becoming a player and playing in big clubs, it is also a period of great challenges and sacrifices. It’s all that context of leaving home early, trying life in other cities, missing family and never giving up on your dream of becoming a professional football player. We always played a lot and tried to always learn something from each other. We have always had a relationship of great loyalty and friendship, which certainly facilitated our development. Is was very difficult. You have to fight and believe a lot. We usually say that only five per cent of the boys who try to become football players can. The competition is very large and the obstacles even greater. You have to have perseverance and belief in your dream regardless of the circumstances.<br /><br />As an older brother, I always try to advise him with some situations I’ve been through and what I think is right. But I also get advice from him. We help each other. He has been building a brilliant career, full of moves to great clubs and his call for the Italian team. It’s a very beautiful career. I hope the new chapters of his career continue to help his rise, for he has worked hard to achieve these goals. I was proud to see my brother go through so much and get a place in the Italian national team. It filled me with pride and he’s really worthy of everything he’s been getting. I knew he could adapt [in Europe]. He is a winning guy, with a lot of personality and, like me, a dreamer. He knew that he would overcome any obstacle to remain in steady pursuit of his dreams. Of course, it is a different environment and coming to England requires a period of adaptation, but I think Emerson has been able to get to grips with it. Whenever I can, I watch and I pray for him. Of course, I am very happy and proud. I want him to continue believing in his dreams with humility and perseverance. I believe in a bright future for him and he can continue to be a source of pride for all of us<br /><br />Yes, it is certainly a source of pride. When I received the proposal from America I knew the responsibility of wearing that shirt. It is a club with a lot of tradition and owner of a beautiful story. I hope to continue to contribute so that new chapters of this beautiful story can emerge. It was a special moment [to achieve promotion]. There are campaigns that mark us forever, and this was certainly one of those. I am a dreamer who fights hard for professional and personal goals. I just want to improve every day</p>
