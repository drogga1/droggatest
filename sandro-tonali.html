  <p><b>[Differences between Tonali and Pirlo]</b> I’m not thinking about moving to another club and I won’t think about it until the end of this season. I don’t feel the pressure. I’m happy with it, appreciate it, but nothing more.</p>

  <p><b>[Born in Lodi in May 2000, Tonali’s talent was first spotted by Piacenza as a nine-year-old, though not ever club was convinced by his ability]</b> <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> rejected me after a trial. I was eight and I was playing in attack. Disappointment? No, because then I went to Piacenza.<br /><br /><b>[Tonali, though, does not see many similarities in terms of playing style]</b> They compare me with <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Pirlo</a> because of the hair, I should get it cut! <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Pirlo</a> is unreachable. Like <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>, who is the most dynamic, or <a href="luka-modric.html">Luka Modric</a>, who is unique in his style. I see more of myself in Gennaro]&lt;/b&gt; <a href="gennaro-gattuso.html">Gattuso</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[Sandro Tonali declared he is a mix of <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Andrea Pirlo</a> and <a href="gennaro-gattuso.html">Gennaro Gattuso</a> as he compared himself to the Italy greats following his international debut]</b> It’s tough to pick one of those champions. Maybe a mix of all of them would be perfect. I guess there are similarities with <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Pirlo</a> in a way but I also add a lot of a grit in there, so maybe more Gattuso<br /><br /><b>[There was also time for Tonali to make his debut with 16 minutes remaining and he reflected on the emotion he felt when replacing <a href="federico-bernardeschi.html">Bernardeschi</a>]</b> I felt wonderful as not everyone gets to play for the national team. I was a little emotional for 30 seconds that it was really happening. The coach told us all to be ready to play so I had an idea. Everyone in the squad was very helpful to the newcomers like me and it felt easy to come in. The system is different, so is the timing and there is obviously a lot more quality in the Italy side, but the role and position remain the same</p>

  <p><b>[Sandro Tonali insisted he is not scared about his €300 million price tag as Europe’s elite eye the <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a> and Italy sensation]</b> I love president <a href="massimo-cellino.html">Cellino</a> very much and he rates me highly. He’s a great person and I hope to travel down a good road with him. After the match against <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a>, he said he wouldn’t even sell me for €300m, but that doesn’t scare me, even if it really is a lot of money.

I consider myself to be like <a href="gennaro-gattuso.html">Gattuso</a> but more technical. He’s always been my role model<br /><br />His agent and his parents were telling me about this €50 million evaluation. I replied that for me he is worth €300 million, which means I don’t want to sell. I have a dream. If Sandro accepts, I am ready to make a big financial sacrifice to extend his contract. It’s up to him to decide. He can stay here and enjoy his football or go to a big club and risk being left on the bench</p>

  <p><b>[Wonderkid Sandro Tonali names favourite player amid <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> &amp; <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> links]</b> I am not thinking about it, I don’t care, not now. And I’m not saying that to be misleading. I am just interested in finishing the season as best I can, because I still feel I have a lot to give to <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a>, who believed in me. Then, we’ll see. <a href="massimo-cellino.html">Cellino</a> says he wouldn’t even sell me for 300 million? The president loves me, like a son, and I love him very much - he always gives me important advice. I don’t know, it’s a lot of money. It is a bit of a shock to hear certain figures, but I am always quite calm and serene, it is one of my qualities<br /><br /><b>[Tonali frequently finds himself compared with Italy legend <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Andrea Pirlo</a>]</b> Because of the hair. It doesn’t bother me, but it is not a suitable comparison for me. Having similarities is one thing, but on the pitch we are very different. <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Pirlo</a>’s ability was crazy. I don’t know who will be able to reach him.<br /><br /><b>[While <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> have been the club most closely linked with a move, Tonali himself is an <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> fan]</b> Yes.

We don’t play like each other - but to say that I’m a more complete player than he was <b>[…]</b> When two of my friends sent me the Instagram live in which he said that, I stayed still. I’m still speechless now. All I can say to him is, thank you. I’d rather say what I’d like to learn from him. The long pass from deep, accurate to within a millimetre. I’m better at short passes today. Which, to tell you the truth, comes even more natural to me than the long pass. I know that with the right sacrifices, I can reach the top of the world. I haven’t achieved half of what I have in mind, but I feel good enough to make it.</p>
