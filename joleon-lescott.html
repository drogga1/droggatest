  <p><b>[Owen Hargreaves on brink of joining <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> on pay-as-you-play deal]</b> He has plenty of experience in the Champions League so it will be good for the squad. He is a great professional so it can only be good for the club</p>

  <p><b>[Joleon Lescott believes Manchester United have made an excellent signing in Harry Maguire]</b> I don’t see Man United ever finishing above Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City. It is difficult to say what happens afterwards but there is never any complacency at City. The way they treat every game the same. Every game is a must-win; every game is a cup final. There is the same level of respect shown to every opposition in the way he sets them up. Pep knows how we win this game. It is evident from their Amazon Prime documentary. Man United would admit there is a big gap between them and Man City. Maguire is not the answer to close the gap. It is not just the defensive record that wins you titles. You need three or four players who score 20 goals<br /><br /><b>[Lescott has hailed City’s team-first mentality, which may have resulted in a few of their stars being overlooked for major individual honours]</b> The way Man City play, it is not an individual that does that, it is a collective. The way Raheem Sterling plays up front and performs shows Pep’s methods. He coaches and teaches unstoppable methods. Man City is a collective. I know Pep is frustrated that his players are not getting recognised for FIFA Best Awards, but it is a credit to both him and them. No player is needed more than any other. They lost Kevin De Bruyne for most of last season and still won the league the way they did and it proves that. It is a compliment to them, but he is right that individuals deserve recognition for being so consistent with him. They won a domestic treble. Going forward, they will be determined to win everything, including the Champions League<br /><br /><b>[Maguire is set to make his debut this weekend against Chelsea, and Lescott believes that the price tag won’t have any effect on the Red Devils’ new central defender]</b> I think you have to expect people will talk about it, but I doubt people will put any more pressure on him to do well than he puts on himself. I think either at £80m or £8m; he will just want to play at his best. He is not the finished article but there aren’t many who are. I am sure he will want to improve aspects of his game. He is going to be eager to learn. There is a bit more scrutiny. That will be new to him. In terms of improving, he will want to improve every aspect. I think it will be more about playing for Manchester United. There will be more eyes on him, more criticism and more expectation.<br /><br />When you play for a top team then you have to perform and winning isn’t always enough. I am sure he is ready for that and relishing the challenge. I remember when I went to Man City I was the same, relishing the challenge and chance to become a fixture and win trophies. I am sure with Man United’s current situation he will think the same and want to get them back to the top. It won’t be easy because there are a lot of teams pushing. I wish him the best as an individual but not for his team!</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> defender Joleon Lescott has hailed <a href="vincent-kompany.html">Vincent Kompany</a> and compared him to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> legend <a href="carles-puyol.html">Carles Puyol</a> ahead of his testimonial match on Wednesday]</b> The way he conducts himself, any squad in the world would miss him when he isn’t there. He is like <a href="carles-puyol.html">Carles Puyol</a> at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. They are great captains who leave and you struggle because of their impact. He is right up there with the best City has had. He saw City before the current owners. Vinny almost saw the vision before they did. He was a great servant to the club and he was great value for money. He gave blood, sweat and tears to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>. There are a few of them; Vincent, <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> and <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a>. They have been there for so long and performed consistently. Kevin De Bruyne is a top talent and if he keeps doing it he’ll be up there. Same for <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a>. <a href="bernardo-silva.html">Bernardo Silva</a>, <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Aymeric Laporte</a> and <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a>.

  <p><b>[Joleon Lescott believes that <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> and <a href="raul-jimenez.html">Raul Jimenez</a> warned off making <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> move over lack of Champions League]</b> When you look at the spectrum of teams, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are still a big club but in terms of <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a>’s ability, if he leaves <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> he’s going to want to play Champions League and that’s not guaranteed at Man United, even in the future. I would love to see him test himself in the highest level because I think he’s capable of playing at real heights<br /><br />He’s proven that he can really perform in a team that’s been struggling this season. In terms of if he was going to move to United, it would obviously be a great move for him because it is Man United. But, in terms of how he can test himself against the very best, is he going to be able to do that at Man United as they’re not guaranteed Champions League football?<br /><br />The interest in <a href="raul-jimenez.html">Jimenez</a> doesn’t surprise me, he’s performed consistently over the past two seasons and that’s the key. He’s not just coming in and having good periods then going cold again. He’s consistently done well for the team and scored goals and proving to be a lot more than just a goal scorer<br /><br />Obviously he is their top goal scorer since he’s been there. but he’s absolutely vital to the way they play. There will, of course, be interest in him as he’s such a good player, I suppose it just depends on how realistic this interest is. For example, if it’s <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, then you may look to them as more of a possibility of playing Champions League. Whereas if you look at interest from Man United, and you look at the team’s current success - are Man United better than <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>? Are they guaranteed to finish higher than <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> next season? Who knows! <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are a big club, but the best players want to play against the best players and you do that by playing in the Champions League</p>

  <p><b>[Joleon Lescott does not think that <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a> has been treated unfairly by Pep Guardiola]</b> Only Pep knows what he sees in both players (Stones and Nicolas Otamendi) in order to pick them. He’s always rotated between him (Stones) and Otamendi. Pep’s main focus at centre half at the moment is <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a>, it seems he just picks who is most appropriate for each game. I don’t think anyone is being unfairly treated. They all are getting enough game time. Obviously players want to play every game but that’s just not realistic nowadays<br /><br />It’s hard to think who a good fit at centre-back as initially we hadn’t heard much of <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Laporte</a>, and he’s been incredible. I’m sure <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> have someone in their vision that is ready and primed to come in this summer. I know how they work with regards to the due diligence done on each player.<br /><br />They’ve got a list of players that they see are perfect. It was always going to be a massive loss when you lose Vinnie <b>[Kompany]</b> not just on the field, but around the place as well. It’s such a big loss, not just the ability he had, but the presence as well. Any top player with any team, if suddenly they’re not there, the players genuinely miss them. When you play in the biggest games against the best teams and he’s in your starting line-ups, the team play better because he has that belief and it’s a shame he’s left now, but it just goes on and football moves on</p>

  <p><b>[Former Blues defender Lescott expects <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> to overtake <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a> at some stage]</b> Regards to what he can achieve, hopefully, touch wood, he can withstand injuries, he can be the most decorated English player in history. What has he got? Two <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> titles, an FA Cup, two League Cups. He’s 20 years old. If he continues at this level and stays at City for the remainder of his career, which I hope he does, he’ll average two, three trophies a season which is going to be remarkable<br /><br /><b>[Lescott added on Foden]</b> I don’t think his quality is ever going to be in question. What he has, which I don’t see many players have, is an obsession with football. I don’t just mean love of the game - I love the game - but he’s like weirdly obsessed with the game. He walks around with a football, I did some work with England Under-21s and I had to ban footballs from the hotel because he was constantly with one at his feet. He would want to stay extra on the field and do extra stuff so I had to monitor that. His obsession for football is none like I’ve seen before<br /><br /><b>[Lescott is also tipping <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a> to make a senior international breakthrough at some stage in the near future - with the rescheduling of Euro 2020 set to work in his favour]</b> The timing of it all could benefit him especially. We’re going to miss <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a>, but if that means <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> getting more minutes, him playing more minutes for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> inevitably leads to him playing more minutes for England. Hopefully that is the case for him next season. He’s fearless, he loves the game, he’s a sponge to all information given to him. Hopefully he can get more minutes next season, then get into that Euros squad</p>
