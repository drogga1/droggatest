  <p><b>[Manchester City’s John Stones is the best because he offers something extra to most defenders]</b> Stones can obviously defend but not everyone is a Vincent Kompany and there aren’t many defenders who will be as good as Vinny in one-on-ones, in the air and so on. Vinny has his own style - I had a different style when I played alongside him, hence the reason we probably worked so well together. So, while John isn’t that style of defender, he can defend as well as most and then he has that little bit of something extra<br /><br />John can do things most defenders can’t - a little feign here and there, maybe a turn to get out of trouble when he needs to - and that’s what is going to set him apart from others - the ability to things others can’t. He’ll do his job and defend well, but there will be moments when he does something special and you’ll just go ‘ah, that’s why he’s regarded as the best’. He doesn’t seem to get fazed by anything and always seems calm and he never hides - he’s got everything and he’ll get to wherever he wants to get because we have to remember he’s still only 23. I’ve been really impressed by him, especially this season where he seems to be going from strength to strength</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin De Bruyne is the only member of Manchester City’s star-studded squad that will not be rotated by Pep Guardiola]</b> Everyone in City’s squad knows that there will be rotation. Probably apart from De Bruyne, every player will be expected to be involved in that rotation to get some rest. Mahrez is a top quality player, he’s recognised Premier League quality. Outside of City’s top players, he had the most assists in the Premier League. He’s coming in with title-winning experience, which a lot of the City players now have. It’ll be exciting for everyone to watch and see. In terms of him playing straight away, he may have to due to the lads being on international duty. Throughout the season, especially the forward players, will play a relevant number of games and have a great impact.</p>

  <p><b>[Pep Guardiola is building a legacy at Manchester City]</b> I think Pep Guardiola has started building a legacy at Manchester City that could one day be compared with what Sir Alex Ferguson achieved at Manchester United. Guardiola has already stamped his legacy on the Premier League with the records he has broken and the style of play he has brought to England. However, his overall legacy will depend on longevity rather than the number of trophies he has won. There was a lot of pressure on Guardiola when he arrived and he failed to live up to that expectation in his first season, but he quickly recognised where improvements needed to be made and Manchester City totally dominated last year like no Manchester United team ever has before. I think Guardiola is creating a club in Manchester City that will be favourites for the Premier League for the next 10 years.<br /><br />Alexis Sanchez has been struggling for form, but I don’t think he will regret moving to Manchester United over Manchester City. Manchester United and <b>[Jose]</b> Mourinho showed beyond doubt how much they wanted Sanchez at the club, so the form is down to him and he has no excuses<br /><br />Manchester City’s squad is so strong that I think it is making it more difficult to sign the players they want. I think Fred chose to go to Manchester United because it was an opportunity for him to be a permanent fixture in their midfield. Mourinho told him he would be the missing piece to the club winning the Premier League and that’s a very attractive proposal. There’s a feeling that he would have been second fiddle to Fernandinho at Manchester City, so I’m sure game time was pivotal in his decision. Jorginho is a different story. I think Jorginho’s head was turned by Chelsea purely because <b>[Maurizio]</b> Sarri, a manager who he knows and loves, went to the club. He has settled straight into that team, being the heartbeat of that central midfield and controlling the tempo in their games. I think that was the key for Jorginho</p>

  <p><b>[Wolves are right to reject any offers for Ruben Neves]</b> Ruben Neves is already being hunted by big clubs all over Europe and has been linked with some astronomical fees. Wolves have flatly rejected any notion that he may leave the club and that’s the right move, because he has been a huge star since he arrived. Hopefully he can stay healthy, because he will be crucial to Wolves achieving their ambitions this season.<br /><br />I’ve been really impressed with Nuno. He has achieved everything the club would have hoped to achieve by earning a spot in the Premier League and starting as well as they have done. I remember there was a lot of scepticism when he was appointed, pointing to his lack of experience in England, but they’re eating humble pie right now. He has created a culture and style of play which is working, and there’s no sign of that stopping now Wolves are in the Premier League.<br /><br />I think bigger clubs will be keeping an eye on Nuno and what he is doing at Wolves. The club gave him the opportunity and he grasped it with both hands, getting fantastic results and looking good while doing it.</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney convinced Joleon Lescott to join Manchester United’s arch-rivals Manchester City in 2009]</b> He <b>[the chairman]</b> sold me the story of where they wanted to be. Obviously it is easy for him to say that and see it as a vision because he is a businessman first. He believed the club was going to be where they are now. As a player I hoped that would be the case but not as quickly as it has happened. Rio will probably remember I spoke to him and Wayne <b>[Rooney]</b> at the time. Wayne being a massive Evertonian was encouraging me to go there because the ambition of the club matched me as a player. To go there and be a part of that and see it develop over time it hasn’t surprised me<br /><br />We had that extra motivation of people, players, pundits, fans only assuming that we went there for money. No-one assumed we were going there to win the title. <b>[It was said]</b> that was the only reason we went to the club, it wan’t to win the Premier League or create something, that is happening now</p>

  <p><b>[None of the players in Jurgen Klopp’s current Liverpool squad would get into Pep Guardiola’s starting line up at Manchester City]</b> Both Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp will each be happy with their own team and their players suit their styles of football. I’m not sure I’d take a single one of Liverpool’s players for Man City’s team, but it’s fair to say both have put together great squads. From a Man City perspective, I have been very impressed with Aymeric Laporte this season, who has arguably made a similar impact to what Virgil van Dijk has at Liverpool.<br /><br />I expect Manchester City to go on to win the Premier League. It is interesting that they’ve been able to overtake Liverpool so quickly. I don’t think it’s a surprise that Man City have won the games they have, but rather that Liverpool have dropped points in recent weeks. Earlier on in the season, the title could have been Liverpool’s to lose but they threw the opportunity away with a bad run of games where they didn’t achieve what they should have done. It’s now in Manchester City’s hands and I don’t expect them to let it slip. Retaining the Premier League title will be Man City’s biggest achievement and to become the first side to do it since Sir Alex Ferguson retired from Manchester United is another camel off their backs in the city</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City have been urged to make a move for Tanguy Ndombele]</b> Tanguy Ndombele could be an ideal Fernandinho replacement at Man City when the time comes. I think he has all the potential to go on to become a great player and achieve great things. I think players in Fernandinho’s position tend to get better with experience, but I think Ndombele is a player that could be a good fit.<br /><br />Wan-Bissaka is an exciting young player with his career ahead of him. He’s certainly impressed for Crystal Palace this season and inevitably, as with any young player performing well, some top teams will be linked with him. Wan-Bissaka looks to have the attributes of a player that could go on to play for a top club. I enjoy watching him as he is a full-back who enjoys defending more than attacking. He enjoys a 1v1 challenge and that’s an excellent quality<br /><br /><b>[On Isco]</b> As with any player not getting game time, it wouldn’t be a surprise if Isco is unhappy being left out at Real Madrid and he would be a good addition to Man City’s squad. He’s an excellent player that still has so much potential that Guardiola would work to develop. However, Isco would have to accept he wouldn’t be a guaranteed starter in a similar way that <b>[Riyad]</b> Mahrez has had to adapt to this season. Man City will be looking to strengthen their squad in the summer, but it has to be the right player to fit seamlessly into the team’s style of play and the operation they have set up there. The owners have created this format over the past 10 years so Guardiola and all of the players need to fit into this system to achieve global dominance for Man City</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester City defender Joleon Lescott has said he cannot see Pep Guardiola leaving the club in the foreseeable future]</b> don’t believe Pep Guardiola will move on until he has dominated Europe with Manchester. You could say it’s unfinished business as he bids to take their football to a global level. Pep has created so much success at Manchester City in such a short space of time and I believe there’s more success to come. Everyone associated with the club wants Guardiola at Manchester City and there would be a lot of disappointed fans, staff and players if he left. I don’t expect Guardiola to look to move anywhere until his contract is up in two years, at least<br /><br />I think Man Utd have potentially cleared the way for Man City to win the Champions League when they knocked PSG out of the tournament. I believe PSG were the biggest threat to Man City’s potential success in the Champions League this season. Man City could still slip up in the latter stages of the tournament through lack of experience within the squad because not many of the Man City players have as much experience within the Champions League semi-finals. It would be a shame as they are definitely ready to win the Champions League</p>

  <p><b>[Joleon Lescott believes <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> have made an excellent signing in <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a>]</b> I don’t see Man United ever finishing above <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>’s <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. It is difficult to say what happens afterwards but there is never any complacency at City. The way they treat every game the same. Every game is a must-win; every game is a cup final. There is the same level of respect shown to every opposition in the way he sets them up. Pep knows how we win this game. It is evident from their Amazon Prime documentary. Man United would admit there is a big gap between them and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>. Maguire is not the answer to close the gap. It is not just the defensive record that wins you titles. You need three or four players who score 20 goals<br /><br /><b>[Lescott has hailed City’s team-first mentality, which may have resulted in a few of their stars being overlooked for major individual honours]</b> The way <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> play, it is not an individual that does that, it is a collective. The way <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> plays up front and performs shows Pep’s methods. He coaches and teaches unstoppable methods. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> is a collective. I know Pep is frustrated that his players are not getting recognised for <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Best Awards, but it is a credit to both him and them. No player is needed more than any other. They lost Kevin De Bruyne for most of last season and still won the league the way they did and it proves that. It is a compliment to them, but he is right that individuals deserve recognition for being so consistent with him. They won a domestic treble. Going forward, they will be determined to win everything, including the Champions League<br /><br /><b>[Maguire is set to make his debut this weekend against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, and Lescott believes that the price tag won’t have any effect on the Red Devils’ new central defender]</b> I think you have to expect people will talk about it, but I doubt people will put any more pressure on him to do well than he puts on himself. I think either at £80m or £8m; he will just want to play at his best. He is not the finished article but there aren’t many who are. I am sure he will want to improve aspects of his game. He is going to be eager to learn. There is a bit more scrutiny. That will be new to him. In terms of improving, he will want to improve every aspect. I think it will be more about playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. There will be more eyes on him, more criticism and more expectation.<br /><br />When you play for a top team then you have to perform and winning isn’t always enough. I am sure he is ready for that and relishing the challenge. I remember when I went to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> I was the same, relishing the challenge and chance to become a fixture and win trophies. I am sure with Man United’s current situation he will think the same and want to get them back to the top. It won’t be easy because there are a lot of teams pushing. I wish him the best as an individual but not for his team!</p>

In terms of if he was going to move to United, it would obviously be a great move for him because it is Man United. But, in terms of how he can test himself against the very best, is he going to be able to do that at Man United as they’re not guaranteed Champions League football?<br /><br />The interest in <a href="raul-jimenez.html">Jimenez</a> doesn’t surprise me, he’s performed consistently over the past two seasons and that’s the key. He’s not just coming in and having good periods then going cold again. He’s consistently done well for the team and scored goals and proving to be a lot more than just a goal scorer<br /><br />Obviously he is their top goal scorer since he’s been there. but he’s absolutely vital to the way they play. There will, of course, be interest in him as he’s such a good player, I suppose it just depends on how realistic this interest is. For example, if it’s <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, then you may look to them as more of a possibility of playing Champions League.
