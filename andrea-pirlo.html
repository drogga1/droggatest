  <p><b>[New York City FC midfielder Andrea Pirlo on former Italy team-mate Mario Balotelli]</b> He frustrates me, but I do have so much affection for Mario. He is infectious to be around. When I used to see him walk into training for Italy, he would have this big smile on his face - and I would just burst out laughing - and start wondering what is he thinking, what is he up to? Mario should not just be a character the media write about for good stories. We shouldn’t forget what a special player he is. I have played with some of the best strikers, and I can tell you Mario has all the attributes to be one of the best strikers in the world. By now I thought that is where he would be, that is where he should be. He has no more time to waste</p>

If he goes to another team, he has to deserve his place. I’d keep him because he’s an important player. It’s not that he’s gone from one season to the next from an important player to a bad player. He’s suffering a little at the moment because of the change of formation and the arrival of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. But he’s still young. I think the <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> environment is perfect for him. Mentally, physically, he has to understand that in Europe there’s another rythm; it’s not the Italian league.

I studied him intently, collecting DVDs, even old photographs of games he’d played. And eventually I understood. It wasn’t an immediate discovery; it took patience and perseverance.

Then the club spent well on players that fit well with the coach’s ideas. A serious club does the rest.

He has everything to be a champion but he is more a midfielder for a two-man midfield. He could already play for a great team; he is the best in this league<br /><br /><b>[After retiring from the game in 2017, he is ready to return to it in a coaching role]</b> I have already spoken to someone, I will start in July. I really want to start a new, totally different path. I think I can become a good football coach, I can pass on my ideas. I have my personality, I have always made myself heard and understood. Playing well helps you get there.<br /><br /><b>[Pirlo credits former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> manager <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> as his coaching inspiration]</b> It was because of <b>[Conte]</b> that I started thinking about being a coach. He is the best I have had, he showed us 40 to 50 minutes of videos every day. I told myself I could do it and I wanted to do it too. Getting started was the important thing.<br /><br />In the next few months I will go and follow <b>[Sarri]</b> in his day-to-day work, to find out his methods. There is some negativity around him, perhaps because the fans expected more. But <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> has done well wherever he has gone, from Naples to London, and now to <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> where he is leading another big season. <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> can win the Champions League.

He is another type of player. He is much more complete both in the defensive phase and when he sets up. He is a mix between my characteristics and those of other players. He is the most promising of midfielders. He will surely become a great player<br /><br />There are undoubtedly important prospects for Sandro, at his age few get the chance <b>[to move to a big club]</b>. It’s better for Sandro to stay in Italy. He can immediately establish himself at a top club and for <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> it would be a shame to lose him<br /><br />Health comes first, then if you can finish the championship then all the better. It won’t be an easy choice. We hope it will happen. Football makes many people work, maximum safety must be guaranteed. If one person is infected, everything must be blocked again</p>
