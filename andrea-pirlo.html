Against Malta and Bulgaria we have two important matches. I had hoped I would be included and I hope to have other opportunities. These are big games because we still have to play to qualify.<br /><br />I didn’t think that Juve could lose to Udinese. But the Italian league is difficult, there are pitfalls in every game. But I believe that they are still the best team. I think they will win against Roma because they are the champion, although Roma has strengthened a lot and are trying to reach the level of Juventus. It will certainly be a balanced game and nice to see.<br /><br />It is not going very well, but we are working hard and unfortunately we have a hard time getting points. The important thing now is to go to Italy and do well with the national team</p>

  <p><b>[Andrea Pirlo believes playing in MLS could be partially to blame if he misses out on Italy’s final Euro 2016 roster]</b> When someone decides to come to the U.S., he knows what he’s getting into. I reflected on this and I knew what the risks were. It’s clear that anyone who plays in Belgium or another league with less quality still has a chance of making the Champions League or the Europa League. And that’s what makes the difference.<br /><br />Conte has still not named the final squad. The players who are still playing in official games have not been called up. Sebastian <b>[Giovinco, of Toronto FC]</b> and I talked to Conte about the decision.

  <p><b>[Italy get sweet revenge on Spain in Conte masterclass]</b> It would have been perfect to take revenge in another final but you can do that in the round of 16, too….<br /><br />Conte is able to impose a very precise identity on the team. Organisation is key for him, so players come and go with no difference, as everyone knows what they are meant to do down to the smallest detail. The feeling you get when you play is that you can hurt the opposition at any moment because what you worked on to the point of exhaustion really does pay off in a match situation</p>

He is infectious to be around. When I used to see him walk into training for Italy, he would have this big smile on his face - and I would just burst out laughing - and start wondering what is he thinking, what is he up to? Mario should not just be a character the media write about for good stories. We shouldn’t forget what a special player he is. I have played with some of the best strikers, and I can tell you Mario has all the attributes to be one of the best strikers in the world. By now I thought that is where he would be, that is where he should be. He has no more time to waste</p>

I cried on the field, then returned to the dressing room and it was even worse. There was an atmosphere so surreal in there that I couldn’t even cry.

At Milan we had <b>[David]</b> Beckham, Ronaldinho, <b>[Clarence]</b> Seedorf … a lot of good kickers. We talked to each other, we watched each other and we stole each other’s secrets. I used to watch Juninho’s free-kicks without being able to figure out how he hit them. I tried and tried, until eventually I came up with my own way to strike them. I was by myself trying all types of free-kicks.<br /><br /><b>[Asked for his free-kick secrets]</b> I’d tell myself it was impossible not to score. It was enough just to get the ball over the wall and it was a goal. In football, like in life, there are always millimetres which can change things, the course of a goal, or of a life. It’s a sign of destiny, a natural talent which my parents gave me. To come in front of the ball, find the right position … it always seemed so simple to me, but it might not be for others. It’s completely natural, I’d do it without even thinking about it.<br /><br />I had to prepare the moment perfectly. I didn’t want the ball to be dirty. I wanted it to be clean, beautiful. So I cleaned it before I shot. I didn’t quite hit it with my instep, or even the inside of my foot, it was more the two toes at the tip of the foot. I was often ready to celebrate before the ball had gone into the goal. By judging the trajectory of the ball, I knew intuitively whether or not it would be a goal</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronado tilts Champions League balance in favour of Juventus]</b> Cristiano Ronaldo can bring that something extra, which Juventus need. I’m happy that a great champion has joined Juve. Buying a player like him doesn’t win you the Champions League alone, but you get a lot closer to it. Ronaldo is a player who tilts balances, and he can help Juventus win the Champions League. He’s a top player, he’ll make the difference and we’ll see something beautiful.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba completing a second switch from Manchester United to Juventus would come as no surprise]</b> It would not surprise me because Juventus is looking for the best and if one player goes away it is not said that they cannot return.<br /><br /><b>[On Paulo Dybala]</b> If he starts training with the desire of Ronaldo then it will be difficult to leave him out. When you do not play, it means that you have to do something more. 	The qualities of Dybala are not in question. To become a fundamental player for Juventus he must find something inside him, he must do it first of all for himself</p>

Meanwhile in Serie A, Juventus have shown and are proving to be a step or two steps above the others<br /><br />Cristiano Ronaldo? My friends - his coaches, like Ancelotti - tell me he is a serious professional and a humble person. I’m not surprised at all, the results on the pitch are showing that<br /><br />Cristiano Ronaldo, Pjanic or Dybala? They have a great choice now because all three are very good shooters, but now Pjanic and Dybala might find it a bit more difficult because maybe the priority goes to Cristiano Ronaldo</p>
