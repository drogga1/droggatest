Against Malta and Bulgaria we have two important matches. I had hoped I would be included and I hope to have other opportunities. These are big games because we still have to play to qualify.<br /><br />I didn’t think that Juve could lose to Udinese. But the Italian league is difficult, there are pitfalls in every game. But I believe that they are still the best team. I think they will win against Roma because they are the champion, although Roma has strengthened a lot and are trying to reach the level of Juventus. It will certainly be a balanced game and nice to see.<br /><br />It is not going very well, but we are working hard and unfortunately we have a hard time getting points. The important thing now is to go to Italy and do well with the national team</p>

He is infectious to be around. When I used to see him walk into training for Italy, he would have this big smile on his face - and I would just burst out laughing - and start wondering what is he thinking, what is he up to? Mario should not just be a character the media write about for good stories. We shouldn’t forget what a special player he is. I have played with some of the best strikers, and I can tell you Mario has all the attributes to be one of the best strikers in the world. By now I thought that is where he would be, that is where he should be. He has no more time to waste</p>

  <p><b>[Lionel Messi can’t claim to be the best player of all time unless he wins the World Cup]</b> It will be important for both Messi himself and for Argentina to win the World Cup in Russia. Messi is always compared to Maradona but he needs to win the World Cup because if you don’t win the World Cup you can’t be up there with the very best.<br /><br />Argentina have had the time now to improve and find the right players for the World Cup and I think they are going to do well in Russia despite the big loss they had against Spain. Argentina have a lot of good players and if their top players perform they are going to do well<br /><br /><b>[Luis Suarez biting Giorgio Chiellini]</b> After the game, the Italy players and myself were just depressed by the result. The biting incident was something else but we were more down because we had lost and gone out of the World Cup. It was an incident that can happen on the pitch and in this case the referee didn’t see it<br /><br />My favourite England player is Harry Kane. He’s really good and powerful, he’s scored so many goals in the last years and he is one of the players I am going to follow closely at the World Cup<br /><br />As Italy are not there, I will not be supporting any team in particular.

  <p><b>[Andrea Pirlo has snubbed both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as he picked his all-time dream World Cup team]</b> In goal, I would choose Gianluigi Buffon. Buffon is the best goalkeeper of all time. He can be considered the best because he has played for over 20 years at the same very high level. I would put Paolo Maldini in defence and I would have to pick myself in midfield, of course. Then in attack I would have Ronaldo - the Brazilian Ronaldo that is - along with Diego Maradona and Pele.<br /><br />It was unbelievable. To win the World Cup is the best thing that can happen to you as a footballer. It happened to me and it was probably the best moment of my career<br /><br />It was a moment filled with such tension so I was hugging Cannavaro and asking him if we would win the cup if Grosso scored. There was so much pressure that I really didn’t know what the situation was!<br /><br /><b>[So what went wrong?]</b> Italy went into the 2010 World Cup not in the best condition. I was injured going into the tournament and only managed to play 20 minutes of the last group game against Slovakia. It wasn’t a great World Cup for Italy. Buffon also got injured in the first game <b>[against Paraguay]</b> and couldn’t play after. It’s just a pity because Italy could have gone far</p>

All three of them take free-kicks very well.<br /><br /><b>[Free agent Balotelli had not played for the Azzurri since the 2014 World Cup]</b> I am really happy that Balotelli is back playing for the Italy national team. He’s been playing really well in the past two years and he deserves the recall. I don’t know which club Balotelli is going to be playing for next season but I am sure that a lot of big clubs are going to be after him. It is up to him to choose himself the best option<br /><br /><b>[Becoming Italy manager Roberto Mancini’s assistant coach]</b> I spoke with Mancini about the role.

Ronaldo is a player who tilts balances, and he can help Juventus win the Champions League. He’s a top player, he’ll make the difference and we’ll see something beautiful.</p>

When you do not play, it means that you have to do something more. 	The qualities of Dybala are not in question.

Meanwhile in Serie A, Juventus have shown and are proving to be a step or two steps above the others<br /><br />Cristiano Ronaldo? My friends - his coaches, like Ancelotti - tell me he is a serious professional and a humble person. I’m not surprised at all, the results on the pitch are showing that<br /><br />Cristiano Ronaldo, Pjanic or Dybala? They have a great choice now because all three are very good shooters, but now Pjanic and Dybala might find it a bit more difficult because maybe the priority goes to Cristiano Ronaldo</p>

There was little quality in midfield. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> deserved the victory for the season they have had but also for these supporters</p>

  <p><b>[As iconic midfielder and former team-mate Andrea Pirlo harshly - but fairly - asked about <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Paulo Dybala</a> at the tail end of last season]</b> In what other top team would <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> play? If he goes to another team, he has to deserve his place. I’d keep him because he’s a great player. It’s not as if he’s gone from a great player to a bad player from one season to the next. But he’s suffering because of the change of formation and the arrival of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. Mentally and physically, he has to understand that in Europe there’s another rhythm; it’s not the Italian league. If he wants to reach certain levels, he has to improve in everything</p>

  <p><b>[Andrea Pirlo, taken from his autobiography, in which he touches upon the technique of <a href="juninho.html">Juninho</a>]</b> During his time at <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>, that man made the ball do some quite extraordinary things. He’d lay it on the ground, twist his body into a few strange shapes, take his run-up and score. He never got it wrong. Never. I checked out his stats and realised it couldn’t just be chance. I studied him intently, collecting DVDs, even old photographs of games he’d played. And eventually I understood. It wasn’t an immediate discovery; it took patience and perseverance. From the start, I could tell he struck the ball in an unusual way. I could see the ‘what’ but not the ‘how’</p>

  <p><b>[Pirlo unsurprised by <a href="inter-milan.html">Intermilan</a> resurgence]</b> Not at all, because I know him too well. I knew Inter would be at this level, fighting for the league title until the end. He always leads you to give your best, to play better than you think you can. He is addicted to winning, if he loses you can’t talk to him. He becomes a devil!<br /><br /><b>[Their good season so far hasn’t been a one-man show, but Pirlo believes most of the credit has to go to <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>]</b> Him especially. Then the club spent well on players that fit well with the coach’s ideas. A serious club does the rest. Today <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> are so strong because they have quality in every position - the team was built by getting one player at a time better than the last. But I am sure Inter will fight to the end<br /><br /><b>[Pirlo said of Eriksen]</b> He is an excellent player. He will raise their level. He needs time because he is coming from a very different championship</p>

He has everything to be a champion but he is more a midfielder for a two-man midfield. He could already play for a great team; he is the best in this league<br /><br /><b>[After retiring from the game in 2017, he is ready to return to it in a coaching role]</b> I have already spoken to someone, I will start in July. I really want to start a new, totally different path. I think I can become a good football coach, I can pass on my ideas. I have my personality, I have always made myself heard and understood. Playing well helps you get there.<br /><br /><b>[Pirlo credits former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> manager <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> as his coaching inspiration]</b> It was because of <b>[<a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>]</b> that I started thinking about being a coach. He is the best I have had, he showed us 40 to 50 minutes of videos every day. I told myself I could do it and I wanted to do it too. Getting started was the important thing.<br /><br />In the next few months I will go and follow <b>[<a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>]</b> in his day-to-day work, to find out his methods. There is some negativity around him, perhaps because the fans expected more. But <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> has done well wherever he has gone, from Naples to London, and now to <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> where he is leading another big season. <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> can win the Champions League.

  <p><b>[Andrea Pirlo played down talk <a href="sandro-tonali.html">Sandro Tonali</a> was similar to him]</b> It is said that he may be my heir, but I don’t see many things in common. He is another type of player. He is much more complete both in the defensive phase and when he sets up. He is a mix between my characteristics and those of other players. He is the most promising of midfielders. He will surely become a great player<br /><br />There are undoubtedly important prospects for Sandro, at his age few get the chance <b>[to move to a big club]</b>. It’s better for Sandro to stay in Italy. He can immediately establish himself at a top club and for <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> it would be a shame to lose him<br /><br />Health comes first, then if you can finish the championship then all the better. It won’t be an easy choice. We hope it will happen. Football makes many people work, maximum safety must be guaranteed. If one person is infected, everything must be blocked again</p>
