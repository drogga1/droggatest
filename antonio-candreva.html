  <p><b>[Inter winger Antonio Candreva admits it is ‘nice’ to be linked with Chelsea]</b> I’m proud to wear this shirt, I’ve bought into an important project here and I’m happy to be here. This shirt has an important history which I honour every time I wear it. The links with Chelsea are nice but there’s been absolutely nothing to date. The club will take care of any bids that may come in.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea target Antonio Candreva will stay at Inter, says agent Federico Pastorello]</b> Candreva believes that he will. His desire is to continue at Inter and the club and <b>[Inter manager Luciano]</b> Spalletti have said the same. So I believe this season he will remain at Inter, but in January Chelsea wanted him.</p>

  <p><b>[Inter winger Antonio Candreva says he would love to have a go playing in the Premier League]</b> I really like the Premier League, as it’s an exceptional competition. I’d love to have a go at playing in the Premier League. Serie A is showing this season that not only is it always a difficult league, but also now has some very entertaining games. I think Italian teams are improving and can do well in Europe too.<br /><br /><b>[On Luciano Spaletti]</b> Spalletti is a coach at a great level. I’m very happy to be working with him in this period of my career. Thanks to him, I am improving a great deal. He works a lot on concentration, motivation and consistency. He is meticulous and you always learn something new with Spalletti<br /><br />I never felt the pressure of playing at San Siro. We are talking about a crowd that knows its football and has seen world-class players, so naturally it demands a high level of performance. That is why we must be careful to make as few mistakes as possible</p>
