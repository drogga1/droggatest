  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> legend Graham Roberts says <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> shouldn’t be anywhere near the first-team at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a>, if he had signed a contract <b>[with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>]</b>, he would have played <b>[in the 7-2 Champions League defeat to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>]</b>. For me he shouldn’t be on the bench - he shouldn’t be anywhere near the first-team. Because he wants to leave and has come out and said he wants to leave. Then go. If you think it’s better somewhere else, go<br /><br />If he <b>[Eriksen]</b> wants to play football and get back to where he was, he has to sign a new contract and put all that to one side and get back to being the top player he was. Because in the last six months he has not been that player. He has had one or two good games but then been off again. I’ve never seen a player of his ability give the ball away so much in the last three or four months, and that can’t happen to a top quality player. It should never have got into this situation; you cannot let players run their contracts down. It should have been sorted out two years ago, but I do understand because of the money situation, and that is where we are at the moment. It’s not just him, I think there are other players in the team as well; Toby, I’ve loved him and Jan ever since he’s been in the team, but they’ve let their contracts run down and just want to walk away<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on who is to blame for an unfortunate situation at the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham Hotspur Stadium</a>, which mirrors that of recent struggles endured by arch-rivals <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> It’s the chairman <b>[<a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a>]</b>, it’s got to be the chairman. The chairman does all the deals. But I suppose with the new stadium last year and with a lot on their minds, maybe they forgot about it. But at the end of it, we’ve lost one game, 7-2 at home. Yes, it is destroying, but I’m sure our manager will pick it up. What he has got to do now is pick one team and stick with it, and pick players he thinks are going to be at the club moving forward</p>
