  <p><b>[Henrik Larsson talks about his brief loan spell at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in 2007]</b> That’s the only regret I have in my career. I should have stayed, as it would have meant I got a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> winner’s medal, and I would have stayed for one more season. But I still had a contract with Helsingborgs and I feel that when you sign a contract, you have to see it out. Everything was professional at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. When I had to attend a christening for my brother’s children, the club ordered a plane to take me there after a match. United really take care of all their players</p>

  <p><b>[Henrik Larsson tells FourFourTwo that his son would never join the Scottish club’s rivals Rangers]</b> He would never do that. It’s up to him what he wants to do. If he’s good enough, he will get the chance. He’s promising, for sure, but there’s more pressure on him than on any other 19-year-old here in Sweden. In the first part of this season, he was fantastic, but when things don’t go so well, he gets a little too much stick because he’s my son. But he’s strong enough to handle things</p>

  <p><b>[Henrik Larsson has left his role as manager of Helsingborgs over verbal abuse. The former Celtic, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> striker ends his second spell as the club’s coach after a shock cup defeat to Oskarshamns. Krister Azelius said]</b> It is extremely sad that it should be this way. We take a serious look at the verbal abuse and will get to the bottom of it. Everyone who works at Helsingborgs always does the best for the club. The job Henrik was given was to keep the team in the Allsvenskan. When he took over the team was in a relegation play-off spot and right now we are in 12th place with two points down to the relegation play-off place. Based on where we stand now, he has completed the assignment</p>

  <p><b>[Henrik Larsson’s managerial career has struggled to hit the same heights with a low point coming after he oversaw Helsingborgs’ relegation in 2016. Following late defeat in a relegation play-off, both Henrik Larsson and his son Jordan were confronted by angry fans at the time]</b> I didn’t see that they attacked Jordan but if I had, I would have gone in there towards him. I was not going to run from there. If they turn on me, they turn on me. I had been beaten</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Chris Sutton: When Southend first came calling, you texted me asking what do I know about the town. Can you remember my reply?]</b> You answered: ‘It has an airport’. The thing is, even though I played at a certain level, in order to come in to the English system, you have to start somewhere. I’m realistic enough to know I won’t be offered a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> club, or even a Championship club<br /><br /><b>[Chris Sutton: Why not?]</b> Because that’s not the way it works. The longer you’re out of football, the more difficult it is to get back in. You’ve forgotten quite quickly. I’m not a guy who does interviews, or television, or, as we say in Swedish, ‘natverk’ <b>[network]</b>, so you meet people who know people who have influence in clubs<br /><br />In Sweden, I’ve been more or less offered jobs. This was the first proper job interview I’ve had, and we were agreed, 100 per cent. Then Tommy Johnson called me, said he was sorry but he had another offer. Obviously I wasn’t very pleased<br /><br /><b>[Chris Sutton: So why England? You’ve managed a few clubs here in Sweden. Would you do that again?]</b> In Sweden, no. In Scandinavia, no. As a player, I played at the highest level, and I want to see if it is possible to reach that as a manager. Why England? It’s the culture, the love of the game. But I can accept that the owners in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> don’t want me as their manager. I can accept that. I’m not afraid. I believe in myself. I don’t need to work a day more in my life, but I love the game<br /><br /><b>[Chris Sutton: Has coaching changed? The first 11 v 11 session I ever did was under <a href="roy-hodgson.html">Roy Hodgson</a> at <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> in 1997]</b> Was that the year you lost against Trelleborgs (the Swedish minnows in the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Cup)?<br /><br /><b>[No, but thank you for bringing that up]</b> Coaching has changed. To be honest, when I played, I didn’t listen that much to the coaches. We had game plans, then it was up to me to do my thing<br /><br /><b>[Chris Sutton: I suspect it would be difficult for you to take a job in Scotland other than you-know-who?]</b> I would have to agree. I was offered the Celtic job once, around 2015. I was manager of Falkenberg. I had a meeting with the owner and another member of the board, and they wanted me. But I saw some things. I asked them a few questions about different things and I wasn’t really pleased with the answers I got<br /><br /><b>[Chris Sutton: Southend have lost every league game since <a href="sol-campbell.html">Sol Campbell</a> took charge. Maybe you dodged a bullet]</b> No, because I have a high belief in myself. I’m sure we could have done something there. What I can offer as a manager is I know what it takes. The knowhow; the sacrifices you have to make to play at a high level. Even though it was 15 years ago (when I played), I know what it takes. Football is not a new game</p>

  <p><b>[Why is Celtic vs Rangers called the Old Firm Derby? Henrik Larsson, who has played in both, conceded even those didn’t live up to the Old Firm]</b> I never experienced anything, either before or after, that compared to my Old Firm games in Scotland. That was the best atmosphere and those were the most fierce encounters I ever played in</p>

  <p><b>[Henrik Larsson on coping with his brother’s death]</b> During my time in Scotland, I had a brother who was on drugs. Knowing the things I knew about him and having to go out and perform week in, week out - it wasn’t easy. In the end, he took an overdose on drugs and the pressure my parents felt about that, the worrying they had every night and me as well sometimes, it’s not easy. I talked a lot, and still talk to this day with my wife, about the things that maybe I didn’t want to talk about with other people. I think it’s important to share how you feel in order for somebody to help you<br /><br />After my brother died and passed away, I had a period when I wasn’t feeling very good because I had a lot of questions. My wife said to me, ‘you need to go and talk to somebody in order to straighten a few things out’. I did that. I went to a professional and talked with her about different things, and felt so much better after that. I think it is important and I think it is good that people talk about <b>[their struggles with]</b> mental health nowadays because it is nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
