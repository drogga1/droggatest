<h4 id="2019-09-06-publish-khabib-nurmagomedov-v-dustin-poirier---the-big-questions-answered-as-the-eagle-returns">2019 09 06 Publish: <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> v <a href="dustin-poirier.html">Dustin Poirier</a> - The big questions answered as ‘The Eagle’ returns</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>The eyes of the MMA world will be locked on <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> when he makes an eagerly awaited return at UFC 242 in Abu Dhabi on Saturday. It has been 11 months since Nurmagomedov last fought in Las Vegas, where his excellent victory over <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> was marred by an ugly post-fight melee. But Nurmagomedov remains one of UFC’s greatest attractions and the battle for supremacy in the lightweight division is on when he goes head-to-head with interim champion Dustin Poirier<br /><br />What happened at UFC 229? Oh boy … where do you start with this one? The build-up to this was fight was, let’s dilute this a little, ugly. Back in April 2018, <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> was involved in an attack on a bus carrying Nurmagomedov and other fighters. <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> would eventually be forced to undertake community service and an anger management programme over the incident. So, naturally the scene was set for a red-hot build-up that had many barbs that crossed the line. After Nurmagomedov submitted <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> in the fourth round the bad blood spilled over, with the Russian launching himself over the cage to fight members of his rival’s team, leading to a mass brawl. It was all rather unpleasant, unsavoury and unnecessary, and in truth not a great look for UFC<br /><br />What’s Khabib been up to since? There has been parenting advice from <a href="vladimir-putin.html">Vladimir Putin</a>, an airport opening with Turkey president <a href="recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> and a meeting with Vladimir Vasilyev, the head of the Republic of Dagestan. There was also time to call out boxing legend <a href="floyd-mayweather.html">Floyd Mayweather</a> Jr – who has also fought <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> – and take in trips to watch <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> and Paris Saint-Germain<br /><br />What’s Khabib’s record like? In a word: formidable. Nurmagomedov has had 27 fights and earned 27 victories. In a world of the finest margins it is a phenomenally dominant record<br /><br />What is his style? Nurmagomedov is one of the best wrestlers in UFC and no one has been able to defend against his extraordinary grappling and takedown skills. But there are several more strings to his bow, as <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> found out to his detriment when caught with an awesome overhead right in their bout. Trying to find a weakness in his game is tough<br /><br />Who is his opponent Poirier? Hardcore fight fans will need no introduction to Brazilian jiu-jitsu expert Poirier. The American has notable victories over big hitters like Eddie Alvarez, Anthony Pettis, <a href="justin-gaethje.html">Justin Gaethje</a> and Max Holloway on his resume – a second win against the latter seeing him named interim lightweight champion in April. ‘The Diamond’ collected aluminium cans and picked pecans prior to getting into the fight game, landing in MMA having first looked into the possibility of boxing. Poirier is a talented grappler and also has decent stand-up. He is sure to be a tricky customer.</p>
