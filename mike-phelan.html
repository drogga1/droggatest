  <p><b>[United’s assistant manager, Mike Phelan, has also revealed the club are keeping tabs on Sporting Lisbon’s 22-year-old goalkeeper Rui Patricio]</b> He’s a young ‘keeper with enormous potential - we’ve known Rui Patricio for a long time and we’ve also played against him a few times. The only thing I can confirm is that we haven’t made any offer</p>

  <p><b>[Mike Phelan says Manchester United are looking to make amends for their poor finish in 2018-19]</b> We’re piecing everything together. We’ve asked the players to do more and we’re getting that response from them. You can see the intensity in training is high. We need to keep pushing and pushing. We’re not just preparing them for the first game of the season <b>[against Chelsea on August 11]</b> but preparing them for the season. We all know last season was difficult - a great start but poor finish. We need to make sure now that the energy, stamina and enthusiasm is in the players right from the start.<br /><br />It’s not just fitness. We want them to be mentally tough as well to experience what it really is about Manchester United - it’s right to the end, from start to finish. We had periods in games where we looked really at it and really strong but then faded. We need to get that Man Utd back, that goes right the way through 96 minutes, which is a game of football nowadays, and we’re preparing them for that. The players have to understand how it feels to be fatigued and then go again. We’re trying to get that into them, both in their minds and in their bodies</p>

  <p><b>[Mike Phelan says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> had to teach <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> to be team player]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> stood out. He was like a sponge. He wanted more <b>[advice from United’s coaches]</b>. He challenged you for more. We had to try and get <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> to be a team player and he got it. In the end, he got it. There were certain things we did in training that made him do things he didn’t want to do. Especially when the success came and after he moved to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, there were certain things - when observing games at Madrid - that he definitely picked up at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. He was translating that further up the ladder of excellence. That’s important and there’s a satisfaction there. I don’t claim to have created <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. A lot of people have influenced him. But the biggest influence has been himself - his drive has been fantastic</p>
