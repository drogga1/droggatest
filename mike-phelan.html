  <p><b>[United’s assistant manager, Mike Phelan, has also revealed the club are keeping tabs on Sporting Lisbon’s 22-year-old goalkeeper Rui Patricio]</b> He’s a young ‘keeper with enormous potential - we’ve known Rui Patricio for a long time and we’ve also played against him a few times. The only thing I can confirm is that we haven’t made any offer</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo’s route to the top of world football started from the moment he arrived at Manchester United]</b> When Cristiano Ronaldo first arrived at Manchester United in 2003, Ryan Giggs was on free-kicks. But Cristiano took on challenges like nobody else. He always wanted to try something. He wanted to be the guy who found out through trying. He did it every day after training with Giggs and Wayne Rooney. The first challenge was to be better than his team-mates. He rose to that. Once he mastered it, he liked people to be around him watching it and talking about it.<br /><br />He also insisted on doing it against the best goalkeepers. He wouldn’t have a youth team goalkeeper in nets. He wanted to score against Edwin van der Sar. He spoke to the goalkeepers and asked about their psyche: finding out what they thought and what they found difficult</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho has been urged to rein in the outbursts at Manchester United and avoid seeking conflict]</b> Any manager of any big institution, which is what Manchester United is, internationally, you have a role and a responsibility to give out the correct messages. You don’t have to avoid conflict, but you certainly have to conduct yourself in a way which is befitting of the tradition of where you’re working, and that’s something you can do by keeping your own counsel and getting on with the job. But he <b>[Mourinho]</b> is a completely different character and he expresses himself in a completely different way. There are opportunities to say things and there are opportunities to keep it to yourself. He chooses one way, and with that there are consequences in what you say.<br /><br />There is fierce competition within the city. If United are at loggerheads within the club, it just helps fuel City’s cause more than anything else. That’s something they need to be very careful of, because City are a very big club now and they’re very well run. They know how to use certain situations, and unrest across the road helps. It can’t not be a help and they use it well<br /><br />I don’t think so. You’re the manager of Manchester United, why would you want to leave that situation? It probably is delicate right now, in terms of his managerial role, but most things are controlled by results. You’ve got to perform well, get the right results and enjoy the time that you’re there. Not many people become manager of Manchester United. Sir Alex had it for a long, long time, then a few have come along since to try to emulate him and make them the champions again. It’s something you’ve got to embrace, rather than not embrace, because it’s a fabulous time to be at a football club of that magnitude</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United coach Mike Phelan says that Jose Mourinho’s current squad are lagging behind their rivals]</b> They haven’t improved, it’s as simple as that. They haven’t grasped the mantle and moved forward. They’re still lagging behind and a lot of teams have caught them up. I think their selection of players and the direction they’re going in has proved difficult for Manchester United. Others have overtaken them in that respect.<br /><br />There’s no shortage of investment into Manchester United. I think most people realistically could say the money is there to spend, but it’s who you spend it on and what you are getting for the money. Decision making is always top of the tree when it comes to the big football clubs and where it takes you. Is it going to be a year, is it going to be two years, is it going to be three? It’s progressing into five, six, maybe even seven. It’s going in the direction that Liverpool went in years ago</p>

  <p><b>[Mike Phelan has reaffirmed that he will remain committed to A-League outfit Central Coast Mariners as their sporting director after the club endorsed his return to Old Trafford]</b> Taking on a temporary coaching role at Manchester United is extremely exciting. It’s also a really positive step for the Mariners to have a direct link with Manchester United as I will continue my role as sporting director. I’m still a Mariner. I’ve put something in place that I want to see through. This might be a small distraction, but it’s with one of the biggest clubs in the world that I simply couldn’t turn down. I was offered the opportunity at the Mariners to pass on my experiences and wisdom in order to develop the football club back into the football club that it once was. It’s an exciting project, that’s my remit and we’ve put a structure in place with full time academy coaches that will ensure that we are prepared for success. Part of the discussion with Manchester United was that I will still be available for the Mariners, this is a dual role. I will take the first opportunity possible to get back to the Central Coast. I’m not going anywhere, I am one phone call away from anyone at the Mariners. 	I will be back on the Central Coast as soon as I can. There’s obviously a few issues to sort through at Manchester United which will take time, but once we’ve worked through that I look forward to getting back to the Central Coast</p>

  <p><b>[Mike Phelan would be interested in staying on at Manchester United if <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> is handed the managerial reins]</b> It’s just a case of how things develop over the next couple of months. It’s a busy time for Manchester United obviously, but the season is coming to an end in Australia so I think once decisions are made back over in England then I think we’ll open those discussions again with the Mariners and hopefully the partnership can continue. I think it’s a good one; it’s a nice one to be able to be associated with the Mariners, and obviously an association for the Mariners with Manchester United is always a nice thing. It’s all down to ifs and buts right now, but I certainly would like to keep my interest at the Mariners<br /><br />Managing people is no different wherever you are. You try and get the best out of people, you try to communicate well, and he’s got all those skills. It just so happens now that he’s got an opportunity at Manchester United, which he’s relishing</p>

It’s all down to ifs and buts right now, but I’d certainly like to keep my interest at the Mariners going. It doesn’t matter where you are, if you have something to offer you just try to fit it into what is a busy schedule but there’s always a time and a place. I put something in place here at the Mariners…and I want to try and pursue that a little bit further<br /><br /><b>[With over 10,000 miles between Manchester and the Central Coast]</b> My day starts now at 4am.

It works, but I’m going to bed at about 3pm now</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd star Paul Pogba urged to ignore Real Madrid rumours and fulfil potential]</b> Paul is not the finished deal even though everyone looks at him and sees a World Cup winner already. But there is still a lot more to come - and that is the exciting bit about Manchester United. There are players here who haven’t achieved for the club what they need to achieve. And we want to make sure that they relish that experience, embrace the opportunity to win things at United.<br /><br />Paul had a spell where all the eyes were on him and delivery of his best wasn’t there all the time, the consistency. Now we are trying to apply ourselves to Paul’s game. Ole has done a terrific job at helping Paul through certain spells and he has embraced that. He is maturing all the time<br /><br />I want these players to enjoy their own great moments for themselves but I also want to do it again - that is the drive. It is different this time around, of course it is. It was six years ago, but it is not impossible</p>

  <p><b>[Mike Phelan says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are looking to make amends for their poor finish in 2018-19]</b> We’re piecing everything together. We’ve asked the players to do more and we’re getting that response from them. You can see the intensity in training is high. We need to keep pushing and pushing. We’re not just preparing them for the first game of the season <b>[against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> on August 11]</b> but preparing them for the season. We all know last season was difficult - a great start but poor finish. We need to make sure now that the energy, stamina and enthusiasm is in the players right from the start.<br /><br />It’s not just fitness. We want them to be mentally tough as well to experience what it really is about <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> - it’s right to the end, from start to finish. We had periods in games where we looked really at it and really strong but then faded. We need to get that <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> back, that goes right the way through 96 minutes, which is a game of football nowadays, and we’re preparing them for that. The players have to understand how it feels to be fatigued and then go again. We’re trying to get that into them, both in their minds and in their bodies</p>
