  <p><b>[Leeds <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> return would be Pablo Hernandez’s career highlight]</b> I’ve been very happy here since my first day in <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>. When I came to <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> four years ago I knew I came to a big club. I knew some things about them. I saw them when they played <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> in the <b>[2001 Champions League]</b> semi-finals, but when I arrived I was surprised because they were bigger than I thought<br /><br />Yes for me, to go to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> with this club, if we achieve this, it will be the best trophy for me in my career. If I can go to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> with <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a>, it is my dream and I’ll try to push 100 per cent every day to help this team to achieve that<br /><br /><b>[He had missed the previous week’s defeat at Cardiff due to an ongoing hamstring problem, but feels he is edging towards full fitness]</b> I hope so yes. We need to manage this situation well, we need to see each day what happens and see what my feeling is. But I think I’m ready in the next few days to be ready and be 100 per cent fit. It’s been frustrating the last few weeks because after the break, after a long period with no games, I want to play, I want to help the team. But I have experience in this situation and I know these things can happen and I need to manage it well, not just me, I need to manage this with the medical staff and the manager, everybody. If we play our football, if we don’t lose our identity or spirit and we play like we have most of the season, we have a good chance. But we know, we talked after the Fulham game that this is a difficult game and we need to be focused 100 per cent</p>
