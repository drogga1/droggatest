  <p><b>[Last Friday, Wigan’s Sam Morsy took his place in the Egypt line-up opposite James Rodriguez, Colombia’s Champions League-winning midfielder in a pre-World Cup friendly in Bergamo]</b> I’m competing with some good players. I’d like to see myself as a tenacious ball-winning midfielder but also I like to get on the ball, start attacks from deep. The system we play I’ve had success. It suits me down to the ground. I got the opportunity to show the manager what I can do.<br /><br />They knew about me for a while. They had been watching the games and watching my performances. It’s very easy to access performances now. They were happy with me and since then I’ve been involved in many of the camps.<br /><br />The manager <b>[Paul Cook]</b> came in and he’s brought his own staff in and they have a set way of playing which suits the players. At times it was working like clockwork. It’s a really great team to be a part of and a great team spirit and that showed with the results on the pitch as well. We’ve got a great team spirit and obviously we’ve got very good players and that coincided with winning the league as well and having a really good FA Cup run<br /><br />The squad’s stronger this time around and I feel the manager is a lot better this time around. With the new investment in the club, we’ll be giving it a real good go next season<br /><br />All my Dad’s side of the family are still there. I’m regularly speaking to my cousins and my uncles about it. In the lead up when we were a couple of games away and we were doing well they were telling me how much it meant. Qualifying is like winning the World Cup final. It’s been such a long time. We’ve had to wait so long and now it’s finally here<br /><br />The manager made a lot of changes so it was a really respectable result and it was a good performance. The weather was crazy, the humidity was crazy. It gave me a lot of confidence that the manager played me in this game. It was a game I really enjoyed and hopefully getting my game I’m earning more of the manager’s trust. That’s what it’s all about especially at international level with a large pool of players and the manager has to be able to trust you to do the job he wants you to do<br /><br />It’s been an amazing season. It’s something which has been a long time coming. To be a part of that, to see that, to see what it means to the people of Egypt, and to the players, the staff, it’s been amazing. We’re all looking forward to Russia now and will give a really good account of ourselves</p>

  <p><b>[Wigan captain Sam Morsy says players are determined to secure Championship survival]</b> The advantage we had when the news came out was that we only had two or three weeks left of the season. For two or three weeks you can focus and put all the other things to the side. If it was three months, it would be very difficult. Not getting paid for three months and all the speculation, that could definitely turn your head. But for the sake of three weeks, we all said, ‘listen, let’s sacrifice three weeks’. Obviously, agents would be involved and players could be leaving. But the situation we have now, with just a week left of the season, you can fully clear your mind of that, you can do something special. There will be players who go on to big things, play at a higher level, and that’s all great. But if we can survive this season, this will be one of the best accomplishments of our footballing careers<br /><br /><b>[Morsy insists they were not expecting to have it so easy against the Tigers]</b> We didn’t expect it. I woke up on the morning of the game thinking it was going to be a cagey affair. They are a good team, even though they’re not in great form. It wasn’t a game where we thought it was going to be a pasting. We were just at it and everything seemed to go in and that’s just the confidence we’re playing with at the minute<br /><br />Beating Stoke 3-0, another relegation rival and a really good team, that evening the lads were ecstatic. That win probably would have kept us safe and then in the morning to be told that we were in administration, that was obviously a huge shock. The first few days there was a mental draining of energy, but the players have been so upbeat. We spoke among ourselves and said, ‘it’s about us now, can we do something special’. Let’s start the next game, let’s beat QPR, and then we’ve got a chance. It’s just been one step at a time but the lads have been really positive</p>
