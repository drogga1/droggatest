If Zidane tells you to stay, that you will play and that he has faith in you - you simply stay! It is Zidane! It was a privilege to hear such words from someone like him, who was one of best ever. And also, it is Real Madrid… how could I leave Real?! It is an honour to be part of this club.<br /><br />I am still young and have a lot to learn. To be honest, when Zidane promised us at the beginning of the season that we will all get minutes, I thought it would be hardly doable with so many of us in the squad. But he did it, we all got a chance. It is pure pleasure to play under Zidane<br /><br />Modric and <b>[Andres]</b> Iniesta are the best midfielders I have seen. I was watching them play and wanted to play like them. When I came to Madrid, Modric didn’t give me any football advice because he kept telling me I was ready to play for Real. But he gave me some tips about life, like: ‘Don’t go crazy, you have to be calm and cool’. I just followed his example. And that is why I am still at Real. Modric is undoubtedly the best Croatian player ever. He is also an amazing guy and I am proud to have him as a friend</p>

  <p><b>[Croatia midfielder Mateo Kovacic is confident his side will get the better of Argentina when they meet in the World Cup]</b> Argentina depends a lot on Messi, although they are a great team in other positions. He has to take care of them most of the time. He is phenomenal, he can resolve the game at any time. We do not need to be too afraid of Argentina, we are singularly better than them, except Messi, and so we should behave, look at ourselves, not others.</p>

  <p><b>[On Roberto Mancini]</b> I’m not sure if Mancini liked me or not. There was no relationship between us, neither positive nor negative. In the end, I was happy to leave because I don’t know what would have become of me if I’d stayed there. I prefer to play as a holding midfielder. I’ve played further up the pitch and on the left wing and that’s not a bad thing because it helps me to grow as a player. But I think Inter made a mistake by moving me around and changing my natural position. It was an honour to play for Inter, but without a doubt Real Madrid are of a higher level. In Italy the training sessions are really boring and sometimes you don’t even use the ball. When I left, Mancini told me he was disappointed but, to be honest, while I was actually in the squad, I never got that feeling.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United star Paul Scholes is one of the best ever midfielders]</b> Every player has to be himself- but for me Scholes was one of the best ever. He was amazing. I still enjoy watching his videos on YouTube. Sometimes I go home and watch him to learn something new. He had everything, he was the modern midfielder - scoring goals, defending well, tackling. I don’t copy anybody but I do like to watch Scholes. I also watch other players to see what I can do better. Players like Luka Modric and Andres Iniesta, too<br /><br />That is the problem in my career, I have not scored enough - and it’s something I need to improve on<br /><br />It was difficult when I was playing less - now I am involved more and it helps me a lot. I was 18 when I went to Inter and then Madrid at 21. Maybe it was a bit too fast. Alvaro <b>[Morata]</b> told me Chelsea are on the same level as Madrid. The fans can expect me to always give 100 per cent. I will do my best to play good football for them</p>

  <p><b>[Eden Hazard is an incredible talent]</b> For me he has everything, but the thing that has impressed me the most is that they tackle him so much and he is always on his feet. England is a really tough league, the toughest in the world for me, and he just plays with the defenders. He’s an incredible player but also a nice team-mate, a nice guy, and I have really enjoyed the time playing with him. When I came here I didn’t realise he was so good. He is one of the best players I have played with. The stuff he is doing is amazing; he is helping the team a lot and I hope he will continue like that, or do even better because I think he can do better for sure<br /><br />It’s important to keep winning. We need to have this mentality to try to win every game, and for now I think we are doing very well. Everybody can see Chelsea are trying to play attacking football, football that the fans like to watch, so I think we will have a good season this year. We can improve a lot because we have great potential, but the team is doing great and that is the most important thing for now<br /><br /><b>[When quizzed on his future]</b> It is too early and I have to respect my contract with Real Madrid.

I was not used to playing every three or four games and here it is very tough football. You can’t relax against anybody so it’s a little bit difficult but I really enjoy it. We have a great team, great fans and the city is nice. I like it a lot here.<br /><br />I go around and I enjoy the city - it’s huge and I haven’t seen enough of it yet. I’m looking forward to getting to know it more. I’m enjoying it. What’s the most interesting thing I’ve seen so far? The stadium. I don’t do anything special. I spend a lot of time in Cobham because I need to prepare myself for training and every game but after that I go home and enjoy time with my wife. Nothing special, we go for dinner, we live in the city so we are walking a lot. My family enjoys the city and that’s the most important thing for me in the end</p>

Last year was only a loan. I feel better and more confident than last year. It makes me feel more relaxed as last year was difficult and I needed to prove myself.

I feel good. I have a good connection with the coach and all the team. We can change positions. We are aggressive. We are doing well but it is only one month with the coach so we can improve. Last season was also a good connection with the coach. It was also a good year last year. The connection is good <b>[with <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>]</b>.

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> getting best of Mateo Kovacic after ‘difficult’ <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> spell]</b> Of course it’s better to have consistency in your position. To move around the pitch is not so good, when you’re playing one year there, and another year there. That has also been a bit of a problem in my career. Everything happened too fast for me. I had three great and difficult years in Madrid. I played, didn’t play, I didn’t get the continuity that I needed and what I have now here. I enjoyed it, we won three Champions Leagues, but <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is coming in the best moment of my career. It has been the most important switch for now and I’m really pleased with that<br /><br /><b>[Kovacic added on the qualities he adds at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> My game is to open spaces for other people. It’s a big strength and I have felt I am trying it a lot more because we play a little bit different football to last year. Now we are more direct, more aggressive, we just try things we didn’t try last year. I feel better. I think my best position is in a midfield two. I can play as well in a midfield three, but in the two I feel maybe more comfortable with more freedom. But in the end the formation doesn’t matter too much<br /><br /><b>[He is not overly concerned by a lack of end product for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">the Blues</a>, with his game more about being destructive than constructive]</b> I never had the pressure to score goals, I was never obsessed because my game is not about goals, but obviously if I want to go to the next step I need to improve it. The coach was the greatest goalscoring midfielder that ever played. There were many, but he really scored a lot of goals. He tells me always that I need to shoot. Now I am trying more! It’s just a thing of mentality, to try to score, to be aggressive and to have the hunger to score goals. I want to improve that, I’m trying to improve that and I am sure I will get there</p>

He has been preparing me to arrive late in the box to score more goals and it is just a consequence of training hard and preparing myself. I think mentally I have become stronger this season. Last season I was obsessed a little bit with not scoring because people were always asking when I was going to score. This summer I was just focused on preparing well and having a good season for the team and, as I said before, the goals are just consequences of training well and preparing myself<br /><br />It’s actually for my nieces.

We need to play these next games like we were playing in the beginning of the season and change some things as well, obviously<br /><br />We played well in the beginning but it’s always the same against United - we play good, we create chances, we don’t score and then they score from one opportunity. We don’t have the three points and that’s the most important thing. It was a good game from us, we played well, like we have for more or less the whole season, but we made some silly mistakes and we lost the points. We are still a very young team and we need to improve a lot. Now we will see if we are a great team because we have some tough matches to fight for the fourth position and we need to show ourselves</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> midfielder Mateo Kovacic says that <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> will be better rested]</b> They have a great team, and they are playing well. Their league is not as tough as <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, so for sure they will be more rested than us. We will prepare to hurt them a lot<br /><br />I had the luck of playing for a great club like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. I won the Champions League and I am happy about that. But as players, we don’t think about winning it because every week is a big game for us, so it doesn’t change too much. There is always another great game that we try to win. We are trying to do great things this year and tomorrow we want to show that we are a great team and pass this stage if possible<br /><br />I think we are similar teams, there is not much difference. We can be a big team, we have shown that this season in big games. We don’t have so much experience, but we know how to play big games. We’ll show that tomorrow. <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> has a squad full of great players. That’s normal at this stage of the Champions League, you always play against big players. It will be tough, but we like these big games</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="n-golo-kante.html">N’Golo Kante</a> was the first name on the team sheet for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s most recent title winners but now <a href="chelsea-fc.html">the Blues</a> have a new undroppable player: Mateo Kovacic. In recent weeks, the Croatian has grown into the player that many expected him to become from the moment Inter signed the midfielder from Dinamo Zagreb in 2013. The arrival of <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>, then, was key to Kovacic’s development]</b> I have good communication with him. I am working on my bad sides of my game. I am talking to him a lot and I am analysing my game. I think I am becoming a better player but it is normal because I am getting more mature. I am a good age so I feel good. Kovacic played with a personality and a quality that makes you go, ‘Okay, he can play in pretty much any team with that level’</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> midfielder Mateo Kovacic believes he is working with the perfect manager in <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> to add the qualities to his game that he is currently missing]</b> We had a quite good year under <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a>, winning the Europa League, in the end he left and <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> came to the team. I think from the first moment our feeling was good. I liked the way he was training us, really hard training, I liked his character, how he was speaking to the team. I think I can learn a lot from him because all the things I am missing from my game - scoring goals and being more direct, this is the thing <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> was amazing at in his career. So he’s a great manager, a great person and I think I can learn a lot from him during my time here</p>
