With <a href="jozy-altidore.html">Altidore</a> finally starting to find his form, he figured to be a major weapon for the Stars and Stripes in Brazil</p>

  <p><b>[Jermaine Jones explains his reaction to referee Mark Geiger’s decision not to award a late penalty as New England Revolution lost in the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> play-offs]</b> My passion then after maybe went a little bit high … people who know me, they know that I’m not a good loser. In that moment I was really upset</p>

  <p><b>[Former USMNT midfielder Jermaine Jones announces retirement]</b> After 18 years I say good bye. I have a clear vision, after I had a couple of months to concentrate on what comes next!!! THANKS to all my teammates, coaches and clubs who stuck with me &amp; believed in me through all of the years. And a special thanks to all the fans who supported me all the way. See you all soon.</p>

  <p><b>[Jermaine Jones has hit out at the U.S. women’s national team, saying their fight for equal pay could backfire real quick]</b> There is a big difference between men’s sport and women’s sport. Give me one country where the girls get paid the same as the men. There is just no country. The girls, they are calling and screaming a little bit for more respect and (to be) more appreciated for what they are doing, and that’s I think more the case why they are saying all this<br /><br /><b>[Jones has highlighted that difference, also saying that the women’s professional league in the United States, the National Women’s Soccer League, is not up to standard]</b> Some players who play <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, they play men’s national team, can make less than a woman who gets a salary cap through the national team, not through her club, and that’s a big difference. We’re coming, and we get not paid. We have to play games and win games. She gets the whole season paid, and plays in a league where you can say that you suck<br /><br />I think they have to be careful too, because you have players (like) <a href="alex-morgan.html">Alex Morgan</a>, they are making more than some of the guys, but then they scream out and say ‘we need more money’. It can backfire real quick.<br /><br /><b>[Jones, however, isn’t getting caught up in the accomplishments of the USWNT in comparison to the USMNT]</b> Of course as men we know it’s tougher to win a World Cup than the girls</p>
