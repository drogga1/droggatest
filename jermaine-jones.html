  <p><b>[USA visits Panama eyeing six-point sweep of March World Cup qualifiers]</b> The away games are always tougher than the home games, especially with the conditions. It will be hot, the field will maybe be a little bit bumpy, but if we go out and play our own game we showed already in 2013 that we can come here and win a game.</p>

  <p><b>[Jermaine Jones fires back at USA critics]</b> People hate and try to find mistakes when you lose games. To me, the point is what I’ve said always: Bring me the guy who is better at that position and show that week to week in the league, against me, against other teams. I respect it and I say, ‘If he’s better, I step away.’ I’m 35 - I can step away and say I had a good career. But right now, if you be honest, ask my teammates, ask the people inside. There’s nobody who can take my spot<br /><br />People always say that me and Michael don’t fit together. The criticism is always on me. If we lose a game, they always try to find the next guy who can play for Jermaine. It’s never somebody else - it’s always me. I’ll be honest: That pisses me off, where I say, ‘Wait a minute - when we play the big tournaments, I’m almost or always the best player on the field for this country.’ But then at the end of the day, they try to kick me out when we lose games. That’s not fair<br /><br />I want that the people respect me for that what I did. They respect Timmy, they respect Clint, they respect all of the people. I have no problem when you want to criticize me when I play a bad game. But if you want to go against me and say I’m a poor player and all kind of stuff, I’m sorry man, but there’s nobody in that national team who have the same games and have the same success where I’ve been. I’ve played over 15 years in Europe at a high level. Not 10, not five years, not one year. But sometimes it’s tough to look at numbers. I’m a German-American and maybe not a full American that you can sell like a product<br /><br />I missed 2010, I missed 2006, and to me 2014 was something special and I wanted to go to this one again. I wanted to represent this country again one time. And trust me - after that, I will watch it on a TV, the national team, I will support them. But you will not see me in a jersey anymore</p>

  <p><b>[Is Jermaine Jones really still a must-start player for the USA?]</b> Bring me the guy who is better in that position, and show that week to week in the league, against me, against other teams.

I can step away and say I had a good career, but right now if <b>[we’re being]</b> honest, ask my teammates, ask the people inside - there’s nobody who can take my spot. If it comes to a game, a tough game, there is nobody who really wants to battle with me..<br /><br />The criticism is always on me.

  <p><b>[Jermaine Jones wants USA players testing themselves in Europe]</b> We have a couple years now to build something really good, but we have to build it really smart. And for building something smart you have to have somebody on top who is top, and I hope that happens.</p>

  <p><b>[Jermaine Jones has hit out at the U.S. women’s national team, saying their fight for equal pay could backfire real quick]</b> There is a big difference between men’s sport and women’s sport. Give me one country where the girls get paid the same as the men. There is just no country. The girls, they are calling and screaming a little bit for more respect and (to be) more appreciated for what they are doing, and that’s I think more the case why they are saying all this<br /><br /><b>[Jones has highlighted that difference, also saying that the women’s professional league in the United States, the National Women’s Soccer League, is not up to standard]</b> Some players who play <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, they play men’s national team, can make less than a woman who gets a salary cap through the national team, not through her club, and that’s a big difference. We’re coming, and we get not paid. We have to play games and win games. She gets the whole season paid, and plays in a league where you can say that you suck<br /><br />I think they have to be careful too, because you have players (like) <a href="alex-morgan.html">Alex Morgan</a>, they are making more than some of the guys, but then they scream out and say ‘we need more money’. It can backfire real quick.<br /><br /><b>[Jones, however, isn’t getting caught up in the accomplishments of the USWNT in comparison to the USMNT]</b> Of course as men we know it’s tougher to win a World Cup than the girls</p>
