  <p><b>[Despite suffering a punctured lung and broken ribs in the 1958 Munich Air Diasaster, and being issued his Last Rites twice, Busby somehow walked out alive after over two months in hospital]</b> I was absolutely determined that I’d have nothing more to do with football. But my wife Jean persuaded me otherwise, telling me the lads would have wanted me to carry on</p>

  <p><b>[It took place at Wembley, in front of over 92,000 spectators and also featured a <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> side that had already conquered the continent twice, beaten <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> home and away in the last four, and boasted the formidable gifts of Mario Coluna and <a href="eusebio.html">Eusebio</a>. Foulkes and <a href="jack-charlton.html">Charlton</a>, survivors of the Munich Air Disaster, lined up in a United XI devoid of the injured Law. With red being both teams’ first-choice colour, the Mancunians wore an all-blue kit with the Lisbon giants in white]</b> They’ve done us proud. They came back with all their hearts to show everyone what <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are made of. This is the most wonderful thing that has happened in my life and I am the proudest man in England tonight<br /><br /><b>[Charlton lifted the trophy in front of relatives of those who died in the Munich Air Disaster, and later recalled]</b> It was a marvellous night because it put things right in a way. This great tragedy had taken place. Matt felt responsible because he had cajoled the parents into allowing their sons to come and play for him. He considered the players we lost as his family. He was hurt by what happened at Munich more than anyone. The emotion of it all after the final whistle was pretty intense. I remember hugging Matt. We had all suffered so much and when I looked at him, there was a mixture or relief, ecstasy and absolute pride. This made it a little easier for him in some ways</p>
