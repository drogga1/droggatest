  <p><b>[Mustapha Hadji gives his thoughts on the Atlas Lions’ World Cup group containing Portugal, Spain and IR Iran]</b> The first game will be our final. It will be a tough game because we watched Iran in qualifying and they have a very good team and a very good spirit. But if we win, we have a great opportunity to reach the second round. That’s what we are coming for. They are big nations of football <b>[Spain and Portugal]</b> and have won everything already. So that’s why we have nothing to lose against these two. We know that it is not going to be easy, but we can surprise them</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah is in the same bracket as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi]</b> Mohamed Salah has reached a level that puts him alongside the greatest players. I think he proved it again against Roma <b>[in the Champions League semi-final]</b>. Today, he is one of the best players in the world. He is in that category alongside Neymar, Ronaldo and Messi. He has his place there. When we see everything that he has done this season, and I also believe that he’s a very humble guy, I wish him the best because it is not always easy to start where he started. He did a tremendous job. Beyond the footballer, I feel when I look at him he has exceptional humility and it goes above and beyond anything. I am really a big fan. He’s a guy who surprises me every day. I wish him to be one of the top three players in the world and I really believe he can make it.<br /><br /><b>[On Andres Iniesta]</b> I never understood why he did not win the Ballon d’Or. It is an injustice in the light of his career, the player he has been, and he still is. He’s not just a player, he’s an engine. He is an exceptional player. He really makes the team play around him. I was lucky to play against him when I was in Spain. I saw his qualities. I never understood why he was not rewarded because he is a football monster. He’s an icon, someone who represents Barcelona. I take my hat off to him because he was a true example for world football</p>

  <p><b>[Mustapha Hadji believes Morocco must play with ‘guts and heart’ if they are to enjoy a successful World Cup in Russia]</b> You can play all the Champions Leagues in the world, you can win as much as you want, you can do whatever you want in the world of football, the nation goes before everything. I say it to you in all honesty because it is something that I have lived, and I know it. Pfff … what we win with a nation, what we do by representing it, it’s priceless. Really. This is beyond what we can hope. That’s why, when you play for your country, you have to play with guts, with heart because that’s what people want to see. They do not want to see players who are just coming <b>[here]</b>. They want to see players playing for their homeland. This is exceptional. It’s a privilege to play for a national team. We must not neglect it, we must always be there, always surpass ourselves because it is a nation. What you win with this team, people are indebted to you for life.<br /><br />We must already focus on Iran. It can be a trigger for the future. We often talk about European champions and former world champions, but against these teams the motivation will be natural because we will play against two of the biggest football nations. We must take it match by match. We know we have a very strong group. We really have to prepare for the game against Iran, and then we will see about Portugal and Spain because it will be something else. Without neglecting Iran so far, be careful. It is a team that will be very solid. It may even be more difficult than Portugal and Spain because they will play without pressure</p>
