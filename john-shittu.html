<blockquote>
  <p><b>[John Obi Mikel’s agent, John Shittu, has confirmed it is ‘50-50’ as to whether the midfielder will leave Chelsea during the January transfer window]</b> Obi Mikel and Antonio have been speaking. The manager, club and player have been talking. So I am not in a position to tell about what they have been speaking about, in the next few weeks things should be clearer. We have been having meeting with a few parties who are interested in him, once we are able to agree the way forward with Chelsea, then we will take it from there. There are a few clubs in Europe and Asia, they are numerous and are interested in him because he is a quality player, aged only 29, and we just have to speak, so we will see. A lot of interest is there.<br /><br />There is no decision made yet and it is still 50/50 whether he will sign or leave. A lot can happen in the next months, never say never in football<br /><br /><b>[Shittu insists that he is calm about Mikel’s future ahead of January]</b> I am very busy because he is one of my players who we need to decide on what happens in the next window. Is there going to be a January opportunity? Our number one priority is to make the best decision on his future and that’s what we are trying to do. His future is very bright, so we are having meetings, here and there, and we have to work towards the January window. We have meetings with different clubs and we are very clear about the situation. We are just waiting for the window to open and we will go the best way forward for Obi Mikel.</p>
