  <p><b>[Reds coach Jack Robinson says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> goalkeeper Alisson is so comfortable on the ball that he looks like <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Andrea Pirlo</a> in training sessions]</b> Unbelievable! He’s like <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Pirlo</a> or someone like that. He’s really comfortable on the ball and wants to receive it under pressure. Like you see in the games, that nerve strength, that calmness, he’s able to play when there’s chaos all around him. If a team is pressing high up the pitch, there’s obviously space in behind them. You see with Alisson and the runs that Mo <b>[Salah]</b>, Sadio <b>[Mane]</b> or Bobby <b>[Firmino]</b> make or one of the midfielders might make, we look to play beyond the team as well. It’s exploiting where the space is. If teams drop off, it should be simple and easy to play out to the centre-halves and midfielders. The nature of how our team plays, we’re a fast attacking team. We look to break quickly, so the goalkeepers are always looking to keep the pace and momentum of the game going.<br /><br />A lot of the work that we do as a team is about being in the right position and to get the focus on that. The way to do it is to obviously talk to your defenders, so communicating to them keeps you focused in the game. Being in the right position then allows you to make the right decision if the ball is played over the top. Having that concentration is down to your character. Understanding the game as well, ‘OK, what’s likely to happen if we’ve got the ball in this position and we lose it, where’s the ball likely to go?’. So reading the game and understanding where the ball is going to go is an important factor</p>
