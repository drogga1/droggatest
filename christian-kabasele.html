  <p><b>[Watford’s Christian Kabasele has called for football’s top authorities to crack down harder on individuals committing racial abuse]</b> There’s a lack of understanding and respect for each other. When you saw what the fans of Inter said about it… they just don’t get it. For them it’s just a way to make the opponent lose their head but it’s not right, it’s not the right thing to do. It’s a serious thing to do to make monkey chants in a stadium and it is nothing about making the opponent lose their head. We need to take this problem very seriously and it’s up to the federation to find the right punishment. It’s as simple as that<br /><br /><b>[Kabasele revealed that he too has been subjected to racist insults]</b> Here in England <b>[it happens]</b> on social media. In Belgium and in Bulgaria it happened on the pitch, so it’s not easy. Being treated like an animal hurts a lot and until the federations think of the right punishment then we will still have this kind of problem. It’s horrible. At first you feel really bad and the only thing as a player that you can do is try to report as much as possible when this kind of thing happens. Unfortunately, for the moment the punishment is not so high so we need to take a step in the right direction to try and get some stronger punishments</p>

  <p><b>[Although there has been a target of June 12 for <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> football to return, Hornets defender Christian Kabasele believes that will be impossible]</b> I think it is impossible because it would be less than three weeks training after a long period without doing anything, it’s a risk for us. I’m not sure, I don’t have any information but I think we are not going to start June 12. The most obvious choice for me is the end of June. Like this you have at least four weeks to train with the team if it’s possible. We will see. For the moment it’s a big question mark on this</p>

  <p><b>[Watford defender Christian Kabasele says it will be impossible for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> to return by June 12]</b> We see speak about June 12. I think it is impossible because it would be less than three weeks training after a long period without doing anything, it’s a risk for us. I’m not sure, I don’t have any information but I think we are not going to start June 12. The most obvious choice for me is the end of June. Like this you have at least four weeks to train with the team if it’s possible. We will see. For the moment it’s a big question mark on this<br /><br />The club has been very clear, really clear with that - every individual player is making his own choice. They are not putting pressure on us to say: ‘You have to be back’. It’s about the player, the player’s feelings and every personal situation. For the moment, they came to us with phase one and personally I was quite happy with what they presented to us, so we will see what they are planning for phase two and phase three. If it was starting tomorrow, training 11 v 11 with contact, with everybody at the training ground, I would not go - that’s for sure. But with phase one, personally I think everything is put in place and they have tried to make the training ground as safe as possible.</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Kabasele joked <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> are injecting Covid-19 into players and staff members in a sarcastic response to the club being accused of trying to avoid relegation]</b> So let me explain our tactic: we are doing one injection of Covid-19 once a week. We draw the player/member of staff who gets it <b>[and]</b> like this we are sure that we never play again and avoid relegation.<br /><br /><b>[When the same Twitter user said Kabasele should ‘get back to work’]</b> Can I laugh at someone who can say to someone that he should ‘GET BACK TO WORK’ when actually he went back to work <b>[…]</b> And it’s not a question of being a coward or not when literally you can kill someone from your household if they get the virus from you. Anything else?</p>
