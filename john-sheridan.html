  <p><b>[Young Australian midfielder Aiden O’Neill has made a deadline day loan move from Burnley to Oldham Athletic in League One]</b> He is a good young footballer and good on the ball. Aiden is someone different to what we already have. Hopefully he will get hold of the ball and keep possession of it and it’s a good opportunity for him to come out and play regular first team football. He is definitely good enough but hopefully he will come here, enjoy his time with us and help us to stay in the league.</p>

  <p><b>[John Sheridan was another player given the opportunity to play on some of world football’s biggest stages by <a href="jack-charlton.html">Jack Charlton</a>, most notably at the 1994 World Cup in the USA]</b> He turned things around massively for Ireland. His record speaks for itself. A small country like Ireland was competing with the top teams in the world, so I have massive respect for what he achieved. We had some great times and there were some great characters in the team. No one ever pulled out of a squad, you always wanted to be there in case you were missing something</p>
