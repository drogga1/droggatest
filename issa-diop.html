  <p><b>[West Ham defender Issa Diop claims to be unaware of where reports linking him with Paris Saint-Germain have come from]</b> Honestly, I know nothing about a PSG winter move. I learned the information like you did, I saw them via social media. Perhaps my agent knows more, I need to check with him! I am very good with West Ham right now. I am enjoying getting to know the Premier League each weekend.</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham defender Issa Diop insists he’s fully concentrated on performing for Manuel Pellegrini’s side]</b> I don’t know what it means. It’s for my coach to say <b>[whether he is impressing in the Premier League]</b>. I don’t think my adaptation <b>[to the Premier League]</b> is perfect because we don’t have the number of points we’d hoped for. I continue to learn but to be honest I prepare to play the matches the same way as I did in France.<br /><br />I simply want to show all my qualities for West Ham and to perform as well as I can when I play. Everything else that happens is out of my control<br /><br />West Ham was just the club that wanted me the most, the French clubs did not want me that much. I did not say ‘it’s the Premier League and nowhere else’. I just wanted to go to a club that really wanted me and so from that point of view the choice was not difficult</p>

  <p><b>[Issa Diop hopes that his good form at West Ham will lead to a France call-up so that he can play alongside Kylian Mbappe]</b> Of course, I want to play in the first team of France one day and I hope I can do this with West Ham.<br /><br />I played through the age group sides with Mbappe, Dembele, Rabiot, Kimpembe, Lemar and Hernandez. Firstly I am happy for them and also I want to play with them in the France team. Mbappe is very quick. Sometimes I won the battle. Sometimes not. He is very smart. He has all the qualities of a big player. If you make just one mistake it’s a goal<br /><br />I’ve not played well. I need to improve and I hope I improve quickly. Maybe people have said I have been impressive, but we <b>[have]</b> conceded too many goals. For me, I know I can do more and I can play better</p>

As a player, I am excited by games like this, but I am also excited when we play against <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> or <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>. I am excited by every game!<br /><br />I don’t think they <b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> are unstoppable. I’ll just play the game like any other one. We know <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> is a big player but, for me, I will prepare the same and play the game the same way. Before every game, I watch clips of all the strikers I am going to face so we know what they like and don’t like, but a big player like him can do anything, so he is difficult to stop, but it is not impossible!</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> defender Issa Diop is excited at the prospect of a reunion with former team-mate <a href="sebastien-haller.html">Sebastien Haller</a>, comparing him to <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> and describing him as a complete striker]</b> Sebastien is a very good player, he is very strong and he has very good technique and I hope he is going to score a lot of goals for us! I played alongside him for France under-21s and we had a few games together and also many training sessions, so I know how difficult he is to challenge because he is very tall and very powerful. He uses his body very well to make things tough for the defenders, so I hope he can do that for us<br /><br />It’s true that they are similar because Sebastien is a target man who can also score and do everything. He also has good speed, so I would say he is a complete striker. As a person, he is also very good. He is humble but also very funny, so he will be good to have in the squad. I think he’s going to bring a lot to this club</p>

It’s the club where I want to try to become the best defender I can be, compared to my qualities. Whether technical, tactical, physical, I still have a large margin of progression<br /><br /><b>[He has already represented his country at Under-21 level, but is now knocking on the door of Didier Deschamps’ World Cup-winning squad]</b> It is the performance that I will make in the match that will determine if I have the level to play with Les Bleus. It’s up to me to work. That’s how I see things. All very good players go into the national team. Well, if I am very good, it will come if it should come. Obviously it’s a goal, but the proof that I deserve to reach it, it’s me who must give it</p>
