  <p><b>[Slavia Prague midfielder Tomas Soucek covered 13.1km in the battling 2-0 defeat to Manchester City]</b> I cover all the pitch when I can. In Slavia, we played many of us like this. For example, in the Champions League we wanted to press all over the pitch - and I wanted to help my team here with intensity and running and covering the pitch too. When I am strong, I like to go to both boxes. When I was in school I went very often to some running races. We ran in the park or in the forest. But my mother sometimes ran marathons. I think in the future for fun <b>[I’ll do marathons]</b> - but not now! I prefer this running, with a ball. <br /><br />I like to go to the boxes on both sides, on the defence and the offence, too. I used to play like this in Slavia and I want to play here too. We do some corners and free-kicks to me and to other guys because we are very strong with our height but when we play the match I go very quickly to the box and I want to support our striker from the second line. I have more space there, so it is good for the team and for me, too<br /><br />I used to love playing at all the grounds when I came and now it is very strange. For me it is very good <b>[playing alongside them]</b>. When we have more time together it is better and better. <a href="mark-noble.html">Mark Noble</a> is a great player with many experiences. He is the leader of the changing room and when I came he was very helpful and useful to me for settling in. Declan is a young star and each day he is better and better. We three are together now and we can help <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> stay up.<br /><br /><b>[A win over <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> at the London Stadium on Friday night, though, would be a huge step towards securing their <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> status]</b> This is a massive game for us. It’s a six-pointer game and we have prepared well. I believe we are ready<br /><br /><b>[Premier League survival would also see Soucek turn his loan deal into a permanent transfer]</b> My ambition number one is that I want very quickly to get safety for the club. When we are safe we will help <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> - and I will sign a contract with them too. It is two in one!</p>
