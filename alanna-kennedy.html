  <p><b>[Australian defender Alanna Kennedy was shown a straight red card against Norway in their Round of 16 clash at the Women’s World Cup to the disbellief of players and fans. Kennedy, who was unable to watch the rest of the match due to a faulty TV, believes her sending off was harsh]</b> I felt at the time that my body was in front of hers and it was more or less a 50/50 and as a striker you go down and milk it a little bit, but the decision is what it is and the girls did really well to get us into penalties and that shows the character in our team and we will come back from this. I think there needs to be a lot more clarity around the decisions of the referees. I think its been questionable throughout the whole tournament, and that’s not the way we want to play</p>

  <p><b>[After being sent off in Australia’s Round of 16 loss to Norway at the Women’s World Cup, Matildas centre-back Alanna Kennedy has hit out at the standard of refereeing at the tournament]</b> I felt at the time that my body was in front of hers and it was more or less a 50/50 and as a striker you go down and milk it a little bit. But the decision is what it is and the girls did really well to get us into penalties and that shows the character in our team and we will come back from this<br /><br /><b>[Exiting France earlier than many expected, Kennedy believes the officiating didn’t do the Matildas any favours]</b> I think there needs to be a lot more clarity around the decisions of the referees. I think it’s been questionable throughout the whole tournament, and that’s not the way we want to play. We feel disappointed, we feel we had more potential and our tournament is cut short.<br /><br /><b>[As the green and gold ultimately lost the match against Norway on penalties, Kennedy revealed she was unable to watch the game from the locker room after being sent off]</b> It was very difficult - I couldn’t get the game up on the TV. I was just pacing around I guess. I had full belief in the girls that they would get through. I am really proud of them for gritting it out and at least get to penalties. When you get to penalties anything can happen and that’s a bit of luck. I am so proud of them for the fight we showed throughout the whole tournament and we showed a lot of character. Maybe we didn’t play our best football, but the character and mentality within our team is admirable and I am happy to be part of this team</p>

  <p><b>[The transformation of Australia’s Sam Kerr: From wild winger to best No.9 in women’s football]</b> I was about 13 when I first came into Under-17s Australia camp. Because Sam’s from Perth, she was running a bit late and everyone was going, ‘Oh Sam will be here soon, Sam this, Sam that’. I was like, ‘Who is this Sam that everyone is going on about?’ And then she rocked up, the chick from Perth, and she was wild as ever. She’s always been pretty upbeat and a fun person to be around. She’s just an unreal athlete, raw talent, and just unbelievably talented<br /><br />I think Sam’s the first person to say that she’d give up all her individual awards for team accolades</p>
