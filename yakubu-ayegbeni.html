<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Nigeria legend Yakubu Ayegbeni announces his retirement]</b> I would like to officially announce my retirement from professional football today. Firstly, I would like to thank God for the career I have had. I would like to thank the entire Nigerian Football Federation and my Nigerian national team-mates for all the memorable years I had playing for the Super Eagles. I would also like to thank all the football clubs I played for. The managers, all club staff, owners, fellow players and my dearest family and friends who immensely supported me throughout my career. When I started my career at Julius Berger in Nigeria all those years ago <b>[1997]</b> I could only have dreamt of the success that was to follow years after. Also playing in England especially helped me grow as a player and as a person so much that I am now settled here. I feel the time is right for me to now focus on the next chapter in my life</p>
