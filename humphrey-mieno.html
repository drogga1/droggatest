<blockquote>
  <p>[Tusker FC started the season badly, getting eliminated from Caf Champions League, losing KPL Super Cup and falling in first two league matches] It is a fact we started the season badly, but we have turned it around. Everybody has worked hard for this to happen and at this rate, we can only be better and better. We had several new players at the beginning of the season, and the coach was also new, and honestly, it took us time to get an understanding as well as get used to the new tactics implemented by the coach. However things have changed, now we have that knowledge and the good thing is that co-ordination and understanding between us. The team is gelling well and to me, this is a massive step forward to the right direction.</p>
