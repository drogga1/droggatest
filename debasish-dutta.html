  <p><b>[Mohun Bagan have been banned from participating in the ongoing 2016/17 of the U-18 I-League for fielding an overage player as adjudicated by the I-League’s Supreme Committee]</b> I have heard the news but I exactly do not know of what has happened. I do not oversee the operations of the junior team. The people who do will be better suited to give answers regarding the same.</p>

  <p><b>[Mohun Bagan and East Bengal apprehensive on AFC meeting after AIFF snub]</b> No one has any idea what happened in that meeting. The promotion of the I-League is diluting and as a result the ISL’s growing with better standard of telecast. Obviously the financial support is huge and in that case, there are no takers for the I-League. ISL is the number one tournament commercially, visually and viably. So, why have two parallel tournaments? It’s a way of compromise. Wasn’t the motive to have a long tournament afterall?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Debasish Dutta, Mohun Bagan financial secretary, said that the franchise fee was never a factor in their decision to ultimately stay away from the ISL]</b> We had the financial capability of paying the franchise fees, but we didn’t want to pay it on principle. We are not against the ISL, but the AIFF should have a proper plan and structure in place.<br /><br />We want the Mohun Bagan-East Bengal I-League Derby to be played at the Salt Lake Stadium. Not only that, we also want to play some of our key matches at that venue. We will be taking up the matter with state sports minister Aroop Biswas soon. If the stadiums are full when Bagan or East Bengal play, that will send a message to the AIFF and the ISL. They will perhaps then understand the legacy of these two clubs</p>

  <p><b>[Mohun Bagan ups the ante against East Bengal and IFA]</b> IFA is not Indian Football Association any more. They are now East Bengal Football Association. Their job is to help that club win the league.</p>
