<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> goalkeeper Roy Carroll has recalled details from the two-hour conversation he had with <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> before he joined the club]</b> was very close to signing for <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> when I was at Wigan. Everything was agreed. We had met and agreed the next day I would sign. But then in the end their coach, Peter Taylor, told me they wanted a more experienced goalkeeper and they signed Ian Walker. I was very upset, but that’s what happens in football and then a few days later <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> called. I couldn’t believe it. We talked on the phone for two hours. He told me that they had been watching me for the last two years. I was very nervous at the time, but also so happy, at 23 years old. I was talking to the best coach in the world. After I agreed, I would meet my new team-mates three weeks later. Until that day came, I couldn’t sleep<br /><br />The fact that I went through <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> was a great honour. We won <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, an incredible feeling. I never expected it to happen to me<br /><br /><b>[Recalling his first time at the club’s Carrington training ground]</b> He approached me and said, ‘Hello, I’m <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>.’ I knew who he was and I introduced myself. There was no reason, but I was nervous. But, they all made me feel very happy. I had a fantastic time. It’s a dream come true for many to play for United. We won titles, we had 70,000 spectators. every game. But, I didn’t leave with the best breath because we lost <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup final to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in 2005</p>
