  <p><b>[Alphonse Areola is intent on making the most of his opportunity at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> as he looks to emulate his goalkeeping idol <a href="iker-casillas.html">Iker Casillas</a>]</b> I have spoken to my friends and family about what it means to be number one in this side. <a href="iker-casillas.html">Casillas</a> was one of my idols when I was young in France, he made me want to play in goal. In fact, I’ve got a shirt of his from when I was young. I think it’s good to try and take on this responsibility to be number one and try and prove I can be number one. It’s true, I only have one year on loan here, but I’ve seen the stadium, the history here and I’m going to do as much as I possibly can. Of course, there’s a hierarchy already but as soon as I get the chance I’m going to try and show the level I’ve got. It was a good opportunity to come to the biggest club in the world and take advantage of that, to improve as a player and discover a new opportunity. It’s a great opportunity for me.<br /><br /><b>[Areola added another deciding factor in his transfer was <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>, with the goalkeeper honoured to be playing under a France legend]</b> It is true I am coming to a club that is coached by a legend. It is an honour for me to be here with <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>, to play under him, and I am going to do the best I can for him. He’s given me a great welcome. My objective is to give everything I can every day in training, be ready for every game. When I have a chance to show my level, show how good I can be, I have to be strong and show what I am worth</p>

  <p><b>[Alphonse Areola refused to reveal if he has spoken with <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> about joining him at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, while confirming he has also had no such conversation with Paul <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>]</b> The thing I’ve spoken to Kylian about is his injury, he has to get back as quickly as possible from that and we’ll see what happens in the future. I can’t go into detail if we’ve spoken about Madrid or not. I’m here and I want to be part of the history of this club. He’s at Paris at the moment, he needs to recover from his injury, get his level back. Everyone has their own way forward, their own story and we’ll see what happens at the end of the season<br /><br />I have not spoken to Paul. He was injured in the last time we met with the national team, but I know him well. He’s a great person, a great player with great quality. But everyone has their own way and their own road, so we’ll see what happens<br /><br /><b>[<a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a>’s injury means he is set to miss <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>’s Champions League meeting with Madrid on September 18, a fixture Areola is relishing]</b> It’s great coincidence that we play <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, I’m going to go back to the club very quickly. <b>[Madrid’s players]</b> haven’t spoken about that yet, about how they’re going to play. For me it’s about getting involved in the squad and being comfortable here, I am very happy to have trained now we’ve got a game, it’s an important one against Levante and we have to prove that we’re ready</p>

It’s up to me to decide what to do in my career. It was a good opportunity for me to come to the biggest club in the world. I’m going to enjoy this year and hopefully grow a little more. It’s a quirk of destiny to head back <b>[to Paris]</b> so fast. But in the locker room, I have not talked about their squad or the training led by Tuchel</p>
