  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen have confirmed the signing of highly-rated Greece Under-21 international defender Panagiotis Retsos from Olympiakos]</b> Bayer have always played in the Champions League, despite a difficult national competition, which has impressed me very much. To be wanted by such a club makes me proud and I’m looking forward to playing in the Bundesliga in one of the most attractive leagues in Europe.</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Barcelona &amp; Arsenal target Panagiotis Retsos?]</b> One morning I got a call from Olympiacos, they told me that Leverkusen gave that money and that I had to prepare my suitcases. It was my dream to play with Olympiacos in the Champions League, but I knew I must lose something to gain something. Since then, I have thought about it many times and I have concluded that it’s as if God wanted it to happen. I can really say it was the right choice. It has been a rapid rise for a talent that spent eight years bubbling away in Olympiacos’ academy, but the pace has been manageable for Retsos. Stepping into a club, league and culture in which a player his age faces greater expectations than in Greece, the change has been immense, but he is thriving.<br /><br />The young players here have the opportunity to play without stress, without fear of making a mistake. It’s something very good for us and any mistakes we make makes us stronger. In Germany, players aged 17 and 18 get their first experiences at the top level. They may not be ‘ready’, but they think they are ready to fight, to make their start. This is something that doesn’t happen in Greece, 17 and 18-year-olds are still considered talents, they play in youth teams and start playing after 20 or 21, but I think that’s a bit late.</p>
