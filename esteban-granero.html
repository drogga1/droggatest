  <p><b>[Esteban Granero tells about the first time he saw <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> star <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>]</b> We went to a tournament in <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> with <b>[Real]</b> Madrid and we were in the same hotel as <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a>. I had a good relationship with some of the players from the national teams: <a href="gerard-pique.html">Pique</a>, Marc Valiente, Cesc… I saw <a href="gerard-pique.html">Pique</a> in the hotel. At that time, we always used to beat them. But <a href="gerard-pique.html">Pique</a> told me: ‘This year, we will beat you’. I said no fucking way. ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘because we have a new player who is brilliant’. I asked him who and he pointed <b>[at <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>]</b> by the swimming pool. I saw a small kid, really small. He was sat on the edge of the pool with his feet in the water, lost in his own world, thinking about other things. <a href="gerard-pique.html">Pique</a>’s a prankster, always has been, and I thought he was winding me up. In fact, I thought: ‘He’s winding me up and messing with his own team-mate. That was the first time I saw Messi’</p>

  <p><b>[Esteban Granero says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>’s legendary status at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> built on taking down best-ever <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> I was always afraid to even think or dream about playing in these kinds of games. Then you blink and you are standing there on the pitch. The referee is ready to go so you are there and you have to perform. I always supported <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and I went to the stadium ever since I was five and I started in the academy when I was nine. You are always in a place where you have to win when you play for them. I played 100 competitive games for them, which was a dream come true. The summer that I arrived at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> saw <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, <a href="kaka.html">Kaka</a>, <a href="xabi-alonso.html">Xabi Alonso</a> and <a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a> come in. There were legends already in the team like Raul, <a href="guti.html">Guti</a> and <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a>. I was in the starting 11 almost every game so it was a dream. You had to be 100 per cent or more to be there in this fantastic team. When I arrived at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, we were fighting the best <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> ever in terms of their football. We fought them and we managed to win the Copa del Rey against them and then the league. It was the best <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> in history and we managed to win the league against them. We scored a record 121 goals in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> in 2011-12. It was the best season in my career.<br /><br /><a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> had just signed for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and I joined a month-and-a-half later. I was training with him and then playing with him. He made a huge impact in his 10 years at the club. His impact in terms of performance and leadership has been huge. I can only mention two comparable players before him in Raul and Di Stefano, and I think that he is up with them as one of the most important legends we have had<br /><br />When I arrived <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a> was a very young kid. He was potentially very good. You didn’t know he was going to be this good, though. The first thing that you notice is that he loves football above everything else and you can see this. He is so different from when he is outside the pitch than inside the pitch. Outside, he is a joker and he provides a lot of fun for the dressing room. Then, when he is on the pitch, he becomes aggressive like a champion. This is something that all top players have. You could see it clearly. In my time there, he exploded. He had the ability, he is one of the top players in the world and I am happy to see him having played for big clubs. I always hope he makes good decisions and keeps pushing<br /><br />I have been in this company for five years, so I have been running the company and playing at the same time. To me, football is important but not the only thing. It is my passion and my first memories are playing football. Everything I have done has been focused on being a footballer. I wanted to always do my best. I am so happy to be at a great team and a great club. I came here with something in mind and not everyone understood my decision. Some consider it a waste that I play for them and this opinion is based on the division. I can have a very important role in leadership here to help us gain promotion from the third division. I didn’t want to spend my last years as an impact player on the bench in an easy retirement path. I wanted to face the biggest challenge of my career, which is to drop down myself to help this club go up. This is my passion. We have a lot of free time as footballers and we can use it in different ways. I decided to launch a company in my free time and it is important for me. The most important thing that I have learned through all this is how important anticipation is. It is something that happens for a midfield player in the game, to see what happens before it happens. This is also important for every decision in clubs, like a big signing. It is important that you can anticipate the performance of this player in a new context in order to make a decision. This is our vision and this is how we have been able to create solutions in terms of predictions. These are the answers the clubs are looking for. They don’t want to know how they performed in the past, but they want to know how they will perform in the future and we need to be able to answer this question. This question can only be answered by artificial intelligence. We have been working harder than ever on the virus problem so we thought it would be important for society. It has been a huge impact and no one was ready for this kind of problem. To stop in this way is something critical to the industry. I think for one or two years there will be problems in the budgets for new signings. In this situation, clubs need to make smarter decisions, which is something you can do if you use artificial intelligence to power your process. This is a difficult situation for clubs but we are here to help</p>
