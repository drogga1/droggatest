  <p><b>[Kenyan player Clifton Miheso has denied reports that he was forced to terminate his contract with Golden Arrows at gunpoint]</b> This is to state my disappointment on the news claiming that you had me threatened. This is all incorrect. In fact, I am grateful to you and everything you have done for me. The termination agreement I signed is correct and I was not forced to sign it. I did this willingly and I have been paid everything due to me. I wish to state my apologies for everything.</p>
