  <p><b>[John Achterberg claims <a href="alisson-becker.html">Alisson Becker</a> has enjoyed a stunning debut campaign at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> When you come new into <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, you always need time to settle in, but he picked it up quickly. There were a couple of areas where he needed to adapt, but everything else was automatic. We worked in training on the things that could happen in terms of aggression, players trying to block and things like that, so I think he was well prepared. If you have a season like he’s just had - and we still have one game to go - it’ll be hard to beat. 21 league clean sheets! He had a great season and his level was probably one of the best in the world, so we cannot complain. In the Champions League, he made some massive saves for us - the <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> save for us to get qualification for the next stage - and then in the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> game, you cannot make any errors and he made some match-winning saves to get us the clean sheet we needed. Hopefully next year we can improve even further; there are always small things we can be better on. We’ve spoken to Ali about them and hopefully he can improve even further for next season. Our aim is to do it again.<br /><br />He is really calm under pressure and makes good decisions. The calmness he gives to the team, the decision-making, that is vital for any goalkeeper. He is always able to make a match-winning save and make the team steady in front of him, knowing if anything goes wrong he will be there. You have to be in every moment 100 per cent focused and make the right decisions - that’s what he has been doing consistently for most of the season. That’s the level he produced - and now we need to try to make that even better<br /><br /><b>[Alisson conceded just 22 goals across 38 appearances in the 2018-19 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> season, with his performances ensuring that back-up keeper <a href="simon-mignolet.html">Simon Mignolet</a> barely got a look in]</b> Simon has been for a long period a No.1 goalkeeper, so it’s not an easy situation for him. You always want to play; you always have to find the motivation and drive to keep going and wait for the moment you’re needed. He has been unbelievable in that way. He has been training day in, day out to the highest level, in the gym doing everything perfectly - the perfect lifestyle and perfect professional. He has given a good example to all the young ‘keepers at the club and it’s really important he is part of the team as well. Si has a good level, of course, and I can be only positive about him</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> goalkeeping coach John Achterberg says the club have reaped the benefits from their massive investment in <a href="alisson-becker.html">Alisson Becker</a>]</b> It is unbelievable the way he stayed calm in the difficult situations and the saves he makes, he takes the team through the pressure moments. He’s done it in a few games: <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> to get to the knockout round, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> to get to the final. What can you say? Decision-making you cannot train, you train and try to prepare but what he does is so unbelievable in his first year in the UK. Also staying calm under high pressure is not teachable, it is natural. In training, you can prepare what’s going to happen in a game and situations you can train but decision-making, when to come, when to stay, when to be calm and when to play, he showed that’s all him. We bought an expensive goalie but he paid it back with the trophy, he had a big hand in it anyway.<br /><br />There are always things he can improve but the level he has produced this season is probably one of the best in the world. He showed it. He has set a standard for himself and to try to overtake it again because that is the drive you have to create as a player, always to be better<br /><br />That’s football. It’s tough for the one and f**king great for the other, it’s true. The staff and the players work their balls off and we have to go again. You can’t say anything about the investment from the owners either because that has helped as well. Hopefully we keep it going and try to win the next one</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s goalkeeping coach John Achterberg says Alisson is progressing well in his recovery from an untimely calf injury]</b> Ali is good. He’s in every day for treatment and they try to improve things. He’s able to do some fitness work in the gym without using his leg. It’s difficult, but you have to try to look forward and be positive. You have to try to turn a negative into a positive<br /><br /><b>[When pressed on a possible return date]</b> They haven’t given us a specific time he’ll be out as it’s difficult to say how quickly it will heal. That’s all with the medics. There’s an international break coming up and we’ll have to wait and see how long it takes after that<br /><br />At the start, you always think that a goalie needs time to settle a little bit. Playing for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is very difficult. A lot of people don’t want to give you time. But from day one, Ali was really there for us. He cost us one goal <b>[at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>]</b> finding out what was possible and not possible in terms of playing out from the back, but that’s what you expect. Look back in history at how many keepers came to England and were ready straight away. I can tell you <a href="edwin-van-der-sar.html">Edwin van der Sar</a> wasn’t when he started at Fulham, <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a> definitely wasn’t at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> because he struggled for more than a year. <a href="fabien-barthez.html">Fabien Barthez</a> wasn’t either. It’s not easy, but Ali is very strong mentally and adapted really quick. Before, the crowd at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> was on edge a lot with the goalies but he changed that around<br /><br /><b>[So impressive has Alisson been, there is now talk that he could join Reds team-mate <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> in the battle for the 2019 Ballon d’Or]</b> It’s difficult for a goalie to win that. You probably have to be on the scene and regarded as the best for a few years. <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Manuel Neuer</a> had a period like that and he only got to third place. That’s what Ali has to strive for too. In my opinion he’s definitely been the best goalie out there over the past year. It’s about desire and mentality - wanting to be better than all the goalies in training, wanting to be better than the goalie you’re up against at the weekend. You have to set yourself targets. Get to five clean sheets as quickly as possible, then get to 10. What’s the record? If it’s 25, say you want 26. That’s how you keep yourself hungry and sharp in your own mind, on top of what we supply training-wise</p>

  <p><b>[John Achterberg has indicated that Alisson has made a return to light training]</b> In the last few days he has been out on the pitch to do some catching and footwork, as well as small passing drills. He has made steady progress. It needs time and we cannot look too far ahead, so we take each day as it comes, see how he feels, and then make progress from that. Ali has been working with Dave Rydings <b>[rehabilitation fitness coach]</b> in the gym a lot to improve the strength and try to keep the fitness levels up</p>

  <p><b>[Goalkeeping coach John Achterberg says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have not been able to complain much at all about stand-in goalkeeper <a href="adrian.html">Adrian</a>]</b> He had to come in from <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> and he had to settle quickly. Everything he has done so far has been really good, we have not been able to complain much at all. It’s a different style of play, with <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> he had to kick the ball long 90 per cent of the time, but we ask him to be calm on the ball and play out from the back. To be fair, he has picked it up really quickly. He has adapted fast, even though he had a lot of experience playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. It has helped him a lot to settle quickly. He is a calm and confident guy but also a really good guy. He fits in well, I would say. Big credit to him and what he has done. It has been really good, so we cannot complain<br /><br /><b>[<a href="adrian.html">Adrian</a> was not the only shot-stopper drafted in by <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as their ranks were depleted by injury and the departure of <a href="simon-mignolet.html">Simon Mignolet</a>. Andy Lonergan was also acquired, but the 35-year-old is only working on a short-term deal]</b> Lonergan has come in to do this job because of the injury. He has done a good job and he works really hard every day. That is a good step for us this year. We will have to look at the end of the season to decide what we will do<br /><br /><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have high hopes for 20-year-old Irishman <a href="caoimhin-kelleher.html">Caoimhin Kelleher</a> - who recently made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup clash with MK Dons]</b> I was proud and happy for him because he shows every day in training his speed and reactions. That is why he is in the Irish squad and they thought that he can give the No.1 in Ireland big competition but he needs to play games to show. By making this appearance <b>[against MK Dons]</b> he can make big strides and steps. He reads the game and plays well with his feet for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. But he shot-stopping and his reactions is massive for any club, I would say. This is where he is good and it is what he showed against MK Dons.<br /><br />He can keep making the next steps and how far he goes is how he can producing these displays on the field because that is where you are going to be assessed. In my opinion, he can be anything. It depends how he develops. In an ideal world you have three top goalkeepers but maybe at third choice you have an experienced keeper or a young talented boy who can step up. There are two talented boys at the academy but they are still some way off. Vitezslav Jaros and Jakub Ojrzynski, they still have to improve to get to the level of first team</p>

  <p><b>[q: Firstly, John, this is the second year in a row that Alisson has been the top-ranked goalkeeper in the Goal 50 list. Is there any doubt in your mind that he is the best around right now?
]</b> Well, you don’t want to say it too much in the open, but if you look at it and you follow goalkeepers, he deserves it. Last year, he won everything that was there to win for him, and he was the most consistent goalie around. I don’t think many people would argue that. Now, the chance is there for him to do it again and again and again. That’s something we talk about with him.<br /><br />You have to find your focus and find a way to reproduce your form over time. It’s about desire, wanting to be the best goalkeeper in training, wanting to be better than the opposition goalkeeper, wanting to be the best you can possibly be. You have to create that mentality, get five clean sheets, get 10, set yourself targets as a person, to be the best in every aspect you can be. When you lose that drive, that’s the moment you will decline</p>

I’m always looking for goalkeepers, everywhere. If someone gets discussed in the press, I want to know, or if there is an under-17 championships or an under-19s tournament, I want to watch. It was <b>[Alexander]</b> Doni, our former goalie at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, who came to me about Alisson. He said that he had big potential, that he could be really good.

To play for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, we are looking for every aspect to be the best it can be.

  <p><b>[q: Is it true you looked to sign <a href="alisson-becker.html">Alisson Becker</a> in 2015?]</b> Yes, we were looking for a goalkeeper who could come in and challenge for the No.1 spot. We were looking at <a href="neto.html">Neto</a> from <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> but he chose to go to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> that summer, so we needed an alternative. I had been following Alisson in Brazil, so his name came up. The problem we had was the EU passport; he didn’t have one, and he wasn’t an international player, and so there was no chance to do a deal at that time. The next year, he went to Roma, so we were able to follow him even more closely. He played against us in a friendly match in <a href="st-louis.html">St Louis</a> and he was impressive. That was when I told the manager <b>[<a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>]</b> about him.</p>

He arrived into the group when we were at the training camp in Evian, and I think that was a really important week for him and for the team. He showed the boys pretty quickly what he was about. The boys all liked what they saw straight away, on and off the field. I remember he sang for the boys in Brazilian with his guitar, and he was pretty good! He fits in well. Everyone likes him, he is able to get on with the boys and that is important. You want all your players to feel part of it, and Alisson is very much a part of it. He’s an important guy in the dressing room, for sure</p>

As a coach, you are there to help and express your ideas, but you are part of a team and you have to listen to what the player wants as well. He is the one who has to play, so I ask him ‘What do you want?’ He needs to feel good, comfortable. He is a football fan. His brother, Muriel, is a goalie as well, so it runs in the family.

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> coach reveals what makes Alisson one of the world’s best]</b> He is a goalie who has no fear - if he does something, he sticks to his decision. In his mind, he knows what to do and he doesn’t hesitate. That is natural goalkeeping, having no fear, reading the game and deciding.<br /><br />If Ali receives the ball, he is always looking to counter and restart the game quickly, in keeping with our way of playing. Mo <b>[<a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>]</b> and Ali have had eye contact, they’re looking at each other, and Ali knows he has made the move and then has the quality to put the ball out into his path. When Ali cuts a corner or cross out, the first thing he is looking at is if there is the possibility of a quick restart with a throw or a side-volley. One of his big strengths is to stay calm in the high-pressure moments and making what look like natural, easy decisions, but they’re not easy because you always need perfect solutions and decisions. It’s a quality he has. Some reactions of a goalkeeper are instinctive, of course. It can be a split-second decision, but the main thing is your mind always has to be in an attacking mode, never take it off deciding whether you can reach the ball before anyone else, for example. If it’s a 50/50 or a 60/40, am I fast enough to get there to win it? That’s a mindset, but also a quality he has too, because he has the speed and reacts for it. It is a combination of everything in this moment</p>
