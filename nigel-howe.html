  <p><b>[West Ham starlet Reece Oxford has left the Hammers and moved to Championship side Reading on loan for the rest of the season]</b> Reece was a player who was wanted on loan by a number of clubs and we are absolutely delighted to have secured his services for the remainder of the season. He is young, but hungry for success and I am sure he will prove an excellent addition to our squad and learn a lot during his spell under Jaap Stam at Reading.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> Matt Miazga has been sent back to Reading for a second spell with the Championship club]</b> Even as a player at the early stage of his career, Matt showed last season that he has a mature head on young shoulders and plenty to offer the squad both on and off the pitch. I am pleased that he has been keen to return to Reading and I look forward to seeing his contribution for the Royals in the coming season.</p>
