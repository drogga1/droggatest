  <p><b>[Charlotte awarded 30th <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> franchise after paying record-breaking expansion fee]</b> The awarding of an expansion team for Charlotte by <a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a> is a proud moment and significant for Charlotte and everyone in our community. I’ve made clear for a long time that I have two goals as a team owner: sustained winning on the field and making a difference in the community. These will be our goals with Charlotte’s <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> team, and the work begins today</p>

  <p><b>[Party’s over? <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> expansion reaches its climax as Charlotte solidifies final spot]</b> You have to understand how fast this process was in Charlotte. From day one, it was important to get this process going. I was very much afraid that there would only be 30 teams here and I thought that Charlotte was an ideal place for <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. When you talk about the last two entries, they were in this stage three years. This hasn’t been a three-year process. This was 20 months ago or 18 months ago coming in here and saying what we’re going to do and then trying to do it<br /><br />I’ll tell ya, I was hoping that the price would be lower but it wasn’t! It is what it is and it’s a great thing for the city and, in the long term, hopefully, it’s a good business decision too. We’ll see about that<br /><br /><b>[Tepper really ignited the mood]</b> We’re going to have one big party. All season long for soccer in Charlotte. Every game. Every game is a party</p>
