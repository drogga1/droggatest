  <p><b>[Hungary remain the underdogs to qualify for Euro 2016 despite their first-leg play-off win]</b> We are at the halfway stage <b>[of the tie]</b>. We are already looking forward to the return in Hungary. We played well, made a fantastic start and created two early chances. Unfortunately, we were not sharp in the box. I told the players: let this result motivate you for Sunday</p>

  <p><b>[Norway coach Per-Mathias Hogmo accepted his team were outplayed by Hungary in their Euro 2016 play-off]</b> First of all, congratulations to the Hungary team on their qualification for the finals in France next summer - they were better than us over the two legs. I have been pleased with our qualification campaign but disappointed that we didn’t come up to that level in the home game <b>[on Thursday]</b> and also tonight.<br /><br />Since we didn’t score from our chances at home we picked an offensive team today. It didn’t succeed in the first half so we changed things around for the second half. Not scoring from the six or seven good chances we created at home was the problem</p>
