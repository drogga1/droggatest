  <p><b>[Dutch coach Sarina Wiegman on Sherida Spitse’s penalty in Rotterdam gave the Netherlands a 1-0 win over Denmark]</b> Denmark wanted to score and played much deeper in the second half with more players up front, and we had difficulties with that</p>

  <p><b>[Sarina Wiegman was named as the best women’s coach after winning Euro 2017 with Holland]</b> Thank you for this award. It is a great recognition that I got this. But without the team and without the great staff we had during the tournament we would not have achieved what we achieved. Also, thanks to my parents - my mum, my dad - and my family - my husband and my two kids. They are always so supportive</p>

  <p><b>[Patrizia Panico hosted Sarina Wiegman across an intensive five-day training camp, during which her side played twice (against Turkey), and Wiegman observed the games as well as training and analysis sessions]</b> We’ve had good days here in Florence, exchanged a lot of information. I can see whatever I want, be a part of everything - I’ve really enjoyed being here at Coverciano. It’s good to see how she works and the other way round. I also ask her a lot of questions. Maybe questions she didn’t think of yet with the experiences I’ve had and so we get into a discussion which is really good, and we both learn from that<br /><br /><b>[And their targets for the end of the Coach Mentorship Programme in November?]</b> Just to improve. <b>[Patrizia]</b> wants to improve everyday, I want to do that as well, and if we can help each other - maybe it’s five per cent, or 20 per cent, I don’t know - but I think then you have achieved something<br /><br /><b>[This pioneering pair’s mentor-mentee relationship will continue in the next visit, with Wiegman set to host]</b> Now we are planning for <b>[Patrizia]</b> to come to the Netherlands, where she’ll join a training camp of the Dutch national team. I can show her how I work with my staff, what other things are on my plate like the media, other expectations - so she can be aware of my situation and we can share things again and hopefully we can help each other</p>

  <p><b>[The Netherlands head into the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Women’s World Cup France 2019™ as contenders for the crown]</b> We wanted to show everyone how good we were and that came with the European Championships. But what we do is focus on football and improving every day. During the World Cup - of course - we have a dream, like everyone else, and we do think that we are a team that others want to beat</p>

  <p><b>[Despite not starting a game at the tournament and playing 103 minutes of football compared to Shanice van de Sanden’s 367, Lineth Beerensteyn has a goal and an assist to her name while her team-mate has just one assist]</b> I think she’s having a hard time. Shanice has proven recently that she can give great assists and make goals. Now she has trouble with that, the return is lower. We know that she is that moment footballer, she is very dangerous in the depths. We have talked to her, as we do with all players, and we are going to evaluate and see what we need against Sweden</p>

  <p><b>[United States vs Netherlands. Boss Sarina Wiegman admits her side are up against it, but doesn’t think they will buckle in the face of the likely early onslaught from the USA]</b> We’re the underdog. I’m fine with that. They have a lot of confidence, won many tournaments and <b>[have been]</b> at the top level for a long time. The chances of us going behind are big. We will need to be very focused and sharp, especially for the first 15 minutes</p>
