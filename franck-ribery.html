But you have to consistently show performances like that if you want to be world class. People are so quick to say someone is a fantastic player and deserves to win the Ballon d’Or after just one good year. I disagree with that. For me, you have to prove yourself over ten, 12 or 15 years if you want to be among the best. Do that and then I will congratulate you. I might have been out for nine months or so due to injury, but I have almost always been playing at the highest level over the past ten years or so</p>

  <p><b>[Franck Ribery may have left Bayern Munich, but he is still extremely vocal about what the club should be doing in the transfer market this summer]</b> Bayen need quality, you have to invest and upgrade! I very keenly follow what they are doing. With only Serge Gnabry and Kingsley Coman is it perhaps not enough to go into the new season. Both are good players, but constantly playing a top-level season is a new challenge - especially as both have always had problems with injuries. Bayern needs more wingers.<br /><br /><b>[The former Bayern man had some clear views on links with Manchester City’s Leroy Sane]</b> Sane would be a player who could help Bayern to move forward. He’s skillful, can play on the right and left side, and I’m curious to see if he will really fancies the Bundesliga and will opt for Munich<br /><br /><b>[On his own next move]</b> Maybe they <b>[Bayern]</b> will call me again, if there is no other solution. No, seriously: My chapter at Bayern as a player ended fantastically for me in May. I’ve had many good offers from Europe, but I also have to consider my family, my children. When you’ve been Bayern for so long and it’s your second home, moving away from here is not easy</p>

  <p><b>[Franck Ribery hopes to play on beyond the age of 40 after joining Fiorentina]</b> We have had a very long negotiation, but I am very happy to be here in Florence. I saw great motivation and great confidence in me from the management, and that is why I am here. Naturally, my wife also helped in the choice, because my family is very important. I am very motivated, I always want to play. I have a two-year contract and I want to be decisive and help the young players. I want to give something new to this club, I want to bring Fiorentina into the top three of the table. I came here to help my team, which is Fiorentina. I am not here to be a rival to Ronaldo. Serie A is a great tournament with many excellent players. Inter bought well on the market, as did Juventus. The thing I appreciate the most is that people here love and live for football. It’s a wonderful experience and I want to enjoy myself on the field. Football is my life. It’s the reason I wanted to remain in Europe and I was fortunate to find Fiorentina. I hope to continue playing until the age of 40, just like Francesco Totti.<br /><br /><b>[Fiorentina open the new Serie A season at home to Napoli on Saturday but Ribery is not expecting to be involved]</b> I am not ready to start, but I am happy that I got to train with the squad today, which is very different to training by yourself. I need a week or two to be ready to play, but if the coach <b>[Vincenzo Montella]</b> tells me that I’m needed, I will step up</p>

It’s a huge arena, so many fans. It’s a bit difficult for Milan fans right now, but we put in a good performance and that’s important for us. Yes, I am old, but I feel young on the pitch.

He plays without fear. After his four goals against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, more is expected, but Serge is a man, not a machine.
