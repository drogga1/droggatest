I have always given 100 per cent, power and performance. I always respected this jersey. I will never forget what the club and the fans did for me. That’s hard, but that’s life in football. We have to wait and see. Many people ask me about my situation for next season. But I do not want to think about that too much. I’m feeling good and will be 36 in a few months.

That would be great for me personally and my family and, of course, for the fans too. When I joined Bayern the relationship was immediately great. I always want to do special things for the fans when I’m on the pitch. I always want to play well because it feels so good to wear this jersey. I always wanted to get the jersey really wet for my club. The fans know I have heart and that I’m honest, we always had a good relationship.

He plays without fear. After his four goals against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, more is expected, but Serge is a man, not a machine. It’s not easy to show top performances in every game, but Serge will continue on his way without putting too much pressure <b>[on himself]</b><br /><br /><b>[Ribery also feels the burgeoning alliance between star striker <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a> and on-loan <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> playmaker <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> will continue to yield handsome returns]</b> <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> can now play different variations and <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> is good for <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a>.

  <p><b>[Franck Ribery says the affection he feels for <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> has justified his decision to shun transfer interest from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> I had other contacts, in England and also in Italy, but there was a spark with the <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> executives. When I agreed to come to Florence I couldn’t know that it would be love at first sight, but that’s how it has been since the evening of the presentation. That night was special and I will always carry it with me.

I looked at her and replied: ‘Maybe you’re right’. Two weeks later, we were here and she says: ‘See? Look where we are’. She was right. I also talked a lot with <a href="luca-toni.html">Luca Toni</a> who told me about the fans and the club. I am really very happy to have come to Florence<br /><br /><b>[The winger is delighted to see his strong performances recognised with the MVP award amid his bright start to life in Italy]</b> I’m pleased because it is a good league, the whole world knows that. There are so many excellent teams like <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, Inter, <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>, Roma, <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a>. And people live for football. Even <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> is now an important club<br /><br />I don’t know. I haven’t thought about it yet. But two years could be possible. We hope to still be at <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a>. I came here because I’m hungry and I want to be able to win something. But the future cannot be foreseen</p>
