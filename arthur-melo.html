  <p><b>[Arthur Melo speaks about his relationships with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> team-mate <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and Brazil team-mate Neymar]</b> <b>[Neymar is]</b> a simple guy, really playful. We’ve got close, he helped me a lot with Brazil. When I came to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, he called me to do dinner, to do something, to meet up. Online I play video games with him. We speak nearly every day. When he plays on my side, he wins, but when he’s against me, he loses. <b>[Messi is]</b> a guy I admire and, in my opinion and many other people, he’s the best player in history. He gave me a lot of confidence, he helped me in training and in games. If the best player in the world praises you, I think that gives you some extra confidence. I am really grateful for his words and the attitude he has with me and everyone else in the dressing room</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona midfielder Arthur is convinced the squad and fans want Neymar to return to Camp Nou from Paris Saint-Germain]</b> I have not talked to him <b>[Neymar]</b> about this issue. I don’t like to bother about it because he is already asked a lot. I talk about other things with him. I don’t know if he will come to Barcelona. Let’s see what happens with him. Me, the fans and the team would like him to come to Barcelona. He’s a star and I really like playing with him in the national team. I don’t know if he has to take a step <b>[by saying he wants to leave]</b>, as <b>[Gerard]</b> Pique said, but as a friend I wish him the best<br /><br /><b>[Arthur has no wish to see Coutinho leave, but is backing him to take whatever decision makes him happy]</b> It’s his decision. He has to talk to his family, he has to be happy to stay. I think he’s happy. My wish is <b>[for him]</b> to stay. He is happy these days and working hard, like everyone. I think he has everything to stay at Barca</p>

  <p><b>[Arthur rubbishes talk of Inter move]</b> Inter? It’s an honour that they’re interested in me, but my time at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> has not ended. It’s an honour for any player to be linked with big clubs like Inter, who have a great coach and an impressive squad, but my head is exclusively focused on <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, I am so happy at the club and in the city. Honestly, I see myself here for many years. I feel integrated and I feel better physically all the time. I am taking advantage of this time to completely recover and I can’t wait for competitions to return, that’s all I am thinking about</p>
