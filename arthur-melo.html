  <p><b>[Arthur explained after sealing a pre-contract deal]</b> When the stories started coming out about Barça’s rumoured interest, I had a short conversation with Neymar with the national team. I asked him about Barcelona and he only had praise for the club and the city. He recommended Barcelona to me. After that I spoke with Philippe Coutino on Instagram, who agreed with everything Neymar said. He said that that city is wonderful and it’s an excellent club to work at.</p>

  <p><b>[Gremio midfielder Arthur has revealed he will arrive at Barcelona ahead of the 2018-19 La Liga season]</b> I wanted to go out in a press conference for the love I have for the Gremio fans. I am fulfilling a dream and for this I have to thank them. It is not a goodbye, it is a see you later and I hope to be able to return one day. Barca asked to arrive this summer and it was the clubs that spoke, I did not participate in the negotiations. Barca are the biggest club in the world. It has been my dream since childhood to play for them. People talk me about the club, the city and the fans. I have many expectations with my arrival in Barcelona</p>

  <p><b>[On his style]</b> I’m a player who likes to have the ball at my feet, and organise play. As a defensive midfielder I see more of the ball, further back. But as a playmaker Renato is forcing me to get into the area, reach the goal and try to score, as well as thread the ball through. I am also forcing myself to support the attackers and wingers. I think that is where the difference has come, I am trying to get into the area more to feed those up front.</p>

  <p><b>[Arthur has thanked his new Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi for his praise of the new Brazil midfielder]</b> I’m very happy to receive that praise from Messi, particularly as it’s him, an exceptional guy. There are no words to express how much he means to football. It is a great responsibility to defend Barcelona and Brazil. I have been welcomed by both and the adaptation has gone well with both so far.<br /><br />I am not in direct competition with Fred, we can play together, but it’s a fair and healthy battle anyway. Those of us who are coming in must get used to the process here, there is a lot to learn. We have been called up to fit the system. The players coming into the side now have to observe everything and learn the lessons</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona midfielder Arthur has said he is praying that Neymar will return to the Camp Nou]</b> personally am praying for him to come because he is a superstar, it is indisputable. I think that the more great players the team has, the better.<br /><br />Personally, I’m doing a lot of work to get him back, but he has his life, he knows what he’s doing and I do not know how deep those negotiations are, if there are options for him to come or not. But he is a personal friend and a professional that I admire a lot and would be very happy if he could come back here</p>

We’ve got close, he helped me a lot with Brazil. When I came to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, he called me to do dinner, to do something, to meet up. Online I play video games with him. We speak nearly every day. When he plays on my side, he wins, but when he’s against me, he loses. <b>[<a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is]</b> a guy I admire and, in my opinion and many other people, he’s the best player in history. He gave me a lot of confidence, he helped me in training and in games. If the best player in the world praises you, I think that gives you some extra confidence. I am really grateful for his words and the attitude he has with me and everyone else in the dressing room</p>

  <p><b>[Unnamed <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> executives said]</b> <a href="frenkie-de-jong.html">Frenkie de Jong</a> is a control player, similar to Arthur Melo but much deeper in his actions. De Jong and Arthur will mix very well.<br /><br />It is so easy to negotiate with Dutch players being <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, everyone wants to join the club but especially the Dutch players for the long history between the country and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. De Jong has high quality and technique. He has a dribbling style very similar to <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>’s with the right foot doing the movement to the inside with the external part of the foot. De Jong loves to play with spaces, receiving and turning himself to start the play. He is young and his abilities will strengthen <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s midfield</p>
