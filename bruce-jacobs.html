<blockquote>
  <p><b>[The timing of Hong Kong protests during Golden Week means the Chinese government’s response is particularly significant as plenty of mainland Chinese will visit Hong Kong and see the protests first hand]</b> What I would like and what I fear are different things. I’m afraid the Chinese will use a very hard line response. It could involve a lot of arrests or killings and it would be a disaster for Hong Kong. On the other hand if the Chinese back away and agree with commitments for more open elections, for more franchise <b>[for people in Hong Kong]</b>, then things might be solved more peacefully.<br /><br />For the military forces to be called out would be a bigger step than it was in Beijing but it could happen. It could definitely happen. That’s one of the things that I would personally fear … Hopefully it won’t come to that but it could<br /><br />The Chinese leadership today and Xi Jinping is quite arrogant and it is over confident and it’s over confident of its own strength and directions and this could lead to all sorts of miscalculations, not only domestically but overseas. They lack a free press so they don’t have any feedback, if people oppose a regime they’re often imprisoned. There’s no feedback mechanisms so this further enhances their arrogance</p>
