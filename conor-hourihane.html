  <p><b>[Conor Hourihane has described <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> as a ‘top-class player’, while admitting that the <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> talisman is destined to complete a ‘big move’ away from the club amid strong links with <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> He’s top, top class. In terms of pure ability and sheer skill and technique level he’s easily the best player I’ve played with to date.<br /><br />He’s just got that gift. He runs quicker with the ball, when he faces someone up you’re in real trouble. He’s skipping by the best players in this league so easily. He’s developed over the three years I’ve been here - he’s taken his game to a new level - especially this year in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.<br /><br />He’s taken it by storm really. You know, England team and getting that big move is only a matter of time because, if I’m being brutally honest, he’s too good for our team at Aston Villa</p>

  <p><b>[Conor Hourihane believes that his <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> team-mate <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> deserves to be linked with some of Europe’s top clubs]</b> Jack’s obviously hugely talented, he’s our talisman and he’s had a fantastic season. He’s been linked with so many clubs, lots of top teams around Europe. It’s going to be a tough summer and a tough decision for Jack. Hopefully, first and foremost, he keeps us up - that is the most important thing for the football club. And then, whatever Jack decides to do, that’s up to him. He deserves everything he gets. For me, he should be in the England squad as well because he has something that nobody else does, in my opinion<br /><br />We’ve got an inexperienced squad for this level, but I think when we come back, we’ll have taken the first part of the season and learned from it. We’ll make sure that heading into the last 10 games we’ll use the experience we’ve got, which should help us get over the line, fingers crossed</p>
