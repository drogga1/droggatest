  <p><b>[AIFF seek to re-assimilate Bhaichung Bhutia with new role]</b> We will look to offer a more suitable role to Bhaichung in the coming weeks.</p>

  <p><b>[Vedanta to promote skill building in sports through Sesa Football Academy]</b> It is lovely to be back in Goa. It brings back many memories of my childhood. The SFA has been doing a lot of good work in football by grooming players. It is good to see the revival with good coaches the academy has. I am sure the academy will produce good football talent. The time is apt as the nation now sees a great amount of interest generated around this sport.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Indian player Baichung Bhutia expressed his opinion on a potential ISL-I League merger]</b> We are looking at the perspective of players, to see that lots of players get opportunities. From a player’s point of view, if we have 20 teams after merging, then we are more than happy. But whether that happens or not is a different question.<br /><br />We want to see maximum number of players playing. The opportunity for players, who are playing at the highest level for a longer period of time, is going to be more and that is what we want. A lot of players are getting to play only very few matches. In a team in ISL, not all players get to play matches. So the number of matches for a player is less<br /><br />If ISL merger does not happen, I want 7 months of ISL and I-League so that there are more opportunities for the players. The AIFF spends money on I-League but doesn’t make a lot of money out of it. In India, we need to make sure that players become assets for their clubs</p>

  <p><b>[Bhaichung Bhutia wants India U17 team to be more attacking]</b> Personally, I would like to see them keep the ball more against Colombia. That would allow them to control the game, go into attack mode more and create more opportunities.</p>

  <p><b>[Bhaichung Bhutia wants India to win the midfield battle]</b> India had in the past played against both USA and Colombia but never against Ghana; in fact, not that much against African teams as much as we have played in Europe and Latin America.<br /><br />Ghana are a very physical side and blessed with sublime skills of some individual players. India will have to defend like they have been doing as Ghana are a side which loves to attack right from the kick-off. But it’s important not to get into the defensive shell. In International Football it’s pertinent to strike the right balance, like we did against Colombia<br /><br /><b>[Bhutia hailed the performance of right-back Boris Singh]</b> Boris Singh coming back to the start XI was a big plus for India. He is fearless and as always, initiated a lot of moves in the last match. His understanding with Ninthoi has been superb. It all boils down to the four years spent at the AIFF Academy and Boris had a hand in all of India’s chances in the first-half<br /><br />Personally, even as India have been compact at the back, I would like them to be closing down in the midfield much more. The rival midfielders have managed to maneuver in a bit of space and if you do that, you invite trouble. It gives the game makers the liberty to regulate the game at their will and in today’s modern day football it’s a luxury. I am sure coach de Matos will be thinking on the same lines</p>
