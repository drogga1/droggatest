  <p><b>[Vedanta to promote skill building in sports through Sesa Football Academy]</b> It is lovely to be back in Goa. It brings back many memories of my childhood. The SFA has been doing a lot of good work in football by grooming players. It is good to see the revival with good coaches the academy has. I am sure the academy will produce good football talent. The time is apt as the nation now sees a great amount of interest generated around this sport.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Indian player Baichung Bhutia expressed his opinion on a potential ISL-I League merger]</b> We are looking at the perspective of players, to see that lots of players get opportunities. From a player’s point of view, if we have 20 teams after merging, then we are more than happy. But whether that happens or not is a different question.<br /><br />We want to see maximum number of players playing. The opportunity for players, who are playing at the highest level for a longer period of time, is going to be more and that is what we want. A lot of players are getting to play only very few matches. In a team in ISL, not all players get to play matches. So the number of matches for a player is less<br /><br />If ISL merger does not happen, I want 7 months of ISL and I-League so that there are more opportunities for the players. The AIFF spends money on I-League but doesn’t make a lot of money out of it. In India, we need to make sure that players become assets for their clubs</p>
