Asked about it afterwards, Garcia spoke as if it was the most normal thing in the world]</b> I always say when we are on the pitch we are all the same team. I think if we speak to each other it is better for the team, because you try to help your team-mates and at the end that’s the most important thing. Obviously with the age there’s a lot of difference, but I just feel that I need to do it<br /><br /><b>[Garcia has said of his time training with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>]</b> I think that he helps me a lot every day. Every day is like if you go to school because you learn something different, so it’s good.</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Garcia has no fear of playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> if <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> boss <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> requires him to step up]</b> With these games, it helps to be ready if someday I have the opportunity to play. These type of games are the ones that are really helping me. Having the centre-backs we have like John, Nico and then <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a> can play there, or <a href="rodri.html">Rodri</a> did play there and they play really well so I keep working and wait for my opportunity in these kinds of games to prove I can also play<br /><br /><b>[While many of the club’s academy players have been sent out on loan across England and Europe to increase their game time, <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> believes his young defender will benefit more from being around the Etihad Campus]</b> I learn from all of them because they are all different players. I learn from Otamendi’s experience that he has and also <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a>. <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a> is a young player but we know with the ball he is really good so I try to learn from all of them. At the end, Pep asks the defenders to play from the build-up and we try to do what we can. The staff and the players are helping me a lot. I have more contact with the defenders because at the end we play in the same position and we try to help each other. I haven’t heard anything <b>[about a loan move]</b>. I am fully focused on the training session and playing in these type of games</p>

  <p><b>[When asked if he has ever questioned his decision to head for England]</b> No. You don’t think about how it would be somewhere else. I’m very happy with the opportunities I’ve had<br /><br /><b>[He added on his experiences at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>]</b> I’m in my third season in Manchester already and I’m very happy. At first it was more complicated, but then I adapted after a few months. I’m lucky to have a lot of Spanish team-mates, who make things easier. When I first went, I was hoping to see how things were going. We all know <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is a different league, it’s more physical. I was going to see what happened but I’m very happy with how it’s gone. At the end of last season, they told me I’d start pre-season with the first team, and I did. I’m one of the first-team players. I train with them<br /><br /><b>[Fellow Catalan <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> is the man to have given Garcia his big break]</b> You learn. Every day he teaches you something new. He’s very special. Everyone is at a phenomenal level, but <a href="bernardo-silva.html">Bernardo Silva</a> surprised me the most. I had seen him at <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> but not much, so I was surprised when I first trained with him</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Garcia says <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> will stick to their gameplan in the Carabao Cup semi-final at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> despite being picked off on the counter-attack in last month’s derby]</b> Obviously they are very dangerous on the counter-attack because they have really, really fast players. We need to try to avoid that because at the end it could be the key for the game. I think we need to play like we always play - trying to attack and playing very high. Recently we’ve been playing teams that really like the counter, especially United, so we need to be careful with the balls that we lose in every single area and try to avoid that and be secure at the back<br /><br /><b>[Garcia warn about the threat from <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a>, having come up against the 18-year-old in youth football]</b> He’s a player that doesn’t even need a chance to score. He’s good with his left and right foot so he’s a player to look out for</p>

  <p><b>[The centre-back’s knowledge was further enhanced by his time in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>’s famed La Masia youth academy before his switch to City, where he quickly moved up to the first team to learn from the man himself]</b> The players I most remember watching growing up are (Carles) <a href="carles-puyol.html">Puyol</a>, (Gerard) <a href="gerard-pique.html">Pique</a> and (Javier) <a href="javier-mascherano.html">Mascherano</a> when Pep was there. I was playing for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> and when I was only 10 or 12, they were the three defenders I learned most from watching<br /><br /><b>[However, he is also mature and grounded away from the pitch, which is why <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> were so upset when he left in the summer of 2017. Garcia admits it was tough leaving the Spanish giants but he has no regrets about his decision]</b> When I was at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> I had the offer to come here - to start with the Under-18s and then they had a mini-plan for my future. At the end, I could train with the first team if everything was going right. It was a difficult decision for me to come here because I left my family, my friends, it’s a different country, a different language. But it’s going really well. I was lucky because I was in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> we played the same way. So, for me, it wasn’t like a big, big difference. Obviously, when <b>[Pep]</b> demands different things, it’s more or less the same.<br /><br /><b>[Garcia, though, admits that when he first moved up to join the first team, he was not sure he was ready for the challenge]</b> Well, the first day, no. It was different because watching them on TV and then being lucky to train with them, it was like a shock for me the first time seeing Kevin (De Bruyne) or Sergio (Aguero) or David (Silva). Players that you have been watching for many years on the TV, winning trophies - and then training with them, I was so lucky. Every day is like a game now because they are friends and probably the best strikers in the world. So, for me, it is something that is incredible, because I’m still young and to train with them is incredible.<br /><br />I just need to keep training hard to show the manager that anytime he needs me, I’m ready for it. Keep learning from them because they are the best players I could probably train with</p>
