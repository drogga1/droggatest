They waved back, a slight provocation. But the Ajax fans reacted ferociously, they broke through security with some 50 men to get to the Feyenoord section. There were a lot of women and senior citizens. It was a totally unsafe situation. I fear that in the future the Mini Derbies will not be played with fans</p>
