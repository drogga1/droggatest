Ajax on brink of Eredivisie title after commanding victory over Utrecht</p>

  <p><b>[Saturday’s Under-19 clash between Ajax and Feyenoord was abandoned before half-time after the game was marred by clashes amongst supporters in the stands]</b> The players and staff of both teams went back to the dressing room during the temporary halt. There, Feyenoord determined that the safety of players, family members and other Feyenoord guests could not be assured. It was then decided to stop the game completely. All those present for Feyenoord were able to leave the stadium safely and unharmed.</p>

They waved back, a slight provocation. But the Ajax fans reacted ferociously, they broke through security with some 50 men to get to the Feyenoord section. There were a lot of women and senior citizens. It was a totally unsafe situation. I fear that in the future the Mini Derbies will not be played with fans</p>
