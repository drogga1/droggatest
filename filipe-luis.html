  <p><b>[Filipe Luis on Neymar]</b> <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> and I have a similarity: we are very competitive. He does not like to lose, neither do I. In training, because he is so light and dribbling so fast, people are sometimes afraid to get a little stronger with him. I am not! We have several jokes. I am like this in my day to day, at all times, everywhere. And he also really likes to compete. This similarity strengthened our friendship, especially in the World Cup, when the guy opened his heart because he knows that everyone is after the same goal, we trust 100 per cent in our teammates and we try to get to know the guy on the side better. He’s a sensational guy</p>

  <p><b>[Filipe Luis confirmed he is joining Brazilian side Flamengo after the full-back bid farewell to Atletico Madrid on Sunday]</b> I have been a Flamenguista since I was young. Leaving Atletico is not an easy decision to make, but I want to end my career in Brazil<br /><br /><b>[Filipe Luis has played 333 matches and won seven trophies with the Rojiblancos]</b> I’m privileged to have been a part of the best era of this club. I want to thank everyone. We enjoyed great moments. Today is a happy day, because I’ve given my all for this club. Playing at the Vicente Calderon and enjoying the Wanda Metropolitano’s first years has been unique. I will be back in the future, this is just a farewell as a player</p>

  <p><b>[Filipe Luis said he hopes Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar returns to La Liga champions Barcelona for the good of Brazilian football]</b> I want him to finish in Barcelona. At Barca, Neymar is happy. I want him to enjoy and play next to <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi. I hope, for the good of Brazilian football, that Neymar returns to Barca, but I think it will not be easy<br /><br /><b>[Atletico Madrid have also been linked with Real Madrid and Colombia playmaker James Rodriguez, who is wanted by Serie A side Napoli]</b> Having a player like James at Atletico would be very interesting, it would not be bad. Whoever comes will help but signing James would be spectacular</p>

  <p><b>[Filipe Luis has completed his move to Flamengo after leaving Atletico Madrid at the end of his contract]</b> Feeling that goes from father to son, from grandfather to grandchild. The heart beats. The big day has come, the day to fulfill my childhood dream. The day I can say I’m a player of my Mengao.</p>

  <p><b>[Filipe Luis claims he had the chance to join <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> or <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> this year before opting to return home to Brazil with Flamengo]</b> From January until March I had an offer from <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, but it didn’t work out. There was a call from Juninho Pernambucano to go to <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>, but I said I could only give an answer after the Copa America and they ended up signing someone else. There was Turkey, China, a number of countries that called, but none of them felt right in my heart at the time<br /><br /><b>[Luis, 34, says he was at one point close to joining <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, and that he seriously considered another offer from <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> title contenders Dortmund]</b> I had a contract with Atletico Madrid and an absurd offer came in <b>[from PSG]</b>, one that I couldn’t refuse. I went to Atletico Madrid and said ‘if you let me leave, I’d appreciate it’, especially because Gabi had just left. But they said no, it was impossible for me to leave because they would have to sign another left-back and there wasn’t enough time for that. I didn’t want to fight with Atletico, though, and in the end it didn’t go ahead, but the offer was there and I was close. In the end I had three or four proposals to consider, and then you have to choose. But I see that one club calls me, then the director of another one … it’s a long list. There’s this club but it can’t afford my wages, then another one but it doesn’t want to be champion, so bye! So, a lot of things were happening and in the end I closed some important doors, like Borussia. It was a very good offer, but I didn’t feel it in my heart. Even though I had the same thing with the fans (a good relationship with Flamengo’s), I didn’t feel that passion to say, ‘I want to go to Borussia’.</p>

  <p><b>[Fellow Brazilian Filipe Luis says <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> clearly wanted to return to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> over the summer. Quizzed on whether he feels a move was being pushed for]</b> I don’t know. I want to believe he did, because if he didn’t then his name wouldn’t have been heard every day for two months. But leaving <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> isn’t easy because they don’t usually sell. I see him as being calm since saying he’d stay. He can develop at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. They also have <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a>, <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Mauro Icardi</a> and <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Edinson Cavani</a>.

He’d been there for a few years and wanted something new. He gave a lot to Atleti and returned everything the club invested in him. Being at the same place for a long time can lead to comfort that no longer motivates, so we all understood him and remember him fondly<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he could have spent another 12 months with Diego Simeone’s side]</b> I could have, but we spoke and everyone decided it was time to separate. The team are well covered in that position as well. I value the way they treated me until the last minute. I plan to return, I haven’t even rented my house in Madrid because one day I want to go back and help coach the kids or anything at the club</p>
