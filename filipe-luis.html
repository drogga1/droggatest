  <p><b>[Filipe Luis content with life as Marcelo’s Brazil understudy]</b> Almost every time that Marcelo could not play I have been chosen. I know it is not easy to keep that going. It is getting harder and harder to receive the call, there is a lot of competition in that position. It makes me, Marcelo and whoever wants to be here work even harder for our clubs and for Brazil. Being in Tite’s plans makes me very proud. I have to always be attentive and at the top of my game.<br /><br />Every player is selfish and wants to play. But Tite has managed to ensure that a lot of players come here without knowing if they will play and they are happy to help the team. To get the chance to play for Brazil is always special. It doesn’t matter what game, it is just as important. You know it could be your last game or the first of many. I’m here with the same philosophy I always have: to give my best, to not try and be more than who I am nor less. Playing always for the team, so things work out naturally. This moment is a great one and it is always difficult to come in for such a good team-mate. But it is the ideal time to play</p>

Few things in life will outweigh the pain of Lisbon. There were many sleepless weeks.

  <p><b>[Diego Costa is the best in the eyes of Filipe Luis]</b> <b>[Costa]</b> is the best I have played with. I have seen <b>[Juan Carlos]</b> Valeron do things nobody could do. Neymar and <b>[Eden]</b> Hazard are amazing talents, but the player who gave me most trophies was Diego Costa. He always scores the opening goal. Because it is one thing to score 30 goals with hat-tricks in easy wins, and another that 20 of those 30 goals are enough to win 1-0. Nobody does that as well as Diego Costa.<br /><br /><b>[On Antoine Griezmann]</b> <b>[Griezmann]</b> is a kid who speaks very clearly. Often players talk when they feel they are not being valued as they deserve. Then they get more attention. He would have had many offers from many teams. A player of his size wants to be up with the biggest in terms of contract and value. And that is fair - as Griezmann is doing great here.<br /><br />In the end, for all the talk about other clubs, he always wanted to stay here and he is still here, happy and liking it. For sure, he can stay much longer. We hope the fans understand this and everything gets back to normal, although he has been scoring goals, and goals cure everything</p>

  <p><b>[How do you stop Lionel Messi? Filipe Luis happy to fill ‘butcher’ role at Atletico]</b> I’m always in the ‘butcher’ role. But the only way to stop Messi one-on-one is to foul him. Otherwise, if I’m alone, I’ll only get the ball one in 20 times. I have to use other weapons.<br /><br />I know the best way to stop him. I know he does not like playing with his back to goal, you must be right on top of him when he gets the ball. If he feels comfortable, you’re dead. I feel I do pretty well against him when we play, although he always scores against us. And even with me being the bad guy when we meet, he never reproaches me, always shakes my hand after the game.<br /><br />Messi is so good that he can win La Liga even with a mediocre team, which is not the case. Barca remain up top every year because of him. Because Barca have this way of easily creating internal debates, it seems they like it. But Messi is so good, so good that he holds up what is around him.</p>

At Atletico he has a whole team playing for him and he is very happy. He is happy with the club and with the city, so I do see him here for many years<br /><br />I think that neither Diego nor I regret having left, but I always wanted to return, I’ve been here in the best years of Atletico’s history and you experience moments that are unthinkable in other teams… 2012 to 2014 was unique. I had the opportunity to return and I took advantage of it, to try to make my life here, my career in the club I love. Antoine can think like us and write his name in the history of the club.</p>

I spoke to Atletico and asked them to let me go, just as they had released Gabi <b>[who moved to Al Sadd]</b> recently. The club said that it wasn’t the same situation, despite similar periods of time remaining on our contracts. In my situation there was little time before the window closed and finding a replacement would have been difficult. When they said they did not want me to leave and they set a price that was not going to be paid, I accepted. They said that I tried to force a move, but it’s a lie. I’ve got history with Atletico and it made me sad. They tried to make my image worse at the club.<br /><br />I’m in my eighth season with Atletico and I’ve played more than 300 games. I will not tarnish my legacy</p>

In training, because he is so light and dribbling so fast, people are sometimes afraid to get a little stronger with him. I am not! We have several jokes. I am like this in my day to day, at all times, everywhere. And he also really likes to compete. This similarity strengthened our friendship, especially in the World Cup, when the guy opened his heart because he knows that everyone is after the same goal, we trust 100 per cent in our teammates and we try to get to know the guy on the side better. He’s a sensational guy</p>

In the end I had three or four proposals to consider, and then you have to choose. But I see that one club calls me, then the director of another one … it’s a long list. There’s this club but it can’t afford my wages, then another one but it doesn’t want to be champion, so bye! So, a lot of things were happening and in the end I closed some important doors, like Borussia. It was a very good offer, but I didn’t feel it in my heart.
