<blockquote>
  <p>[Sydney FC and their coach Graham Arnold were at rock bottom at the end of the 2015-16 A-League regular season] I saw his energy everywhere and I saw the things that were coming out of his mouth and I thought this is not the guy I met [in 2015]. One day in August 2016 I was at home and something just said to me ‘ring Graham Arnold’. I rang Graham on a blocked number and he answered. After we chatted for a while, Graham said to me, ‘Bradley, I never pick up blocked numbers and I don’t know why I picked up today and here you are and we’re having this chat’.<br /><br />[Stubbs says he knows why coaches struggle] I put in place with Graham one of my programs with the goal of going undefeated for the season. To me, that’s not a big deal – and there is plenty of coaches that believe but how much belief do they actually have? If you look at coaches in their interviews, when they lose, they make all these excuses. The only reason a coach doesn’t win is because the problem is in the mirror and they need to be aware of that. The problem is with them - nowhere and no one else<br /><br />Bradley’s big strength with me was making me believe in myself and being someone that I can talk to about issues when you don’t usually someone to discuss those things with. He drummed into me ‘the words you speak are the words you get, the thoughts you think are the thoughts you get’. He corrected my words – got me to get rid of the words ‘hope’ and ‘want’. In the past I would say to my players ‘I hope we win this weekend’. I’m a big communicator. Every player I’ve coached would probably say one of my strengths is man management. The only way you can man manage is by communicating. Other coaches don’t talk to players or don’t really communicate that much. But I’m the opposite. And when you communicate as much as I do, the messages and the words I speak are important to the players because what goes into their subconscious mind they then believe<br /><br />Graham rings me 4-6 times a week and when he talks to me I ask him what kind of language he is using with the players. I tell him, ‘don’t say that, say this. That word you just said there has no energy in it. Every coach I have worked with, we use the media to put out the ‘mental warfare’ to bring out the doubts in the subconscious minds of opposition coaches and players</p>
