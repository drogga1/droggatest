  <p><b>[Septemes-les-Vallons president, <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> <a href="samir-nasri.html">Nasri</a> on Isaac Lihadji]</b> He had no club, no team. At that time, he was nothing out of the ordinary, he played just the same as the others. Then, thanks to our training, he progressed and revealed himself over time. He stood out quite quickly but at the start he did not have it all. It was later that he exploded<br /><br />He dreamed of going to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, he cried. We had to make him understand that it was only a matter of time and that if it were to happen, it would happen. His objective is clear - Isaac wants to play in one of the five big European clubs</p>
