  <p><b>[Jason Kreis says Orlando City close on center back addition]</b> There’s two ways to address that: be tactically a little better, can we all be on the same page a little bit more on how and when we defend. And the second piece is do we need to get better players; stronger and defensive minded players.<br /><br />We think the answer is somewhere in between. Everybody knows we added two left backs, we’re in the process of trying to address a center back, we think that’s very close to being done. And we feel with those additions as well with more time with the group, we plan to be on a much better defensive situation heading into 2017<br /><br /><b>[Rumors have linked Orlando to Bordeaux defender Gregory Sertic since December]</b> I would tell you that those sorts of rumors were not started by the club, and we won’t comment on those types of rumors</p>

  <p><b>[Orlando City provides Jason Kreis a chance at redemption]</b> Somebody told me the other day, this is my 10th season. That’s a few more than I thought I had. I took over the coaching job at RSL when I was 34 so I’ve been going at this quite a bit of time.<br /><br />I really don’t. I don’t <b>[have something to prove]</b>. Am I hungry and do I want to win every single match I’m a part of … and coach one of the best teams in the league? I absolutely do. But I don’t think that way. For me, what happened in New York was an anomaly. I think that we were doing a job that was incomplete, so I don’t view that in particular as a big failure. I view it as a job that was left half done, because as I said from the very beginning, it takes time. So i just continue forward and don’t look at it that way<br /><br />It’s a job that takes a little more patience than most people understand and appreciate. And it’s very difficult for me because I’m naturally a very impatient person. So you’ve got to continue to work and work and work and believe in what you’re doing in order to get to the objective that you want<br /><br />So far in Orlando City we have a terrific fan base, one of the best in the league. We have a terrific sponsorship sales group, one of the best in the league. We have an unbelievable ticket sales group, one of the best in the league. What we don’t have yet is a team that’s one of the best in the league and I think it is now upon us as staff members and players to raise our level to the level that the rest of the club and the fans have given so far</p>

I think everyone could see the energy he was already putting into the game in those 11 minutes. I thought this was going to be a special night for him.

  <p><b>[Orlando City’s defense makeover]</b> So many positive statements to make about effort level, intensity level, commitment of the players to defend, real, real signs of togetherness and a fortitude that says we aren’t going to be broken at home. I’m really, really pleased with that. The negative is we’ve got to continue to be better with the ball. We cannot force ourselves to defend for such long stretches in matches like these, against opponents like these, because at some moments you’re going to break and you will have lost all of the momentum that we should gain.<br /><br />I would say <b>[Spector is]</b> critical, absolutely critical. We’ve played four matches now and I think he’s been outstanding in all four. He’s a very consistent performer who is leading the back line and is exactly what we went into the offseason looking for</p>

  <p><b>[Orlando City’s Jason Kreis returned to Yankee Stadium an improved coach with an improving team]</b> I have to tell you, that the year I was here was such a whirlwind. I just never really felt like my feet were under me. Even my memories about this stadium are just very fleeting. I just didn’t feel settled, and so coming back here there just wasn’t a whole lot <b>[of emotion]</b>. Nothing like it was the first time I went back to <b>[Rio Tinto Stadium]</b>. That’s a whole different ballgame. I think some of that is part only being here for one year, and some if it is a part of trying to do so many things to get a hold of it that year<br /><br />That was our objective. I don’t think it’s any secret that New York loves to build out of the back. They take a certain amount of pride in that, and they’re resolute about doing it all the time. So for us, the objective was to see if we could press them in their half and nick a goal, but also just to disrupt their rhythm<br /><br />I think that you won’t find a coach more familiar with this field than me. There’s something about the dimensions and the size of it that we try to play to our strengths. I’m very, very familiar with how Patrick wants to play after watching him for four or five months coaching his team there. We did go into the game with a very clear gameplan<br /><br />The first and easiest thing to talk about is the <b>[new]</b> personnel. We have three out of the four <b>[starting defenders]</b> are new to the team. Then you add a guy like Will Johnson, with his defensive mindset and willingness to really just do whatever it takes to help the team defend. So from a personal standpoint we’ve improved.<br /><br />I also think that, from an understanding standpoint, we’ve improved. We had a preseason to really go over it with the guys, step by step by step. This is how we want to defend, this is why we want to defend, this is where we want to defend. Then the third part is it’s a collective buy-in by all of the players to recognize, ‘I’ve got to help this team to defend<br /><br />I think each game that we play against New York City, the emotions for me are less and less. The attachment is less and less, to the point where this week I didn’t really have any extra motivation. For me, it’s about trying to get our team to have a solid road performance. It’s only our second road game, to show that we are a team that can win away. A lot of the hype or the word around town is that we only had four wins because they’re all at home. Nobody can say that anymore<br /><br />At the end of the day, I’m extremely thankful for the experience that I had here, for the people that I worked with, and for what I learned on an individual basis. I was able apply everything I thought I did wrong and apply it to <b>[Orlando]</b>, and I think we’ve seen improvements because of that</p>

  <p><b>[On Cyle Larin]</b> I was surprised when I got here to learn what Cyle’s body <b>[composition]</b> was, what Cyle’s weight was, to see what his fitness level was. From my point of view, none of that was good enough, and to see the success he was having in spite of that was pretty amazing. Even more so than his body composition, and his professionalism, and what he’s putting into his body, is his willingness to do more than just try to score goals. What he does when we don’t have the ball, what kind of runs he makes for the team to relieve pressure and open up spaces - those are the things I think that we’re seeing some real improvement on..</p>

  <p><b>[The Lions had a game-plan in place, but it didn’t account for the presence of Latif Blessing, who wound up scoring both Sporting KC’s goals in Saturday’s 2-2 draw in Orlando]</b> No, we didn’t expect <b>[Blessing]</b> up there. We actually thought Soony Saad would play in that role tonight so that took us by a little bit of surprise. There’s not a whole lot of scouting material available on him, but as you saw, quick guy. Another guy that was ‘Johnny on the spot,’ at the right place at the right time.<br /><br />I felt all three of their strikers - if you like to call them that - their front three I thought were all extremely dangerous. They’re talented individual players and some of the combinations they were creating in and around our penalty box was real good</p>

  <p><b>[European interest in Canadian striker Cyle Larin continues to grow]</b> From my point of view it’s a real balancing act. We don’t want to be a club that’s going to hold players back from opportunities, but we’re also a club that is trying to identify ourselves - trying to become a winning club, trying to show our fans that this matters to us, and we’re not just here selling tickets and are out here to have fun. We’re here to build something special, we’re here to succeed and part of that is keeping your good players.<br /><br />From our point of view, I think that we have a player that has several more years left on his contract, who’s doing well, that other clubs want, but so what? We want him too. For us, it’s a situation where if everything were to fall in to place, and Cyle was to want to go, and we were to get the money we wanted, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, then it wouldn’t be something that we’re going to say absolutely no to. But I think that we are going to take a real dim view of doing anything too quickly</p>

  <p><b>[On Kaka]</b> It’s worth reiterating that he worked incredibly hard in the offseason, and came in incredibly lean and trim and I thought had a fantastic preseason. The work he put in in the preseason was second to none. He was leading everything we were doing by example. And I thought really we were going to see the absolute best of Ricky that we’ve seen in the league this year, but then to get that injury in the first game kind of put a sour note on things. But again, he’s worked really hard to get himself healthy, and has looked like he’s building into the things.<br /><br />He’s an incredibly important player for us. Of course he’s an extremely talented player that can make goals, and score goals, and really dictate the tempo of our play, but more so just because he’s such a leader for our club, and a person for everybody to look to<br /><br />He’s been absolutely incredible to work with as a coach. From my point of view, he’s the type of player that every coach dreams of because he’s super talented but real willing to listen to what the coaches want, and to try and to implement it and get the players around him to do it, and intelligent enough to understand it<br /><br /><b>[On Kaka’s work ethic]</b> I think it’s amazing, absolutely amazing. With a player like that, who’s won everything, including World Player of the Year, you have to think, ‘Gosh, is he really going to be motivated by playing Kansas City this weekend at home?’ But he is, and I think he takes a more global view of it in that he kind of wears this club on his sleeve. He takes a real pride in the fact that he was the first player here, and real pride in being part of this community. Because of that, I’m pretty sure he’s extremely motivated to help get this team in the playoffs and lead this team to the playoffs</p>

  <p><b>[Orlando City head coach Jason Kreis has taken a stern but supportive stance in regards to striker Cyle Larin’s Thursday morning arrest for driving under the influence]</b> Cyle is obviously distraught, very, very disappointed in himself and his decision, but is wanting to move forward as quickly as possible. We disagree with <b>[his decision]</b> vehemently. It goes against what we’ve tried to establish here in this club and how we want to comport ourselves publicly.<br /><br />On a private side of things, though, we also believe very strongly that we are a family, and families come together when mistakes happen. So, we need to be strict in our view of it and tell Cyle and the rest of the group that these decisions are poor and they affect everyone. But then we need to move on from that and say we’re family, and family members forgive</p>

  <p><b>[Kreis said of Dom Dwyer, Cyle Larin and Giles Barnes]</b> I wanted to see those three players play together. I just really wanted to see if we could go with what I felt was a little fresher legs and a little more athleticism in this game. They’re all very active guys, dangerous when they’re picking up the ball and feeding off of each other.<br /><br />The whole week we were trying to make a decision. That’s the way we’re going to operate now going forward, that we won’t make decisions on lineups until we feel like we have to. The week in training we competed, we laid it out there for the guys and we went with the guys who earned it through the week</p>

  <p><b>[Jason Kreis shaping revamped Orlando City for the post-Kaka era]</b> We took a very conscious decision last offseason to not change things radically. We took the decision at the time because we felt we were very close to being good enough to be a playoff team, to be a contender for MLS Cup. But what we found was we were wrong<br /><br />We felt like we needed to take a more radical direction. That was to essentially completely overhaul the team, and we’ve worked extremely hard in the offseason to find new players, to work deals, to trade for some very top-level players and ultimately find people that are like us - that are extremely competitive, that are extremely willing and able to do anything necessary to improve this team and to improve our fortunes<br /><br />The message that is being delivered and needs to be delivered is that we’re going to build faces of our franchise based on success. Let’s win as a team first, and then by winning we’ll establish players’ names that fans and people outside of our club would like to talk about. We are all laser focused on improving and getting results, and letting the chips fall where they may, so to speak, about who the fans deem are the stars<br /><br /> you asked me last year, I would have said, ‘This is my team. This is a team that I believe in because they are the ones putting it out there for us, the coaching staff, every single day and every single match’. But truth be told, there may have been a collection of players that it didn’t seem like we could do anything with from a contractual standpoint. You’re making the best out of the tools you’ve been given. This season, after the process we have gone through, now I could say 100 percent that all of the players that are here and will be a part of the club in 2018 are guys that are our guys. This is now our team, without a shadow of a doubt</p>

  <p><b>[Orlando City already under pressure]</b> Unfortunately, for me I think that’s three matches where I just feel like we’re giving things away. The first match we give away a goal defending a throw-in in our own end, and then we end up with an ejection that was a poor decision. In the second game, it was the same thing with giving away a cheap goal, and then this game we smashed the ball at our goalkeeper to gave away the first goal. If we correct those small errors, I think we will be OK. In this league you can’t beat yourself, especially on the road. It’s difficult. We had a good, solid game plan. We had opportunities, we got in good spots going forward the other way and weren’t able to create or take a goal. Then to give away the two goals in the manner that we did is frustrating<br /><br />We’ve now got an international break to digest these first three games and go for it, but the pressure is on. Every game’s important now. We’ve spotted the rest of the conference eight points, so there’s no more margin for error until we start to get some wins on the board. We’ve dug ourselves a nice hole to start the season</p>

Still, I think Philadelphia created quite a few chances, but they’re a good team that’s quite capable of creating those chances. We just couldn’t be happier with the complete performance.</p>
