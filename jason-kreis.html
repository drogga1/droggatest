  <p><b>[Orlando City already under pressure]</b> Unfortunately, for me I think that’s three matches where I just feel like we’re giving things away,” Kreis said. “The first match we give away a goal defending a throw-in in our own end, and then we end up with an ejection that was a poor decision. In the second game, it was the same thing with giving away a cheap goal, and then this game we smashed the ball at our goalkeeper to gave away the first goal. If we correct those small errors, I think we will be OK. In this league you can’t beat yourself, especially on the road,” Orlando midfielder Will Johnson added. “It’s difficult. We had a good, solid game plan. We had opportunities, we got in good spots going forward the other way and weren’t able to create or take a goal. Then to give away the two goals in the manner that we did is frustrating<br /><br />We’ve now got an international break to digest these first three games and go for it, but the pressure is on,” he said. “Every game’s important now. We’ve spotted the rest of the conference eight points, so there’s no more margin for error until we start to get some wins on the board. We’ve dug ourselves a nice hole to start the season</p>

  <p><b>[Orlando City coming together behind new goal-scoring tandem]</b> Tonight, I think we saw for the first time a collective mindset that we weren’t going to give anything away defensively. I think that led to us being very balanced, very well organized, and shut them down pretty well. Still, I think Philadelphia created quite a few chances, but they’re a good team that’s quite capable of creating those chances. We just couldn’t be happier with the complete performance.</p>

  <p><b>[Jason Kreis is looking for work again after Orlando City parted ways with its manager on Friday]</b> This is a very difficult decision to take, but sometimes in sports we must make tough decisions with the best future of the organization in mind. I have enormous respect for Jason and the work his team did in Orlando. He arrived in a difficult moment and is leaving with a legacy of respect and professionalism. Now is the time to look forward, keep our heads high and continue pushing toward the many goals we set this season.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Real Salt Lake, New York City FC and Orlando City head coach Jason Kreis has been named the new U.S. Under-23 national team coach]</b> It’s a tremendous opportunity. It’s an opportunity to be a part of a new system under the leadership of Gregg Berhalter and Earnie Stewart leading the national team the way that they are. I’m a big fan of both of them. It’s an opportunity to work with the country’s brightest young stars. We have some fantastic young players. And it’s an opportunity to represent your country. In my opinion, that’s the highest honor of all<br /><br />There’s no doubt about it, this group of players was a major factor in my thinking about this position. The group is going to be very talented. I think it should be arguably the best U-23 group that this country’s ever seen. That’s a huge credit to all the work that everyone in the soccer community has done in this country over the last 10-20 years</p>

  <p><b>[The U.S. hasn’t seen more players earn their first international cap in the same game since September 1992]</b> It’s a very, very good day for U.S. Soccer. And I think a small snapshot of what the future can look like</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="reggie-cannon.html">Cannon</a>, Llanez and <a href="richie-ledezma.html">Ledezma</a> headline U.S. squad for Olympic qualifiers]</b> With a lot of games in a short amount of time, we will need the contributions of all 20 players on this roster to achieve our ultimate goal of qualifying for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. This is our sixth time together with this U-23 group, so I think we have a real firm understanding of how we want to play and who we want to be</p>
