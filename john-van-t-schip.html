<blockquote>
  <p>[John van’t Schip, who handed the youngster his senior debut for PEC Zwolle, feels it is far too early to be likening a player with much to prove to the finest centre-half on the planet] It’s stupid of course. You just have to let him develop in his own way. He doesn’t have the physical [body] of <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> and he’s got a totally different pathway. Virgil started with some lower teams and could develop himself with Groningen and Celtic. Seppi has only played 20 games in the Eredivisie and is now going to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. That’s a totally different build up. I think the thing with him is people must understand he’s not a first team player yet. They have to get him there and he’ll have to work. If Sepp was playing at Ajax he would not be in the first team, he would be in the second team or maybe have some time playing in the cups.</p>
