  <p><b>[Mark Bright on Zaha]</b> I’ve seen a lot of <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a> and I think he could be like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. He has the ability to do everything. He’s quick, strong and determined. He’s <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>’s last signing, a great gift to David Moyes</p>

  <p><b>[Cyrille Regis is dead]</b> Heavy heart this morning, just heard that Cyrille Regis has passed away age 59. He was more than just a footballer, he blazed a trail for every black player who followed him, an inspiration to myself and many players of my era. A humble man and a great man.#RIPC</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Bright has explained that in January 2018, <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Aaron Wan-Bissaka</a> was so frustrated with his lack of opportunities at Selhurst Park that he tried to force a move away]</b> Amazingly on transfer deadline day he asked me if he could go out on loan. I asked the manager and he refused, but as I was telling him the manager came down and told him ‘if you stay here you will be training with Yohan Cabaye, <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilf Zaha</a> and Andros Townsend’. ‘You might even get a chance here’, that was the last thing he said to him. Five days later he made his first-team debut. I would have sent him out on loan as there were two clubs who wanted him and we would have never known. He, without knowing it, gives all those below and in his age group hope that at this football club, if you work hard enough and develop, you will get in the team</p>
