  <p>[Red Bulls flex player development muscles] It just reinforces everything that we’ve been putting together for the past three plus years. It’s just nice to see these guys get an opportunity and play the way we want to play. For the organization, that’s the fun part. They have certain qualities and talents that fit the way we play. it’s just one game, but it’s definitely nice to see that.<br /><br />For us, that’s the future of the success of this club. Even with the [targeted allocation money] initiatives, you have to be certain, and sometimes those are harder. We’ve brought guys in who didn’t work out. When we have guys we know and we’ve had them for years, and they understand our system, it makes it easier for us to give them the opportunity</p>

  <p>[The New York Red Bulls have hired assistant coach Chris Armas as the team’s new head coach following the departure of Jesse Marsch] We are fully supportive of Jesse and his decision to pursue a new opportunity. Jesse played a large role in establishing our club identity, but the culture here is the result of the dedication and hard work of many. We are confident in Chris Armas. We know Chris and the coaching staff will have our team ready to compete each week, and they will continue to find ways to improve and work towards our ultimate goal of winning MLS Cup</p>
