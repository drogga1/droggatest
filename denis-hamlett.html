  <p>[The New York Red Bulls have traded Sacha Kljestan to Orlando City in exchange for Carlos Rivas and Tommy Redding] It’s never easy to trade a player, especially one that has been as impactful as Sacha. That said, this move is in the best interest of our club now and for the future. We are adding two young, exciting players that have MLS experience.</p>

  <p>[The New York Red Bulls have signed Argentine playmaker Kaku from Club Atletico Huracan] When we identified Kaku, he quickly became our top offseason target. He fits the profile of the player we are looking for: highly skilled, creative and hard-working. During our discussions, we realized that we are adding a good player and great young man to our team. We look forward to seeing him continue to grow as part of the New York Red Bulls.</p>

  <p>[Red Bulls flex player development muscles] It just reinforces everything that we’ve been putting together for the past three plus years. It’s just nice to see these guys get an opportunity and play the way we want to play. For the organization, that’s the fun part. They have certain qualities and talents that fit the way we play. it’s just one game, but it’s definitely nice to see that.<br /><br />For us, that’s the future of the success of this club. Even with the [targeted allocation money] initiatives, you have to be certain, and sometimes those are harder. We’ve brought guys in who didn’t work out. When we have guys we know and we’ve had them for years, and they understand our system, it makes it easier for us to give them the opportunity</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The New York Red Bulls have hired assistant coach Chris Armas as the team’s new head coach following the departure of Jesse Marsch] We are fully supportive of Jesse and his decision to pursue a new opportunity. Jesse played a large role in establishing our club identity, but the culture here is the result of the dedication and hard work of many. We are confident in Chris Armas. We know Chris and the coaching staff will have our team ready to compete each week, and they will continue to find ways to improve and work towards our ultimate goal of winning MLS Cup</p>
