  <p>[Who is Josef Martinez? The Venezuelan striker who broke the MLS scoring record] [Martinez] plays angry and I liken it to Clint Dempsey when he’s on the field. He has no fear, goes out there with an attitude, like it’s him against the world, and will do whatever it takes to score goals. He doesn’t care if he’s going to get a broken nose, or if someone’s going to kick him in the face. He just does what it takes to put the ball in the goal.<br /><br />He’s got a little bit of Taylor Twellman, with the attitude of [Dempsey]. Taylor just because Taylor was so explosive as well, and so good in the box. Just a goal scorer in and around the box, knowing where to be, and good in the air, but obviously more dynamic than Taylor used to be. He understands where to be. He has that striker’s instinct. He has scored what you would deem as maybe some fortunate goals were you think he’s just in the right place at the right time. But when that happens over and over, it’s not a coincidence</p>

  <p>[Painful lesson from 2017 playoffs leads to more adaptable Atlanta United] I think we learned from last year. You have to adapt a little bit. There’s no points for playing pretty. You don’t want to be too stubborn. You have to take what the game gives you. Of course we’d like to play a little bit more than we did, but nobody in this locker room is going to complain. We’re happy with the result. We’re happy with the performance. We understand that on our field, a bigger field, we want to play more, but we’re happy we did what we did (on Sunday).<br /><br />Our field is just so much bigger. It’ll allow us and them to play a little bit more. They’re going to have to attack a little bit, I’m sure they’re not going to want to open up too much from the beginning. You saw tonight, we should have gotten a second goal, but that plays into our favor, especially if things are more open in the second leg</p>

  <p>[Attack-heavy Atlanta United rides defense to MLS Cup final] I think we’ve had some big performances throughout the year where we had to sit on leads and grind wins out. I think that’s one thing this team has learned to do better this year, just grind games out. If you’re not having a day offensively for one reason or another you have to be able to take pride in defending and winning battles and this year we’ve been able to do that.</p>

  <p>[Poised Michael Parkhurst has elusive MLS Cup title within reach] You never know when the next chance will come, so at that time it was tough to take. That’s one message I have for this group now, to make the most of this opportunity because there is no guarantee there will be another.<br /><br />They brought in trialist after trialist. Four, five, six guys because they knew they needed a starting center back. I just kept training, kept working on it. They’d give me chances in between the trialists and seeing guys, and nobody worked out for them. I don’t know how confident they were going into the year with a 160-pound center back starting in a back three, but I had a good team around me<br /><br />I didn’t watch a ton of soccer growing up because there wasn’t a ton on TV. I watched [Paolo] Maldini whenever I could watch Maldini, [Fabio] Cannavaro, but really it was just using my strengths. I physically can’t outdo strikers, so you learn how to adapt along the away</p>

  <p>[From draft classmates to teammates: Guzan, Parkhurst and Larentowicz seek MLS Cup together] I went later than I thought I would. I thought maybe I’d go to LA. They had a few picks. A couple of defenders went before me and I thought, ‘Man’, and I just kept dropping. It was meant to be that I went to New England at number nine, and I’m glad I did. Center back has a standard physique and I don’t match that. I’m sure it scared off some teams, and I’m glad Stevie (Nicol) took a chance on me.</p>

  <p>[Michael Parkhurst captains Atlanta United to title, ending MLS Cup drought] It was everything I dreamed about and more. I can’t wait to relive it, see the pictures and party with these guys tonight. It was special.<br /><br />I told them to control the emotions, go out there and play your best game under the biggest lights. Step up like we have all season and go win a trophy for the city<br /><br />Each one I think you take a little harder than the rest. That one was tough because we were at home, it was an opportunity lost. It was crushing. You never know if you’re going to get a next one, but everything happens for a reason. I thought I’d play my career in Columbus, but I got shipped to Atlanta, thankfully. Getting another opportunity to close the deal was special, and tonight was everything I ever imagined winning MLS Cup would be</p>

  <p>[On Concacaf Champions League] I can see why MLS teams have had difficulty in this tournament, and that’s without even having kicked a ball yet. It’s a quick turnaround from MLS Cup. It’s a balance between getting fit versus not wanting to be too sore, too overworked like you usually are in preseason because the games come up very quick. Basically if you get any type of injury in preseason you’re going to miss games. Knowing our fitness needs to be tip top before the season even starts is a challenge as well, but we understand there’s pressure on us as MLS Cup champions to go out there and represent the league well.<br /><br />When we were watching Champions League in previous years, last year included, you’re rooting for the other MLS teams to do well. You want somebody to win that championship and go represent the league. Hopefully we’ve got the opportunity to make a good run and be that team this year</p>
