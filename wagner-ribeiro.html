  <p><b>[Igor Gomes’ agent dreaming of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> move for Sao Paulo star]</b> I’ve been working with Igor since he was 12 years old. He is a starter at Sao Paulo and he is a different sort of player. He has the kind of style they appreciate in Europe: he scores goals, starts moves, makes assists…he is a complete player. There has been talk that Madrid want him but I said it wasn’t the right time to talk about that. But I do have the dream of one day taking him to the Bernabeu. I like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> as a club. If the opportunity arises, I would do it with pleasure</p>
