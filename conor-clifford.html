  <p>[Dundalk have confirmed the signing of Conor Clifford ahead of the 2017 League of Ireland season] I am delighted to have signed with the club. I spoke with [Dundalk manager] Stephen Kenny and things went well there so I can’t wait to get started. Stephen was massive in my decision. I like the way that the team played last year and he has done great things with Dundalk. I am looking forward to playing under him so I am happy to be here.<br /><br />Europe is something I am looking forward to this season. I watched Dundalk in the Champions League and Europa League last season and I was very impressed with them. The style of football was good and they played well. I want to do something similar this year. I want to help repeat that but I want to win trophies as well. I want to win things. That’s the aim and hopefully we can achieve that</p>

  <p>[A Chelsea FA Youth Cup-winning captain says that there is no room for young players at Stamford Bridge once they get past a certain age] At Chelsea, there’s no room for you when you get past reserve stage. There’s just so many players, so the next step if you’re not in or around the first team, is to go out on loan. There were 40-something players out. You go out, you get called back and then you get shipped out again.<br /><br />[Despite not making a breakthrough at Chelsea, the former Crumlin United youth stressed that he enjoyed his six years at the club] [It was] the best time of my life, I loved it there. I had a good upbringing playing with some of the best players in the world. I liked the environment, the people I was around</p>

  <p>[St Patrick’s vs <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. A familiar face on Saturday will be St Patrick’s midfielder Conor Clifford, who captained the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> to Youth Cup success in 2010, scoring the winning goal in the final against <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>] It’ll be good to see a few of the old faces as the kitman and a lot of the medical staff are still the same. I loved my time at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I won the Youth Cup, played a lot of reserve games and trained regularly with first-team squad and the best players in the world. Lamps (Lampard) looked after me really well. We sat down for lunch every day and we’d stay out after training to strike the ball. He was great with the young players. He’s such a legend of the game and it’ll be great to catch up, say hello and ask him for a trial!</p>
