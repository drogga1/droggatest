  <p><b>[Atletico Madrid star Antoine Griezmann has been hailed as one of the best players in the world]</b> He’s incredible, one of the best players in the world. I hope that he’ll stay here for many years with us.<br /><br /><b>[Lucas is also hopeful of being named in Didier Deschamps’ France squad but says he will not allow it to define his season]</b> I’m really happy, proud of what I have done this season. I’ve improved myself a lot, I’ve learned many things and I’ve acquired a good deal of experience. I hope I will be in it. Where will I be when it is announced?

  <p><b>[Antoine Griezmann made his mind up to snub Barcelona a month ago]</b> I believe Griezmann made his choice a month ago. The video only came recently but that <b>[situation]</b> wasn’t in his head. He’s only thinking about the World Cup and is 100 per cent focused on that.<br /><br />I think like his wife said in an interview: ‘At Atletico, you can be a star. At Barcelona, you will only be a player’. She said what is most essential, that’s the truth. Here, at Atletico, he can be the idol of everyone, of every fan. If he would have gone to Barcelona, there are a lot of great players and the best player in the world as well. He would have been in the shadow of some great players like Messi, Iniesta or even Xavi before. If he would have moved to Barcelona, it would have only been one more player in the team. Here, at Atletico, he is the player, our best player, our leader. He will make the difference</p>

That’s part of the show, part of the game. It’s true that sometimes I exaggerate a bit but it’s part of my character. I am used to doing that, especially when we are leading.

Maybe Sergio Ramos doesn’t like it, that Antoine has spoken his mind. We know that he defends his interests. He’s in a rival team, the team of the capital. We know that there’s a great rivalry between the teams and it’s normal that he defends his interests and we defend ours</p>

I was 100 per cent focused on my club, where I had recently signed a new contract. My agent told me about it. When he said there was an opportunity to go to Real Madrid, I told him I couldn’t do that. Atletico are my club, a team who have given me everything. I’m an honest person and I couldn’t go to Madrid. I hope I can stay here for a very long time, but football moves very fast. If an offer comes in that I can’t refuse…</p>

After such a long downtime, it is normal for it to take some time to get back to normal levels. Today I played for almost 80 minutes and felt well on the pitch, which is another step forward.

They’ve paid for a defender. Football today is full of these crazy sums, I know the reality. That’s why I worked like crazy and made every effort to get myself match-fit quickly.

  <p><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> defender Lucas Hernandez has opened up about the complicated childhood he had with his brother, Theo, after their father left his family]</b> I never tried <b>[to contact him]</b>. Of course, when I was young, I thought about where he could be and would have liked to know more about it. However, the more time has passed, the less that was part of my thoughts. I thought more about myself and my life when I grew up. It finally became clear to me that he left because he did not love us. And if he did not love us, then it was better that he left. I am 23 years old now and I was five or six years old <b>[when he left]</b>. It would now have been about 16 or 17 years since we have heard nothing more from him.<br /><br />I don’t know where he is, what he does, whether he is still alive or not. Meanwhile I have started my own little family. Since he has not contacted us so far, he will not be interested - or he simply does not feel like joining us<br /><br /><b>[Lucas counts himself lucky as he says his mother managed to fill both parental roles and did a fine job raising the two boys]</b> My mother, brother and I soon became a sworn trio after the split. Theo and I always had a football with us - morning, noon and night. We played together all the time. My brother is my best friend, we are very close. We never understood why he left. So we just grew up with our mother. She lived, worked and gave everything to us. We did not miss anything<br /><br />Now Theo and I have become professional footballers, so she can sit back and enjoy her life a bit. She told us what happened: that they broke up. One day my father was suddenly gone, we never heard from him again. Of course that was a bit complicated without a father at our side. But my mother has been very successful in fulfilling both mother and father roles. My brother and I had a complicated, but beautiful childhood<br /><br />My grandfather and my grandmother supported us financially so that we could live in a house and go to school. That’s why I say that my grandfather is like my dad and my grandmother like my second mother. They have made the most of our economic efforts and helped us a lot with everything<br /><br /><b>[Hernandez says that he is proud to be a club record signing for the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> giants and is determined to show he is worth it]</b> After all that I experienced with my mother and brother when I was little, it makes me proud that a club pays such a large sum for me. It’s not only pride, but also a responsibility. The transfer fees have recently become increasingly exaggerated. You pay incredible sums. Because of all the confidence the club has put in me with this fee, it is up to me to repay it on the field and give my all. The club should also be proud of having spent this money on me someday</p>

It will be difficult to get everyone out of lockdown, to be in similar condition but also just to meet up, to travel to Italy, Spain, England or France. You have to be realistic.
