  <p><b>[Fulham boss Scott Parker conceded his side’s hopes of an upset were dashed by Ream’s moment of madness]</b> Everything we planned for we had to change after six minutes because of the red card. <a href="tim-ream.html">Tim Ream</a> is obviously devastated. He has been immense for us this season. He made a mistake today. In the heat of the moment, you make decisions and sometimes you make the wrong ones</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> opened up a three-point lead at the top of the Championship after a professional display earned them a 3-0 win over Fulham]</b> When you analyse a game, from the way I felt, they’ve scored the first goal against the run of play. We created numerous chances and put <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> under pressure but for all the chances we created, we needed to be more clinical<br /><br />There’s a challenge ahead of us and there’s been many challenges this year. I’ve been at this football club for a long time now. We need to man up, dust ourselves down because we have seven games left in a season we’ve worked very hard for</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="cyrus-christie.html">Cyrus Christie</a>’s first league goal for Fulham earned Scott Parker’s team a Championship promotion lifeline in a 2-1 win at QPR]</b> There’s no hiding from the fact we’ve not now got a recognised forward in our squad, in the building. So the way the players look to the structure and the way we wanted to play tonight was spot on really. While it’s disappointing to lose <b>[<a href="aleksandar-mitrovic.html">Mitrovic</a>]</b>, other players are going to have to step up. Definitely, he’s going to be a big loss for us in the next few games, how we work, everything is around him. So to the players coming in it’s a big responsibility now. We had to shuffle things around a bit here and I think obviously the result was key tonight, that was evident</p>

  <p><b>[Josh Onomah struck deep into added time to keep Fulham’s automatic promotion hopes alive with a 1-0 win over <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a>]</b> That gives a sense of relief. As the game goes on, you miss some big chances, and the keeper pulls off an amazing double save. You start wondering if it is not your day. It was tough. We came up against a team who came here to play for a draw. At times the game was played in their half<br /><br />It’s a massive win for us, the way things have panned out in terms of lockdown, the games we have left. I think there will be many twists and turns. Our main focus is to win games. We have some tough games coming up. Whether you play someone at the top end or mid-table, they will be very big games</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="aleksandar-mitrovic.html">Aleksandar Mitrovic</a> scored on his return for Fulham as they climbed up to third in the Championship with a 2-0 win over Cardiff]</b> Three points is key at this moment in the season, and a third clean sheet on the bounce. When you play against a team like Cardiff you’re going to get put under extreme pressure, and at times the ball gets put in the right areas and it becomes a bit of an onslaught<br /><br />You have to defend your box very well and I thought we defended set plays and we limited them to a lot of long balls and second balls, which we dealt with very well. I would have like to have been better on the ball, but the message again was a clean sheet and job done</p>

  <p><b>[West Brom’s grip on an automatic promotion spot loosened as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Fulham]</b> It’ll be difficult. We need to be focused, we’re five unbeaten and it’s a fourth clean sheet, we need to stay focused on the journey. We came to win the game and keep the pressure on. Up until the drinks break was perfect. The longer the game goes on it becomes a little bit more end to end<br /><br />We tried to change things around a little bit but it didn’t happen. The end goal that has been drummed into these players from day one is you’re fortunate enough to have the play offs. Our message to the players is that it could be two games left or it could be five</p>
