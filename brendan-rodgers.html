After everything he’s done here, Steven deserves that respect, and should be given that time to consider that. It’s a big move, not just in his life, in terms of committing to where his next contract’s going to be. He needs to be given that time and respect to look at that. There are probably many things Steven has to look at in a decision like that, but it certainly won’t be about money.

But I need to give him the opportunity to think for as long as it takes in order to decide what he wants to do next. I’ve seen some unfortunate reports yesterday about a rift between him and me. If there are two words that describe our relationship, they would be honesty and respect. He’s been an outstanding player over his time and my time here. He’s been absolutely brilliant. He’s at the stage of his career where it’s not so much about the number of games that he plays now, it’s about the level of the games. That’s something we’ll work with and look at<br /><br /><b>[Asked directly if there had been any fall-out with]</b> No - 150%, no. I was very surprised to see that.

This is his concentration. When I see how he trains and works it is still about playing. Then, maybe there is a role further down the line. To have someone like that beside you in a coaching capacity would be great. At this moment it is purely about football. He is 35 years old at the end of this season and still has a couple of years to play if he wants to. There are many things at this stage he needs to factor in, it is not just about football</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester boss Rodgers explains Okazaki exit]</b> It is respecting his desires and at the stage of his career, he is 33 and has been a wonderful servant here. He is world renowned now because of his story with <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a>, but he wants to go back to playing as a striker and have that opportunity. He is in the latter stages of his career. From the outside watching him you could see his honesty, the type of player he is and the quality he has, but actually it is only when you work with him on a day-to-day basis you find out he is a star. He gets on with his work, is very low maintenance and is ready when you need him<br /><br /><b>[Whatever his destination, he is keen to return to a more attacking role than he was generally deployed in at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, having made his name as an out-and-out forward]</b> As a striker you are judged on your goals in your game. Here he played more as a third midfield player, where he could link the game between the midfield and Jamie (Vardy). He is also very clever in his pressing. He can press. However, he sees his strengths and his positioning as a striker and unfortunately here that opportunity would be limited, but also I think he is keen to try in another country. I am sure wherever he goes he will be a great success. I don’t know where and I don’t think even he knows yet. He feels it is probably time to move on but his contribution will never be forgotten. He is honest and every day he works so hard. He does it all with an energy, enthusiasm and a smile</p>

So you have to fight. You can’t accept what is the top six, in terms of finance, and that you are always going to sit below it. We have to hopefully find a way and drop a hand grenade in there, and see where it takes us. For us, we have to do it in a different way because we don’t have the resources to get players that will go to some of these other clubs. We have to find a way, but that’s the beauty, the excitement, the challenge, and the project I was excited about in coming here, to see if we can break that mould, and not just create something, but sustain it, and that’s what we are looking to do<br /><br /><b>[Now Rodgers believes he’s at a club which is able to challenge the established order of the Premier League]</b> <br /><br />There is a fantastic infrastructure here. You have the ownership, which is absolutely brilliant. It’s very simple, very straightforward, they have ambitions, but they are realistic in where they are at. So they give us a great foundation to build from. We’ve got a new training facility coming next summer, which will be amazing, and will allow us to develop more players of our own, and then hopefully encourage players to come as well, which is important. You’ve a great fan base, with the potential, of plans going forward, to extend the stadium. Obviously, the clubs we talk about have big histories in the game, but for us it’s about creating a new history, and that’s the challenge for us, but one we are all excited about</p>

Coming into here, I knew he was one of best in Europe, and it was a case of giving him the confidence to show that. Sometimes players can get into their early 30s and be written off.

I’ve always felt that when teams have been against him that he’s a real threat up front because he’s aggressive with his press and then when you have the ball, the one thing you’re frightened of as a defender is pace and this guy is as quick as I’ve seen over 10 yards that I’ve worked with. He has that explosive speed. He’s so clever, he recognises danger. He waits in the central area and then when it’s on, he can go and press it. He doesn’t have to worry about pressing the whole back four, he’s conserving his energy, because the other players have to conserve their energy as well<br /><br />He gives any team great confidence. When you have a striker with that ability, you know he doesn’t need many chances. Any of the best sides have it, that striker that can score, and he’s got guys behind him who can serve him</p>

  <p><b>[Brendan Rodgers says <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Jamie Vardy</a> is among the finest centre forwards in the world]</b> Before I came in, I was watching him from afar and seeing him maintain that real quality that he has as a goalscorer and I was really looking forward to working with him when I arrived. I was seeing the quality in the games, but it was going to be interesting to see how he was on a day-to-day basis. But he is right up there with the elite strikers in world football, how he threatens the line and his explosive speed over a short distance is absolutely phenomenal. He is very focused, he is in his early 30s now but he’s still as quick as ever. He has an appetite for the game and he’s got that old school mentality where he wants to fight, he wants to run and his whole attitude to the game has been absolutely brilliant since I came in. He’s a natural goalscorer, if you get the service to him, he will finish<br /><br />He’s got a self-belief, but I have to say, he is a wonderful boy. He’s got the personality of a big player, he has that belief. I was interested to be able to work with James, I’d seen him from afar as a young player and I’d seen his move from <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> to <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> so I was keen to see how he would work close up. But this is a boy who loves football. He thinks about the game, he watches the game, he just loves it and he wants to be better. He’s been a joy to work with and it’s a joy to see him constantly improving, but there’s no doubt his personality is a big part of what he is. He’s a super professional, how he prepares himself every single day and what’s important as well, with players like that, is you don’t want to kill their joy and their spirit. They have to toe the line in terms of the team but you don’t want to take away that individuality, that personality and that quality because that’s what makes up a fantastic team<br /><br />We’re in the position on merit. I think the players have done fantastically well this season to get into that position and our wish is that we can hopefully have the chance to finish it off, everything being well and the safety being paramount for everyone. We’ve been on a great journey as a team over the last year and our ambition was to earn a European place, which we knew was always going to be a big challenge.

He is not one of those players who is involved in the link-up, in the game. That’s not his strength. His strength is in the box and running from deep in behind. Of course we want to get him more service, but we are looking at ways to develop and get our wingers back to being involved and scoring and creating goals, and of course our midfield players. A lot of spotlight <b>[is]</b> on Jamie, but it is not just the striker, it’s the team’s contribution. So that’s something we need to improve<br /><br />We are not that concerned about that at all <b>[dropping out of top four]</b>. We only played two games, we drew two. Yeah, it would have been better if we’d won them both but we are where we are. We are going to do our best to play better and I believe we will do. We are a good enough team, we are motivated and we will be going forwards with these positive ideas</p>

The style, you can see. That is not an easy style to put in place and implement, especially at a club that want to be challenging straight away as well. His courage since he’s gone in, to want to develop that. They’ve played with a couple of different systems but the style has always remained the same. That is something that bodes well for the future and for him.<br /><br />We’ve shown over 33 games our talent. Okay, we are maybe missing some players that have helped us along that way but as a squad we’re very focused on achieving it.
