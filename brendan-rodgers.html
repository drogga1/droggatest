We are hoping he can develop over the next 48 hours, to be in a position to train with the team on Thursday, but that would his first involvement with the team, on Thursday, Friday and have the availability maybe for the squad for Saturday. But if we are talking about players to be picked for international duty then they need to be fit to play, and Daniel certainly won’t be fit to play.<br /><br />It’s something we have already stressed. We will see. My focus is on protecting the Liverpool players and at this moment in time my focus is on getting him fit for Liverpool.

The boy is being hung out to dry and I dare say the criticism will continue for a few more weeks to come because of this.<br /><br />I’m fed up reading about this club v country row, claims we intervened and put pressure on Roy Hodgson. I’ve read we sent dossiers to the <b>[Football Association]</b> on Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge and I’m having showdown talks with Roy Hodgson on Sunday and all sorts of rubbish. The decision not to play him was a managerial decision. I haven’t said a single word but have to say I have never seen such rubbish written over the last few days<br /><br />Let me tell you, there have been at least five occasions in the past when Raheem has said he felt tired before games but he’s never refused to play. We have taken on board what he has said and taken a decision accordingly. I rested him against Aston Villa and we lost the game. But it was our decision to do so - and our decision alone. Last season he said he felt tired before the Manchester City game. We won 3-2 and he put in a man-of-the-match performance. The point I’m making is you have to take on board advice from your own people and make your own decision, right or wrong</p>

  <p><b>[Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers has warned Chelsea that their opening offer for Craig Gordon fell well short of the club’s valuation]</b> There has been an offer but nothing that we would <b>[make us]</b> even think about moving him. He is a player very much part of what we want to do. He has 18 months left on his contract and I want to keep him here to build a team around. We have no interest in selling him. When the club spoke to me about it, my message was very simple. He is not a player we want to sell.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether £3m was considered to be a derisory figure]</b> It is certainly not his valuation, that is for sure. I don’t want to put any numbers on it. The message is pretty clear. He is not for sale. I repeat again, if a player is to go out of Celtic then the club will get their worth for the player. It will be at our valuation, irrespective of what the perception is of the league. In the real world, every player has a valuation but there are four days to go in the window. I don’t want to be in the mind-set of moving a goalkeeper with four days to go, a goalkeeper we have been building up to become a Champions League goalkeeper. To move him on and try to find a replacement is a very difficult thing to do. I would hope the only thing that comes out of it that we can renegotiate with Craig and get him here for a longer period than the 18 months he has left</p>

  <p><b>[Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers has warned Craig Gordon that he would be forfeiting two or three years if he moved to Chelsea]</b> Chelsea is a fantastic club but it’s also about what you want and for him now it has to be about playing games and for as long as he can. It’s difficult because it <b>[Chelsea]</b> is not really a playing role. You become a training keeper and you are virtually forfeiting two or three years of your life to be a training keeper. Before you know it, you are 37 and where do you go? Right now, Craig is in a great moment. It is absolutely flattering for him and also for the team. I think if you had asked six months ago would someone from Chelsea be looking for a keeper at Celtic it may not have been the case. It shows you that if you can impose a style of play on a team and develop it then it does a lot for you as a football player. So for Craig it’s great because it shows he has been performing at a really good level. I have spoken to him at length.<br /><br />When I was there, Petr Cech was No.1. Carlo Cudicini was the loyal No.2 and didn’t play so much. The decade was built around Petr. The next decade was built around Courtois. The strategy, which is a clever one, is to bring in a loyal No.2 who is resigned to being that and not playing so much. After a while, you want to play. Asmir Begovic was No.1 at Stoke, goes to Chelsea as loyal a No.2 and does great. He didn’t play so much bar a little run when Courtois was out but eventually you want to play. He’s at an age where he wants to play and that’s how it works. It was Ross Turnbull before that but this is the best place for Craig and he respects where he is</p>

  <p><b>[Brendan Rodgers feels criticism of his Liverpool successor Jurgen Klopp is harsh]</b> I look at Jurgen Klopp and of course Wolves played very well, but there is a contradiction there. People want young players to play and when they do play, there is an issue. It is never nice when you lose a game but Jurgen has went and played four or five British players and given them a chance. He is hoping they can go and win a game at Anfield against a Championship team with experienced players around them. It never worked out like that because Wolves played very well but the narrative changes for a manager every single day. You are either very good or very bad - you are never just a good manager who has maybe given players an opportunity and a chance. Ultimately, you are judged on games you win and lose, but sometimes in the modern day it is very difficult as a manager.</p>

You see the level of his game, his composure, his quality, everything.

He has a fantastic mentality which helps him. He has talent but he’s also very focused on being a footballer.<br /><br />There’s no doubt in the next decade he’ll be leading France and being a real reference for the full national team.

But I was told he wouldn’t be for us at the time. Van Dijk could have jumped from Celtic to a Liverpool. Some clubs will want to see the players tested at certain arenas first. But if there is enough belief in the player then that counts. The key for scouting is trying to predict when the player is peaking. You could see with Van Dijk that he was quick, strong, good on the ball and decent in the air. So what more do you need to see? You could see him playing international football and, okay, clubs may want to see him in Champions League<br /><br />Wanyama left and then made the jump but he was a good player at Celtic, showing up well in the Champions League.

  <p><b>[Liverpool almost sold Luis Suarez to Juventus in 2012 before the striker was eventually convinced to remain at Anfield]</b> I think at Liverpool, you always feel you can hang on to your best players, because you have such an iconic club, an institution worldwide. When I first went in there, Luis was destined for Juventus, and we were able to talk him round into staying, telling him that the team would be built around him and his qualities. Second season, we obviously had the Arsenal connection. Then he went on to have his best season and then that following season we couldn’t keep him. You always felt at Liverpool that you could pay the wages and you could pay the money, but if it was through choice, if the player wanted to move on then that’s what he would do. So there was real disappointment.</p>

  <p><b>[Celtic have not had one bid for Moussa Dembele]</b> My mind is that he’s a Celtic player and we have not had one bid. I don’t want to keep going on about it because it can affect players, especially young players. There has been a lot of noise around Moussa for 18 months now but let’s be clear, we’ve not had one bid. There have been enquiries around him, but not one bid. He has been linked with about 16 clubs, but the bottom line is you have to play football. Always be ready to play and then, if a move comes, it comes.<br /><br />All the talk can be very unhelpful for a young player. If you are an experienced player, you get used to it. But if you’ve been linked with so many clubs over a period of time, big clubs, less clubs, foreign clubs, British clubs, then it surely can be unsettling. It’s not something that ends up being good for a player. He always had a plan when he came here. He wanted to play for a big club, show he could cope with pressure, develop as a player, become a winner and see where that takes him. If you are a young French international and are progressing like he is then there’s going to be a level of interest. What’s important for him is to concentrate on what you can control, which is the football</p>

Some of the other boys are not too far away in terms of coming back but in terms of what we needed I’m still clear on that and the strength we wanted to get in, come the end of the window. There’s no change there.</p>

  <p><b>[Aberdeen forward Sam Cosgrove was sent off for the lunge on Scott Brown, and Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers was impressed with how Brown reacted to the dangerous tackle]</b> It’s not a great challenge from the boy who got sent off. It was naughty. Logan didn’t set the best example for young players when he twice tried to smash the ball at the player on the floor. Fortunately for Scott, he didn’t hurt him. Scott is a big-game player, especially in those moments. When it goes to 10 men he revels in it even more. Browny is a brilliant leader. He takes it, shrugs it off and gets back up again to dominate the game. He’s a big-game player.</p>

  <p><b>[Brendan Rodgers continues to be billed as a potential successor to Arsene Wenger at Arsenal]</b> If you’re happy, ultimately that’s all that matters. The money’s irrelevant. You can have X amount of pounds in your bank every month but if you’re not happy and you’re not finding peace in what you’re doing, it doesn’t really matter. I love the Premier League, the quality of the players, the quality of the coaches. There are great challenges. But there are arms and legs flying off managers down there. You can come here and my genuine love is improving people and making them better, helping the club improve and getting the chance to develop and win things and see people improve. Or do you go somewhere where you might have six games? That wouldn’t make me happy. So it’s a Catch 22. I came here because I was asked by the major shareholder, Dermot Desmond, to be the architect of the club. I don’t have to control absolutely everything because it is very difficult to do that now in the modern game. I don’t need that. But I just want to work with good people that have one vision for the team and the club and that is what I have here. I’m not in any rush to come away from that.<br /><br />Celtic are one of the great clubs of the world. There’s a pressure here that’s different. You have to win every game. There’s not a club in England that has that. You can go to Old Trafford as Liverpool manager and get a draw and it’s not a bad result. At Celtic, there’s an expectancy to win home and away. I’ve been 10 years as a manager now and I’ve done a lot of learning. The biggest thing you can have as a football manager is happiness and energy. Sometimes, if you are doing OK, people tend to want to move you. It’s the way it is.<br /><br /><b>[On his future plans]</b> I’m in a position where I’m in my dream job. As a guy from Northern Ireland who supported Celtic and worked in football, I’m living my dream here. I want to work through until I’m 60 and get to a thousand games and I probably know I won’t do the other 500-odd games here at Celtic. I know how quickly it can all change. I nearly won the title at Liverpool and everybody’s saying, ‘Sign him up’, then very quickly I was out. Now I stay calm with it and never be complacent and do the best I can for the club. Winning is winning as a football manager and wherever that is, that feeling doesn’t change</p>

It’s all very aligned and very clear and that allows me to work in confidence and it gives the stability to the team, the staff and everyone, and we can all move forward. I couldn’t have wished for it to have gone any better. You always hope you come into a club and can make an impact. What was important for us is that we could start quickly, but that’s all down to the players and their ability to learn and take on board and they’ve been absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />No matter how big your institution is and how great it is, you always have to guard against complacency and that’s something I always say to the players - they need to be allergic to that</p>

  <p><b>[Brendan Rodgers concedes that Kieran Tierney may leave Celtic at some stage in the future]</b> I don’t put any speculation or figure around him. Everyone sees the market now and there is a market out there for top talents and particularly young talents. But he’s a player who’s not for sale. He’s still got development to go and he is in a great place to learn. If you play for a big club in whatever country, there will always be people watching you. Obviously there is a dearth of good left-backs around and with Kieran’s qualities and huge potential still as a young player, that is always going to draw the eyes of top teams. Kieran has great qualities. He has a really good temperament and that is getting better in big games. Tactically, he understands the game much better. Physically, he can cope with any league in the world. He has got stronger and faster. He is playing at a big club.<br /><br />You see his passion and love for Celtic. I’m sure there will be times over the next few years when that will be tested, because obviously there will be a financial implication there that you have to think about, and he can’t not have that opportunity if it comes. But I don’t think it’s something that’s on his radar. He knows that to leave Celtic, ever, it has to be a win-win situation for him and the club so that people go ‘okay, we can see that one’. It tends to be more that sort of moral issue that comes into it, in terms of being on ‘X’ amount at Celtic, another club can give him more and they give you a big fee as a club. It’s very, very difficult for a young player to turn that down. If the player doesn’t want to go, it’s okay - you’ll not be pushing him out the door. He’s a Celtic supporter and that means everything to him, but football’s a business now for players and I think he’s recognising that if you’re playing over 15 years of your life and you’re at this club for whatever - another four or five years - he might feel that this is the happiest he’ll ever be. This is where football becomes a business. I hear now of so many players of years gone by, bless them, who’ve never earned the money and then people talk of loyalty and say, ‘Oh, they played this many games and blah, blah, blah’ and ‘what a player he was.’ Then they say, ‘Oh he’s struggling at the minute.’ So, you have to look after yourself and that’s the modern world.

  <p><b>[Valencia vs Celtic]</b> It’ll be important to be defensively compact, tight and concentrated. And then when we have the ball we must look to create opportunities. The first goal will be very important. An early goal isn’t very important, it’s more about not giving anything away. Our focus is on bringing our game. If we can get that first goal, that will give the team that extra confidence to go and get another. Last week was disappointing and we lost our way a little bit. After any disappointing performance we’ve always tried to analyse it openly and honestly. We had to be concentrated on Sunday to get a result and we eventually did that. That’s been the make-up of this group since I came. We can come back again tomorrow night. It’ll be a challenge. If I look at the game and ask if we have a chance - the answer is: Of course, we do. Even if it will be difficult. The result and how we performed in Sunday’s game will give us confidence but this is a different game and different level. What we need to ensure is that in the moments of pressure we can stay strong and stay compact. It’s a challenge for us, but we’re really looking forward to it.</p>

The team has come deeper, the ball goes up to him and he’s fighting on his own. Because of the title win and everything around the threat of Jamie, space is no longer there all the time, especially at home. So when teams are banked up you have to find a way and a method that still exploits his qualities. It was something I spoke to him about at length on Friday morning before training, where we could get him into areas and how we were going to play against teams that just sit deep.<br /><br />I will certainly give him other ideas and just simplify the game. But you saw the other night (against Brighton) what he is - pass, makes the run and gets his finish. Away at Chelsea he comes in, <b>[James]</b> Maddison plays the pass, he makes a little blindside run and finishes.

He’s taken his game now to a level where he clearly is one of the best players in the world.

This was a boy who looked after his body and his life to ensure that he could give himself every chance to do that<br /><br />For Raheem, it was never about money. If it was about money he could have stayed at Liverpool. It was about being the best he can be. In that moment in time there was an opportunity to go to Manchester City where they had top-class players. He’s gone in there and developed and become a winner, which is clear to see now in his game.

I was seeing the quality in the games, but it was going to be interesting to see how he was on a day-to-day basis. But he is right up there with the elite strikers in world football, how he threatens the line and his explosive speed over a short distance is absolutely phenomenal. He is very focused, he is in his early 30s now but he’s still as quick as ever.

Into professional football at 25, I read somewhere his first competitive game at the top level was only a few years ago, at 27. It’s absolutely remarkable and it shows you the talent the guy has and the spirit and drive the guy has. No doubt he’ll get to that, pretty much sure he’ll go well beyond it. It’s a phenomenal story Jamie , but he’ll go beyond it. He’s super fit, super fast, I think he’ll enjoy every minute, he’ll get back to the level he was very quickly</p>

The thing I look at with young players is ‘do they have the temperament?’ And you’ve just seen how Luke <b>[Thomas]</b> served the ball in. He wasn’t phased and if there were 100,000 <b>[people in the stadium]</b>, he would be just the same. He’s got incredible composure, it’s his first game at first-team level against a really good team and he has the awareness and the view of the game to disguise a pass inside. He lasted so well. Firstly he defends, for someone so slight at the moment, he’s aggressive, he’s tenacious, but he can pass the ball and that’s always important for a player that plays for me. We set out at the start of the season with a huge effort to try and qualify for European football, which was always going to be a big ask, but the result tonight gives us the second highest finish in <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>’s <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> history and now we’ve got two more games to see if we can create some more history. The players are so happy but they’ll be ready now for Sunday</p>

  <p><b>[Ben Chilwell: <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> boss <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> unsure if defender has played last game for club]</b> I’m not sure. He’s a <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> player and not one that we want to lose so I’m quite relaxed on it. We’ve got a fantastic squad and one that we want to keep together. There’s no intention to sell <a href="ben-chilwell.html">Ben Chilwell</a> and absolutely no need to sell. The message is: He’s not for sale<br /><br /><b>[Rodgers keen to freshen squad for Europe]</b> We’re not a club whose budgets needs a guarantee of Champions League football but we’re ambitious and we want to fight. We want to overcome whatever financial differences there are to find a way to arrive there. Of course, if you have that opportunity to finish in the Champions League places, which we have, then we will give absolutely everything we can to do that.<br /><br />We all understand the need to improve, that’s very important. We haven’t had too many changes in the squad since I have come in but I think there is a lot more development left in the players we currently have. Of course, you have to be careful that if you go through with the same players there can be a psychological exhaustion if you don’t freshen up your squad with quality. We want to improve and in order to do that we have been looking for a number of months to bring in the right quality</p>

  <p><b>[Luke Thomas certainly made his mark on his debut for <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>]</b> He’s got incredible composure.

  <p><b>[Brendan Rodgers says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> boss <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> shown ‘lack of respect’]</b> Jose is a world-class manager. He has been until this point of his career and will continue to be that. It (criticism) is a lack of respect and normally from people that have never stood on this sideline. OK, football continues to evolve and change, but you still have room for different types of football. Jose’s a master at getting his teams organised, difficult to beat and winning. There’s different philosophies and identities of managers and there’s no right or wrong. He’s proven over many years that he’s such a successful manager and he’ll be looking to bring success to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. His longevity in the game, what he’s done, and what he continues to do deserves a huge amount of respect<br /><br /><b>[When asked where getting <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> into the Champions League would rank in his career achievements]</b> It would certainly be up there. At <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> it was about getting the club back in the Champions League. At <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> it was a different challenge but we did good work there too. Coming here’s a different challenge because there’s not that expectancy. There’s ambition of course, and the challenge of bringing a team into the top six. We’ve been able to do that in our first full season and now we have a chance over a couple of games to go even better than that and arrive in the top four. But if we didn’t get in the top four it would still be an absolutely brilliant season for us<br /><br /><b>[<a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> bounced back from a shock 4-1 defeat at struggling <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> to record only a second post-lockdown win against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> on Thursday]</b> It was a big psychological shift to get over what we went through at <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> and then go again. We’re not a team that goes soft the way we did in the second half, our defensive record shows that. We fell way below our standard. It was really important that we said what we had to say and then move on quickly</p>
