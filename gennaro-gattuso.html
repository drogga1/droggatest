For me, <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a> is the best player in England. He is a technical player, who plays very hard and with his heart. He is a legend for his club and the best player they’ve got. I have more respect for him because I remember that final in Istanbul. We had won it but then he played a great game and changed everything. I watched him against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> on Tuesday and he was amazing, unbelievable. I still say I have respect for him and like the way he plays. I am looking forward to playing him again and looking him in the eye before it starts. This will be a very important game for us both</p>

We just got that game wrong against a strong Arsenal side. We realised that and today we responded. We’ve still got a 30 percent chance of going through and we’re not going to London for a holiday. We need to respect our glorious shirts. The league table is finally looking pretty for us. Our objective is there in front of us, but we’ve got to take things game by game. I was a bit worried because we’d not lost in two-and-a-half months until Arsenal so we were afraid we might struggle after going so long without losing, but the team responded well.</p>

In recent months he’s improved some things in training and we decided to let him play in the Primavera.<br /><br />The train has passed but he’s not 50-years-old, he’s 20-years-old <b>[in June]</b> and I think he has to take stock of his mistakes.

He’s a great professional and always the first to lead the group. I hope he can stay, he is a valuable player with a great mentality. When a player expresses a desire, the coach and those working in a group must do everything possible to persuade him to stay. Agonistically, we must think about the pros and cons.

It’s Christmas time, so you’re wrapping them up and putting them under trees. All the things you write about the transfer market and Financial Fair Play are things the club hasn’t had to deal with yet. No-one has come to tell me ‘we’ll sign him outright’ or ‘we won’t sign him outright’. These are things I’ve only heard from you in the media. I know we have constraints and we can’t do much on the market, but it’s you who keep saying we have to sell <b>[Hakan]</b> Calhanoglu, Suso, <b>[Gonzalo]</b> Higuain. For me, that’s not the case. I don’t only defend Hakan, I defend everyone. I’m willing to throw myself into the fire for my players. So when you talk to me, it irritates me that you attack my lads.<br /><br />I’ve spoken to Gonzalo, and he’s the first to be disappointed by the situation. In the period we’re in he needs to give us his experience and character, his goals come after that. In difficult times the priority isn’t goals, but leadership, he needs to carry his teammates even if some make mistakes. The chatter around him will always be there, we can’t control everything, but I’ve told him that everyone appreciates him, though he has to do more</p>

When important people like our directors are here I respect them and everyone does their own job. I knew there was a chance, and I also knew from day one that it was difficult. There’s no disappointment, if someone arrives I’m happy but I’m not going to tear my hair out about those who don’t. The management knows who I like and who can be useful, and since July I’ve never spoken to a player outside our group.<br /><br />We know that after evenings like Thursday we’ve written a dark chapter, but there’s no shame. Shame is for those who steal, we just play sport. Seeing modern players crying in the dressing room is a sign. Maybe the football of 15-20 years ago is still there. That struck me. This group has human value, a lot of them were in tears. Before I’ve spoken about scars, and this has to be a scar which will remind us of the mistakes we made</p>

If a player has those qualities and that desire to improve, results will come</p>

It was their decision. We can’t underestimate any detail. We need to look each other in the eye, stay together and say what needs to be said. We have to find solutions, because what we’re doing right now is not enough<br /><br /><b>[Runners-up last season and in 2017-18, <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> have looked a shadow of themselves - lacking energy, creativity and passion]</b> We must first and foremost apologise to the fans and the whole city, because the performance was embarrassing. In the past we had decent performances, but here other than the first 20-25 minutes, there was a lot that needed work. We can’t look for alibis, we have hit rock bottom here and need to find out what is happening. It looks as if we just met this morning, put the jerseys on and went on to the pitch. There is no organisation or unity, we are all at sea.<br /><br />It’s strange, because the team trains hard during the week and does well, then we get out there on match day and don’t do anything. We’re sluggish, we let the opposition through, we create little. Nothing worked this evening and it’s only right we take responsibility for that. I can’t explain it, as I felt the team would put in a great performance tonight and I was let down. The team has no soul. We thought that we were recovering from the earlier situation, but evidently we’re still sick</p>

They force you to defend deep and we had to play like that, because if there were spaces back there, they could really hurt us.
