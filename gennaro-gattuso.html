<p>: 2019 06 19
AC Milan have announced the appointment of Marco Giampaolo as their new head coach. Milan have been in the hunt for a new boss since Gennaro Gattuso’s departure at the end of last season, after the former Italy international failed to lead the Rossoneri to a Champions League spot in Serie A.</p>

  <p><b>[Gennaro Gattuso said <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> players have decided to go into a training retreat after hitting rock bottom following a 2-0 loss at home to Fiorentina]</b> I spoke to the squad and they made the decision to go into a training retreat from this evening. It was their decision. We can’t underestimate any detail. We need to look each other in the eye, stay together and say what needs to be said. We have to find solutions, because what we’re doing right now is not enough<br /><br /><b>[Runners-up last season and in 2017-18, <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> have looked a shadow of themselves - lacking energy, creativity and passion]</b> We must first and foremost apologise to the fans and the whole city, because the performance was embarrassing. In the past we had decent performances, but here other than the first 20-25 minutes, there was a lot that needed work. We can’t look for alibis, we have hit rock bottom here and need to find out what is happening. It looks as if we just met this morning, put the jerseys on and went on to the pitch. There is no organisation or unity, we are all at sea.<br /><br />It’s strange, because the team trains hard during the week and does well, then we get out there on match day and don’t do anything. We’re sluggish, we let the opposition through, we create little. Nothing worked this evening and it’s only right we take responsibility for that. I can’t explain it, as I felt the team would put in a great performance tonight and I was let down. The team has no soul. We thought that we were recovering from the earlier situation, but evidently we’re still sick</p>

  <p><b>[Gattuso revels in <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>’s Champions League showing]</b> Since <b>[Barca coach Quique]</b> <a href="quique-setien.html">Setien</a> arrived, they systematically push five or six players into attack, they don’t just pass and that’s it. They force you to defend deep and we had to play like that, because if there were spaces back there, they could really hurt us. I think they barely grazed us tonight, they hardly had a single shot on goal. They could’ve been there all night and not scored, but we conceded after one single error. They didn’t hurt us, it barely tickled<br /><br />We could’ve done better on a few counter-attacks, but the team did what we had to do. We allowed them very few opportunities. I am a little disappointed that we didn’t create more playing out from the back and in possession, but a little fatigue can happen when you work so hard throughout.
