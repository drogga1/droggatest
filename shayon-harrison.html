  <p><b>[Harry Kane inspiring Spurs striker as he looks to shine in Australia]</b> Harry’s an example of hard work, going out on loan, doing well there and showing that hard work pays off. He’s a big inspiration for me, especially being a striker. Someone I really look up to and hopefully I can mirror that one day. I’ve trained with him a lot, played with him in a few pre-season games - he’s just an amazing player, everything you want in a striker. Not only on the pitch but the way he carries himself off it as well. He’s an unbelievable professional and someone all the lads at Spurs look up to.<br /><br /><b>[on Warren Joyce]</b> I knew a bit about the manager when he was with Man United’s reserves a couple years ago so when I found out that there was interest for me to come over I was really, really excited. We were looking at options anywhere really in England and abroad - this was a very sudden interest so when I found out I thought it was a great move for me and wanted to get it done. I was in Melbourne for a pre-season tournament with Spurs a couple years ago so I was keen to come back<br /><br />It’s a big challenge for me off the pitch as well as on it. Being so far away from home, living alone and really getting out of my comfort zone essentially. It’s a big challenge mentally and I know the A-League is a physical league. The next step for me is to play men’s football - those were the reasons I came out here and I’m trying to make that next step in my career.<br /><br />I’ve been at Spurs since I was nine - was scouted from my Sunday league team in London. Made my debut in Anfield in the League Cup which was an amazing experience and something I’ll never forget. Really hungry to get that back. With such a big club like Spurs you have everything you need to get the best out of yourself. Hopefully I can go back there and kick on from there</p>
