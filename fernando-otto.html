<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Alex Telles has been backed to end up at Chelsea one day by his agent, Fernando Otto]</b> For now, we have nothing. Not from Chelsea. Neither me nor the player received any contact from any English club. But it can happen. When he went to Galatasaray, we had an offer from Chelsea for Alex. But at the time, we had already confirmed a pre-contract with Galatasaray, and we could not go back. But there was information exchange, last year too. And I believe that maybe one day he will play for Chelsea. I don’t know if it’s going to be this season or the next. But I feel like one day he can play for Chelsea<br /><br />I don’t know. Porto paid six, seven million Euros. But he’s been valued this year, he was the best full-back of the Portuguese league, and in assists numbers he’s the best left-back in Europe. I believe they will ask a lot, not a little. Also because there are no full-backs in the market</p>
