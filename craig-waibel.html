  <p><b>[Real Salt Lake announced Monday the signing of forward Chad Barrett, who joins the Utah side as a free agent]</b> Chad is a hard-working competitor with a nose for the goal. He’s proven throughout his career that he can be an impact player either as a starter or off the bench and we’re happy to add him to the locker room.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Real Salt Lake has signed free agent defender David Horst]</b> David is another veteran player that adds a different dynamic to our group of center backs. With his addition, we are much more comfortable with our depth now that we have four center backs that are capable of starting, with each pairing offering something different.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Luis Silva knew he departed Real Salt Lake with unfinished business]</b> We are excited to have Luis back. He’s a talented player that we loved having here, and during that time he fit in very well with the organization. He can play multiple positions and brings another dimension to the attacking front.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Real Salt Lake has announced the acquisition of midfielder-forward Brooks Lennon on loan from Liverpool for the 2017 season]</b> Brooks is another in a long line of great stories from our academy. They don’t all follow the same path, but we are proud to play a part in their development and get them on the field with Real Salt Lake. We’ve been following his development closely and to bring him back gives him a great opportunity to play first-team soccer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Justen Glad and Jordan Allen have signed new multi-year contracts with Real Salt Lake]</b> As an organization, we could not be more pleased with the way Justen and Jordan have represented the club at the professional and international levels while also showing to be vital parts of the Salt Lake City community. Who they have become as men is as admirable as anything they’ve done on the field and it is appropriate to reward those efforts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Real Salt Lake has announced it has signed forward Joao Plata to a multi-year contract extension]</b> Any time you can make a long-term commitment between the player and the club on such a promising player with so much attacking ability, you never shy away from that opportunity. The timing was perfect to extend</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Real Salt Lake fires coach Jeff Cassar three games into 2017 season]</b> At the conclusion of last season, we felt that while we were disappointed in the end result, Jeff had done enough to earn another shot to lead the team in the 2017 campaign. We have a high sense of urgency for progress this season, and have made many offseason changes towards that endeavor. So, while these decisions are always difficult, we, as an organization, felt that it was necessary to make the change in our head coaching position now.<br /><br />The process for hiring a new head coach to lead the club has already begun. We will work quickly and diligently to ensure that we find the right leader that shares our values, passion, commitment and vision</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Real Salt Lake has signed coach Mike Petke to an extension through 2020]</b> We put a lot of stock in player development and Mike has been tremendous in that regard this season. His success on the field and great leadership in integrating young players does a lot to confirm the confidence we had in him when we first hired him with the Monarchs and when we promoted him earlier this year.</p>

<h4 id="2017-11-02-retrieve">2017 11 02 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Real Salt Lake has exercised its option to purchase Venezuela international Jefferson Savarino]</b> It’s a huge step in the process we’ve been going through and a massive commitment from our owner, one which exemplifies where we are in the sport of soccer in the United States but also individually as a club</p>

<h4 id="2017-12-20-retrieve">2017 12 20 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Real Salt Lake has signed USA youth international Brooks Lennon from Liverpool on a permanent deal]</b> Lennon is another key player in what we believe to be one of the youngest and most exciting attacking groups in the league, and Brooks adds depth to the choices the coaching staff possess each day as he can fill multiple roles within the front four and play them all very well. Brooks took a different route than most, from Arizona to England and back to Utah - and he’s now come back to our club and found success here on the field, and we expect even bigger things in 2018.<br /><br />I’m ecstatic - I knew I wanted to stay at Real Salt Lake. Under the leadership of Mike Petke I thought I made huge strides in my development and I matured as a player on and off the field. It was a no-brainer for me to re-sign and I know that we have the quality to compete for hardware, and I’m excited to do that with a group of players that I grew up playing with</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Real Salt Lake has announced the signing of former Blackburn Rovers fullback Adam Henley]</b> He is a promising young talent that has American roots. He has every reason to come over and work hard to be successful. It’s a perfect scenario for us to bring in a young, energetic player that needs to prove himself.</p>

<h4 id="2018-05-02-retrieve">2018 05 02 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Real Salt Lake has signed American defender Shawn Barry from Polish side Korona Kielce]</b> He’s got some great professional experience and can play multiple positions along the back line. He’s a guy that can challenge guys on the roster on a weekly basis for playing time. He’s a strong, athletic guy who can pass well out of the back. His midrange passing is phenomenal. He trends more to the way the staff wants to play.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="2019-03-22-retrieve">2019 03 22 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Taylor Booth is not your typical American]</b> I think Taylor is an extremely talented player. Obviously, that’s why we wanted to keep him home. But when you go to a club like Bayern, the biggest thing is getting those minutes, and Taylor understands the challenge in front of him. I don’t think it will surprise anyone when he finds his way onto the field in their youth levels</p>
