  <p>[Real Salt Lake announced Monday the signing of forward Chad Barrett, who joins the Utah side as a free agent] Chad is a hard-working competitor with a nose for the goal. He’s proven throughout his career that he can be an impact player either as a starter or off the bench and we’re happy to add him to the locker room.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Real Salt Lake has signed free agent defender David Horst] David is another veteran player that adds a different dynamic to our group of center backs. With his addition, we are much more comfortable with our depth now that we have four center backs that are capable of starting, with each pairing offering something different.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Real Salt Lake has announced the signing of former Blackburn Rovers fullback Adam Henley] He is a promising young talent that has American roots. He has every reason to come over and work hard to be successful. It’s a perfect scenario for us to bring in a young, energetic player that needs to prove himself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Real Salt Lake has signed American defender Shawn Barry from Polish side Korona Kielce] He’s got some great professional experience and can play multiple positions along the back line. He’s a guy that can challenge guys on the roster on a weekly basis for playing time. He’s a strong, athletic guy who can pass well out of the back. His midrange passing is phenomenal. He trends more to the way the staff wants to play.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Taylor Booth is not your typical American] I think Taylor is an extremely talented player. Obviously, that’s why we wanted to keep him home. But when you go to a club like Bayern, the biggest thing is getting those minutes, and Taylor understands the challenge in front of him. I don’t think it will surprise anyone when he finds his way onto the field in their youth levels</p>
