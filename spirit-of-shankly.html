  <p><b>[Supporters union ask <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to explain controversial decision to furlough staff]</b> Spirit of <a href="bill-shankly.html">Shankly</a> want to make it clear that we have not refused to criticise the club. Our chair has been misquoted and misrepresented by a journalist on Twitter looking for clicks.<br /><br />On Saturday 4 April, LFC announced they are to furlough non-playing staff. We know no details, yet were asked for a statement. One was given in good faith saying for us the priority is LFC staff being paid 100% of their regular wage.<br /><br />During this crisis, many workers have lost or will lose their livelihoods. When it began, SOS contacted LFC to seek assurances that all non-playing staff would be guaranteed to receive 100% wages. We were told this would happen and we made a statement. This was and continues to be our priority.<br /><br />Many of our members and the committee have raised concerns that the club intend to use taxpayers’ money to pay staff. We can all agree this is wrong, but again for SOS the prerogative is protecting jobs. It is the club who make the decision on how to pay their staff and they are the ones who need to answer why, if they decide to furlough.<br /><br />Our belief is that no million-pound plus profit-making organisation should be relying on taxpayer subsidies in times of crisis, yet football as a money-making industry has been singled out. It is an easy target for the authorities. We are contacting the club now and asking them to explain their position and reasoning. We will report back as soon as we hear back<br /><br />SOS have been working tirelessly in our communities over the past couple of weeks delivering food bags to those most in need and being here for people. Where were the journalists then looking for quotes?</p>

  <p><b>[A joint statement issued by <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool FC</a>, Merseyside Police, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> City Council and Spirit of Shankly]</b> During the evening the over-exuberance of some of those in attendance, who were setting off flares and fireworks, resulted in a small fire on a balcony of the Liver Building which had to be put out by Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service<br /><br />We cannot stress enough that behaviour such as this is wholly unacceptable and those who were setting off fireworks and flares in the crowd were putting the safety of those around them at risk<br /><br />Clearly we are still in a public health crisis and we need to work together with the public of Merseyside to prevent the potential spread of COVID-19<br /><br />The potential danger of a second peak still exists and we need to work together to make sure we don’t undo everything we have achieved as a region during lockdown<br /><br />The government has made it clear this week that if people continue to ignore guidelines around mass gatherings, whether they be at beaches or beauty spots, or for celebrations like we saw last night and the night before in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, then they have the ability to close down public spaces and will close areas if necessary<br /><br />We all understand that fans want to celebrate, but now is not the time. We need to get through this first, and know that it is safe, before any victory parade can go ahead</p>
