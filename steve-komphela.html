  <p><b>[Kaizer Chiefs head coach Steve Komphela admitted that Ajax Cape Town gave a good account of themselves in the two teams’ 1-1 at the Athlone Stadium]</b> I think one has to compliment Ajax - they played a good game there was a good energy in the match.<br /><br />Possession-wise we were still okay, but clearly whenever you are consistently on the ball, the next logical step is to suffer a counter-attack. So, all that we needed to control was whilst in possession be alert about the next action that might hurt you, which is how they came to hurt us and I think we failed to deal with the cross. As soon as they cross, you know their strength is always in the air with Nathan Paulse<br /><br />From a game’s point of view, I thought it was a good advert of football, nice intensity, good energy and both sets of players played a good game and the excitement as well that you got from the left midfield and the right-back… Rheece Evans going up against Tight <b>[Joseph Molangoane]</b>, it was quite exciting and I thought we could get more of that and finally get the breakthrough and the glancing header from - was it Cardoso?… I think it was great comeback<br /><br />It would not have been nice for them to have lost the game at the back of the performance they gave. A draw… you don’t want to draw matches at this stage of the season, but we will take it. Performance-wise, we are happy with ourselves</p>

  <p><b>[Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela has lamented the unpredictability of the league]</b> Well if you look at the log, nobody gets free points. It’s very tight and I don’t know how far it will go. Are we going to get to a 60-point mark, which is more of your usual mark or will we get to 53 or 54 like the rest of the other seasons?</p>

  <p><b>[Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela is not concerned with the prospect of losing Brilliant Khuzwayo]</b> Great keeper. Brilliant is with us. There’s a lot of talks that goes on and honestly speaking the same happened with Tight <b>[Joseph Moloangane]</b> and it has always happened.<br /><br />Nothing different with Brilliant but you as coach working for this institution you just have to keep focus. The player is still with us and he is training and playing with us. If anything happens to Khune, Brilliant is ready and we still have <b>[Bruce]</b> Bvuma. So people will always bring this</p>

  <p><b>[Kaizer Chiefs head coach Steve Komphela has lamented the timing of the Christmas break following his side’s win over Ajax Cape Town]</b> We hope we’ll keep up the momentum, but we now have to go off for a minor recess and be back for the game against SuperSport. It feels more like an international break where you are just about to get your momentum and then there is a stoppage.<br /><br />We’ll have to come back again and try fight and get into SuperSport with the energy we showed against Ajax. It’s going to be very difficult<br /><br />In the first half we made quite a number of entries, but there was nothing to show <b>[in terms of goals]</b>. In the second half‚ I thought we should have made our lives a bit easier <b>[by breaking the deadlock]</b> earlier, but that’s the name of the game<br /><br /><b>[Komphela admitted Dumisani Zuma scored a beauty of a goal]</b> It was a beautiful goal. At times it looked like structurally we were not well co-ordinated, but we are delighted with the victory</p>
