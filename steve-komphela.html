<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Kaizer Chiefs head coach Steve Komphela admitted that Ajax Cape Town gave a good account of themselves in the two teams’ 1-1 at the Athlone Stadium]</b> I think one has to compliment Ajax - they played a good game there was a good energy in the match.<br /><br />Possession-wise we were still okay, but clearly whenever you are consistently on the ball, the next logical step is to suffer a counter-attack. So, all that we needed to control was whilst in possession be alert about the next action that might hurt you, which is how they came to hurt us and I think we failed to deal with the cross. As soon as they cross, you know their strength is always in the air with Nathan Paulse<br /><br />From a game’s point of view, I thought it was a good advert of football, nice intensity, good energy and both sets of players played a good game and the excitement as well that you got from the left midfield and the right-back… Rheece Evans going up against Tight <b>[Joseph Molangoane]</b>, it was quite exciting and I thought we could get more of that and finally get the breakthrough and the glancing header from - was it Cardoso?… I think it was great comeback<br /><br />It would not have been nice for them to have lost the game at the back of the performance they gave. A draw… you don’t want to draw matches at this stage of the season, but we will take it. Performance-wise, we are happy with ourselves</p>
