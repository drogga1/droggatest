  <p><b>[Japan international Takashi Inui set to travel to Germany to complete <a href="bochum-fc.html">Bochum</a> deal]</b> Both parties are much closer now. I’m optimistic that we’ll find an agreement. He is in the middle of the season and fit. Inui is an agile, technically excellent and strong-running player</p>

  <p><b>[Hamburg confirm Halilovic has asked to leave to the club]</b> Alen wants to play a lot more and he asked us for a change. A loan is feasible. Winter transfers are the most difficult. Everyone is looking for a fully integrated player who is 100 per cent fit, speaks German as well as possible and has played every game in the first half of the season</p>
