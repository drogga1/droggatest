<blockquote>
  <p>[Tuca Ferretti won’t show it, but pressure is on for Tigres in Liga MX semifinal] I think he has some credit with the fans thanks to the favorable results he’s had lately - except for in Concacaf. He’s a coach I know really well and in big matches he transmits a certain calm, a certain peace, despite the pressure that exists,” the former defender said. “He doesn’t stop being demanding, that’s his personality, but even so he tries to make sure the atmosphere is calm so you don’t feel that pressure that does exist.<br /><br />There is pressure, without a doubt. He knows that well. He’s got a lot of experience and he’s a manager who has lived through the good and bad - even here at Tigres. He really knows how to manage the team in games like this from an emotional side. He can show his poker face for these types of games.<br /><br />He doesn’t show emotion, he looks relaxed, like it isn’t important, that he’s not worried. But obviously inside, not in front of the fans, it’s different. He’s a coach who is really detailed, who puts a lot of emphasis in how the opponent can hurt you and how you can hurt them. He’ll need to deploy all the weapons he has and use them at the right time to get past a Rayados side that got the better of him just a week ago. If Tigres don’t come away with the series win, that outward calm may fade away. It’ll be a brave person to question him on it - or remind him of the ever increasing pressure he’d be facing</p>
