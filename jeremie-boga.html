  <p><b>[Jeremie Boga says that he is mentally prepared to deal with it if he suffers racist abuse in Italian football]</b> I have played in Verona and, for me personally, there weren’t any chants or anything. Even in Italy, generally, I haven’t had it but my team-mates have. I am ready for it if it happens. I hope it doesn’t happen but, mentally, I have prepared for it. I heard some people were making racist chants against <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Balotelli</a>. It is something that has been happening pretty often in some of the stadiums. It is a bit sad but sometimes you need to continue and play through it. It is difficult because everyone has their own opinion and reaction. For me, because it happens often, we need to keep fighting against it. When you are on the pitch, you need to show a good reaction - try to score a goal - but these things shouldn’t be allowed in stadiums<br /><br /><b>[Boga is delighted to see <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s younger generation shining in the Premier League]</b> It is very flattering and nice for him to say that. The <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> development squad had a lot of talented players and he was one of them. For him to say that, I thank him for that. I still talk with some of the guys, mostly the ones I played with but I keep contact with them. We look at each other’s careers. I am really happy for all of them. I think all the youngsters who got the chance to play this season are top players and they have proven it this year again. I am happy for them and hopefully many more will get chances after them.<br /><br />In the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> academy, we have always had talented squads from the oldest guy to the younger guy there. To see them in the first team and starting is not a surprise. Hopefully they can keep doing well and keep making <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> proud. They are not lucky. The transfer ban has indeed come at a good time but I wouldn’t say it’s lucky because, if they were not talented, they wouldn’t be where they are now. It comes from the talent and hard work that they got the chance to play. We have had many young talents. It is true that maybe in my time there those young players weren’t getting so many chances but I think everything happens for a reason. I feel lucky to come from the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> academy. For me, it is probably the best in the world. Since I was there, we won practically every trophy from <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Youth Cup to the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Youth League. I think the development and facilities we had over there were amazing so I can’t complain</p>

  <p><b>[Jeremie Boga believes that <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a>’s return to <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> would see even more people switch over to watch Italian football after <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Commissioner <a href="don-garber.html">Don Garber</a> linked the striker with a move to <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>]</b> I think it would be great <b>[for Ibrahimovic to return to Serie A]</b>. It would bring even more eyes to <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>. It would take the competition level to a higher level. It is great to have all these great players here like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> and <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Balotelli</a>. If he comes, then I think it will be great for <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> and our football. It is already great for <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> to have <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and to see him in Italy. He is one of the best players in the world and football history. To see him playing football here every week is a great thing and something I can learn from. Since I was young I have been watching him at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. He has inspired a lot of young kids<br /><br /><b>[Fellow Ivory Coast international <a href="nicolas-pepe.html">Nicolas Pepe</a> made a switch to the English top tier in the summer with Arsenal]</b> I think it was a brilliant move for him. He had a great season last season and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is really suited to his style of play. They trust young players and play good football. It was a good transfer but, indeed, the beginning wasn’t so easy for him. It’s normal when you change league. A lot of things have changed for him so now it’s just about taking time to adapt. He’s a great player. When he shows it everybody will be happy with him<br /><br /><b>[A recent run of two goals and an assist in three games illustreated that Boga is beginning to deliver on the promise that he showed in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s academy]</b> During the last year and a half I haven’t been called back to the national team. It has been a big disappointment. I have been continuing to work hard in my club to show that I can get more games, goals and assists to make sure they can keep an eye on me and hopefully I’ll get the call up soon</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Chelsea talent Jeremie Boga insists he can reach <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>’s level]</b> <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a> is definitely stronger than me, but not in my head, because I know my talent and I know that over time I can reach that level. I watch many videos of <b>[Lionel]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, <b>[Hatem]</b> <a href="hatem-ben-arfa.html">Ben Arfa</a> and <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>. Now I like <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, too, but I always watch the first three<br /><br />I tried to overcome him with the ‘scavetto’, but the ball didn’t go too high. Let’s just say that the trick could have been better. Dribbling and playing one against one… it has always been like that since I was a child<br /><br />My first thought, after doing the one-two with Ciccio (Francesco Caputo), was to pull hard on his right. Then, I don’t know what exactly happened in my head, but I changed my mind at the last moment and I decided to chip it. I don’t look at who I have in front of me, though, even if he is the strongest goalkeeper in the world. If I have the possibility to make such a goal, I try.</p>

  <p><b>[Jeremie Boga has hinted that he could return to Chelsea]</b> When I was there, it was <a href="willian.html">Willian</a>, <b>[Eden]</b> <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>, <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a>. When <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> was there, it was <b>[Mohamed]</b> Salah. There were a lot of good wingers. For me, it has always been if I can’t play, then I will try to go on loan or try to go somewhere to improve, then maybe come back one day<br /><br /><b>[Boga believes he has taken the right career path, with Sassuolo proving to be a productive breeding ground]</b> It’s a top club for young players who want to have game time or have a team where they can come and impress and then go to a bigger team. Sassuolo is the perfect club for them<br /><br /><b>[on being a forward that likes to get at defenders]</b> That’s my style but over the years, I think I’ve improved. Before, I used to force it. If there were three players, I’d still try and do something. Now, if there are three players, I’ll look for a one-two or a pass. But every time there’s a one-against-one for me, an opportunity to go past a player, then I take it</p>

  <p><b>[Jeremie Boga has stated he remains committed to Sassuolo despite the transfer interest surrounding him]</b> I am considering it at Sassuolo because I had discussions with the coach <b>[De Zerbi]</b>. We will see what will happen. For now, I’m in Sassuolo. I’m aware. Even if I try to ignore it, I still hear rumours. I always see people talking. It’s nice but I’m still far from where I want to be. I want to keep my head on my shoulders and keep working to reach my goals. I have seen many names of big Italian clubs, yes. That’s flattering. When I hear clubs like Roma, <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, Milan, Inter, <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, it’s always a pleasure. For now, I’m in Sassuolo and I’m concentrating on finishing the season very well. I want to reach my goals and we will see what will happen next year<br /><br />It’s a kid’s dream to compete in the Champions League or the Europa League, all these great European competitions. I keep it in the back of my mind and it’s a goal for the future. I would say Spain and Italy because it plays a lot forward. Even if we say that the Italian championship is closed, it is growing more and more with a lot of teams trying to create games. This is where I flourished the most<br /><br /><b>[Boga’s career started at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> but he was unable to break into the first team]</b> Disappointed, not really. Maybe it was not my time. Regarding my buyout clause, I, personally, did not have any contact, I was told nothing. I just saw, like everyone on the networks. I don’t think about it too much, I’m just focused on Sassuolo. Contacts with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>? No, I just saw on the internet that Sassuolo had bought the clause but whether it was Sassuolo or <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, nobody told me about it.<br /><br /><b>[Boga was born in Marseille and played for France at youth level but decided to represent Ivory Coast]</b> I played for the French U16, U17 and U19, then a qualifying match for the African Cup of Nations with Cote d’Ivoire. I am French but my origins are Ivory Coast. It has always been a choice of the heart. I only made a selection. There, I spoke with the new coach <b>[Patrice Beaumelle]</b>, we will see how it will go and I hope to make my return very soon</p>

  <p><b>[Jeremie Boga has no regrets over <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> exit after career best season with Sassuolo]</b> I am ready for a new chapter. I have no regrets, as I made the right decision in leaving <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I think that was the best choice I could’ve made in the circumstances. Nothing is definitive yet. I spoke to coach Roberto De Zerbi to have a better understanding of the situation. I am ready for a new challenge, whether it is in Italy or abroad, but I could remain at Sassuolo too. I think <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> football is suited to me and I am having the best season of my career so far</p>
