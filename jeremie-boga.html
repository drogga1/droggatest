  <p><b>[Chelsea have confirmed that Jeremie Boga has joined Birmingham City on loan until the end of the season]</b> Jeremie Boga has today signed a new three-year contract with Chelsea and will now join Birmingham City on loan for the rest of the 2017-18 season. The 20-year-old midfielder made his Chelsea debut on the opening day of the Premier League season after impressing during our pre-season tour of Asia, and making his international debut for Ivory Coast earlier this summer. The talented and tricky Boga has helped us to win the Under-21 Premier League, the FA Youth Cup and UEFA Youth League, and has previously enjoyed loan spells in France and Spain</p>

  <p><b>[Just 18 minutes into his Chelsea debut in August, Jeremie Boga was hauled off in a tactical change following Gary Cahill’s dismissal against Burnley]</b> Yes, it was very surprising for everyone including me to start that game. In pre-season, I went with the first team and for me it was just to add numbers. But I said to myself, ‘I will train hard and you never know, I might get that opportunity’.<br /><br />In the Arsenal game <b>[in China]</b> that is what happened because <b>[Pedro]</b> got injured. It was unlucky for him, but it was an opportunity for me. I went in and after that I got more game time. Then when we came back to England I was training well, because I knew there was a player out with a red card so it was an opportunity to take. Luckily, I got my 15 minutes. I think on the day and the day after, I was really sad. I think that is a normal feeling because, for me, I was waiting for that chance for a long time. After that, I got back up and trained as hard again because I couldn’t keep staying down about it. You have to make sure when the next opportunity comes that you are ready. Everyone knows how hard it is to play for Chelsea, so for me, whether it was just one minute or two minutes, I don’t care. It was really a proud moment for me and my family. I now look back on it with pride, yes.<br /><br />I played in all different positions. With Redknapp, at the beginning, everyone was happy because I was playing as a number 10. I was high up the pitch and working in a second striker position, where I played throughout my Chelsea youth. So for me, that was important. I can also play on the wing and did that a lot this season. I can also play as a striker. I have learned to play as a striker. I think it helped me survive, especially this season, because if I could only play as a number 10 then I think I wouldn’t have lasted long in this team with their problems<br /><br />For me, I have done some good things in my career, but for the talent that I think I have I don’t think I have done enough. I think I need to go much higher, I want to keep working to reach my goals at my national team and clubs I play for. I have a lot more work to do.<br /><br />The best feeling was one against Hull City because I played against Ola Aina. We did everything together ever since I came to Chelsea. From the Under-16s we grew up together, but it wasn’t such a fun experience because we lost 6-1. However, it is nice to see how well he is doing and to exchange shirts, it was a proud moment for us. I think Ola can be a top player in his position. The same goes for Charly Musonda and Ruben Loftus-Cheek. I hope Loftus-Cheek gets his chance soon and Musonda is a talent<br /><br /><b>[Boga has now worked under Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte]</b> There is not a lot of differences because they are both top managers at the top of their game. Mourinho was very good as well with me also. He gave me a lot of confidence. I did pre-season with him as well and he was always talking to me. I think they both are good coaches and are really focused on what they do. They notice every detail and don’t let anything get past them</p>

  <p><b>[Jeremie Boga has been farmed out by Chelsea three times already]</b> I was always in contact with them every two months, but sometimes at random. I think that they were a bit concerned at one moment with my game time around December but I started playing again so I just kept in contact. They gave me feedback on how I play in every game, so they kept a close eye on me.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Chelsea youngster Jeremie Boga has little doubt Callum Hudson-Odoi has a bright future]</b> I think it isn’t an easy decision for Callum, but everyone has their own opinion. I think you see him now exposed to the national team, then maybe that will help him get playing time at Chelsea. If not, I think there will be a lot of clubs wanting to buy him in the summer. I think no one should worry about his future. I met him during pre-season with Chelsea and saw videos of him before he broke through. I thought he was a top talent straight away. He is getting the opportunity he deserves, and maybe he could get more. I would tell him to keep working hard and to wait for his chance. Keep playing as he does. I remember it was a long time ago when I first saw him. I saw him when I went to watch the Under-12s play. He looked older than everyone else, he was doing tricks, step-overs and we were all saying then that this guy will be a top player in the future. That’s one of the things I remember<br /><br /><b>[Boga is looking to make a name for himself at Sassuolo]</b> Yes, of course, it was the perfect time to leave Chelsea. Not because I wasn’t happy or things like this but I needed to progress in my career. It was the right timing, and I found the perfect project for that. I am happy that I left right now. For me, three loans were enough. I wouldn’t say it is bad to go on loan, but it is different when you actually sign for a club. When you go on a loan, you are maybe not fully part of the project. When you sign for a new club then it is entirely different, I feel like more part of the team and part of the project. Everyone is looking after me. Not like I am going to leave in the next year, but I am here for the whole time I have signed on. That’s the best part for me so far. I think my first aim for the future is just to complete a full year with Sassuolo because unfortunately this year I haven’t been able to do that. I want to complete a full season with Sassuolo while being more decisive. That’s more goals and assists. After that, you never know what can happen, but for me, my next goal is to complete a full season here. I chose Sassuolo because of the coach. We spoke many, many times before I came and I researched him. He is a coach who plays good, attacking football, which is my style of play. Now I am here, I am not disappointed. For me, he is the perfect coach to see me develop my game and to progress. I don’t know if I have done that since becoming a professional footballer. For me, it is progress. I now need to keep going and ensure I play more and more. It’s my goal to one day get back to a top club. That’s why I left Chelsea because I thought I would then develop more as a player and not always be on the club’s books. To do my own thing, be given a project. I found this club, and I aim to really push on and show people what I can do to reach my full potential which I haven’t yet done<br /><br />This is the best level that I have played at, and it is great to start five games in a row. It has been very good. In Italy, there’s a lot of top teams who play very well. Juventus, everyone knows. Napoli, Inter Milan and As Roma have been excellent games. It has been a very good learning curve for me to play against those teams. Teams like Napoli play good football, so it has been good to learn against a team like that. The best player I have seen on the pitch was Cristiano Ronaldo, of course. Everyone knows that but also Douglas Costa impressed me, the way he dribbles and his acceleration. I feel like I am a similar player, so I admire what he does</p>

  <p><b>[Jeremie Boga is confident his friend and fellow Ivory Coast international Nicolas Pepe will be leaving Lille]</b> Of course, with the season that he has had this year then I think next year that he will definitely go to a top club. He needs to make sure he makes the right decision on which one, but I am sure that next year he will be an attacker for a top, top club. I know him very well. He is a very good guy. He is technical, fast and clinical. You can see this year that he has been scoring a lot of goals and having a fantastic season. I am really happy for him.<br /><br />It is a lot of young talented players, and we have a great future. We need to keep playing as a team and fighting as a team. I think that the results will come. That’s my goal. I want to do everything I can to be in this squad. We are a big nation with a lot of known and world-class players, so I think winning it should be the goal of all our players. It is true that I am a bit disappointed that I was not in the Ivory Coast squad <b>[for the March internationals]</b>, but I wasn’t expecting too much because I have been injured and only started the last five games. I will keep working hard and make sure to do my best to be in the squad by the time of the African Cup of Nations</p>

  <p><b>[Jeremie Boga says that he is mentally prepared to deal with it if he suffers racist abuse in Italian football]</b> I have played in Verona and, for me personally, there weren’t any chants or anything. Even in Italy, generally, I haven’t had it but my team-mates have. I am ready for it if it happens. I hope it doesn’t happen but, mentally, I have prepared for it. I heard some people were making racist chants against <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Balotelli</a>. It is something that has been happening pretty often in some of the stadiums. It is a bit sad but sometimes you need to continue and play through it. It is difficult because everyone has their own opinion and reaction. For me, because it happens often, we need to keep fighting against it. When you are on the pitch, you need to show a good reaction - try to score a goal - but these things shouldn’t be allowed in stadiums<br /><br /><b>[Boga is delighted to see <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s younger generation shining in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> It is very flattering and nice for him to say that. The <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> development squad had a lot of talented players and he was one of them. For him to say that, I thank him for that. I still talk with some of the guys, mostly the ones I played with but I keep contact with them. We look at each other’s careers. I am really happy for all of them. I think all the youngsters who got the chance to play this season are top players and they have proven it this year again. I am happy for them and hopefully many more will get chances after them.<br /><br />In the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> academy, we have always had talented squads from the oldest guy to the younger guy there. To see them in the first team and starting is not a surprise. Hopefully they can keep doing well and keep making <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> proud. They are not lucky. The transfer ban has indeed come at a good time but I wouldn’t say it’s lucky because, if they were not talented, they wouldn’t be where they are now. It comes from the talent and hard work that they got the chance to play. We have had many young talents. It is true that maybe in my time there those young players weren’t getting so many chances but I think everything happens for a reason. I feel lucky to come from the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> academy. For me, it is probably the best in the world. Since I was there, we won practically every trophy from <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Youth Cup to the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Youth League. I think the development and facilities we had over there were amazing so I can’t complain</p>

Then, I don’t know what exactly happened in my head, but I changed my mind at the last moment and I decided to chip it. I don’t look at who I have in front of me, though, even if he is the strongest goalkeeper in the world. If I have the possibility to make such a goal, I try.</p>

I want to keep my head on my shoulders and keep working to reach my goals. I have seen many names of big Italian clubs, yes. That’s flattering.
