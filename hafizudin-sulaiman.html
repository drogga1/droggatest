<blockquote>
  <p><b>[UKM skipper and trainee teacher Hafizudin Sulaiman considering unpaid leave to turn professional]</b> Both sides played cautiously in the full 90 minutes, but for UKM it was because we did not want to let in an away goal. We had to play safe and that meant our tactics did not work. It’s better for us to play defensively than to go on the attack. And when we were down to 10 men in the extra-time <b>[due to injury and lack of available substitution]</b>, I told my teammates to move as a unit. Praise Allah, we got the goal later.<br /><br />My nine-month sacrifice from the beginning of the season, having to commute for about two hours daily, has finally paid dividends. The promotion and final spots are what we’ve always wanted. Playing at the higher level is what I’ve always dreamt of. I will definitely consider taking an unpaid leave from teaching, in order to fulfill that dream.</p>
