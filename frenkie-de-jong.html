With my intuition, it is not just that I receive the ball and always think ‘I’m going to do this’ straight away, even though it just happens that way sometimes.<br /><br />Most good players play on intuition. Everyone has a little but I don’t know if you can learn it. Sometimes I’m planning. I’m always searching for the pass. I’m always looking to see my team-mate. ‘Is he free?’ Then you already know what to do. But sometimes the situation can change. Then you have to react and use your intuition.

With daring and conviction. Nothing has been decided yet. Real will also feel more pressure in front of its own audience. As a team we did well. It’s a shame that our goal was disallowed. Maybe something like that falls easily in favour of the big club, we’ve also had that. But we continued well and also had our chances afterwards. Pity that it didn’t yield a better result<br /><br />It was certainly nice to play against Luka Modric. That motivates extra of course.

In my opinion, he is the greatest player ever. It’s difficult to define him. I think he is the most complete player. He can do everything with the ball and without, he creates a lot of chances, his left foot is amazing and he’s so smart, just from another level.<br /><br />I always dreamed of Barca as a kid. I just wanted to play for Barca. I liked the players, I liked the style. I think Barca is a bit of my dream club. My dream is to become an important player for Barcelona, I hope I can become a starter, and to win a lot of trophies with Barcelona. Those are my goals at the moment<br /><br />I think the level of the competition is really, really high. Most people say the Premier League is the strongest league, but I’m doubting it.

It is amazing to beat Real Madrid with these numbers, especially at Bernabeu. People might have expected something from us, but not in this fantastic manner. In the first game it wasn’t much worse than this, but back then we were unlucky with the score. Now, everything worked out perfectly for us<br /><br />Each opponent will be tough. We’ll be the underdogs, but that’s nothing new. We’re happy to march on, very, very happy<br /><br />I played a decent game, but in the end the game almost got tricky again because of me.

I felt I should stay for another year at Ajax, or perhaps longer. I see Tottenham as a very stable club, and they are only getting better.

I enjoyed everything: the cup run, this Eredivisie season and the Champions League of course. But what I enjoyed the most, is this team feeling that we have. We are just a couple of friends and we play football together as if we’re playing in the schoolyard. That’s amazing to see. We’ve been everywhere together: Lisbon, London, everywhere. And everywhere you’re stuck with each other and you create a bond. This is such an incredible team. At the start of the season, the first thing we wanted was to win the league title. The rest would be a bonus. Of course it’s a shame how we were knocked out by Tottenham Hotspur, but right now the feeling of pride is dominant. We reached the Champions League semi-finals and we won the double, so we can say it was a very good season</p>

There’s no better level<br /><br /><b>[Frenkie de Jong does have a number of superstar role models around him]</b> It’s difficult to pick one… but when I arrived, <b>[Sergio]</b> <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Busquets</a> helped me with many things. I could say he took care of me in a certain sense: for example, the first day I arrived in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> before training even started, he sent me a message to ask if I needed anything and he reserved a table in a restaurant for me and my girlfriend. He behaved really well with me. If I had to pick one, I would say <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Busquets</a>, even though everyone has helped me a lot<br /><br /><b>[Asked to rate his efforts so far out of 10]</b> Six. For now, six or a six-and-a-half. I have played a lot of minutes and I’ve more or less played well, I am happy, but I know my performances could be much better</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s use of Frenkie De Jong questioned by Netherlands boss <a href="ronald-koeman.html">Koeman</a>]</b> It’s important that he’s playing games, even if they might not be in his preferred position. With the national team, he players deeper but we play with two holding midfielders and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> only play with one and two central midfielders, or sometimes with four central midfielders. The position he is playing now is different to the national team and <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. He’s learning to play further forward like this, it’s not all bad, but it’s not his best position. For me, I think he performs better playing deeper<br /><br />I don’t regret having signed for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, not for one second. I am really happy because I always wanted to play here. I am playing with players who for me are genuine legends. I am enjoying myself and I am learning a lot, too. I am at the best club in the world. living in a wonderful city with great weather. I always wanted to play for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. I don’t know what will happen in the future, but I am happy here and there’s no step forward from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. There’s no better level</p>

  <p><b>[Frenkie de Jong has revealed it was <a href="ernesto-valverde.html">Ernesto Valverde</a>’s sacking in January that drilled home to him how high the standards are set at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> Especially at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. It’s a bit of the same as in Ajax: you have to play good and you have to win everything. When one of the two is not there, it’s already difficult for the team and the coach, so the pressure is really high here. They are demanding the best football in the world and they want to win every prize, but I like this idea a lot<br /><br />Yes, of course, because when a coach is sacked that’s always about the way the team is playing and they are holding the coach responsible for it. But of course you’re feeling guilty because the players have to show it on the field. We were not doing terrible because we were first in the table when he left<br /><br /><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s players agreed a 70 per cent pay cut in March to help the club through the coronavirus period]</b> I think we already made an agreement for some months with the club, as everybody knows, and I think - I don’t know - the club and some players are negotiating now. I’m not one of them. I’m not the talker from the group or something, or I’m not one of the captains, so I think they are speaking and we will see how it turns out.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are days away from returning to action]</b> From the moment we could start training again, everyone was desperate to compete again and be with each other again. It’s really good at the moment</p>

  <p><b>[Frenkie de Jong has revealed he is taking tactical advice from <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> as he continues to settle into life at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> In <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and the Dutch squad I’ve had a different role but we’re playing with a double six <b>[two defensive midfielders]</b>. I have to adapt and it’s going OK, but I can improve. I’m at my best when I’m not the most defensive but also not the most attacking <b>[midfielder]</b>. If <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> is talking and giving you advice you take it as he is by far the best player in the world. If he gives advice, you listen. Sometimes he says you have to be deeper or to the side, small things but it makes the difference<br /><br />It was my dream to play for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. They were my favourite club outside of the Netherlands. When they came and showed they were really interested they made the choice easier. At the beginning I didn’t have the feeling <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> really wanted me. But they said you have a good chance of being a starter and it was really easy for me. <b>[<a href="josep-maria-bartomeu.html">Bartomeu</a>]</b> talked about the other clubs and <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> and said when he was at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> he was amazing. He said <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> was the greatest manager but told me: ‘If you want to enjoy your life, you want to play in Barcelona’. Sometimes when I’m driving to the training ground you see the weather and there are these moments when you think: ‘I always wanted this as a kid’. It’s a dream, I’m really happy<br /><br /><b>[The midfielder admits life is different post-lockdown]</b> I didn’t have the virus but life isn’t how it used to be. I don’t think it’s changed me as a person. I’ve spent a lot of time with my girlfriend, we were in Holland and we could go out - the situation was a bit more comfortable than in Spain. When we were training in separate groups we had to wait before the others left, I couldn’t say ‘hi’ to them, that was really strange. Training is intense and maybe we’re better than when we stopped. I’m feeling there is something special coming</p>
