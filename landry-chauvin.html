<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Yann M’Vila may not have fully delivered on his promise since leaving Rennes in 2013, but 22 France caps are testament to the high ceiling many deemed him to have when he first broke into the first team at Roazhon Park]</b> Yann had a purer game than Eduardo Camavinga. But Eduardo can do a lot more work. He is able to score six to eight goals per season, and it will not be long until he does. But what will allow him to move forward especially is his personality. When you meet him in the street, he is discreet. He is as natural in life as he is on the field, and it will be his great strength. He is a respectful guy, always, who respects the housekeeper of the training centre as much as the coach of the first team. He has a good head on his shoulders and will not change</p>
