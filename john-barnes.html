  <p><b>[Quote on Frank Rijkaard]</b> He’s perhaps best known in retrospect for his time as a midfielder, but he started off his career as a centre-back - and that background made him a very tough holding midfielder. Frank was very strong on the ball. At 6ft 3in he was extremely powerful in the air, but he was also pretty quick and could place pinpoint passes - hence his later deployment in midfield. He could play as part of the zonal system or one-on-one equally effectively. He’d be well suited to the modern game</p>

  <p><b>[John Barnes says Critics of Jurgen Klopp and <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> over lack of silverware branded ‘stupid people’]</b> Well, they are being criticised by stupid people because why should Tottenham win the league? When it comes to silverware, you can’t ask a manager to win an FA Cup when you don’t know who you’re going to play. Let’s say with <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>, to win <a href="fa.html">the FA Cup</a>, in the third round he plays Manchester City away, do you expect him to win that? No, but he can win it. And then in the fourth round he plays Liverpool away and then in the fifth round he plays Chelsea away. What are the chances of winning all of those matches? So to then say ‘we should win silverware’ - it’s ridiculous. The only team you know you’re going to play is in the Premier League and then should they win the league because they’re Tottenham? No. Winning silverware, it’s nice and okay, but doing well and getting as far as you can in the league is the most important thing because it shows you the consistency you have, the team that you actually are.<br /><br />Who would have expected Tottenham to get to a Champions League final? Would you then say Tottenham have finished fourth and are in a Champions League final, <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> has now failed? Which manager could come to Tottenham and make Tottenham win the Premier League and the Champions League? There’s no manager alive at the moment who you’d expect to do that with Tottenham. So, why then say <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> has failed? It’s the same with Klopp. Liverpool shouldn’t finish second in the league, they should be fourth.<br /><br />They shouldn’t beat Barcelona 4-0 to get to the final, but they did. Maybe if you’re at Man City, you can be criticised for not winning anything or even Manchester United because they have a bigger squad and have spent more money. But to then say Klopp or <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> have failed because they have not won silverware - that’s ridiculous</p>

My flight from Santorini got cancelled, so I then had to fly from Santorini to Athens, from Athens to Barcelona. Got to Barcelona 2am in the morning, my train, I had to get a train to Madrid, it was not until 5am, the train station is not open till 4am, from 2am until 4am I was lying on the floor outside the train station with a lot of homeless people before the train station opened. That’s how committed I was to getting here.<br /><br /><b>[Barnes says he was determined to get through his arduous journey to see Jurgen Klopp’s team in action]</b> I am not going to mention any names, about other divas who played for Liverpool, my former teammates who would have wanted to be in a five star hotel.

I am not going to say who wouldn’t have done it… Ian Rush… But apart from that, that is my commitment to the cause</p>

  <p><b>[John Barnes says Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk deserves to win the 2019 Ballon d’Or ahead of Lionel Messi]</b> Very possibly. Normally when you look at the Ballon d’Or winners, they’re either attacking midfield players or centre-forwards. They are goalscorers and eye-catching players. But there haven’t been any of those types of players who have really set the world alight this season. So from a point of consistency and from a point of success, for me, Van Dijk would have to be the man</p>

  <p><b>[John Barnes believes the World Cup winner Nabil Fekir is a luxury that the Reds do not need]</b> Yes, he’d be a good addition to the squad. But, it’s going to be difficult to get into the front three. If you look at the way Xherdan Shaqiri played, he could feature as one of the midfield three as well. It’s always good to have quality to help the squad. But it’s pure speculation until it happens. I don’t necessarily feel that Liverpool are desperate to sign anybody because of the squad they have and with two new players coming back in terms of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joe Gomez, who didn’t feature last year. We’ve still got Adam Lallana. It could be good for the squad but I don’t think we’re desperate to sign anybody</p>

  <p><b>[John Barnes says Dejan Lovren leaving Liverpool comfort zone would be understandable]</b> With Joe Gomez coming back, if Lovren feels that he’s not going to be playing anymore and he wants to play first-team football, fine. I quite like him at Liverpool because, of course, if players get injured, he can step in and do a good job. But players sometimes think to themselves that they want to play first-team football so therefore if he leaves, I’ll have every respect for him, rather than him just staying at Liverpool in the comfort zone. Maybe it is time for him to move on if that’s what he decides.</p>

  <p><b>[John Barnes says Liverpool have no need to go and sign a player for £100 million this summer]</b> actually feel the opposite. I’m looking for something exciting but not necessarily anything new. Last season we needed players like Virgil van Dijk and Alisson to come into the team to be the main pieces in the squad and maximise the potential we had. This year, I don’t think there are any players who will be coming in to take the place of Mohamed Salah, <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, Roberto Firmino, or Virgil Van Dijk, so instead what we need to do is supplement the squad. I don’t think we’re going to go out and get a player for £100m to go straight into the team, but we don’t need that<br /><br />But there are players out there who can improve the next nine or 10 players after that, which is a relatively easier thing to do. Our current rivals, even City included, currently need a few players to improve the first XI and there aren’t that many players out there like that. We don’t need that and we’re just looking for players to improve the squad</p>

  <p><b>[John Barnes says Jurgen Klopp does not need to sign a replacement for the recently-departed Daniel Sturridge]</b> Daniel Sturridge didn’t play much last year and we finished second in the league and won the Champions League. So, do we need to replace him? We have Origi, who did well when he came on. He’s not the top scorer and first player on the team sheet so doesn’t need replacing. Had we lost Salah, Mane or Firmino and not replaced them, then you could say that it is an issue. He was a good player for Liverpool but I think he lost his way in the last couple of years, with his fitness as well. He has to find a home and get motivated for his own career and play. It’s a shame but we haven’t seen a fit Daniel Sturridge for a few years<br /><br /><b>[When asked where Sturridge could end up plying his trade next]</b> Sturridge has to get fit and motivated, no matter what club he goes to. He could go to Real Madrid or Birmingham City, but he won’t play if he’s not fit and motivated. I don’t think it’s a club that is important, it’s how hungry he is and if he can get motivated. If Sturridge can earn money in the MLS and it’s a competitive league, and if he feels he can’t get a club here for whatever reason, then it’s a good move. The players there are fit and strong and competitive. It’s the same all over the world<br /><br /><b>[Barnes felt Salah and Firmino led from the front admirably as the Reds showed the same intensity which served them so well last term]</b> It just didn’t happen for Salah on Sunday. I don’t look at individual players, I look at how well the team is playing and the whole team, particularly in the second half, played really well. Before that game, the first team hadn’t been together. There was no Mane, Salah, Firmino whereas they just left off, for me, in terms of performance and energy, and as well as how they pressed high up the field, from where they were last season</p>

He does what he does and plays by himself, not in a team. He likes to dribble around five defenders. Therefore, he can’t go to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and Liverpool; he can’t go wandering all over the field. He plays whatever position he wants for Crystal Palace, and picks up the ball on the right and the left - that’s not fitting into a team.

  <p><b>[John Barnes says Virgil van Dijk needs to spend another 10 years at Liverpool before he can be considered a Premier League great]</b> If he gets transferred to Real Madrid next year, he’s not been here long enough to be a Premier League great. Don’t look down the line and say in 10 years I want to be a considered a great, he has to go through the process of being here for that period of time. Too many people say they want to be a legend, but you can only be that at the end of your career when looking back. You can’t look forward and want to be a legend, you look back and think ‘I was a legend’. I’m sure he doesn’t, but I’m talking about what people are talking about<br /><br /><b>[Barnes also insists that Van Dijk must prove himself all over again in the upcoming season]</b> Van Dijk had a fantastic season but it means nothing now. If he has a terrible season now, what is he? I’m sure he will be fine but he just needs to carry on and be consistent. He doesn’t need to improve on anything, just consistency as he’s not been around long enough to judge that consistency. How he can improve is to do the same again - because he has then improved his consistency, that’s the key to everything. He brings stability, he is calm, which helps the crowd and now he has to continue to perform<br /><br /><b>[Barnes feels Joe Gomez is the best choice to partner Van Dijk long-term]</b> I think long-term Joe Gomez will be van Dijk’s partner. I think that’s a good partnership but he does have a lot to learn. If you look at the centre back partners, we’ve got Joel Matip, we’ve got Dejan Lovren and we’ve got him (Gomez) alongside Van Dijk. Anybody can do a good job and if not, whoever comes in for him can do a good job</p>

  <p><b>[club legend John Barnes says Liverpool resisted the urge to spend over the summer because there is nobody out there who can come into the first team]</b> I don’t think there is anyone out there who can come into the first team. You could say you could get someone to supplement the squad. Just look at Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and even Tottenham, they needed signings to go into the first XI but we don’t. There is no one out there who is going to take the spots of the front three or the midfield three or the back four. Of course with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joe Gomez coming back in, who didn’t play last year, they are like two new signings. So I don’t think Liverpool needed to make signings this summer<br /><br />Liverpool can go one better but so can City and all teams. City are still favourites. But I don’t expect Liverpool just to lose one game this season and get the same points and I don’t expect City to get the same points as last time. If you look at United, Arsenal, Tottenham and Chelsea, they will be more consistent this year. I expect them <b>[City and Liverpool]</b> to be first and second but I don’t think they will run away with it as they did last season.</p>

If Jadon is going to fall out of love with football, let him give up football and let him go into the real world as a young black man without an education and without being able to play football, then he’ll see what it’s really like to be a black person who is racially abused. As much as footballers want to talk about how terrible it is for them, look at what’s happening in the black community of kids without an education and who haven’t got jobs. If he thinks that’s bad <b>[the abuse of footballers]</b>, let him go into the real world and see what real discrimination is about<br /><br /><b>[He believes the strength of the message from high-profile players could have a lasting effect on helping highlight issues within the community]</b> We’re now coming full circle, we’re trying to get something to change so lets get these black superstar footballers to tell us what we should do and tell us how terrible it is for them. What they should do is use their voice to talk about discrimination where it really hurts people in the inner cities with kids who can’t get jobs or opportunities. He’s signed a nice new contract, is he willing to give that contract up because he’s falling out of love with football? I don’t think he is. Let’s not get it blown out of proportion</p>

Jurgen won’t do that. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> should just try to win football matches.

You can’t go for the double because in the cup, you don’t know who you’re going to play, and you can also play really well and lose. You can play your strongest team, hit the post 20 times, the opposition can have one chance and win 1-0. You can lose the odd game in the league, but to win it, you have to be the best team. The league is where you show consistency, and it’s always the most important thing</p>

It’s obviously bigger than that, you are talking about promotion and relegation all the way down the divisions.

  <p><b>[Liverpool legend John Barnes says There is no summer transfer window anymore!]</b> There is no summer transfer window anymore, it’s an end of season window. If the season is still going on in November or March then the window will have to be then, whenever it starts and ends. Players who are out of contract at the end of the season so they will have to be extended until the end of the season, not July as usual - the question is whether clubs down the leagues can pay their players for that long? This will only be for one year, I’m sure in a year or two it will go back to normal. But you cannot hold people to conventional timings for the next year<br /><br />We have to get away from this idea that top-level footballers are going through a hard time. Footballers on the highest rungs haven’t got to worry about mortgages and bank balances. Compared to a self-employed painter and decorator, footballers are holding up just fine. But I see how players in the lower leagues will be worried about their mortgages. Football is not in a more unique position than anyone else in these troubled times. This is the precarious state of the world and all businesses.<br /><br />From a footballing perspective, maybe everyone can come together under <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> and <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> and <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> to alleviate the problem football clubs have. But unfortunately other sectors do not have that safety net, they will just have governments to rely on.<br /><br />I just hope the smaller clubs are still around in the next six months to a year to start again, because football will eventually kick-start - and we need every club to still be afloat when that happens as they are so important to people’s lives and wellbeing.<br /><br />I worry for lower league clubs, it’s grave for them. The Government need to help out all smaller businesses of which football clubs are some. You cannot kick them out of the equation and say they are football’s problem and rely on <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> as they may have a lot of money.

But we’re not in an ideal world and certainly, the players I’ve spoken to accept that if that is what it’s going to be, that’s what it will have to be<br /><br />I’ve been speaking to players - including two or three very high-profile <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players more or less on a daily basis - and the conversations I had with them at the outset were based around not wanting to play behind closed doors if at all possible. I said to them, ‘Look, none of us, in an ideal world, want to play in front of empty stadiums. Football is about fans.’ But the reality is that for the vast majority of the players, particularly at the highest level, their income is funded by television money and there are contracts that have to be adhered to. In order for us (the PFA) to be able to protect those players in terms of securing their salaries … if that’s the only offer we have on the table to complete the season, then that is what it will be.<br /><br />To be fair, most players very much took that on board when we spoke to them. The players get it. They understand the alternative. Quite frankly, if we’re going to get the season finished in a timely fashion so that we can even consider starting next season, we’ve got to be open to all options. If it means playing behind closed doors has to happen in order that contracts are protected, fixtures fulfilled and commercial deals honoured, then I think we’ve all got to come together and accept we’ve all got to make sacrifices to try and find a solution for the industry as a whole</p>

Of course, I don’t know if that is what may necessarily happen.

I don’t think they’re preparing for any of the front three to leave. If you can get a player of Werner’s quality to come in and one of the front three doesn’t leave, it’s fine, they have a stronger squad. I don’t think they’re going to lose any of the front three, but in modern football, you can never tell. If you get a chance to get a player who can fit into what you want, you should do it. I don’t think he’s going to cost hundreds of millions or his salary will be that high and it won’t be the case where he has to play every single game because he’s going to cost £100m and he’s being paid £300k a week. This is also what he’s <b>[Klopp]</b> looking for, players that will come and be happy to be there and not demand to play every week, they’re not superstars like a <b>[Cristiano]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> or a <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> star John Barnes says that his former club should not be awarded <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title unless the season is capped off with promotion and relegation]</b> Not if people aren’t going to be promoted and relegated, no.<br /><br />Obviously you’re talking about big money, lots of money, but that’s to play matches. We’re not talking about that. We’re talking about when players can start to train safely, socially distancing. We can do that immediately. The different question is when we can start to play again and, for me, you should take your time. No matter how long that takes. Either we say we’re never going to play again ever or we’re able to play, whether that’s a year, two years, whatever we decide, why can’t we then finish the nine games and then start the next season straight away? The players will have had three, four months, five months, six months off. There’s no need to have more time off, go straight into the next season with the teams that should be relegated and the teams that should be promoted.<br /><br />Football, school, life isn’t like Christmas. Christmas has to be December 25. New Years Day has to be January 1. School doesn’t have to be, football doesn’t have to be August until May. You can actually adjust, particularly at time like this where we have to, and it’s not making sacrifices, it’s just changing the time table. It’s what we have to do</p>

For example, 10 years ago, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> signed a load of players, but none of them made the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> side any stronger, and they weren’t good purchases for the long-term future of the club.

At the current stage that United are in, they aren’t in the position to make the quality of signings they want, because those players won’t want to go there. They need to focus more on the players that they currently have and work on improving them. They have some good players, with the likes of <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>, <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> and <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a>, but they need to make sure the harmony within the club and the team are right.

It comes as no surprise to me that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and Manchester city have been the two most successful clubs in England over the last two years, because the manager in both those clubs is truly the man in charge, the power doesn’t lie with the owners or the players.<br /><br />I think it’s not just about this season, the team cannot take their foot off the gas and rest on their laurels if they do manage to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.

  <p><b>[The myth of Maradona: Was ‘Hand of God’ goal integral to Diego’s legacy?]</b> In our era, footballers didn’t get the support they needed. So, you had lots of players like <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> back then who were considered a bit crazy. Now, though, I think that with the support and discipline inherent in the modern game, you don’t get players like that anymore. We all saw it. All of us on the bench - the players, the coaches, the manager - we all saw it clear as day. We all knew he’d handled the ball, so we just couldn’t believe the referee hadn’t seen it.<br /><br /><b>[Barnes maintains that <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>’s second goal was in no way influenced by his first]</b> We were all international footballers, we’d all been playing professional football for a long time, so we’d seen many injustices in league games where goals shouldn’t have been allowed for blatant offsides, fouls or whatever. So, for professional footballers to claim that they were stunned by the handball shocked me. To say that it had anything to do with the second goal is rubbish. I don’t believe that it affected us in that way at all. Yes, there was a feeling of injustice. But it didn’t affect the way we performed<br /><br /><b>[Barnes, though, holds no ill will towards Maradona]</b> I don’t blame <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>. I blame the referee and the officials for not seeing it. I don’t have anything against <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>. He was the best player in the world. And I was just watching everything he did. Of course, I was following the game and cheering us on. But I even watched him warm up.

So, that was something to see. Also, it’s not as if we’ve not seen other players handle the ball. We’ve all seen the likes of <a href="michael-owen.html">Michael Owen</a> and <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> try to get goals that way.

We know that money plays a big part in this, but we don’t know what is happening this summer because after Covid-19, I don’t think you’re necessarily going to see £100m and £50m signings. It’s up to the player to decide if he wants to stay in Scotland or not. If he is happy there and he’s in the Champions League and happy with his football then yes they may be able to keep him, but if he wants to go and play in a bigger league with more exposure then it is hard for any Scottish team to keep their better players<br /><br />Celtic have no more frustration than if you’re a top club in any league where you can’t compete financially with England, Italy, Spain, France and Germany. Celtic are slightly different in that they are as big as some clubs in England or the world, but the financial implications of football in Scotland means they can’t always keep these players and I suspect it will be a frustration. They’ll be understanding that they’re no different to other clubs that lose players, look at Belgium, one of the best teams in the world but you don’t see any players playing in Belgium. This has always been a factor of Scottish football, except maybe in the 70s and 80s because from a financial point of view they were able to compete, but now the financial differences between Scotland and England and the rest of the European nations means it is hard for the Scottish teams to compete in keeping their best players</p>

My brother-in-law is the biggest Evertonian you could meet, and he’s around my house every day talking about <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. <a href="donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> can be on the television, and it’ll somehow come back to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Hopefully, he’s not talking much on Sunday!</p>

You’re talking about a world-class player who demands to play every week and if he’s not going to play every week, is that going to upset the spirit in the camp? I don’t know if <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> was given assurances or he feels he can play for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> every week rather than coming here, but you’ve got to be careful and I know Jurgen doesn’t like to have a big squad and lots of superstars in the team. Keeping them happy can be quite problematic and we’ve seen every now and again, like the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> game when they didn’t have <b>[Roberto]</b> <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> or Salah and <b>[Divock]</b> <a href="divock-origi.html">Origi</a> can come in and did the job</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool have no need to bring in big signings during the next transfer window]</b> If <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were to make big signings but then suddenly, those signings cannot play, and they cannot get into the team because of Salah and <b>[Roberto]</b> <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>, it damages the harmony of the club. How does that big signing feel when he’s always on the bench? I don’t think they need to do it at all. And I don’t feel this was the reason <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> didn’t win the title this season<br /><br />Pep <b>[Guardiola]</b> and <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, the two most successful managers in world football, both feel like they don’t have to make big signings to compete. So, who are we to question that? They are successful every year.<br /><br />If you have players you can put in the squad like <b>[Takumi]</b> <a href="takumi-minamino.html">Minamino</a> and <b>[Divock]</b> <a href="divock-origi.html">Origi</a>, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> still have a large squad with people that can make an impact from the bench. It is not an issue to go and sign someone. I don’t see why there is a necessity to sign big. They are 23 points better off than everybody else <b>[…]</b> <a href="adam-lallana.html">Lallana</a> is on his way so maybe they will replace him, but I can’t see <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> making big signings. If they do there is pressure on their reaction, and the harmony they bring to the team.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool will not be breaking the bank for <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> defender <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Kalidou Koulibaly</a>, claims John Barnes, with the Reds not in the market for ‘a <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> or Lionel Messi’ which requires them to spend big]</b> <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Koulibaly</a> is a very good player and you’re looking at <a href="joe-gomez.html">Joe Gomez</a> coming through and he could help him, <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Koulibaly</a> is already the finished article so if they get him that would be a good signing for them. If they don’t get him, well they’re still 25 points better than any other team, so as long as they don’t lose players. I don’t think there’s necessarily a reason to go out and make big-name signings. Yes, they’ve signed <b>[Takumi]</b> <a href="takumi-minamino.html">Minamino</a> and they may be able to sign some players that aren’t going to go straight into the first team, but I don’t think they necessarily need that<br /><br />If <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> offer <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Koulibaly</a> twice the salary, then he’ll go to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. The whole idea that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are the champions and that means he’ll go to them, that’s not the case. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is an attractive proposition, as attractive as anybody else, whether they are more attractive than <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> I don’t think that’s necessarily true. What may happen is that his type of football may suit <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>.

I don’t think there’ll be many signings coming to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. If there’s a signing that they feel will improve them they’ll do that, but that’s no different to any other club. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> won’t break the bank to sign anybody, the type of player <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> want isn’t going to be a <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> or <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> who you may have to break the bank for, so they will able to get the players they want but they won’t have to break the bank for them.</p>
