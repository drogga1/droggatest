  <p><b>[Quote on Frank Rijkaard]</b> He’s perhaps best known in retrospect for his time as a midfielder, but he started off his career as a centre-back - and that background made him a very tough holding midfielder. Frank was very strong on the ball. At 6ft 3in he was extremely powerful in the air, but he was also pretty quick and could place pinpoint passes - hence his later deployment in midfield. He could play as part of the zonal system or one-on-one equally effectively. He’d be well suited to the modern game</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool cannot compete with the likes of Manchester City, Chelsea and Manchester United for the world’s top players]</b> I’d love to see <b>[Cristiano]</b> Ronaldo, <b>[Marco]</b> Reus and Manuel Neuer, but that’s not happening. In terms of the best players in the world, if they are coming to England, they are going to go to Manchester City, they’re going to go to Chelsea, they’re going to go to Manchester United. They are going to go to these clubs before Liverpool. The advantage we have is that we trust Jurgen Klopp enough to make the decision to buy some players in Germany or wherever that he knows can do what he wants.<br /><br />If you are talking to me about the obvious players who I would like to see coming, there is no point mentioning them because they are not coming to Liverpool. We are unique in that. Unless it’s going to be a £40m or £50m signing that everybody knows is a world-class player, the Arsenal fans will be disappointed. The Chelsea fans will be disappointed. Liverpool fans trust Jurgen Klopp enough to know that he may sign a player we’ve never heard of, but we trust him enough to get the best out of that player</p>

  <p><b>[Raheem Sterling must offer greater end product in order to avoid becoming another Theo Walcott]</b> Towards the end of the season Raheem was on the bench. Now they’ve signed Bernardo Silva so that’s an interesting development to see how that goes. Raheem has great potential. It’s effortless when he dribbles past players. He has to improve on things. His end product is going to be important. If Raheem was with Ronnie Moran he would say to him: ‘Yeah, you beat five players but then the ball goes over the bar.’ That’s instead of ‘You beat five players how great is that?’. You have to be harder with them for them to understand the things they need to improve on. I think I’ve seen a marked improvement in Raheem’s end product since he’s been with Pep. His finishing, his passing is better<br /><br />Look at Theo. He’s a great player who has had a fantastic career. But in terms of what we expected from a 17-year-old to 27, maybe he hasn’t developed as much as we’d hoped. Raheem is 22 but the difficulty is he’s also playing with a lot of inexperienced players. Having players like Kenny Sansom or a Gary Lineker to help you along the way is important. I could easily have thought ‘I’m at Liverpool, I’m a superstar’ but I had players I looked up to because of their seniority. At Watford, Wilf Rostron was there and he was kind of an Arsenal substitute. He played behind me but I didn’t think ‘I’m John Barnes’. Wilf said ‘do this or that’ and I did it. Now the emergence of the superstar youngster means they have to be careful</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool’s problems are down to lacking a classic No.9 such as Robbie Fowler or Ian Rush, not their defence]</b> <b>[Liverpool’s season has been]</b> patchy. They are such an attacking side with so many players going forward that at time they leave the back four exposed. For me, that’s one of the main problems - not necessarily that they have a dodgy back four but the way they defend as a team.<br /><br />They don’t have a classic No.9 goalscorer to put the ball in the back of the net. They create chances, efforts on goal but they <b>[Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino]</b> are not a Robbie Fowler or an Ian Rush. They aren’t that clinical. But they are playing an exciting brand of football. They’ve had the best record against the top teams. I’m not worried about when they play against Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal or Tottenham. The problem they have is when they play the other teams who defend deep.<br /><br /><b>[On Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain]</b> He hasn’t started all the games but he’s come to be a main player at Liverpool for, hopefully, the next five, six or seven years. We’re too quick to judge. When players come in and do well we say they are fantastic. And if they aren’t in the team and don’t start, we say it’s a disaster. It’s not. I think he’s a fantastic player. He’s probably a reflection of the team. He’s come to be part of a good team and because the team has been inconsistent, maybe he’s been inconsistent. But I think he’ll be a fantastic signing for Liverpool long-term</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp remains the best manager for Liverpool]</b> All you can ask any manager to do, and I’ve always said this, is to maximise the potential of the team. That’s all he can do, he can’t do anything more. I think he has maximised the potential of Liverpool’s team because maximising the potential of the team Liverpool have should mean they can finish, in my opinion, fourth or fifth. Klopp is doing the best he can with what he has at his disposal as well as any other manager in the world could do.<br /><br />If Guardiola was at Liverpool with these players - I’m not saying they’re bad players, they are good players but of course Man City have better players - he wouldn’t be able to do necessarily anything better than Jurgen Klopp. He may have done it in a different way but I don’t think he would be able to do what he’s doing at Manchester City. The fact we are four points off second place means that he’s not doing a bad job.<br /><br />Now, we can do better defensively and be more consistent obviously when we get other players and when he works with the players that he wants but in terms of saying we should be higher up in the league at this particular point, I don’t agree with that. In the future, if he gets the players he wants, like he did at Borussia Dortmund, he will make a bigger challenge. So I think he will be competitive enough to win the league but we can never tell if he will ever win it.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool boast a fearsome front three of Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane but still need to sign a striker]</b> They need better all-round players. The front three are great, but I don’t feel that they are necessarily going to continue to do this for the next two or three years. Salah is not a centre forward, I don’t think he is a player who can score goals consistently over a period of time. We don’t have players like that. We have players like Salah and Mane and, although Mane scored a hat-trick against Porto, they are not out-and-out goalscorers. So, as funny as it may seem, I think if they could get a centre forward, a penalty box player and play Firmino slightly deeper, I think it will be better for the balance of the team. Yes, we’re scoring lots of goals but can we see Mane and Salah continuing to score this amount of goals on a regular basis? I think we need to get better individual players now.</p>

Neymar could leave PSG as well so even the biggest clubs in the world are selling clubs.

  <p><b>[John Barnes considers Liverpool to be the most feared side in Europe]</b> It could have been easier, or it could have been harder. In Napoli and PSG they have two very good sides; though Napoli probably are not as strong as they were a couple of years ago. So it’s going to be difficult. But the thing with Liverpool is that more people fear Liverpool now than I think any other team in Europe, in a one-off <b>[fixture]</b>. Of course we lost the Champions League final, but if you look at the passion the team played with, the aggression and the intensity, then teams wouldn’t want to play Liverpool. So it could have been an easier draw, but I think Liverpool will be confident of getting through that group.</p>

  <p><b>[Sustaining a Premier League title challenge is more important to Liverpool than winning the FA Cup or Carabao Cup]</b> People talk about winning trophies but they’re wrong. We could win the FA Cup by beating Swindon and Tranmere. You can win a trophy by not playing top teams. You can’t just win a trophy because you don’t know who you’re going to play. What you know in the league is who you’re going to play week-in, week-out. You should be able to suggest that we will be closer to the top. I know people talk about winning trophies as success, but I’d rather be 10 points closer to Man City and not win a trophy than win the League Cup or the Europa League and be 25 points behind City. Getting close to the top of the league shows how good you really are.<br /><br />We knew what we were going to get with <b>[Naby]</b> Keita because we signed him a while ago, we knew he was coming, we knew what to expect. Of course, we needed to resolve the goalkeeper situation to give everyone confidence heading into the season and Alisson is a fantastic keeper. It’s early but they’ve fit in like they’ve been here a while</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp is under no pressure to win a trophy for Liverpool this season]</b> Well, would we rather get silverware and win the League Cup and finish 25 points behind City or finish second behind City by three points and not win silverware?<br /><br />That for me is more important. That shows progress. That shows that you’re going to be consistently challenging at the highest level for the league and that will mean they’ll be challenging in cup competitions. So the whole idea of needing silverware, for me, is not as important as getting much closer to the top. Because if you’re much closer to the top of the Premier League, that means that you’re consistently winning matches and playing well which would help you in cup competitions as well. Yes, it would be nice to win a trophy, but I’d rather not win a trophy and finish second, seven or eight points off the top</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah may struggle to net 40 goals again for Liverpool]</b> Salah’s been fine. I mean he hasn’t obviously scored as many goals as he did last year, but I never expected him to. Because I don’t think Salah is regularly going to be scoring 40 goals a season as easy as he did last year. But if he can be part of a team who has won seven games in a row, as much as he hasn’t scored all the goals, then that’s fine, he’s doing equally as well. That’s much more important for him to do that than for him to be scoring lots of goals and us not to be winning.<br /><br />So as much as individually people may think he’s not doing as well as he did last year, he’s part of a team and helping out the team to be better than they were last year. It depends what you call a one-season wonder. If he doesn’t score 40-odd goals this year and that means that he’s a one-season wonder, that’s ridiculous. Because if he only scores 20 goals which means he hasn’t done as well but will win the league, that’s even better. So maybe in terms of scoring 40-odd goals, but not in terms of being effective and helping the team to be even better this year than they were last year</p>

  <p><b>[John Barnes believes England’s fans have a role to play in the development of Jadon Sancho]</b> He has got great potential, we need to give him time to develop and improve and don’t get carried away. Don’t put too much pressure on him and say he is going to be the next best thing. It was the same with Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. We say how great they are and then they don’t realise their potential because we put too much pressure and expectation on them. He is a young player, who is doing well at the moment so let’s not go overboard with saying how fantastic he is. Of course, he has great potential but let’s give him time. He wasn’t playing at a top English team so that’s why he left to play for Dortmund. A German team, unfortunately in England we are not giving players like Sancho a chance in the top teams. He has to go abroad to do that. It has worked well for him. I would like to see top English players in top English teams but that isn’t going to happen. It is an option to go abroad. It was a gamble, but it has worked out well for him<br /><br /><b>[On Gareth Southgate]</b> He has got good players and the players and the fans like him. The fans have a lot to do with it because in the past they haven’t really got behind certain England managers or certain players in the England team. We have got this thing now with England when the team don’t play well, the fans stick with us. It gives confidence to these young players, even when they don’t play well in a game because the supporters believe they will show their true worth in the next game. They are a young team that needs experience, but they will grow and they have to be given time to grow and fail. It is no good coming down hard on them if they fail, and destroying their confidence. It is difficult to win the European Championship or World Cup because there are still teams better than us. We shouldn’t be winning it, the expectation shouldn’t be there. If it isn’t there then the players can play with more freedom and maybe do something special. I hope expectation doesn’t rise too high. I hope we stick together. If we have that harmony then we can be successful and the fans have a lot to do with giving their side the best chance</p>

I am not saying that we cannot win it but that I think we are the closest to Manchester City<br /><br />Everton have not been in form in recent years so we have gone into the game as clearly the better team.

  <p><b>[Liverpool legend John Barnes has weighed in on the recent alleged racial abuse of Raheem Sterling during Manchester City’s clash with Chelsea]</b> Absolutely. And not just in football - like when we hear about Muslim terrorists, Nigerian con men, Yardie drug gangs and Muslim grooming and paedophile gangs. There are many more white paedophiles and white drug dealers than there are of the other groups of people but we don’t talk about that. What that does is not painting a negative image of drug dealers or paedophiles, it’s portraying a negative image of Muslims or of Nigerians or of Yardies. It’s a very subtle way of indoctrination.<br /><br />It’s not getting worse but because we didn’t hear about it we thought it was getting better. <b>[Football clubs]</b> can say ‘if there are any racist chants we’re going to kick you out of the ground’, so for any racist football fans all you have to do is keep your mouth shut. That doesn’t mean it’s getting any better. But in times of confrontation like you saw with Raheem, people show their true colours. You can’t tell me that those three people who were racially abusing him <b>[were the only ones]</b>, there would have been hundreds that probably felt like saying the same thing but they didn’t. So does that then mean it doesn’t exist? We <b>[need to]</b> start looking holistically at how to get rid of racism. The only way we can do that is to tackle the cause, not the symptom. That incident <b>[with Sterling]</b> is a symptom of it, we’ve seen symptoms from Luis Suarez and John Terry, we’ve seen so many. Very much like a disease, we have to tackle the cause of racism, not the symptoms. All we’re doing is tackling the symptoms</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United will look to stifle Liverpool again on Sunday]</b> This is the most confident I have seen Liverpool and the most faith I have had in Liverpool in terms of getting results regardless of whether they play well or not. However in a game like this, Liverpool against Manchester United is very much like the Liverpool-Everton games, form goes out of the window. It’s a complete one-off. It probably means more to Mourinho to put one over Liverpool than the other way round so those tables have been turned. While I see Liverpool as being very confident, not just in the way they are playing but the confidence we have in them in not conceding goals and being very consistent in and out of possession, Jose Mourinho and Manchester United will be a very difficult proposition. It’s going to be a very difficult game for Liverpool but also for Manchester United and I think it’s going to be very dependent on how Manchester United approach the game. If they come, I don’t think they will, and play an open game with players going forward end to end I think Liverpool will win comfortably. But Manchester United will try to stifle the game and then it’s going to be difficult for Liverpool.<br /><br />Whatever terminology you want to use in terms of parking the bus. They will come and I am sure Liverpool will have more possession. I am sure Manchester United will defend deep and get five midfield players back in front of them and try to catch Liverpool on the counter-attack. I think they will play an attacking line-up in terms of Rashford and Lingard and maybe Martial but the onus will be on them to get back and defend and maybe when they have possession to use their pace to counter-attack. This is what Manchester United have done, not just against Liverpool but in many games, and I don’t see why it is going to be any different. If I was Jose Mourinho against Liverpool I would do the exact same thing</p>

  <p><b>[Former midfielder John Barnes insists that Liverpool’s current starting XI is stronger without Xherdan Shaqiri]</b> He is pushing for a start but if you look at Liverpool’s best team, he probably wouldn’t be in the top 11. When you’re playing against the so-called lesser teams, he can play with two midfielders and Shaqiri as well as the front three. Mané, Salah, Firmino - he’s not going to get any of them out of the team. But, Fabinho, Milner, Henderson - Shaqiri can fit into one of those three midfield positions. He could even be one of those three strikers if you’re playing against so-called weaker opposition. But, if you have to pick your best 11, it is always going to be those front three and a hard-working midfield. He has to accept that, he’s part of a squad<br /><br />I had Man City as favourites until the last two games, but I’d make Liverpool favourites now. It’s not necessarily ‘theirs to lose’, I just think the Premier League is so difficult now. Once upon a time, the top five teams weren’t necessarily going to drop points, but these days you can see with Crystal Palace and Leicester beating City, that can actually happen. So it’s much more difficult now to win the Premier League from a winning position. Numerically, it’s theirs to lose in terms of numbers they have on the board, but in terms of the difficulty of the competition, it’s definitely not finished. If they were six points ahead coming into April, then obviously it would be, so for now I make them favourites, but it’s not a foregone conclusion</p>

  <p><b>[John Barnes insists the issue of racism needs to be dealt with in England]</b> It does not feel any different to how it felt when Raheem Sterling was racially abused by Chelsea fans. Up and down the country every single week at football matches you have black football players being racially abused so why is this any different? I think that it is quite hypocritical that we want to talk about Montenegro and say how terrible it is when we have not taken care of the problem here. We go to Montenegro once every six months, whereby every week we face it here in droves. So what is more serious? Going to Montenegro once a year or black people facing this every single day of their lives? Because it is high profile, we say, ‘let’s do something about it’, but we are really not tackling the issue here.<br /><br /><b>[When quizzed over what could be the solution to prevent racism]</b> The solution is to tackle it in society and once we do that it will disappear from all walks of society of which football is one. We have to decide whether we want to get rid of it, or if we don’t want to hear it. All we are doing by passing laws is saying, ‘you can be as racist as you want, but not in a football ground’. Instead of passing laws why don’t we try and educate people why they feel the need to be racially abusing people and then we can actually deconstruct the whole idea of why they feel that way rather than just banning and passing laws</p>

Plus, we’re in the Champions League semi-final against a Barcelona team that is one of the best ever. So even if we are beaten by Barcelona and finish second, for me, it’s been an incredible season that shows we’re moving forward. Next season we’ll be there or thereabouts once again.<br /><br />Before Barcelona, we have to play <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a> and beat them to keep the pressure on Man City.

It won’t surprise me if Liverpool doesn’t make a major signing. The fans and the club trust in what Klopp is doing, so there won’t be any disappointment if he doesn’t sign anyone</p>

I think Liverpool, when Coutinho left, they were a much better team. I think Hazard influences the team so much that anywhere he goes you have to give him the ball. They’ve got good players and they can’t show their worth<br /><br />When Coutinho left, as much as he was the best player, the team became a better team. And I think Hazard dominates that team so much that every time they get the ball they have to give it to him. I think they’ve got to get away from Hazard because they’ve got good players, like Willian and Pedro. But they’re not able to show what they can do because it’s all about Hazard</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool legend John Barnes believes the introduction of a salary cap would make the Premier League more competitive]</b> I am a firm advocate of a salary cap as that will instantly begin to level the playing field. When I suggest this, people always say it can’t work and clubs would find a way of getting around it, but it has been effective in other sports around the world and I don’t see any reason why football cannot follow suit.<br /><br />What a salary cap would do is encourage clubs to invest in young players and change this culture of signing five players every summer for millions upon millions and if those signings don’t work, rip it up and start again in the next transfer window.<br /><br />This is not a criticism of Manchester City and the position they are in now because clearly they are a fantastic team led by a great manager and even though they have more money than anyone else, they have still had to be wise in the way they have spent it.<br /><br />It is too simplistic to say City have bought the Premier League title or that they have bought the treble if that is what they do this weekend. A lot of teams have spent big money in the last few years and not managed to achieve the success of City, so you have to congratulate them on what they have done. However, the potential is there for City to dominate English football for years to come unless something is done to change the structure of the game and control the way clubs manage their finances. I think a salary cap would do that</p>

  <p><b>[Raheem Sterling does not need to justify his decision to leave Liverpool for Manchester City to anyone]</b> Well if Liverpool win the Champions League this year, is it justifiable? Because then he could have won the Champions League. They say that it’s more important than the Premier League. Finishing second in the league by one point and winning the Champions League, who knows? You don’t have to justify your decision at all, you decided to leave so you don’t need to justify that to anybody else. As far as I’m concerned, he decided to leave and you have to accept that, it’s the name of the game but I don’t think he has to justify it because he does what he thinks is right for himself<br /><br />Liverpool are obviously in a good place as well, they haven’t won the league this year but Raheem over the last 18 months has improved immensely, which is down to Pep Guardiola. He needed someone like Pep to make better decisions on and off the ball, in terms of the way he dribbles, the way he passes and runs, be more creative and score more goals. He deserves all the plaudits he gets but I don’t think anyone should be judging him to decide whether he has justified his decision or not. When he left, even if he hasn’t done well, I’m not going to say he shouldn’t have left because he decided he wanted a new challenge and we need to accept that</p>

Virgil should have won it, but you can’t argue with the stats for what <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s done and how great he’s been. Even this season, this year. Individual awards don’t mean anything to me and I don’t think Virgil will be too hard done by either. As long as <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> win, I don’t feel he will be that bothered by individual awards. Individual awards are for the fans and the media to talk about who the best player is. I thought Virgil should have won it, but it’s not much of an issue or problem at all because <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is a great player as well<br /><br />It’s important for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to win all their matches being in the Club World Cup or not. If they lose before the trip to Qatar, they could come back into it and really lose focus. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> says to the players, regardless if it’s a Club World Cup or not, these are points to be won. They don’t need 12/15 - we need three points in this next game and that’s all that matters. This is the right attitude to have which is what he does so well. First five minutes we want to make sure we’re running, we’re tackling and we’re doing the right thing, this is how he drives the team to success so often, focusing on everything game by game</p>

You can play your strongest team, hit the post 20 times, the opposition can have one chance and win 1-0. You can lose the odd game in the league, but to win it, you have to be the best team.

  <p><b>[John Barnes says Let <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> land title &amp; write off future season]</b> It’s a sensible decision and I think delaying for a year was the only solution.

It’s obviously bigger than that, you are talking about promotion and relegation all the way down the divisions. So I think if the leagues can even be delayed - you don’t have to rush back to them - maybe you have to write off a season. We don’t know what’s going to happen on April 3 <b>[when the EFL suspension is currently due to end]</b> and maybe they are going to delay it further. Even if we have to start in July or August, what we have to do is finish these games even if it takes up until December, which writes off the <b>[next]</b> season.

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> legend John Barnes says There is no summer transfer window anymore!]</b> There is no summer transfer window anymore, it’s an end of season window. If the season is still going on in November or March then the window will have to be then, whenever it starts and ends. Players who are out of contract at the end of the season so they will have to be extended until the end of the season, not July as usual - the question is whether clubs down the leagues can pay their players for that long? This will only be for one year, I’m sure in a year or two it will go back to normal. But you cannot hold people to conventional timings for the next year<br /><br />We have to get away from this idea that top-level footballers are going through a hard time. Footballers on the highest rungs haven’t got to worry about mortgages and bank balances. Compared to a self-employed painter and decorator, footballers are holding up just fine. But I see how players in the lower leagues will be worried about their mortgages. Football is not in a more unique position than anyone else in these troubled times. This is the precarious state of the world and all businesses.<br /><br />From a footballing perspective, maybe everyone can come together under <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> and <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> and <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> to alleviate the problem football clubs have. But unfortunately other sectors do not have that safety net, they will just have governments to rely on.<br /><br />I just hope the smaller clubs are still around in the next six months to a year to start again, because football will eventually kick-start - and we need every club to still be afloat when that happens as they are so important to people’s lives and wellbeing.<br /><br />I worry for lower league clubs, it’s grave for them. The Government need to help out all smaller businesses of which football clubs are some. You cannot kick them out of the equation and say they are football’s problem and rely on <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> as they may have a lot of money.

I said to them, ‘Look, none of us, in an ideal world, want to play in front of empty stadiums. Football is about fans.’ But the reality is that for the vast majority of the players, particularly at the highest level, their income is funded by television money and there are contracts that have to be adhered to. In order for us (the PFA) to be able to protect those players in terms of securing their salaries … if that’s the only offer we have on the table to complete the season, then that is what it will be.<br /><br />To be fair, most players very much took that on board when we spoke to them. The players get it. They understand the alternative. Quite frankly, if we’re going to get the season finished in a timely fashion so that we can even consider starting next season, we’ve got to be open to all options. If it means playing behind closed doors has to happen in order that contracts are protected, fixtures fulfilled and commercial deals honoured, then I think we’ve all got to come together and accept we’ve all got to make sacrifices to try and find a solution for the industry as a whole</p>

The different question is when we can start to play again and, for me, you should take your time. No matter how long that takes. Either we say we’re never going to play again ever or we’re able to play, whether that’s a year, two years, whatever we decide, why can’t we then finish the nine games and then start the next season straight away? The players will have had three, four months, five months, six months off. There’s no need to have more time off, go straight into the next season with the teams that should be relegated and the teams that should be promoted.<br /><br />Football, school, life isn’t like Christmas. Christmas has to be December 25. New Years Day has to be January 1. School doesn’t have to be, football doesn’t have to be August until May.

Now, though, I think that with the support and discipline inherent in the modern game, you don’t get players like that anymore. We all saw it.

We all knew he’d handled the ball, so we just couldn’t believe the referee hadn’t seen it.<br /><br /><b>[Barnes maintains that <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>’s second goal was in no way influenced by his first]</b> We were all international footballers, we’d all been playing professional football for a long time, so we’d seen many injustices in league games where goals shouldn’t have been allowed for blatant offsides, fouls or whatever. So, for professional footballers to claim that they were stunned by the handball shocked me. To say that it had anything to do with the second goal is rubbish. I don’t believe that it affected us in that way at all. Yes, there was a feeling of injustice. But it didn’t affect the way we performed<br /><br /><b>[Barnes, though, holds no ill will towards <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>]</b> I don’t blame <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>.

  <p><b>[John Barnes says he hated Merseyside derbies]</b> I hated Merseyside derbies. Didn’t like them one bit! Yes, but those games weren’t for people who like to play good football! Those games are for people like <a href="graeme-souness.html">Graeme Souness</a> and Peter Reid and Steve McMahon, who like to tackle and kick each other! Me, I couldn’t wait to get them out of the way<br /><br /><b>[The most powerful memory, though, came in an FA Cup tie at Goodison in February 1988, where he was photographed back-heeling a banana which had been thrown onto the field from the terraces]</b> I don’t remember doing it! It became an iconic image, of course, but I have to say at the time it wasn’t a big deal to me, I don’t even recall doing it. You have to remember that it wasn’t the first time it had happened to me. I’d made my debut for <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> in 1981, and at that time bananas were coming onto the field every week. But, obviously, because it was <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, the two best teams around, it was perhaps highlighted more. It is an iconic picture. I can see that now, but my memory of it happening, I don’t have one!<br /><br /><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> won the league in Barnes’ first season]</b> I lost my first derby 1-0 at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, and I was at fault for the goal. Gary Stevens got a run on me and came inside to score with a bit of a spawny left-foot shot at the Kop end. Then, later in the season, we went to Goodison, and if we’d won or drawn, we’d have beaten the record for the longest unbeaten start to a <b>[top-flight]</b> season. We lost 1-0 and, as you can imagine, that was a big disappointment, and a huge delight for the <a href="everton-fc.html">Evertonians</a>!<br /><br /><b>[The events of April 15, 1989, when 96 fans lost their lives at Hillsborough, scarred the city - Red and Blue]</b> It wasn’t just a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club tragedy. It was a tragedy for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as a city. <a href="everton-fc.html">Evertonians</a> lost loved ones at Hillsborough. They lost brothers and sisters and uncles and cousins and friends. And when it mattered, when it really mattered, the city came together, like it always does. <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> were fantastic.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s first competitive game, post-Hillsborough, was a goalless draw at Goodison Park]</b> It was the only time I felt sorry for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. Because all the neutrals wanted <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to win. Usually, they’d have wanted the underdog to win. It was fitting and appropriate that it was a Liverpool-Everton cup final, and it was a hugely emotional day. Some would say it was fitting that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> won, but <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> would have been equally deserving winners<br /><br />I was as shocked as anyone when Kenny left. We played <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> on the Wednesday, a ridiculous game which of course we should have won, and we were then playing Luton that Saturday. Luton had a plastic pitch in those days, so you would go down the day before and train there to get used to it. At the time, I still had a house near <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>, so straight after the <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> game I asked Kenny if I could go down south and then meet up with the team at Luton on the Friday. He said no problem. When I arrived on the Friday, all the press were there. They all asked me ‘What do you think of the news?’ I had no idea! It was the biggest bombshell imaginable. I never had a clue. Obviously, the lads arrived on the coach a while after, and they said he’d come in and told them he was leaving, out of the blue. Maybe <a href="alan-hansen.html">Alan Hansen</a> and some of his closer friends had an idea but, for us, he never showed any signs at all. It was a huge shock, and a big setback for the club.<br /><br /><b>[2020 - <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s Kings]</b> It will suit certain players better than others. People talk about the atmosphere, and the effect it has on players, but it works the other way too. Some players will find it easier without fans there. I was never affected by crowds. Whether there were 2,000 there or 100,000, whether they were booing me or cheering me, it was always about the game for me, even in a derby. I know what <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> is like, and I know what this <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team is like. They train and play with the same intensity, whether there’s 50,000 fans there or nobody, whether it’s <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> away or Swindon at home. They have that determination, every single day, so the fact that there are no fans there won’t change their attitude of mentality whatsoever. That’s not to say they’ll definitely win the game. There’s no form to go off, of course, and we don’t know where everyone is in terms of fitness, but fingers crossed! My brother-in-law is the biggest <a href="everton-fc.html">Evertonian</a> you could meet, and he’s around my house every day talking about <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. <a href="donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> can be on the television, and it’ll somehow come back to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Hopefully, he’s not talking much on Sunday!</p>

  <p><b>[Reds legend John Barnes says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> passed up the opportunity to move for <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> because <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> does not like to have lots of superstars in the team]</b> Well once again you’re talking about the harmony within the team. You’re talking about a world-class player who demands to play every week and if he’s not going to play every week, is that going to upset the spirit in the camp? I don’t know if <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> was given assurances or he feels he can play for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> every week rather than coming here, but you’ve got to be careful and I know Jurgen doesn’t like to have a big squad and lots of superstars in the team. Keeping them happy can be quite problematic and we’ve seen every now and again, like the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> game when they didn’t have <b>[Roberto]</b> <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> or <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> and <b>[Divock]</b> <a href="divock-origi.html">Origi</a> can come in and did the job</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have no need to bring in big signings during the next transfer window]</b> If <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were to make big signings but then suddenly, those signings cannot play, and they cannot get into the team because of <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> and <b>[Roberto]</b> <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>, it damages the harmony of the club. How does that big signing feel when he’s always on the bench? I don’t think they need to do it at all. And I don’t feel this was the reason <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> didn’t win the title this season<br /><br />Pep <b>[<a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>]</b> and <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, the two most successful managers in world football, both feel like they don’t have to make big signings to compete. So, who are we to question that? They are successful every year.<br /><br />If you have players you can put in the squad like <b>[Takumi]</b> <a href="takumi-minamino.html">Minamino</a> and <b>[Divock]</b> <a href="divock-origi.html">Origi</a>, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> still have a large squad with people that can make an impact from the bench. It is not an issue to go and sign someone. I don’t see why there is a necessity to sign big. They are 23 points better off than everybody else <b>[…]</b> <a href="adam-lallana.html">Lallana</a> is on his way so maybe they will replace him, but I can’t see <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> making big signings. If they do there is pressure on their reaction, and the harmony they bring to the team.</p>

If they don’t get him, well they’re still 25 points better than any other team, so as long as they don’t lose players. I don’t think there’s necessarily a reason to go out and make big-name signings. Yes, they’ve signed <b>[Takumi]</b> <a href="takumi-minamino.html">Minamino</a> and they may be able to sign some players that aren’t going to go straight into the first team, but I don’t think they necessarily need that<br /><br />If <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> offer <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Koulibaly</a> twice the salary, then he’ll go to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>.

What may happen is that his type of football may suit <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>.

I don’t think there’ll be many signings coming to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. If there’s a signing that they feel will improve them they’ll do that, but that’s no different to any other club. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> won’t break the bank to sign anybody, the type of player <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> want isn’t going to be a <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> or <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> who you may have to break the bank for, so they will able to get the players they want but they won’t have to break the bank for them.</p>
