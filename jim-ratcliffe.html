  <p><b>[Ligue 1 side <a href="nice-fc.html">Nice FC</a> has been purchased by INEOS, a petrochemicals company owned by British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe in 1998. INEOS already owns Swiss Challenge League side Lausanne Sport, which it acquired in November 2017, while in March it bought the UCI World Tour cycling outfit formerly known as Team Sky]</b> With some sensible, measured investment, we want to establish Nice as a team that competes in European club competition on a regular basis. And importantly, sustain it. Nice has a great history and tradition, with a passionate fanbase whom will play an important role in our journey. We made some mistakes at Lausanne, but we are fast learners. These have been rectified and we are already seeing the benefits. Clubs need to be successful off the pitch, as well as on it, and Nice will be no different, as we look to take the club from strength to strength in all aspects over the coming years</p>

  <p>I like <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a> because he’s interested in young people and he’s a very good young coach. I’ve met him twice before - I hated him! At <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, he had his duels against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> with <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> … He really was a b*stard, and now I have to be nice to him<br /><br /><b>[Jim Ratcliffe hopes <a href="nice-fc.html">Nice FC</a> can earn a spot in the Champions League over the next few years]</b> <a href="nice-fc.html">Nice FC</a> has a great history, it’s a very old, popular club, and it’s a great place to bring very good kids. We have a new stadium, a fantastic training centre, the French championship is of high quality and produces the best players in the world. There is the opportunity to play the Champions League while in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, you already have six clubs for four places<br /><br /><b>[Ratlicliffe’s ultimate ambition is to come up against <a href="manchester-united.html">the Red Devils</a> in European competition]</b> The dream is to beat <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, I’d love it. Playing the Champions League would be great for <a href="nice-fc.html">Nice FC</a> and we can do it smartly, it’s not about throwing money out the window. One hundred million is not very satisfactory</p>

  <p><b>[Britain’s richest man, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, has no intention of investing dumb money in <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> as the 13-time <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> champions have lost the plot since <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> retired]</b> <b>[Ineos]</b> never wants to be the dumb money in town, never, never<br /><br />They are in quite a big pickle as a business. They haven’t got the manager selection right, haven’t bought well. They have been the dumb money, which you see with players like <a href="fred.html">Fred</a>. We won’t look elsewhere until we have had a good run here <b>[at Nice]</b>. We need to find out how to be successful before you ever want to write a big cheque. It’s quite difficult. United have spent an immense amount since Ferguson left and been poor, to put it mildly. Shockingly poor, to be honest. We have a different approach here to be moderately intelligent about it. Try to do it more grass roots, trying to locate young talent. Some clubs seem to have an ability to do that, Southampton, Lille. United have done it really poorly. They have lost the plot there somehow<br /><br /><b>[Ratcliffe went as far as visiting <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s training ground when weighing up the merits of an offer to wrestle control from Roman Abramovich, but feels there is little value to be found in English football]</b> You quickly get into some pretty stratospheric numbers. And even though clubs have those valuations today, nobody has ever paid those amounts of money. How much did Abramovich pay for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, £100m? The Glazers <b>[at United]</b>, what, £500m? You can say it’s worth three, four billion but no one has ever paid those sums. Ineos has always tried to take a sensible approach. We don’t like squandering money or we wouldn’t be where we are today. It’s part of our DNA, trying to spend sensibly</p>
