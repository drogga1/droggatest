  <p><b>[Ainsley Maitland-Niles hopes to force his way into the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> squad this summer, and has set his sights on impressing <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> in pre-season]</b> It was all brilliant. I’m hungrier to play for the first team now and I want to make more of it. There’s always the possibility of getting another call up. I just have to work hard and carry on doing what I’m doing. I’m looking to go back with the first team in pre-season and train with them first of all. Then hopefully I can impress the boss and get picked for the tour</p>

  <p><b>[Ainsley Maitland-Niles has spoken of the time when he was racially abused whilst playing for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> at youth level]</b> It is disgusting. It happened to me before in youth football, similar to what happened with Raheem. I went out to take a throw in and there was racial abuse behind me. I was at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> at the time, It was an away trip to Germany. I spoke to my dad and he gave me the heads up. I only thought they were doing it because I was having a good game. It is one way of them knocking me off my game and making me feel uncomfortable. I really credit Raheem for coming out and speaking about it. It hurts to talk about it but it is so important to get rid of it from the game</p>

  <p><b>[The 21-year-old academy graduate, who made his debut in a Champions League clash with <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a> back in 2014, has said of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s ambition]</b> It’s every team’s dream to play Champions League football. It’s the best European competition in the world. To play against all the big teams would be fantastic and you get to test yourself fully. That’s all we wanted to do, to go out there and win. We’ve made one step closer to succeeding<br /><br /><b>[The England U21 international added when asked if a setback for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> had offered an extra incentive]</b> I’m pretty sure everyone was at home watching the game. Everyone studied <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> too. It’s just a good opportunity now for us to go out there, show our quality and say, ‘look, we are one of the best teams in the league and we can compete for the Champions League once again’</p>

  <p><b>[Ainsley Maitland-Niles is hoping to keep his place in the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> side, with regular right-back <a href="hector-bellerin.html">Hector Bellerin</a> back to full fitness, but the versatile 22-year-old concedes]</b> I’m not a defender<br /><br /><b>[when asked if he expects to be moved again with Spain international Bellerin back in contention]</b> Only time will tell and of course I want to play as many games as I can. I want to stay in the team, but if the manager chooses to pick him over me, that’s something I will have to live with. I’ll just have to keep training and working hard so that I get picked instead. I’m a midfielder by trade, either central or on the wing, it’s all the same to me. I’m not a defender so I do get a lot of stick about my defending being poor, but it’s something I’m learning and have been learning for a couple of years now<br /><br />It’s not going to come overnight. If I was a defender as a kid, and my defending was poor, I would understand where the criticism is coming from, but I’m trying my best for the team and for the manager. It’s not where I would choose to put myself in the team, as I’m an attacking player by trade. That’s all I can try to bring to the team. I’m still learning the defensive side, so when players are running at me, and they’re throwing skills at me, I’m still learning how to deal with that. It’s always nice to have one main position where you play, and everyone else gets to play in their main position, so hopefully it’s just a matter of time before I can do that too<br /><br /><b>[The plan is to chase down continental glory once more, but a lofty finish in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> remains the priority for a club that has spent three years outside of the Champions League elite]</b> The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is our main competition that we want to solidify our place in. The top four would be brilliant, and anything outside of that would be unexpected for us. We’d been in the Champions League for so long, but we have to get back into it. That’s the main aim</p>

  <p><b>[Ainsley Maitland-Niles has praised <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Freddie Ljungberg</a>’s influence at Arsenal]</b> There’s quite a few things <b>[I have learnt from <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Ljungberg</a>]</b> really. He knows me as a winger, so attacking-wise he’s helped my game a lot. Defensively, I go to someone else to help me because they’re two different styles that I have to play. Him personally, he’s pulled me to the side a lot and has shown me different techniques and ways of beating players, ways of crossing the ball and shooting. It’s helping me and I’m happy to have him around because he’s such a big figure in the team</p>

The tough times we’re in show we’ve got the character to come back and keep fighting, trying to do as well as we can in the league and in the domestic cups, as much as we can. <b>[My message to the fans is to]</b> just keep supporting us, stick with us. We’re a team in progress, just like a lot of other teams, and we’re trying to win as many games as we can to please the fans<br /><br /><b>[The versatile youngster added on progress in <a href="fa.html">the FA Cup</a>]</b> It’s an amazing feeling <b>[to reach the semi-final]</b>. Every club wants to go to Wembley and play. For us to do it, away, and we haven’t had the best of results away recently <b>[…]</b> it’s good to pick up that win</p>
