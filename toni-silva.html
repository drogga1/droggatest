  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> winger Toni Silva has revealed that current <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> star <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> once tried to help get his career back on track after being let down by money-grabbing agents]</b> I used to speak with <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> when he was at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and he was trying to help put me in touch with a better agent and with some clubs. But it didn’t work out. The problem is I have never had someone in my life to help me, to guide me, to give me direction and show me the way. Agents have taken advantage of me and I’ve had some terrible moves because agents were chasing money, not looking after me.<br /><br />I’m just trying to play football to support my family but I’m not sure how much longer I can take it. I really want to play in England again and this is keeping me going. I miss it so much and would do anything to play there. I think I am still playing now because of what English football taught me. To be tough, to be strong, and to fight. I try to remember this. It is normal to get frustrated but I will keep trying. Still, maybe just two or three years more may be enough for me.<br /><br /><b>[A man who saw his route to the first-team at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> blocked by the likes of <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> and <a href="fernando-torres.html">Fernando Torres</a> added]</b> I feel I let myself down somehow but I honestly don’t know what more I could have done. I get frustrated because I thought I deserved a chance and if I had got that opportunity, who knows where I could be now? I loved playing for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> but now when I watch Suarez play at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, Sterling at City and even <a href="conor-coady.html">Conor Coady</a> at <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>, I sometimes feel like I just want to give it all up. When people are texting me saying ‘that could have been you’, it makes me want to leave football. It makes me feel so down, so sad. I always have this in my mind</p>
