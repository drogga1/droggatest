It’s very important we have fit players in May, that’s the most important thing<br /><br /><b>[England take on Uruguay at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> on Wednesday in their last friendly until 30 May and Eriksson said the time for experimentation is over]</b> We’ll start with the best possible team, the best XI.

The door is open to any English players. I have no idea who will be England manager in August, and I don’t want to know it either. It’s completely up to <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> and the board.

  <p><b>[Sven-Goran Eriksson on his former financial adviser Samir Khan]</b> He’s probably the only person on earth I hate. Yes, that’s right, £10 million. For most people in the world it’s a huge amount of money and it is even for me. Even if I was paid well with the jobs I had it’s big, big money. I’m not bankrupt. I still have some money. The big problem was the cash when you don’t have a job, which I didn’t for a while<br /><br />Because Samir <b>[got]</b> me a lot of bank mortgages. I had to pay them. I needed cash. So I’m starting to sell. I have some properties, which I am going to sell. One I have already sold. I am selling important parts of my life. I have another property in Sweden I have to sell. I bought my dream house near where I was born, very close to where I grew up. I would never have <b>[wanted to have]</b> sold that because that’s the house I bought, an old farmhouse, and I restored it. It’s very, very nice but I need to sell it - it’s got mortgages on it<br /><br />To have it as a proper house, I need people working there always because it’s too big. I can’t afford that any more. It’s not only me <b>[affected financially]</b>. It’s definitely the family, the children<br /><br />You know I never hate anyone in my life. I don’t think I have many enemies but I hate Samir Khan because you can’t treat people like he has done. He’s probably the only person on earth I hate. I feel let down, angry and disappointed because I trusted this man for many, many years. I gave him too much freedom. I gave him all the authorities he needed to take care of my economy<br /><br /><b>[When accepting the lucrative England job in 2001]</b> Of course I was not there for the money. Probably I would have got more money if I’d stayed in Italy. It was said that I took England for the money. Absolutely not. I took it because it’s the biggest football job in the world, the finest job you can have. I enjoyed it every day. I don’t regret being in England. I was extremely sad when it was over<br /><br /><b>[He dwelt on <a href="michael-owen.html">Michael Owen</a> nicking the ball from Brazil’s <a href="lucio.html">Lucio</a> and giving England the lead in Shizuoka in 2002]</b> A special moment. I think England fans, who are a huge amount of fans, are now thinking afterwards that it was not that bad at all. The sad thing for me was that we didn’t win a big tournament, and that we didn’t do better, we definitely should have done in 2006. We had a strong team<br /><br /><b>[Did he keep on working to cover his losses?]</b> That I take the job in China just for money? No, no, no. I was in Dubai as a sports director. I liked the people, the club, everything, but I wanted to be a coach again. China is beautiful. The league is not <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but it is rather good and getting better and better. There are some really good players. I went to see a game yesterday, Guangzhou <b>[Evergrande]</b> against a team from Qatar <b>[Lekhwiya]</b> in the <b>[AFC]</b> Champions League. The Guangzhou team is very, very good. The coach is <a href="marcello-lippi.html">Lippi</a>. They are the best team in China for the moment. We play them in the league on Sunday<br /><br /><b>[Eriksson sounded excited by his latest venture but still wistful about a country where he spent almost a decade]</b> I would of course like to come back to England. Of course. I doubt that I would have some offers from England but you never know in football. I am not 50 or 55 any more. I’m a little bit older. Even if my soul is 25<br /><br />It was good times in England. But I’m not disappointed in life. I’m still a happy man. I’m still working in football. I have two great children, even if they don’t live with me. One is in Africa and one in Italy. They move as much as I do! I’m happy. If you talk about money and Samir Khan, I’m angry, disappointed an frustrated. But you can’t go around in life thinking about that every day. Life goes on</p>

In 2004 and 2006, Tord Grip <b>[his assistant]</b> and I and the coaching staff were looking around and we couldn’t see many teams we thought were better than us, so we thought we had a chance.

They have a lot of new young players who are doing great in the Premier League but they need luck with injuries. That’s always a big problem for England, that and tiredness. I’ll say it again, they will never win the World Cup if there isn’t a winter break<br /><br /><b>[Pressed for any advice he would offer to Southgate]</b> Do it your way, use your head, don’t listen to other people and don’t read the press<br /><br /><b>[He is now 70, but there remains a desire on his part to stay in football]</b> I will probably go into football in another way.

But, I am planning something which is going to be on a very low level in another country. I’m not quite ready to slow down. Football has been my life and I miss it.

  <p><b>[Outgoing Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been hailed by Sven-Goran Eriksson]</b> He has been at Arsenal for a very long time and the job that he did was fantastic. He won a lot of trophies and he spent a lot of money on players. He played the Champions League every year, except the last season. And I think that he leaves Arsenal in a very good economic position. He will always be remembered at Arsenal as the coach who led them to their new stadium, without any debt. They have also a fantastic training ground and they have a reputation that is incredible. So, I think that the whole of Arsenal and all their fans can be very, very grateful to Mr Wenger.<br /><br />Unfortunately, football today, it’s all about money. That’s a fact and we cannot do anything against that. During my time in Italy, the best and the most interesting football in the world was Italian. After that came England. Today, the Premier League is the most interesting championship. It is also the most powerful and the most expensive. It’s a pity to see that the stadiums aren’t always full in Italy, but it will always be a big place for the coaches and hopefully they will back in the running again. I think Italy needs a lot of new infrastructure. Many of their stadiums are no longer football stadiums today. They will always be a fantastic football nation and they will come back to where they belong, I’m quite sure about that</p>

They have a lot of young and talented players, a new generation. If they’re not too tired and if there are no injuries, they can have a good World Cup. I hope so, and I think so.<br /><br />England was the biggest coaching job that I had. You know, in England, the football is connected to all the things in a incredible way. I’m very proud to have been there. We had some success. But, today, there is a new team, a new staff. I’m still supporter of England, and hopefully they will do a good World Cup.<br /><br />We had a good team. There is no doubt about that. But is it the strongest team? I don’t know. In the UK, the people said that we should’ve won the World Cup, but two years later, when I was gone, they didn’t qualify for the Euros. So, I don’t know how the people look at that. But, yes, in 2006 we had a good team. I thought we would go further, and not only me - all of the players and the whole group thought we would do better than the quarter-finals. We didn’t do it. We lost in the penalty shootout against Portugal<br /><br />If you could play all these games once again you maybe could change something. But you can’t go on in life thinking like that. I think that we could have done better, but we were not bad. We reached twice quarter-finals. We lost against Brazil, who won after the world champion title. My worst moment was in 2006, in Germany, without any doubt! The defeat in the knockout phase of the World Cup 2006 against Portugal. That was unexpected and that was also my last game with the English national team. It was not a happy day.</p>

  <p><b>[Former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson had advised Jose Mourinho to avoid taking on the press]</b> When you are criticised as a coach, and it’s happened to me many times - in England, outside England, wherever - it’s better to keep quiet. Don’t try to defend yourself, because the results defend you. It’s only with results you can defend yourself. And that’s in the paper… read it, don’t talk about it. Especially when you start to argue with the press, you will never win that. You will always lose, because if you are a journalist you have the last word - you write it.<br /><br />So keep quiet, put your head down and go on working and show people in the next game ‘we will play good football and we will win’. I think that’s the only way to answer <b>[the press]</b>. I’m talking about me, though, how I was. Don’t start talking about ‘show me respect’. Everybody knows in football what I have done. I know what I have done. I know what I’m good at, I know what I’m not good at. I think every manager is the same. When you are criticised… swallow it</p>

For Sweden he’s been fantastic and Sweden got to the quarter-final <b>[of the World Cup]</b>. He was important in the qualification so he is a great player, no doubts about that. And, of course, when you are criticised as a player, as a coach, life is difficult. You have to come back. But, if you don’t have the manager, the coach defending you, life is even more difficult, much more difficult.

  <p><b>[Sven-Goran Eriksson has admitted to having always been a Liverpool fan]</b> I’ve always been a Liverpool fan. I can say that now, I couldn’t say that when I was in England but I was always since I was <b>[young]</b>. My father as well, he is 90, still a Liverpool fan.<br /><br />I still think City will win it<br /><br /><b>[On his future plans]</b> In this job you don’t have plans and you don’t go to the office and ask for a job. I said no thank you to the Iraq national team and no thank you to the Cameroon national team<br /><br /><b>[On why he turned down those offers]</b> Different reasons but more like private reasons and they are two OK teams who I was rather keen on, but at the end, no. If something comes up I will take it, I still want to work. In the meantime, I keep busy with the local team</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool have been backed to win the Premier League title ‘soon’ by former Manchester City manager Sven-Goran Eriksson]</b> It’s going to be very interesting as usual. A lot of people are saying that maybe it is time for Liverpool. I hope so because in my heart I’m a Liverpool fan. But I think Manchester City are still very strong. I liked Liverpool last season. They played very good football, very optimistic, working very hard, very impressive. They bought some new players, so they look very strong. Sooner or later they will win it, no? I hope it will be sooner.<br /><br />I liked friendly games, but I took them like a test to test new players. People didn’t like that very much. I think friendly games are one thing, but when you come to competitive games, it’s completely different. It’s different for the country, the fans, the players, so it’s good, there shouldn’t be too many friendly games in one year because it’s not very interesting</p>

  <p><b>[Then came a stamp on Ricardo Carvalho, a wink from Cristiano Ronaldo, and the nation was in pieces once more]</b> It was a low point for him and me. In 2006 we all thought we had a good chance to reach a final and maybe win it. When I say we, I mean the players, the staff and myself. We were convinced that there was no better team than England at that World Cup. We could have won it but, when you get a red card in the quarter-final of a World Cup, it’s hard.</p>

  <p><b>[Sven-Goran Eriksson has admitted he had regular disagreements with <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> during his five-year spell as England manager]</b> With Alex, the amazing thing was it was seven o’clock in the morning or earlier, always, when he was angry. And never ‘Hello Sven, how are you?’ It was ‘whuurssshhhh’ <b>[straight into yelling]</b>. He said: ‘I will kill you. You are finished.’ But I represented England and you have to stand up. What’s right is right and what’s wrong is wrong and when you say ‘Don’t pick <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> because I’m going to kill you’ … I said, ‘Fuck off, what’s going on with you?’. And he was screaming. Whenever he got like that … it has no meaning. That’s why I was, ‘Alex, I will pick <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a>. Now, have a nice holiday. Ciao, bye’<br /><br /><b>[Eriksson was reportedly lined up to replace Ferguson early in his England career when the Scot announced his plan to step down as United manager in 2001]</b> That one <b>[the agreement to replace Ferguson]</b> was done. My relationship with Alex was very good, in one way. Privately, we had dinner, we went to events, talked about everything. But when you came to the job, for example friendly games, England, he was absolutely furious.<br /><br />You remember the <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a> case? <b>[<a href="fa.html">The FA</a> suspended Ferdinand for a missed drugs test]</b>. Alex was, ‘If you don’t pick Rio you will never have any <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> players again.’ But I have huge respect. Because of what he has done, and because Alex is a nice man. But you know something? I met him three times as a coach and must be the only one in the world, three meetings and three wins. <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> in the Super Cup and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> twice.

  <p><b>[Sven-Goran Eriksson says he was astounded by the amount of entertainment England players demanded during his time as <a href="fa.html">Three Lions</a> boss]</b> One of the biggest surprises was that English players have to be entertained. Always. Italian footballers can take a coffee and sit for two hours talking, laughing. English players, no. I remember one of the first away games, <b>[David]</b> <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a> came and said, ‘Tomorrow afternoon we have no training. Can we go shopping?’ I said ‘Shopping? Football players - shopping?!’ He said, ‘Yeah, we go to the mall’.<br /><br />The World Cup in Japan… when I went to see <b>[the hotel]</b> they explained, ‘This is the playing room.’ I said, ‘What do you mean, the playing room? Don’t we play outside?’ They said no. The playing room. And it was amazing what <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> had done. It was like going to Las Vegas. I said, ‘But this is for children.’ They said, ‘But they <b>[the players]</b> are children.’ Incredible<br /><br />I couldn’t - still can’t - see any team better than England in that World Cup. We were unlucky with <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> <b>[being sent off against Portugal]</b> but in my time the pressure was too high. The expectation when you went to those tournaments - you win and if you don’t win it’s shit. And too much talk about the Golden Generation. They were good but other teams had good players too. That, and penalties, was England’s problem. My biggest regret is not taking a mental coach <b>[to Germany]</b> but I was very confident and convinced <b>[England would win]</b>. I remember <a href="roberto-mancini.html">Roberto Mancini</a> phoned me, he said, ‘Sven, I’m putting my money on England’ and I told him, ‘You are right’.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fan Eriksson admits titles not worth lives as Reds wait on resumption of 2019-20 campaign]</b> I’m a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fan so you want me to say forget the season? Should be very, very hard. I guess that people dealing with these things, trying to do the best they can, it’s football, it’s the fans, but it’s a lot of money if you take the bigger clubs in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, Champions League and so on and the leagues in all the other countries. What’s going to happen? I don’t know but one thing must be sure, we can’t risk life trying to finish the leagues and Champions League. We can’t do that.<br /><br />I think some days ago it was the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> president at a press conference and he said as long as it’s a risk that one person could die playing football then we shouldn’t do it and I totally agree with that. If we want to start the leagues it must be secure, we can’t risk people getting sick, dying just to play football. Football is important, football is my life, I love it but life is more important than football<br /><br />I am helping my local club here in Sweden - a third division team, it’s not a professional team. They don’t get any sponsor money, they don’t have any ticket money so the club talked to the players and said, ‘what shall we do?’ and the players said they will take less money because the most important thing is the club in this moment. They did it and I think all football players should do it. If the club doesn’t get money how they can pay money? It’s common sense.</p>

  <p><b>[Sven-Goran Eriksson has admitted he sometimes thinks he should have rejected the chance to manage England in order to stay at former club <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a>]</b> I am still a <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> fan. They were the strongest team I have ever coached. It was a real team, perhaps one of the best in the world at the time. We won a lot in three and a half years. Perhaps they could have won more. But it was a wonderful time; the best years of my professional life, without a doubt<br /><br />Sometimes I thought that maybe it would have been better to stay in Italy, to stay at <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a>. But when an offer like that comes from the English national team, it only comes once in a lifetime. I thought I really couldn’t say no. I would have regretted it for the rest of my life if I hadn’t accepted that invitation. Maybe I was wrong, maybe not. Who knows? What happened, happened<br /><br />Italian football in the eighties and nineties was the most beautiful league in the world. The hardest, most beautiful of all. Unfortunately, I think <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is the best today. When I first arrived in Italy at Roma (in 1984) I had, at the same time, an offer from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and I said no because I wanted to come to Italy, where the best football in the world was.

  <p><b>[Sven-Goran Eriksson wants more black coaches in football’s top jobs]</b> Unfortunately, I have to say there are not so many black managers around the world and if you ask me why, I don’t know, but it’s a fact. You have <b>[Clarence]</b> <a href="clarence-seedorf.html">Seedorf</a>, who has been rather successful here and there, so there are <b>[some]</b>. I think you have a lot of South Americans, but probably it should be more. <b>[Campbell and Cole]</b> are two very clever young men, boys when I had them. Extremely good football players, of course, and the knowledge of football is second to none. They know their football and are good people. When they talk, you listen. So I can’t see any reason why they shouldn’t be good managers as well - coaches, managers, whatever<br /><br />I think he’s doing very well and already last season we saw what he could do, so I think it was a good choice of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> to take him. I think he will be there for many, many years. He’s doing a great job and he’s coming from a football family. He was born with football - his father, his uncle, the whole family - so I’m not surprised. When I had him with England, you could see that he’s a very clever man, clever football thinking, so it’s not a surprise that he’s become a good manager as well.</p>
