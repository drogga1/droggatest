  <p><b>[Sven-Goran Eriksson admitted he feels scared every time one of his England players hits the ground and said injuries pose the biggest threat to the country’s 2006 <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup]</b> That’s the biggest problem we might have and we can’t do anything about it. Any time I see one of the English players going down, I am scared, almost. It’s very important we have fit players in May, that’s the most important thing<br /><br /><b>[England take on Uruguay at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> on Wednesday in their last friendly until 30 May and Eriksson said the time for experimentation is over]</b> We’ll start with the best possible team, the best XI. Of course, we have to pay attention to some players who played in the (UEFA) Champions League and the week after it will be the Champions League again, so I will have that in my mind<br /><br />I am going to pick four strikers. Who is going to play with (Wayne) <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> is not sure yet. Charlton striker <a href="darren-bent.html">Darren Bent</a> appears to be in with a chance after finding his form again following a pre-Christmas dip and Eriksson confirmed he will be in the squad, while injured <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> defender Jonathan Woodgate would have been too<br /><br />He (Bent) will be picked, that’s for sure. I thought to pick <b>[Woodgate]</b> but he is injured again so that is a pity. I have talked to Sol and we discussed the World Cup. He wants to be there, that’s for sure. Sol is always good to have on your side. He is a rock. I think he will do everything to be ready for the World Cup. It might be his last World Cup, as well<br /><br /><b>[Although he will not be experimenting any more before the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup, Eriksson insisted the door is open for fringe players to earn a place in his squad]</b> The World Cup squad is announced in May so of course there is time. This is the last game (before the final preparation friendlies) but after that I’ll be going round to see matches as usual. In May we don’t know who will have injuries. The door is open to any English players. I have no idea who will be England manager in August, and I don’t want to know it either. It’s completely up to <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> and the board. I have no idea what I’m going to do in August or who is going to take my job. It’s a big job, a fantastic job with the good team and the squad we have</p>

  <p><b>[Sven-Goran Eriksson on his former financial adviser Samir Khan]</b> He’s probably the only person on earth I hate. Yes, that’s right, £10 million. For most people in the world it’s a huge amount of money and it is even for me. Even if I was paid well with the jobs I had it’s big, big money. I’m not bankrupt. I still have some money. The big problem was the cash when you don’t have a job, which I didn’t for a while<br /><br />Because Samir <b>[got]</b> me a lot of bank mortgages. I had to pay them. I needed cash. So I’m starting to sell. I have some properties, which I am going to sell. One I have already sold. I am selling important parts of my life. I have another property in Sweden I have to sell. I bought my dream house near where I was born, very close to where I grew up. I would never have <b>[wanted to have]</b> sold that because that’s the house I bought, an old farmhouse, and I restored it. It’s very, very nice but I need to sell it – it’s got mortgages on it<br /><br />To have it as a proper house, I need people working there always because it’s too big. I can’t afford that any more. It’s not only me <b>[affected financially]</b>. It’s definitely the family, the children<br /><br />You know I never hate anyone in my life. I don’t think I have many enemies but I hate Samir Khan because you can’t treat people like he has done. He’s probably the only person on earth I hate. I feel let down, angry and disappointed because I trusted this man for many, many years. I gave him too much freedom. I gave him all the authorities he needed to take care of my economy<br /><br /><b>[When accepting the lucrative England job in 2001]</b> Of course I was not there for the money. Probably I would have got more money if I’d stayed in Italy. It was said that I took England for the money. Absolutely not. I took it because it’s the biggest football job in the world, the finest job you can have. I enjoyed it every day. I don’t regret being in England. I was extremely sad when it was over<br /><br /><b>[He dwelt on <a href="michael-owen.html">Michael Owen</a> nicking the ball from Brazil’s <a href="lucio.html">Lucio</a> and giving England the lead in Shizuoka in 2002]</b> A special moment. I think England fans, who are a huge amount of fans, are now thinking afterwards that it was not that bad at all. The sad thing for me was that we didn’t win a big tournament, and that we didn’t do better, we definitely should have done in 2006. We had a strong team<br /><br /><b>[Did he keep on working to cover his losses?]</b> That I take the job in China just for money? No, no, no. I was in Dubai as a sports director. I liked the people, the club, everything, but I wanted to be a coach again. China is beautiful. The league is not <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but it is rather good and getting better and better. There are some really good players. I went to see a game yesterday, Guangzhou <b>[Evergrande]</b> against a team from Qatar <b>[Lekhwiya]</b> in the <b>[AFC]</b> Champions League. The Guangzhou team is very, very good. The coach is <a href="marcello-lippi.html">Lippi</a>. They are the best team in China for the moment. We play them in the league on Sunday<br /><br /><b>[Eriksson sounded excited by his latest venture but still wistful about a country where he spent almost a decade]</b> I would of course like to come back to England. Of course. I doubt that I would have some offers from England but you never know in football. I am not 50 or 55 any more. I’m a little bit older. Even if my soul is 25<br /><br />It was good times in England. But I’m not disappointed in life. I’m still a happy man. I’m still working in football. I have two great children, even if they don’t live with me. One is in Africa and one in Italy. They move as much as I do! I’m happy. If you talk about money and Samir Khan, I’m angry, disappointed an frustrated. But you can’t go around in life thinking about that every day. Life goes on</p>

I probably should have listened<br /><br /><b>[When Sven told Lazio assistant manager Luciano Spinosi he was planning to confess to Nancy’s husband about the ­affair, Spinosi warned him not to because]</b> you don’t know Italian men – he could shoot you dead. <b>[Sven ignored the advice and Giancarlo simply thanked him for being honest]</b><br /><br /><b>[Sven began to feel cramped because she always had to be the centre of attention and he wasn’t used to this in a woman.

I’d practically stolen his wife, yet he was asking for my permission to get her back. There was no reason to hesitate. ‘Absolutely,’ I said<br /><br /><b>[But Nancy found out and hit the roof.

And never ‘Hello Sven, how are you?’ It was ‘whuurssshhhh’ <b>[straight into yelling]</b>. He said: ‘I will kill you. You are finished.’ But I represented England and you have to stand up. What’s right is right and what’s wrong is wrong and when you say ‘Don’t pick <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> because I’m going to kill you’ … I said, ‘F*** off, what’s going on with you?’.

I remember one of the first away games, <b>[David]</b> <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a> came and said, ‘Tomorrow afternoon we have no training. Can we go shopping?’ I said ‘Shopping?

I said, ‘But this is for children.’ They said, ‘But they <b>[the players]</b> are children.’ Incredible<br /><br />I couldn’t - still can’t - see any team better than England in that World Cup. We were unlucky with <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> <b>[being sent off against Portugal]</b> but in my time the pressure was too high. The expectation when you went to those tournaments - you win and if you don’t win it’s sh*t. And too much talk about the Golden Generation. They were good but other teams had good players too. That, and penalties, was England’s problem. My biggest regret is not taking a mental coach <b>[to Germany]</b> but I was very confident and convinced <b>[England would win]</b>. I remember <a href="roberto-mancini.html">Roberto Mancini</a> phoned me, he said, ‘Sven, I’m putting my money on England’ and I told him, ‘You are right’.</p>

  <p><b>[Former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson has declared this is the season <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will break their <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title drought]</b> It will be their year, for sure. I’m a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fan. I always have been, all my life. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is doing excellent. They’re playing very good football, there’s a good spirit and they always come back even if they are down. I am quite sure that this is the year that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and it’s about time. They played very well last season. Of course, they won the Champions League, but they seem to be even more mature and they believe in what they’re doing. They believe that they are the best, even if they are down they come back and they trust what they are doing<br /><br /><b>[Eriksson stressing that <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>’s side were always going to struggle to triumph for a third straight year]</b> <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> has been doing extremely well for many years now, before Pep and with him of course. They can’t win the league every year because the competition gets bigger and bigger. You cannot expect to win every year because you have things in football - you have injuries, you have mental things. It’s good for football - you don’t want to see one team winning every season</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool fan Eriksson admits titles not worth lives as Reds wait on resumption of 2019-20 campaign]</b> I’m a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fan so you want me to say forget the season? Should be very, very hard. I guess that people dealing with these things, trying to do the best they can, it’s football, it’s the fans, but it’s a lot of money if you take the bigger clubs in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, Champions League and so on and the leagues in all the other countries. What’s going to happen? I don’t know but one thing must be sure, we can’t risk life trying to finish the leagues and Champions League. We can’t do that.<br /><br />I think some days ago it was the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> president at a press conference and he said as long as it’s a risk that one person could die playing football then we shouldn’t do it and I totally agree with that. If we want to start the leagues it must be secure, we can’t risk people getting sick, dying just to play football. Football is important, football is my life, I love it but life is more important than football<br /><br />I am helping my local club here in Sweden - a third division team, it’s not a professional team. They don’t get any sponsor money, they don’t have any ticket money so the club talked to the players and said, ‘what shall we do?’ and the players said they will take less money because the most important thing is the club in this moment. They did it and I think all football players should do it. If the club doesn’t get money how they can pay money? It’s common sense.</p>

  <p><b>[Sven-Goran Eriksson has admitted he sometimes thinks he should have rejected the chance to manage England in order to stay at former club Lazio]</b> I am still a Lazio fan. They were the strongest team I have ever coached. It was a real team, perhaps one of the best in the world at the time. We won a lot in three and a half years. Perhaps they could have won more. But it was a wonderful time; the best years of my professional life, without a doubt<br /><br />Sometimes I thought that maybe it would have been better to stay in Italy, to stay at Lazio. But when an offer like that comes from the English national team, it only comes once in a lifetime. I thought I really couldn’t say no. I would have regretted it for the rest of my life if I hadn’t accepted that invitation. Maybe I was wrong, maybe not. Who knows? What happened, happened<br /><br />Italian football in the eighties and nineties was the most beautiful league in the world. The hardest, most beautiful of all. Unfortunately, I think <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is the best today. When I first arrived in Italy at Roma (in 1984) I had, at the same time, an offer from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and I said no because I wanted to come to Italy, where the best football in the world was. All the great players wanted to come to Italy to play</p>

  <p><b>[Sven-Goran Eriksson wants more black coaches in football’s top jobs]</b> Unfortunately, I have to say there are not so many black managers around the world and if you ask me why, I don’t know, but it’s a fact. You have <b>[Clarence]</b> <a href="clarence-seedorf.html">Seedorf</a>, who has been rather successful here and there, so there are <b>[some]</b>. I think you have a lot of South Americans, but probably it should be more. <b>[Campbell and Cole]</b> are two very clever young men, boys when I had them. Extremely good football players, of course, and the knowledge of football is second to none. They know their football and are good people. When they talk, you listen. So I can’t see any reason why they shouldn’t be good managers as well - coaches, managers, whatever<br /><br />I think he’s doing very well and already last season we saw what he could do, so I think it was a good choice of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> to take him. I think he will be there for many, many years. He’s doing a great job and he’s coming from a football family. He was born with football - his father, his uncle, the whole family - so I’m not surprised. When I had him with England, you could see that he’s a very clever man, clever football thinking, so it’s not a surprise that he’s become a good manager as well.</p>

  <p><b>[Sven-Goran Eriksson has urged <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> and Kevin De Bruyne to stay at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and resist the temptation of Real Madrid]</b> Well, they will play for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> if they want to do it, but I would be disappointed. I don’t know - I really hope they stay in England. When you look at it so far, and for many years now, <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is the best league in the world, no doubts about that - most popular, the best league to see. Other leagues are good, but how many people are looking at Spanish football if it’s not <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, maybe <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>? I don’t think many. <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, it’s a little bit the same if <b>[Borussia]</b> <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>’s not playing, if Bayern <b>[Munich]</b> is not playing, are you sitting looking at it? In England it’s different because any team can beat any other team. It’s good football and it’s always a fight, a good fight in England<br /><br /><b>[Manager <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> has a year left on his City contract and has not ruled out signing an extension]</b> Of course it’s important. He’s considered one of the best, if not the best coach in the world. He has been so for a long time. To lose him before the contract finishes would be bad for Manchester City: bad for the fans, bad for the players, bad for the club. Not sending out a good message. I hope they will do everything to try to keep him at least until the contract finishes</p>
