  <p>In doing all my coaching studies and badges, I have never, ever, had any training module that says: ‘If it’s women this is how you coach, and if it’s men that is how you coach’. We are talking about football. Obviously men and women have specific characteristics but the only real difference is physical, athletic</p>

  <p><b>[France coach Diacre aiming to match male counterparts at women’s World Cup]</b> There are lots of good things. I have spoken quite a bit with (coach) <a href="didier-deschamps.html">Didier Deschamps</a> about the organisation of it. He has explained to me how they worked. There are some things I have partially copied, and others which I am not copying because they won’t work for us, and in any case we don’t have the same budget<br /><br />Just because we are the hosts does not make us favourites, although we would like to copy what the men did in 1998. You can set objectives, but that does not mean you will reach them<br /><br />For us, the World Cup began with 645 days to go, when I was appointed. So it is getting closer, but we are not restless because there is still a bit of work to be done. We are gradually improving. The level we were at yesterday needs to be inferior to what it will be tomorrow. The next two matches are sold out. It’s nice to feel that enthusiasm from the people. But, honestly, there is no pressure. We have a World Cup to play at home, and it is up to us to make it greats</p>

  <p><b>[France closes its Group A play Monday against Nigeria in Rennes, and Corinne Diacre expects her squad to have a 3-0 record at the conclusion]</b> Our goal is to try and top the group, even though a draw would suffice. We are going to go out and try to win the match because that’s always good for confidence<br /><br /><b>[France opened the tournament with a 4-0 victory over South Korea in front of a sold-out crowd in Paris, then followed with a 2-1 victory over Norway, with raucous fans backing the national team]</b> We are delighted that people are interested in women’s football. We know that the women’s game has developed significantly over the last several years. Clearly people identify with the game and are turning out in big numbers, and clearly we are very pleased with that<br /><br /><b>[But she wasn’t pleased with the way France played against Norway]</b> Given that we are trying to win our third straight match, we need to stay with the same dynamic. I don’t know how many changes. I’m not going to tell you either way. We want to remain competitive so we are going to put out a strong starting 11</p>

  <p><b>[Having left the Division 1 Feminine’s top scorer out of her squad, the hosts’s coach Corinne Diacre is no stranger to making brave calls]</b> We hope to raise the World Cup just like the men did.<br /><br /><b>[Diacre is not afraid to say when she has been disappointed by a performance, while also being her usual coy self when it comes to pre-match press conferences, as was on show again this week]</b> It’s a good question but I will not answer it. There are a lot of Koreans in the room, and if you will allow me, I will keep the starting XI a little secret. Thank you<br /><br /><b>[Diacre said of Emelyne Laurent]</b> She can bring us a lot. We didn’t have this type of player, who can break into the penalty area and win a penalty if we need to get back into the game. It was a difficult choice <b>[to omit Katoto]</b>, but I made it and I stand by it. It’s certain that if we don’t win the World Cup, I will be reproached for it</p>

  <p><b>[France head coach Corinne Diacre took a measured response after the victory 4-0 over South Korea]</b> It’s been a while since we put things in place, I had that luxury to do what I wanted with this group and take it where I wanted to go. This is only one step, there are six more to go to the end. We must keep our feet on the ground. I refused all emotion tonight, it will be for later. I had to be in the competition, I prepared myself as a player. I hope there will be emotions as late as possible</p>

  <p><b>[As the top goal scorers in Group A, France are more or less guaranteed to qualify for the final 16 if they win against Norway. But Coach Corinne Diacre has been cautious to take the competition one match at a time]</b> The final is on July 7. For me, this is just the second group stage match. We need to be as serious as we were against Korea. France are playing against Norway, and not <a href="ada-hegerberg.html">Ada Hegerberg</a> <b>[…]</b> it’s a team that qualified <b>[for the World Cup]</b> without her. We’re expecting a challenging match<br /><br /><b>[Diacre sought to dismiss concern, pointing out that the full team roster was present for practice on Tuesday]</b> All of the players have been spared. there wasn’t a problem. I’m happy with the 11 who started against Korea, so it makes sense that we would kick off with the same 11.</p>

Once again the Americans showed that matches come down to small details.<br /><br /><b>[And maybe a little luck, considering what appeared to be a hand ball by <b>[O’Hara]</b>(jamie-o-hara.html) in the final minutes failing to merit a second look from Ukrainian referee Kateryna Monzul]</b> We can debate this call all night long. But what point would there be in that?</p>
