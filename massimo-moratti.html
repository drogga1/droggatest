  <p><b>[Massimo Moratti saluted Giacinto Facchetti]</b> Thank you again for having honoured Inter, and with her, all of us. Over the past four years we have often read or heard these words repeated, which best recount the story of a life that united and will always unite Facchetti to Inter and the history of football. Unforgettable and unforgotten. Always with us. Thank you Giacinto</p>

  <p><b>[Moratti says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> boss was never convinced by Madrid move]</b> That Champions League final was the end of a journey and as Interisti we appreciated the difficulties of getting there more than the final result.

  <p><b>[Asked about the potential deal of Ibrahimovic back to Inter]</b> Maybe I’d have done something so crazy. Having said that, there’s a balance that needs maintaining and the players already there have to be respected. In these cases, all these situations have to be considered<br /><br /><a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>’s way of being and working hasn’t surprised me. It was already known that he’s full-on and serious as a coach. He’s only thinking about Inter and he’s working very well. I think Inter will take their fight down to the wire this season. Of course, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> have shown that they have a better chance, plus they’ve won the last eight Scudetto so they have a different kind of spirit. However, Inter are also showing that they have both the quality and character needed to fight for the title.</p>

I don’t know if this situation will change anything, but I think we will see strange things at the end of the year.
