  <p><b>[Mrs. Nita Ambani explained as to what was her vision before diving into the world of football with an intention to help upgrade the current structure to make it world class]</b> Right from the outset, Indian Super League has been geared towards one overarching objective - to develop football across the country in a systematic and holistic manner. As the second most populous country in the world, India’s absence from the world soccer has been notable. However, over the last two-years much has changed, and the world has started to take note of India’s systematic rise in football.<br /><br />India has no dearth of talent, we need to show them the right way, nurture and provide opportunities to our youth. I am impressed with the way our boys have taken up the challenge in the ISL and have matched with their international counterparts. One can see the notable difference in our boys attitude and body language<br /><br />In building the Indian Super League, we have committed to propel Indian football to its rightful place- with Indian talent, facilities, passion and ambition to reach the very pinnacle of the game. The League is built on strong values which will ensure that long-term and sustainable growth is achieved through concerted and mutually-aligned effort from all Indian football stakeholders</p>

  <p><b>[13-year-old RF Young Champs’ Kshitij Kumar joins Dutch Club NEC Nijmegen’s U-15 squad]</b> We are extremely proud of the progress made by the 48 champions. Children like Kshitij Kumar are the future of Indian football. He is dedicated and disciplined at this young age which makes him a force to reckon with on the ground. We are sure he will pave a way for more scouting from foreign countries in India as well as increase the belief among players here to play in the best leagues in the World.</p>
