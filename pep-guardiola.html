  <p><b>[Pep Guardiola on Tiki Taka]</b> I loathe all that passing for the sake of it, all that tiki-taka. It’s so much rubbish and has no purpose. You have to pass the ball with a clear intention, with the aim of making it into the opposition’s goal. You need to dig into your own DNA. I hate tiki-taka. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a> didn’t do tiki-taka. In all team sports, the secret is to overload one side of the pitch so that the opponent must tilt its own defence to cope. You overload on one side and draw them in so that they leave the other side weak. And then you attack and score from the other side. That’s why you have to pass the ball, but only if you’re doing it with a clear intention. It’s only to overload the opponent, to draw them in and then to hit them with the sucker-punch. That’s what our game needs to be about. Nothing to do with tiki-taka</p>

What I admire the most is when you look at these records or numbers. To do 400 games means many years, many bad moments, many good moments, being there day by day, week by week. I admire that a lot. You can have a good year, a good season, but almost 10 seasons here doing that is just incredible. Big congratulations. For the City supporters - me included - it is a privilege what he has done at this club. Hopefully, in the last season he is going to be here, he can help us to achieve</p>

He has an incredible sense of arriving in the box and scoring when the ball is on the other side. He is fantastic at that. When he plays more central all his movement is towards the goal and for a winger that is incredible. Some players play well but they forget the ball is there. He always has the sense of where the ball will be and will attack there because if it arrives, he will score a goal</p>

All I said was the reality of what happened in the game. Saying the truth is not being angry or being grumpy. What happened is my job. When we are doing well I say we are doing well and when we are bad I say we are bad. The reason why we could not win that game is because <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> made an incredibly good defensive performance, had two shots on target and we didn’t play like we could. After that we spoke about the next game and tried to be who we are. At that moment I didn’t think we’d win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and win 14 games in a row. It’s a big mistake to think about that because it’s far away. We did the same meeting that we’ve done when I believe we need a meeting, nothing special. What I want for my players is that when we win, to understand the reason why we win or why we lose</p>

He has to be fit, after two or three games he fell down and he cannot play. We tried to help him, we tried to do the best to help him since the first day of the three and a half years we are here. We do everything for him. He has the conditions to do it, but to be the best central defender you have to play one entire season, every three days being there. It’s difficult to reach the potential that he has, he has to be at the level to play regularly. The last three seasons and a half he could not do it.<br /><br />It’s difficult to know the reason why. Sometimes when you have a tough injury, for example like Aymeric <b>[<a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Laporte</a>]</b> had this season or <b>[Ilkay]</b> <a href="ilkay-gundogan.html">Gundogan</a> in the first season, sometimes it’s unlucky, or <b>[Benjamin]</b> Mendy the year he arrived, first year he arrived.

The exception is when you win a lot. Normally In sport you lose more than you win. Michael Jordan is the greatest example of this.

The performance level, the continuity, the influence in our final third and on our finishing, the desire, his calmness and positivity. I mean, I asked him: ‘Kevin, what did you feel before you took that penalty?’ and he just said: ‘I’m going to score’. He doesn’t feel much pressure, he likes to play in the big events, he’s an exceptional player. I say to him: ‘Kevin, don’t forget, do the simple things properly’. Sometimes he’s alone and might lose the ball. He’s able to see something special and you have the spaces no one else can see but even with that he’s improving and improving. He’s not 33 or 34. He’s still a lot of years to play and always you have the feeling when he’s on the pitch that he’s never disconnected, even if he’s not influencing the game at that moment. It’s important to be like that.<br /><br />Honestly, with these types of players , the challenge comes from inside themselves. If you have to push them to be something special they are not big, big, big. I don’t like players who complain. If a guy wants to be better than he already is then it is up to him.<br /><br />I don’t believe too much in trying to seduce them to become better players. They all know what it takes to improve - so it has to come from them. The big things in sport always come from inside the players. Not the trainers. The one detail that all the best players have is to never complain. They don’t complain to the manager, the club, because they know it is up to them to become better day by day.<br /><br />The others, they are the ones who make reasons why they can’t do it. That’s why they change clubs all the time and never end up with a top club. The big players always look at themselves. Unfortunately, when Kevin helped us get 100 points he still wasn’t good enough to be the best player in the league. Maybe in the future</p>

The sentence from the three independent judges was clear. But, if they want, they know my telephone number, they can call me and I can explain. It’s not a problem at all. But I think we don’t have to discuss a lot because the sentence was clear. All the suggestions that we were lying or cheating, it was not like this.

They are the reason why we are in the Champions League next season because of what they have done on the pitch. Off the pitch, maybe, other clubs are better, but on the pitch we were quite good the last three or four years, and we will defend what we won on the pitch next season in Europe.</p>

  <p><b>[Pep Guardiola: <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> can make <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> contenders again]</b> I expect a tough, tough game. They <b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> have something special already, they have a team spirit Mikel has created. I see from the side how they celebrate goals, how they fight for every ball. They have begun to create something special for the club. We approach <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> like we do the other ones. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> were one of the elite clubs in English football for the last 20, 30 years. I am pretty sure the right person to take them back to the position they were. When the club supports him there is no better person to do the job than Mikel. I have the feeling he is creating something unique. If he can be supported by the club with investment, get the players they need, they can be contenders for the next years<br /><br />I have a incredible respect for him and his career. He is an exceptional player with an incredible mentality, especially personality. I laugh at all the pundits, they were defenders and they didn’t make one mistake in their careers when they played 10 or 15 years. I like he is still playing football and I am pretty sure he is going to make more good actions and mistakes, it’s part of the game. I have a lot of respect for this player.<br /><br /><b>[Number two <a href="claudio-bravo.html">Claudio Bravo</a> has regularly played in domestic cup matches but the Chile goalkeeper is currently sidelined with a muscular problem]</b> We are playing <a href="ederson.html">Ederson</a>.
