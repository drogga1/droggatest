  <p><b>[Joris Gnagnon turned down the opportunity to join Chelsea over the summer]</b> It happened very quickly. Two years ago, I was in CFA <b>[French amateur league]</b>. I played my first season <b>[at Rennes]</b>, then the second. I hear we’re talking about Chelsea and many other clubs, for sure it’s very flattering. I was happy.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether he found it difficult to ignore the advancers from afar]</b> It was really not easy to be honest. After that, I had to look the truth in the face, that is, if I went to Chelsea right away, I was not sure I would be playing. You’re going to Dortmund, you’re not sure you’re playing either. Whether I went to the right or left, I was not sure I was playing. I weighed up the pros and cons with my entourage and my agent and we thought that it was better to do one more season at Rennes. It was not easy but we had to make a choice</p>
