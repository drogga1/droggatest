David Beckham’s Inter Miami has made the first signings in club history, acquiring teenagers Matias Pellegrini and Julian Carranza.</p>

<h4 id="2020-03-21-retrieve">2020 03 21 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Inter Miami’s young star Julian Carranza says <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a>’s a cool guy]</b> I thought he was going to be more closed-off because he is such a big star. But nothing could be further from the truth. I found a really cool guy, who wants to work. His office is being finished and he is making his mark. You can see it in the stadium and in training.<br /><br />So far, nothing. But he’s in good shape, he’ll never lose that right foot, ever. I went in to exercise on our day off and he was there playing with El Chino <b>[goalkeeping coach Sebastian]</b> Saja and his kids. He’s a star<br /><br /><b>[Beckham is reportedly interested in bringing <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> to Miami]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>? Obviously he’ll have the doors open to him if he wants to join up. I have heard more about <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, that was quite the hot topic around here. If <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is coming, I’ll be staying here the rest of my life. If I am wanted, I won’t be thinking about going anywhere else!</p>
