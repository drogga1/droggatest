  <p><b>[Yan Couto comments on his effort Brazil beat Mexico 2-1 in November’s final]</b> It leaves a mark, right? Those crosses, these plays in the game - it was the goal that won the title. I will always remember it</p>

  <p><b>[Guardiola talked ‘new Dani Alves’ Yan Couto out of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> move and into €6m <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> switch]</b> I had a good conversation with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and I thought I would go there, but then <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> appeared and showed me how things would be there. At first, they wanted to loan me out straight away, but then I spoke with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>. He told me that I would do preseason with the first team and from there it would depend on me. <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> was very attentive and said that he was really happy I was coming to the club. It was the best decision for me<br /><br /><b>[He admits that he did not see himself leaving Cortiba so early in his career]</b> I have been a fan of Coritiba since I was a kid. My only dream when I was younger was to be a professional for Coritiba. I really wanted to do a full season in the Brazilian league, but unfortunately it has not worked out that way. I saw that I could achieve big things and I am fulfilling a dream by going to play in Europe</p>

  <p><b>[Man City signing Yan Couto reveals clause that could double his transfer fee]</b> The clause is to <b>[play]</b> five Champions League or <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> games in five years. I hope I can do it, then the amount doubles. I think it is very possible and Coritiba will get the other part of the fee.<br /><br />I spoke with the City representative and it may still take a while before I can go there. The season is not over and I can only play next season. I don’t know if they’ll take me until I’m 18. So, I have a great chance of staying another one or two months at Coritiba. <b>[Playing]</b> depends on <b>[Coritiba coach Eduardo]</b> Barroca too. I am available, yes, to play some games and say goodbye to the fans<br /><br />If I had played professionally last year, I knew I could be worth around €20 million, like Renan Lodi or like <a href="bruno-guimaraes.html">Bruno Guimaraes</a>. So, I think that it doesn’t make much difference. The only difference is that <b>[Coritiba]</b> didn’t bet so much on me to go professional because my contract was ending too. I could have been valued at much more. I was discouraged, but they said that Serie B was a very tough game and I understood. But at least from July or August onwards I could have been playing already. I love the club. I want to go out the front door. The board did what they imagined. They are afraid of players leaving for free, but I would never do that</p>
