<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Uwe Rosler says Son Colin faces different challenge at Man City]</b> People always ask me how I would do if I was a player at City now. Obviously some of the City players now are breathtakingly good but the training and fitness regimes are not comparable with my time. Doing what they do, we would have been better players as well. How far I would have gone? I cannot answer that. But, when I compare my training to the training my son receives, it is from a different planet<br /><br /><b>[Then there were the secret police, who tried to recruit Rosler to spy on his team-mates]</b> I was frightened my career would be over because I said no, but my dad and my coach protected me<br /><br /><b>[far from feeling envious of the opportunities and rewards offered to today’s youth, Rosler feels he had it easy compared to players trying to forge a career now]</b> These days I think it is very difficult to be a young player<br /><br />In Western Europe, not just in England, their life is a totally different environment to the one I grew up in. I was very fortunate to grow up for 20 years in a different political system. I had far less disturbances and distractions than they face in society now. Then there is the influences of elements like parents, agents, money and girlfriends. It is easy to say that young players are pampered and they have it easy now. I see it quite the opposite, I think they have it quite hard. You need to have a strong will to succeed no matter what. I was very focused on what I wanted to do. To be selected for the school I went to was a privilege but to stay there was very tough. One year I had injuries and feared I would be axed, but living under that sort of pressure shaped me<br /><br />The competition is much harder than it was when I was growing up. Back then, the best local kids would play in a team, and then there would be the best from your district. At the very top, you would be against the best kids in the country. Now, wherever you are playing, you are you competing against a kid from China or Africa or anywhere in the world<br /><br />n Western Europe, the young kids have a relatively high standard of life. When they come from other countries, they are with their backs against the wall and they do everything to succeed because they have got nothing to go home to. It is sometimes hard for the Western kids to match that hunger<br /><br /><b>[City are a prime example of a team who no longer just mine for local talent]</b> I think if you are at City you have been chosen on merit and obviously Colin has a chance, but the bar is so high. It is going to be very difficult for him, you have to be honest. But what you know you get from City is a very good football education and, if you work hard you can make a living from football elsewhere.

  <p><b>[Uwe Rosler on <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> fans’ special bond and raising another Blue legend]</b> I didn’t win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, I didn’t win <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup, but I am very happy that I won a lot of hearts of the supporter. City never forgot me and I never forgot them. I think I was very fortunate to play in front of the old Kippax and in a stadium that had 35,000 people singing from every corner. That has disappeared, unfortunately. So I feel really privileged to have had that time.<br /><br /><b>[His love for the Blues even led to the naming of his two sons, and he jokes that his Norwegian wife had no say in the matter]</b> Yes, there was no option. I said if we have a girl, you can decide. She said she would call her <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I said: ‘I don’t think so’</p>

  <p><b>[Ghana attacker Tekpetey unavailable for Fortuna Dusseldorf on <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> return]</b> For Dawid Kownacki, Bernard Tekpetey and <a href="zack-steffen.html">Zack Steffen</a> the game comes too early after their injuries. Captain Oliver Fink left the team quarters for personal family reasons. Marcel Sobottka has finally got really fit and is training very well. But also Adam Bodzek is back in team training and is doing really well right now. The same applies to Alfredo Morales<br /><br /><b>[The German top-flight is among the first few football leagues globally to make a return after the coronavirus disruptions]</b> I still don’t have a clear idea of ​​how the entire matchday will go. I can’t really imagine the feeling in the minutes before the kick-off. We are in good shape as we can be in the current situation. Everyone knows that it is a very important game. We analysed Paderborn and we know how we can attack them<br /><br /><b>[As part of strict protocols for the return of <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, matches are set to be played behind closed doors while each team will be allowed to make up to five substitutions per game]</b> Every player copes with a situation that has never existed differently. You have to understand that. I am therefore trying to send the players on the field who can best deal with this situation. Among other things, we use the time in the team hotel to keep our players up to date. There will be the last conversation tonight - after that we will focus on football</p>
