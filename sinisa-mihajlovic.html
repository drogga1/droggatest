  <p><b>[Sinisa Mihajlovic on <a href="francesco-totti.html">Francesco Totti</a>]</b> I consider him my friend, though there was a period when we didn’t speak. It came after he did not come to my farewell game. I invited him and he did not even answer me. To me, respect is important. Now we have patched up the relationship and everything is fine. When Roma were coached by <a href="zdenek-zeman.html">Zeman</a>, I went to see training and Francesco, when he saw me on the sidelines, came up to me and said jokingly, ‘Who gave you permission to come here, to my house?’ I told him, ‘Do I have to ask permission from you? I come here whenever I want’. And we hugged. I consider Francesco the greatest Italian footballer of all time. Greater than Baggio and Rivera</p>

  <p><b>[Rise of the Underdog: How unfancied Red Star conquered Europe]</b> I think it was the most boring final in European Cup history. Had we approached the match with attacking mentality, we probably would’ve lost, not because Olympique <b>[<a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a>]</b> were necessarily better than us, but because their players were used to playing big matches like this one. We had a squad full of 21, 22, and 23-year-old kids. A few hours before the match, seven of us were shown tapes of Olympique matches. I remember Ljupko Petrovic telling us: ‘If we attack them, we’ll leave ourselves open for counterattacks’, to which I asked ‘So, what do we do then?’ His answer was: ‘When you get the ball, give it back to them. So we spent 120 minutes on the pitch practically without touching the ball</p>

On November 21, 2013, I took over a team in a very difficult situation, low in the table, discouraged, and in crisis. I leave now with the team seventh, after having been third at the end of the first round of fixtures.<br /><br />I don’t know if you will go into the Europe League, it depends on official documents. But, beyond the ranking, I am most proud of something else: to leave a team that today is self-confident, courageous, and able to face every opponent head-on.<br /><br />It would be easy to stay here: I know I’m appreciated by the club and fans. But I think it would be unfair to my growth and perhaps also for the team. I set myself a goal, and I achieved it. Now I look for another challenge</p>

  <p><b>[Mihajlovic rejects China move after wages give him ‘sleepless nights’]</b> In December I received an offer to work as a coach in China, but I decided to turn it down because I don’t like leaving work half-done. To tell the truth, I did have a couple of sleepless nights thinking about the wages I could have had. But in life you make decisions and this was my choice.<br /><br />You still have to respect those who go there for the money. A playing career is not so long, whereas that of a coach is a bit longer.<br /><br />In China you can earn five or six times what you would get here in a single season and China no longer just signs washed-up players like they do in Qatar or the USA.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a> are away to Sassuolo on Sunday having signed attacker Juan Iturbe on loan from Roma, with Mihajlovic conceding the 23-year-old is a risky addition]</b> He can play on either flank and do anything. He has got good stamina, pace and a strong shot. This is a gamble I hope to win. Two years ago he was at the centre of a bidding war and then lost his way. He is very eager, but must be given enough breathing space to not be judged at every tiny error. It is up to him to prove he can be decisive</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bologna-fc.html">Bologna</a> coach Mihajlovic vows to fight leukaemia following diagnosis]</b> Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, we did some tests and discovered some anomalies that weren’t there four months ago. We said I had a fever and the hardest thing was to convince my wife that it was true: I have leukaemia.<br /><br />I spent the night crying and I still have tears now, but I’m not afraid. I’ll go to hospital and I can’t wait to start fighting. I explained to my players that I will fight to win, as I’ve taught them to do on the pitch.<br /><br />I’ll win this challenge, no doubt about it. I want to thank all of <a href="bologna-fc.html">Bologna</a> for making me understand that I’m a member of the family, and I’ll also need them to win this battle. But I’ll also need to see people not crying for me. I don’t want pity.<br /><br />My father died of cancer, so I always get tested regularly. If we hadn’t performed these tests, I wouldn’t have shown any symptoms for a year.<br /><br />None of us must think we are indestructible. All of us think, ‘It won’t happen to me’, but when it does, it’s a big shock. Your only hope then is to anticipate it, because if you discover it after two months or after a year, that makes a big difference.<br /><br />So, if I, as a famous person, can go through this, I hope it can help others to get themselves checked, to prepare and to realise that it can happen to anyone. I was perfectly healthy in every way and yet here I am.<br /><br />It changes your life in a moment. Everything changes in a moment. When you sleep and have a nightmare, you wake up, but for days you wake up and realise this isn’t a nightmare, this is real.<br /><br />I hope, after winning this battle, I’ll be able to talk it over with you all and look back on this period. Nothing has been given to me in life - I’ve had to fight for everything. I’ll fight this, too.</p>
