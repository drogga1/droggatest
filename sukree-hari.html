Alhamdulillah.<br /><br />With that said, I am going to resign from the post effective Wednesday.<br /><br />Thank you, wassalam</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Thai government is not sincere about resolving the conflict in Patani. The negotiations held thus far were a tactic for wasting Malay Patani people’s time <b>[referring to the three southernmost provinces of Thailand and the ethnic Malay Muslims who live there]</b>. Whatever was agreed together at the negotiating table, the Thai side was not willing to sign, and that is clear proof that the Thai side was just pretending in the negotiations, playing for time<br /><br /><b>[The negotiations were dogged by allegations that rebel leaders in touch with fighters on the ground were not participating in the talks and did not support the effort. But Sukree denied this]</b> BRN is BRN … the issue about the real or not real BRN <b>[Barisan Revolusi Nasional]</b> is an issue that aims to divide BRN in the eyes of the people of Pattani, so that they lose confidence in BRN</p>
