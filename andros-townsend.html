  <p><b>[Andros Townsend believes <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> remains committed to Crystal Palace despite his botched summer move]</b> It is massive Wilf is still here. Any side in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> would like him. The fact we are able to keep him again is great for the club. It gave everyone a big boost once the window closed. You saw that extra enthusiasm and energy in our performance. Hopefully, we can build on this performance and have a positive start to the season. It has been the same ever since I have been here. He has been the difference for us whether it has been fighting relegation or going for the top 10. You saw when he came on he gave us an extra dimension. He is a massively important player for us. Any club in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> would be lucky to have a player of his ability. That <b>[his commitment]</b> was never in doubt. He loves his football, he loves Crystal Palace. You saw on social media, he loves playing football - whether it is in his back garden practising with his dad or his cousins or his brother</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> team-mate Andros Townsend surprised by <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>’s rise to the top]</b> Harry is one of the best strikers in the world and I didn’t see it coming, but he always had the foundations to do it. From the first time I saw him he’s always had an incredible ability to score goals. Maybe he didn’t have the mobility he does now, or maybe he was half a yard slower, but he always possessed that ability to score left foot, right foot, from any position on the pitch. And in the last three or four years he’s been in the gym, he’s bulked up, he’s got quicker, he’s got stronger, he can head the ball, he can run. He’s pretty much an all-round player now and one of the best in the world, and rightly so</p>
