  <p><b>[Lyon threaten legal action after <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> season ended early due to coronavirus outbreak]</b> This government position did not seem to impose, in a prohibitive way, such a final stop today from <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> and Ligue 2; the Minister of Sports Roxana Maracineanu having previously indicated the possibility of playing in August if the evolution of the health situation allowed it. Olympique Lyonnais then proposed as early as Tuesday that the League study an alternative solution which would allow the Championship to be ended and thus preserve the fairness inherent in any sporting competition, and to be in line with <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s proposals based on sporting merit according to objective, transparent and non-discriminatory principles. This solution shared by other clubs was based on the principle of play-offs and play-downs, a title of champion acquired by <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, with a calendar limited to three weeks consistent with health constraints, and an innovative formula which normally could have interested broadcasters, currently lacking content, as well as sports betting and all other economic players in the football industry. This solution made it possible very precisely to meet <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s wish to go after national competitions. Given the judgment of the French <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> Championship, decreed today by the League, Olympique Lyonnais reserves the right to appeal against this decision and claim damages, in particular under the loss of chance and in light of the jurisprudence of other professional sports which are currently in progress, since the damage for the club amounts to several tens of millions of euros. Olympique Lyonnais sincerely congratulates the champions, <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> for <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> and Lorient for Ligue 2, who were proclaimed today and hopes that OL Feminin <b>[the Lyon women’s team]</b> can quickly have the same consecration</p>

  <p><b>[Lyon deny date set for Champions League clash with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> despite <a href="jean-michel-aulas.html">Aulas</a> claims]</b> Olympique Lyonnais would like to affirm that the date of <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> v OL, in the second leg of the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Champions League round of 16, has not yet been confirmed, contrary to what has previously been stated. The date of the round of 16 fixture is expected to be set as part of the Champions League schedule, to be announced directly by <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> in the near future<br /><br />Olympique Lyonnais are also eagerly awaiting the 2020 Coupe de la Ligue final, likely at the beginning of August, which will allow them, unlike other teams, to prepare for this essential part of the new season. Nonetheless, OL regrets having to operate with a different preparation than their European rivals, who have, for the most part, already resumed training</p>

  <p><b>[Lyon issue new call for reversal of <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> cancellation]</b> <a href="javier-tebas.html">Javier Tebas</a> explained since <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>’s suspension how a permanent stop would be a very large economic and social disaster for Spanish football, which he estimated at €1billion in the event of a permanent stop but ‘only’ €300m in the event of a recovery <b>[behind closed doors]</b>. Olympique Lyonnais hopes that the example of Spain coming after that of Germany <b>[the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> returned behind closed doors last weekend]</b> will make it possible to reconsider the decision taken in France too hastily. We can reasonably imagine the position of the coaches and players of the French championship is today much more favourable to a resumption of competition than during the UNFP <b>[France’s players union]</b> poll of April 23 or when <a href="didier-deschamps.html">Didier Deschamps</a> told president <a href="emmanuel-macron.html">Emmanuel Macron</a> on April 27 of his reluctance and fears for the health of the players<br /><br />Beyond the economic catastrophe that will hit the French championship hard, the most successful French clubs still in the Champions League will find themselves at a disadvantage during the European matches. <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> and Lyon, both still committed with their two teams, female and male, will be penalised against opponents who will have benefited from the resumption of their championship. Lyon calls on president <a href="emmanuel-macron.html">Emmanuel Macron</a> to support the spirit of a France that reacts to its European competitors. Thanks to the relevance and efficiency of its citizens, France has pushed back the pandemic to allow the controlled resumption of training and tomorrow we hope to compete, as is the case in almost all the others European countries. The decision taken in a rush on April 30 can be offset today in the eyes of the French if we know how to recognise that nothing is ever final by adopting the most appropriate solution in the interest of French professional football and therefore France.</p>
