<blockquote>
  <p>[On Konstantinos Mavropanos] He’s a very good player with a big future ahead of him. But the most important thing for me is to have a good character and be a humble person if you want to build a long career. Talent is not the only important thing, good character is too. Mavropanos has the whole package to have a very successful career. I am sure he will go on to play for the first team because he has the personality and quality to make it.<br /><br />The advice I can give to him is to believe in himself and to be himself. He will see so many things that will be life lessons for him. When I arrived there [at Arsenal] I saw some things in this team which I will never forget in my life. For example, when I saw how the likes of Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry and Tony Adams treated the Arsenal staff [equally] that was a big surprise. That’s what makes Arsenal such a massive club for me. The small differences. First of all I was very happy when I heard the news [about Mavropanos joining Arsenal] because he will see things that only I saw. It was a big school for me which changed my character. When you have legends like Patrick Vieira, Tony Adams and Thierry Henry in the dressing room next to you who have won everything like the World Cup and European Championship, and you didn’t win anything in your career, you start to think about many things. I said to myself that I have to be humble and work hard because before I joined Arsenal I thought the big stars would have big egos - but I was wrong and that was a big surprise for me. They were so good with me and helped me a lot, especially players like Tony Adams and David Seaman. I was so lucky<br /><br />I finished my career seven months ago and I think about all of these things and think to myself how lucky I was to participate in the best squad in Arsenal’s history. They won everything in that time. So many good players with very good character, that was the most important thing for me. Before arriving at Arsenal I had played in the UEFA Cup for Iraklis. They were a respectable club in Greece always in the top four positions and I was playing every game. Sometimes I didn’t want to play with the reserve team and had an arrogant attitude. Then when I joined Arsenal, I saw players like Martin Keown and Tony Adams, at the age of 36 and 37-years-old, going to play with the reserves. That was a big example for me. I have so many good memories and life lessons which changed my character<br /><br />He [Wenger] is a very intelligent man who was like a teacher for me. When you say one thing to him, he can understand 10 things! He gave me the opportunity to play six or seven times which I will never forget. It was my fault that I didn’t take the opportunities but at that time players like Kolo Toure, Sol Campbell and Martin Keown had left their mark on the team and I could only learn from them. I’ll always remember Mr Wenger, Boro Primorac, Pat Rice and people in the staff like Gary and Colin Lewin who were so kind with me and respected me so much. I will never forget the way in which they treated me. I want to say thanks to everybody because it was the most important experience in my 21 year-long career</p>
