  <p><b>[Slovakia coach Jan Kozak says that Russia’s players and coach do not deserve the potential Euro 2016 disqualification which has been threatened due to crowd trouble]</b> If there are things that I can’t control then I don’t think much about them but it’s a pity because it’s a great championship. In Bordeaux against Wales, it was one of the best experiences of my entire life and I hope the emotion <b>[in Lille]</b> makes for a great atmosphere. Football is for the people and the Russian players and coach would not deserve anything bad because it’s all about football here.<br /><br />I already know my starting XI; all the players are fit and ready to play. There will be changes in the line-up - not because some players disappointed me against Wales but I do need to make changes</p>

  <p><b>[Marek Hamsik is ready to play for a very big club]</b> His performance was superb. He helped a lot in defence and scored a beautiful goal which was a major contribution to our victory. I don’t know whether we will be here long enough for him to become one of the top players of the finals, but what we can say is that he has matured as a person and as a player at Napoli - he is ready to play for a very big club.</p>
