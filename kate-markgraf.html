  <p><b>[Kate Markgraf named first USWNT general manager]</b> This new role presents some big challenges, but all are exciting, important to the future of the game and certainly energizing. I’m honored to come back to an organization and program that I love, one which helped mold me as a player and person, and to contribute to its continued growth. To reach the top of the world is difficult enough, but to stay there takes a tremendous amount of hard work by players, coaches, staff and administrators, and I’m looking forward to collaborating with those inside and outside of U.S. Soccer to make that happen</p>

  <p><b>[How the USWNT intends to develop the next set of stars and keep the World Cup train rolling]</b> 2020 will be a success for me if I help build - collectively with the group of coaches - an infrastructure that can help enhance player development, identification and scouting mechanisms. That’s really it: can I do those three? And at every level of the pyramid? Whether it’s pro, whether it’s national teams, whether it’s having the discussions at the youth levels<br /><br />How do we figure this (youth) piece out? It’s more fractured, and it’s always going to be fractured, to be honest, with the pay-to-play model, but how do we make it where it’s not as fractured? How do we mitigate it as much as possible, where we can get better player development? So. That’s my goal. A chance to build an aligned infrastructure. Not that it wasn’t before, but a lot of it left when everyone left, so how can we do it so it’s not person dependent? So if, for example, a coach leaves, we’re not starting from scratch with all of that intellectual property, all of the information is up on one spot<br /><br />That level of tactical sophistication is something that, for these players coming from college, it is going to ramp them up. I look at that as the perfect bridge into our 23s, and then to our senior team and the pro league, so that these 20s can go and actually get a spot on a NWSL team, hopefully. So, to me, it’s an acceleration of their development in a different capacity, because they’re going to be exposed. It is a balance, it’s a balance in the cycle</p>
