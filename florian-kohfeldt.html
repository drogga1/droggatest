  <p><b>[Werder coach Florian Kohfeldt said he had been tracking <a href="davy-klaassen.html">Davy Klaassen</a> for a while]</b> We have been watching him for a long time and are glad that this opportunity has opened up. With his strategic sense, Davy is able to set a rhythm for the game, impresses with his creativity and is strong and aggressive at the same time. Werder made intensive efforts. It was important to me to know exactly where the journey was going on the pitch. The ambitions of the club have convinced me. After my exchange with Florian Kohfeldt, I have a very good feeling that I can make an important contribution here with my abilities. The coach wants to play attractive, offensive football. I am really looking forward to this</p>

  <p><b>[Those positives included netting the only goal of the game against Cologne in Sunday’s pre-season friendly, with the Missouri-born striker Josh Sargentproducing a confident finish past Timo Horn]</b> Josh is unbelievably clinical when he gets in the opposition box. He’s been working really hard and is in fantastic shape, which is great for him and us, but he’s not without competition in attack</p>

  <p><b>[Zack Steffen was arguably the standout goalkeeper in the league’s first round of games, drawing praise from Bremen manager, Florian Kohfeldt]</b> We should’ve scored at least three more goals. But we were up against a fantastic goalkeeper</p>

  <p><b>[Werder head coach Florian Kohfeldt believes Milot Rashica is a special talent]</b> He is a player who can decide <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> games. You don’t find that very often. Milot has incredible skills: in speed, in goalscoring, in passing. Rashica would fit well in England with his pace, but also with his style of play in Spain</p>
