  <p><b>[World Cup 2002 in Japan and South Korea]</b> While the world was left stunned as <a href="guus-hiddink.html">Guus Hiddink</a> masterminded one of football’s greatest underdog stories, there was only one player grabbing the headlines before, during and after the tournament. The commotion surrounding this star would leave a generation of supporters donning replica number seven shirts, changing the face of Asia forever. Step forward Hidetoshi Nakata<br /><br />Not only was he an integral member of that 1996 Olympic squad in America, <a href="hidetoshi-nakata.html">Hidetoshi Nakata</a> was the centrepiece as <a href="takeshi-okada.html">Takeshi Okada</a> guided the Samurai Blue through a difficult AFC World Cup qualifying process. Despite his tender age, the 20-year-old midfielder amassed 11 appearances en route to France 98, scoring five goals and assisting all three in the crucial 3-2 playoff victory against Iran<br /><br />At the time of his arrival, <a href="hidetoshi-nakata.html">Hidetoshi Nakata</a> was the only Japanese international to ply his trade outside of the J League and the 4m euro move was naturally met with frenzy from the local media.

Aside from <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>, the new Roma sensation was arguably the most recognisable face in world football - and certainly one of the most profitable commodities<br /><br />By the time World Cup 2006 had arrived, <a href="hidetoshi-nakata.html">Hidetoshi Nakata</a> had secretly decided that this would be his last foray in professional football. His disillusionment with the game had become so overpowering that he no longer wanted to be involved a sport he’d adored since childhood.
