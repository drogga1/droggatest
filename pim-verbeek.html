  <p><b>[Australia Manager Pim Verbeek Defends A-League Criticism]</b> I think I’ve been reasonable about the A-League. I’ve never said anything wrong. You have a shortage of memory because you can’t even remember what I said. That’s a problem, because people start repeating quotes out of context. What I said about Danny and about Archie, I also said they were fantastic in the A-League, but I have not read it. Maybe it was a little bit rude, I agree. But I’m not speaking with 17- and 18-year-old players who I have to be a little bit careful with. I am speaking with fully professional players who have been champions already here</p>

  <p><b>[That it was 2006 Japan-game hero <a href="tim-cahill.html">Timmy Cahill</a> who dug deep to find not one but two goals was something that couldn’t have been better scripted. Such underdog-overcoming-the-odds history repeating was also sure to satisfy the media, hungry for newspaper-selling headlines]</b> I think we should give them a little more respect for what they do, they love to do it, but still they did a fantastic job in very difficult circumstances and they deserve a little more respect</p>

  <p><b>[Pim Verbeek To Leave Australia After 2010 World Cup]</b> It has been a very difficult decision for me after more than two years but it is time for me to look for a new challenge. I have enjoyed every minute of being head coach of Australia and we achieved some fantastic results including qualifying for the World Cup and the Asian Cup. It is a good time to make this announcement so we can now focus completely on preparing everything perfectly for the upcoming World Cup in South Africa. We will do everything right to prepare for this tournament to get the best result possible</p>

  <p><b>[Aussie Analysis: Pim Verbeek - Mercenary, Pragmatist, Family Man]</b> That’s the most difficult part of my job… Like every marriage, you always have some problems. My problem is that I am sometimes 10,000 or 20,000 km away from my family. We have learned to deal with that and the moment it’s not possible any more, I will go back to the Netherlands immediately. They <b>[my family]</b> are number one. The next decision will have to consider the family situation. The amount of time I have been away and the travelling I have to make and the jetlag you have to get over. In the end you have to make decisions also. The decision always involves family</p>

  <p><b>[Australia Coach Pim Verbeek Names Iran’s Afshin Ghotbi As Potential Socceroos Successor]</b> Afshin Ghotbi passionately loves football and I am sure Iran will be a very tough team under his leadership. There are not many coaches who know Asian football as well as he does. In fact, I think he is a great candidate to take over Australia after the World Cup. He is one of the most experienced coaches in Asia. We started to work together in 2001. He was very instrumental in preparing South Korea for two World Cups working closely with world-class coaches like <a href="guus-hiddink.html">Guus Hiddink</a> and Dick Advocaat</p>

  <p><b>[World Cup 2010 Exclusive: Australia Coach Pim Verbeek On Group D]</b> Germany is always a favorite. They go to South Africa to win the trophy and we have a massive game against them. Ghana will play in their own continent. they are mentally supercharged and will come to prove themselves. Serbia has had an outstanding qualification, beating France. There is no pressure on them and I expect them to be a very challenging opponent. The biggest difference is the responsibility. Before, I was part of the coaching staff, involved in all aspects of the team building and making recommendations, but the decision maker was someone else. Today, I am the ultimate decision maker and as a result, the responsibility is on my shoulders. I have to say that I enjoy it very much</p>

  <p><b>[The victory over the White Eagles gave Australia four points but the Socceroos fail to progress on goal difference to Ghana]</b> In the end it was not good enough. We did everything we could and played a great game. When it was 2-0 we were looking for a third and hoping Germany would score another. We went all or nothing and it was a great result. We waited until 45 minutes to find out the result in the other game and then we went all or nothing and played high balls and looked for the rebounds and put on extra striker.We were unlucky that we couldn’t score the third. I’m disappointed. We have four points, I was hoping it was enough but the goal difference against Germany killed us. There are no lessons. The boys were fantastic</p>
