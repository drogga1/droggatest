  <p><b>[That it takes to be a Man City youngster]</b> First of all I don’t know what the reason is to pull the socks over your knees. I’d say, ‘Don’t be silly, John Terry can do it, that’s fine, but just pull your socks down, look normal’.<br /><br />Hunger and desire, you can’t coach that. It’s either in you or it’s not. We didn’t have that at Brentford where you give a 19-year-old a first-year pro <b>[contract]</b>, he would get a few quid and you could see the desire dwindling. Those players haven’t made it in the game, but that’s not how it is here<br /><br /><b>[On Brahim Diaz, Phil Foden and Jadon Sancho]</b> They’re really good players, technically fantastic and all the rest of it, but they’re our three most hard-working players. When you look at the stats after the game, and the running stats, they’ll be in the top three. With all the nice stuff that goes with it, they actually understand the hard work more than anyone<br /><br />This group I have got at the minute is the best group technically, but also in terms of attitude, in terms of desire, all the things you can’t coach, their attitude, desire, work-rate, their want to succeed, their determination. Even things like the small sided games that we finish training with, the way they compete, I’ve had to cut short a lot of games because they are flying into each other and risking injuries<br /><br />The technical programme is something that is spoken about a lot but off the field it’s as good as i’ve ever seen. No stone is left unturned. They get the best of everything they can<br /><br />We haven’t got big time Charlies. We haven’t got lads that are arrogant who you’ve got to knock down a peg, we haven’t got any of that<br /><br />You do but it doesn’t need to be the kind of arrogance where you’re coming in in your new car, with the windows down, stepping out in your sunglasses like Puff Daddy. It’s more, ‘the whistle’s gone, right go and show us now then’. It’s a trait in all the top players.<br /><br /><b>[Do City’s youngsters have that?]</b> Definitely. They’re a confident group. They’re really looking forward to the final. The game’s on television and they want to show people how good they are<br /><br />They’re on trial every day. They’re on trial every single game. It’s something they’re used to and it’s been the case since they’ve been at the club. We’re constantly looking for better than what we’ve got, whether that’s in the first team or the Academy. We’re constantly looking around Europe for better players than what we’ve got, so it’s important that as soon as they stop developing and stop learning they become under risk of being replaced. The lads can see how big the mountain is to climb already and they are fully aware they are at the bottom of it</p>
