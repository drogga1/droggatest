  <p><b>[Mazinho says <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s natural replacement at Barcelona]</b> <b>[Barcelona]</b> would be delighted if he can return tomorrow. He is <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s natural replacement. There is no other to replace Messi<br /><br />I’ve been saying for a while that I believe in <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>. Perhaps leaving <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> was a mistake for the Brazilian but, if there’s any chance of getting him back for less than the €222m <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> paid for him, the club should seize the opportunity. At 28, he still has a lot of football to play. He would be a great signing for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> as they would be getting someone who knows the club and who has the personality to make the difference in games. He wouldn’t be daunted by sharing the pitch with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and the Argentinian would enjoy having him back on the team.<br /><br /><b>[Mazinho’s son <a href="thiago-alcantara.html">Thiago Alcantara</a> is part of a <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> side who returned to training this week amid the coronavirus pandemic]</b> <b>[Playing football amid the coronavirus outbreak]</b> is worrying because it is a complicated situation that we are all experiencing. In Germany they are progressing in that sense, with group training. You have to be very careful with all this. If Bayern do it, they do it because there is no risk and they are providing security to all their footballers. My son must work and be as prudent as possible</p>
