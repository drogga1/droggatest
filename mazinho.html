  <p><b>[Rafinha’s father and agent Mazinho has said his son needs to leave Barcelona in search of more playing time]</b> It’s crazy, he can’t understand anything. Only the coach knows what he has or doesn’t have. The truth is that we’re trying to get Rafa into a situation where he plays regularly. We have to look for an exit because it’s really complicated for him here <b>[at Barcelona]</b>. It’s been basically two years hardly playing and he needs a club to give him 30 or 40 games a season.<br /><br />Here, when you have three games in a row, then you’re cut <b>[from the team]</b>. The coach has in his head his way of working, but for the player… <b>[Rafinha]</b> has done well in preseason, he’s had some spectacular games. He doesn’t understand it. This is football, it’s normal, of course, and we have to be happy because we’re at a great club. But we need to leave to play more<br /><br />If there are interested clubs, Barca are interested in a transfer and the player’s happy, we will work together</p>

  <p><b>[Mazinho says <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s natural replacement at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> <b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> would be delighted if he can return tomorrow. He is <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s natural replacement. There is no other to replace Messi<br /><br />I’ve been saying for a while that I believe in <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>. Perhaps leaving <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> was a mistake for the Brazilian but, if there’s any chance of getting him back for less than the €222m <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> paid for him, the club should seize the opportunity. At 28, he still has a lot of football to play. He would be a great signing for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> as they would be getting someone who knows the club and who has the personality to make the difference in games. He wouldn’t be daunted by sharing the pitch with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and the Argentinian would enjoy having him back on the team.<br /><br /><b>[Mazinho’s son <a href="thiago-alcantara.html">Thiago Alcantara</a> is part of a <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> side who returned to training this week amid the coronavirus pandemic]</b> <b>[Playing football amid the coronavirus outbreak]</b> is worrying because it is a complicated situation that we are all experiencing. In Germany they are progressing in that sense, with group training. You have to be very careful with all this. If <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> do it, they do it because there is no risk and they are providing security to all their footballers. My son must work and be as prudent as possible</p>
