We lost 3-1 because we made a number of errors and they were very good at the critical points. We didn’t lose because of a single piece of play. It’s not the best way to express yourself and even less so from within the club, aimed at a player<br /><br />We knew what could happen from the start of the game. We had a good first half, but after their goal we opened up and we couldn’t change things with the equaliser. When they have space, and on the counter-attack, they’re almost unstoppable. We don’t give up the trophy as lost. It’s difficult but we have to keep believing as a team. We have to be good defensively. Scoring three goals won’t be easy but we’ve done it there plenty of times</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona star Sergio Busquets has said that he hopes Real Madrid suffer after selling Cristiano Ronaldo this summer]</b> I hope they miss him and notice the lack of goals. But I know his coach and he will make Madrid more of a team.<br /><br />To have Leo in the team solves almost everything because he unbalances opponents, scores goals and creates them. The more time the ball is at his feet, the better and more advantage we will have. It’s logical that our game has to go through him. It’s not being dependent on Messi, it’s being smart and taking advantage of the best player in the world. When I’ve got the ball, I try to find him. Sometimes, too much. But I prefer to take the risk<br /><br /><b>[On Andres Iniesta]</b> Clearly. But not only as a player, but in the dressing room because like Carles Puyol, Xavi and Victor Valdes, he was a captain, a guide. I think the most difficult moment will be when Leo leaves, our generation is almost all the same age and we could finish almost at the same time. Better not to think about it and enjoy the moment</p>

  <p><b>[Sergio Busquets has saluted the ‘unique’ skills of Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi]</b> We have the good fortune to train with him every day. I’ve spent the last 11 years with him, so you get that greater concentration of him doing these things. We’re not quite as surprised by it all. There isn’t a goal he’s scored on the pitch that we haven’t seen in training and he’s also repeating goals he has scored in previous seasons. He is unique.<br /><br />We didn’t know he was going to say that. But all clubs want to do well in the Champions League don’t they? It’s the most prestigious trophy there is and it is even more important for us after having not won it for so many years<br /><br /><b>[On Luis Suarez]</b> It’s not just his goals but all that he brings to the team. The pressure he puts on defences, the way he holds the ball up, the way he battles with rival defences, all that gives us so much<br /><br /><b>[Busquets admits to missing two iconic figures who have moved on to pastures new - Xavi and Andres Iniesta]</b> Of course I do. They are once-in-a-lifetime players, and I spent so many years with them. We complemented each other well and we came from La Masia, which makes it even more special. We could understand each other with just a look. The opponent didn’t know what we were going to do but we knew with just a glance. That was a huge advantage. We’d been through the same things, come up through the youth team, had a friendship on a personal level. It will be very difficult for another midfield like that one to emerge from La Masia</p>

  <p><b>[Busquets says Barca were undone by ‘smarter’ Liverpool]</b> They have been better than us, they have gone for the match since the beginning, they have pressed well in the beginning of the two halves and it has been very difficult. We have not been able to make the chances. We apologize because after Rome this happens again… There’s little more (to say). When a team plays you by pressing so high, if you do not take advantage, they grow in their field, with their atmosphere and the goals they are making. We have had chances to score, it would have changed everything. The 4-0? A failure of all of us for being distracted, they were smarter than us</p>

It seems that we’re not living in this world at times but we are. We know how fans are feeling but their behaviour has been spectacular. They showed their disappointment at first, but after that they were 10 out of 10. We’re all p*ssed off, but we have to keep going. There’s nothing else for it</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> star Busquets doubts <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> season will resume amid coronavirus crisis]</b> I think it’ll be difficult to resume. I don’t think it can be done. At first, I wanted to see how it evolved and now it seems we’ve reached the peak. I’m waiting for good news. I think it will be difficult to resume because of travel, getting everyone together. That will be the problem<br /><br /><b>[Busquets went on to offer an insight into how he is coping with the enforced break in the campaign]</b> This situation is difficult, to live it from the outside, and above all the uncertainty that it is generating. But I can spend more time with my children. I am not touching the ball very much, but we have a weekly pattern of exercises that the physical trainers have designed for us and that we do every day</p>
