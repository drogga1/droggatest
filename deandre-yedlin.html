  <p><b>[DeAndre Yedlin hails progression]</b> That is a big reason I posted that. I don’t know if other people can see it but I can see it. Not just myself but the team is making huge strides and it has been really important for our momentum recently. Everything is starting to click. We know we are never satisfied. We want to keep pushing.</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT youngsters have potential to be a golden generation]</b> Now that we have a base and just a stable platform you’ll really see an unbelievable growth, especially with these guys. This group of players, and a couple of the other younger guys, this could be a golden generation for the U.S. I think<br /><br />A big part of that is players taking that step early and getting over to Europe. I don’t like to talk badly on MLS, and I’m not talking badly on MLS, but I think just making that step and getting out of your comfort zone, once you do step out of your comfort zone and then you do find some success it brings even that much more confidence to you. I think that’s what he’s experienced, that’s what Weston has experienced. You see Christian, you see these guys, they’re playing with so much confidence, which I don’t think we’ve seen so much with younger players before<br /><br />I don’t think it’s easy, but I think it’s necessary that we try to forget that and move forward with this young group. I think that’s how we’re going to reach our full potential. It’s on not dwelling on what happened in the past, but focusing on what’s ahead in the future<br /><br />I was definitely very open to it. I’m not going to tell him ‘I don’t agree with what you’re doing’. It’s obviously how he sees it. The way he wants to play with the outside backs I think it does suit me better to play in the wing position in this formation. It’s a position where you’re high and wide and you get the ball and you go forward and attack, which is more or less what I do at Newcastle so it does have a lot of similarities to how I’ve been playing<br /><br />I’m definitely going to have to be a leader in this group. Just as I tried to be the last year with Dave (Sarachan)<br /><br />I think the biggest thing is people are going to be wowed by the growth. With the system Gregg has set up, and his goals for us over the next year, I think people are going to be wowed by the growth of this team. This team has the capabilities to learn so much and take in so much</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a>’s DeAndre Yedlin feels that VAR ruined his enjoyment of scoring the equaliser in Saturday’s victory over <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>]</b> I think so. Nobody wants to look stupid by celebrating on offside goal. But at the end of the day it counted. I just did what I had to do to get the ball in the back of the net. I know when <a href="allan-saint-maximin.html">Allan Saint-Maximin</a> has the ball in that situation and he’s coming back to shoot I need to take a gamble and come in. I didn’t know if it was on target, but I might as well make it on target. It managed to hit my head and go in. I didn’t really know much about it at first and I didn’t hear the crowd react, so maybe I thought it was offside. It went to VAR and fortunately it counted<br /><br /><b>[Yedlin was making his 101st appearance for the club, and spoke of his pride at achieving such a milestone]</b> I’m very happy because I never thought I would be here. Growing up in America and seeing a big club like <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> is something I never thought I’d get the chance to do. But to get 100 appearances for the club is an honour<br /><br /><b>[Seven of <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>’s last nine league goals have been scored by defenders, with centre-back Ciaran Clark netting the winner on Saturday to complete the comeback]</b> It’s because we have good guys for set-pieces, that’s one thing, the other is with wing-backs they can get on the back post and sneak in. The gaffer told me to get in there more. It’s been good</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT star Yedlin opens up on difficult start in <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>]</b> It was actually quite tough for me in the beginning. There were times when I was like ‘this is too much,’ the jump from <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> to here in all aspects of it, not just the football aspect. I remember being in my apartment thinking like, ‘I can’t do this, I want to go back.’ That just goes to show that money is not everything because I was much happier making whatever I was making at <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> - which was much less than what I was making at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> - but because life wasn’t giving me what I needed, I was depressed. It was a very tough first six months for me<br /><br />There’s a different energy to when you win/lose a game in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> to when you win/lose here. It’s that feeling that here, every game matters. Kids here are growing up knowing about relegation and how important it is and things like that. There, there’s just not that feel for it yet. If that got introduced, the league would be much more competitive. Something needs to be done to take the league more seriously, and I think that would be good<br /><br />I’ve learned a lot about myself and I think I’ve learned things about myself that I definitely wouldn’t have learnt if I wouldn’t have come over here. Hopefully we can all lead this charge of American players coming over here. As of right now, this is the best place to develop</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT defender Yedlin reveals emotional message from grandfather]</b> A couple days after George Floyd’s death, my grandfather texted me and told me he’s glad that I am not living in the U.S. right now because he would fear for my life as a young black man. As days have passed, this text from my grandfather has not been able to leave my mind. He was born in 1946, lived through the civil rights movement, lived through some terribly racist times in U.S. history, and now 70 years later he STILL fears for the life of his black grandchild, in the country he and his grandchild were born in. In the country his grandchild represents when he plays for the United States, in the country his grandchild represents when he’s playing in England. I remember being in elementary school, and having to recite the Pledge of Allegiance which ends ‘with liberty and justice for all.’ Every American needs to ask themselves, is there ‘liberty and justice for all’ and if their answer is yes, then they are part of the problem. In no way are we asking black lives to matter more than white lives. All we’re asking is we are seen as equal, as more than 3/5 of a man, as humans. My heart goes out in solidarity to George Floyd, his family, and all of the countless number of victims that have had their lives taken at the hands of meaningless police brutality.</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT star Yedlin hopes protests can change ‘embarrassing’ United States]</b> It’s chaotic and kind of a sh*t show right now. It’s so sad and I do believe that there will be change that comes from this. The younger generation are much more progressive in their way of thinking, having parents teaching them black people aren’t inferior. You can see it with social media and things like that, back in the day it was harder to convince people that the police are wrong, which sounds crazy, but that’s how it was back then. I think this is the tipping point and I hope it is<br /><br />I was fortunate to be raised in Seattle, which was amazing, but that doesn’t take away from the fact I was still a black kid growing up in America. As far as the riots go I am the last person to support violence but it’s like what else can you do? I don’t know what else people can do. I know people are looting and setting things on fire, they just want to create chaos but the ones that want to be heard, I don’t know what else they can do. When I saw Colin Kaepernick kneeling, I thought that will bring a change, that dug deep in the hearts of those that cause a problem kneeling during national anthem but here we are<br /><br />I was talking to my girlfriend since George Floyd’s death, I haven’t even thought about Ahmaud Arbery, that’s out of my head. As a young black American you become desensitised to it, it’s just like ‘oh, another guy, another kid died today’. That’s so, so sad cos we are talking about human life, the most sacred thing we have. I said I was going to come off social media until after we finished the season, but I felt I couldn’t just stay silent. I got a text from my Grandpa the other day. I’m glad you’re not here in the U.S. because I’d fear for your life as a young, black man. So I’m sitting here thinking, he was born in 1946, alive when Martin Luther King was doing his movement and through very serious times racially in U.S. history, 70 years later he still fears for his grandchild’s life! That text has been sticking in my head, I can’t get over it because my home country, when I pull on the U.S. jersey, I’m one of only two Americans in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, I represent when I am playing this is what people see. It’s been embarrassing and teammates say ‘bro your country is a shambles’ and it is, I can’t defend it. That’s actually so embarrassing for us, his whole presidency, how was he elected, it’s mind-boggling. You can really see now he is the worst possible person in a situation like this, he doesn’t promote unity at all, he wants division, which is crazy for a U.S. president such a powerful country. The fact that it’s been said by the face of our country is ludicrous</p>
