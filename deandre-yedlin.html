  <p><b>[<a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a>’s DeAndre Yedlin feels that VAR ruined his enjoyment of scoring the equaliser in Saturday’s victory over <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>]</b> I think so. Nobody wants to look stupid by celebrating on offside goal. But at the end of the day it counted. I just did what I had to do to get the ball in the back of the net. I know when <a href="allan-saint-maximin.html">Allan Saint-Maximin</a> has the ball in that situation and he’s coming back to shoot I need to take a gamble and come in. I didn’t know if it was on target, but I might as well make it on target. It managed to hit my head and go in. I didn’t really know much about it at first and I didn’t hear the crowd react, so maybe I thought it was offside. It went to VAR and fortunately it counted<br /><br /><b>[Yedlin was making his 101st appearance for the club, and spoke of his pride at achieving such a milestone]</b> I’m very happy because I never thought I would be here. Growing up in America and seeing a big club like <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> is something I never thought I’d get the chance to do. But to get 100 appearances for the club is an honour<br /><br /><b>[Seven of Newcastle’s last nine league goals have been scored by defenders, with centre-back Ciaran Clark netting the winner on Saturday to complete the comeback]</b> It’s because we have good guys for set-pieces, that’s one thing, the other is with wing-backs they can get on the back post and sneak in. The gaffer told me to get in there more. It’s been good</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT star Yedlin opens up on difficult start in <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>]</b> It was actually quite tough for me in the beginning. There were times when I was like ‘this is too much,’ the jump from <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> to here in all aspects of it, not just the football aspect. I remember being in my apartment thinking like, ‘I can’t do this, I want to go back.’ That just goes to show that money is not everything because I was much happier making whatever I was making at <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> - which was much less than what I was making at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> - but because life wasn’t giving me what I needed, I was depressed. It was a very tough first six months for me<br /><br />There’s a different energy to when you win/lose a game in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> to when you win/lose here. It’s that feeling that here, every game matters. Kids here are growing up knowing about relegation and how important it is and things like that. There, there’s just not that feel for it yet. If that got introduced, the league would be much more competitive. Something needs to be done to take the league more seriously, and I think that would be good<br /><br />I’ve learned a lot about myself and I think I’ve learned things about myself that I definitely wouldn’t have learnt if I wouldn’t have come over here. Hopefully we can all lead this charge of American players coming over here. As of right now, this is the best place to develop</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT defender Yedlin reveals emotional message from grandfather]</b> A couple days after George Floyd’s death, my grandfather texted me and told me he’s glad that I am not living in the U.S. right now because he would fear for my life as a young black man. As days have passed, this text from my grandfather has not been able to leave my mind. He was born in 1946, lived through the civil rights movement, lived through some terribly racist times in U.S. history, and now 70 years later he STILL fears for the life of his black grandchild, in the country he and his grandchild were born in. In the country his grandchild represents when he plays for the United States, in the country his grandchild represents when he’s playing in England. I remember being in elementary school, and having to recite the Pledge of Allegiance which ends ‘with liberty and justice for all.’ Every American needs to ask themselves, is there ‘liberty and justice for all’ and if their answer is yes, then they are part of the problem. In no way are we asking black lives to matter more than white lives. All we’re asking is we are seen as equal, as more than 3/5 of a man, as humans. My heart goes out in solidarity to George Floyd, his family, and all of the countless number of victims that have had their lives taken at the hands of meaningless police brutality.</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT star Yedlin hopes protests can change ‘embarrassing’ United States]</b> It’s chaotic and kind of a sh*t show right now. It’s so sad and I do believe that there will be change that comes from this. The younger generation are much more progressive in their way of thinking, having parents teaching them black people aren’t inferior. You can see it with social media and things like that, back in the day it was harder to convince people that the police are wrong, which sounds crazy, but that’s how it was back then. I think this is the tipping point and I hope it is<br /><br />I was fortunate to be raised in Seattle, which was amazing, but that doesn’t take away from the fact I was still a black kid growing up in America. As far as the riots go I am the last person to support violence but it’s like what else can you do? I don’t know what else people can do. I know people are looting and setting things on fire, they just want to create chaos but the ones that want to be heard, I don’t know what else they can do. When I saw Colin Kaepernick kneeling, I thought that will bring a change, that dug deep in the hearts of those that cause a problem kneeling during national anthem but here we are<br /><br />I was talking to my girlfriend since George Floyd’s death, I haven’t even thought about Ahmaud Arbery, that’s out of my head. As a young black American you become desensitised to it, it’s just like ‘oh, another guy, another kid died today’. That’s so, so sad cos we are talking about human life, the most sacred thing we have. I said I was going to come off social media until after we finished the season, but I felt I couldn’t just stay silent. I got a text from my Grandpa the other day. I’m glad you’re not here in the U.S. because I’d fear for your life as a young, black man. So I’m sitting here thinking, he was born in 1946, alive when Martin Luther King was doing his movement and through very serious times racially in U.S. history, 70 years later he still fears for his grandchild’s life! That text has been sticking in my head, I can’t get over it because my home country, when I pull on the U.S. jersey, I’m one of only two Americans in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, I represent when I am playing this is what people see. It’s been embarrassing and teammates say ‘bro your country is a shambles’ and it is, I can’t defend it. That’s actually so embarrassing for us, his whole presidency, how was he elected, it’s mind-boggling. You can really see now he is the worst possible person in a situation like this, he doesn’t promote unity at all, he wants division, which is crazy for a U.S. president such a powerful country. The fact that it’s been said by the face of our country is ludicrous</p>
