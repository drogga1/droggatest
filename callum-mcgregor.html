<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Callum McGregor says Celtic must ‘block out the noise’ as they try to secure record 10th title]</b> We are back in as a group and understand the challenge that is ahead of us. But the reason why we have been so successful in the past is because of the way we work, we take on game at a time, we don’t look too far ahead and the success has been built on that. We have to block out all the noise coming from everywhere else and just look at the next game. The boys have been pretty relaxed so far and I think if you start to get carried away with all the chat that goes on outside the camp, the only people that can make this happen for us is the guys inside the building and we have to stay focused<br /><br />We understand what is at stake but once you start looking too far ahead that is when things can quite quickly fall apart. So for us it is the same message. We have to stay calm, relaxed, we know how hard we have to work in training and preparation for the games and come a match day we have to perform every week to get the points and that is what we will try to do.<br /><br />There are two ways of looking at it. You would rather stay in your rhythm and keep playing and keep enjoying your football and at some point you might need an extended break. So from that point it was good that I never missed any games with injury or tiredness, so I think that it has probably worked quite well that the break has been there but you haven’t missed football as such. I am just desperate to get back playing football, as are the boys.</p>
