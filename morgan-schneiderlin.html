  <p><b>[Morgan Schneiderlin has ended his Manchester United exile by sealing a £24million switch to Premier League rivals Everton]</b> Everton is a big club in the history of English football. I’ve always loved the atmosphere in the stadium. I’ve always liked playing here. I can’t wait to play and to represent this great club. There is a manager in place here that I know, I know he can get the best out of me, I know his style and how he likes to play football. He was very good with me from the start and I enjoyed playing football under him. When I spoke with the manager and the people in place at Everton I understood immediately that they have a very good plan for the future of the football club. I just want to play football. I want to put my print on this club and do everything to get Everton where it belongs.</p>

  <p><b>[Morgan Schneiderlin scores stunner for Everton]</b> I wanted to go to an ambitious club, who could meet my expectations, especially in terms of playing time, because I wanted to get on the pitch. It’s a big Premier League club and the coach has great ambitions to bring them to the top six or even in the top five. It is interesting to me.</p>

  <p><b>[Morgan Schneiderlin has explained why he has chosen to wear the No.2 shirt at Everton after joining the club from Manchester United]</b> Number eight is my favourite but one of the great players here, Ross Barkley, wears that already. I respect him. I wanted to give the kit man a rest after putting Schneiderlin on the back. They wouldn’t want a big number after that! A lot of squad numbers had already been taken and number two was free. I couldn’t have 13 because of superstition and, after that, there was 36, 37, 38, which I think is too high. I will take the number two for now and, if it’s good for me, I will keep it..<br /><br />I want to help Ross. I want to help other players, that’s my thing. I am a defensive midfield player, I get the ball back and find a forward player and feed them. I like to link up with players around me. I believe Barkley plays the number 10 role, so he will be in front of me. I want to feed him and the other players as well. Hopefully he will be what he is for many years, a great player. It has been very difficult <b>[playing against him]</b> because he is the kind of player who can dribble with both feet. Ross can shoot from far, he can find some good passes, he is always in the box. You always have to concentrate because he can go past people. He is very strong in the upper body and in the legs and so it is very hard being up against him</p>

  <p><b>[He said of his time as a young man]</b> I was never a tackler. Of course sometimes I made tackles but not too many - only when I thought I could. I try to nick the ball when I can, think about what the opposition is going to do with the ball and try to make interceptions. People in the past have said I’m a good tackler and they just focus on this point. But, since I was very young, my first quality was with the ball at my feet and my range of passing. Coaches used to tell me I needed to improve my tackling but never my passing ability. That has always been the case for me. Now I feel confident, I feel in tune with the ball and that’s the most important thing. I’ve always been calm, I always try to find a good solution with a pass and never get too excited when I’m on the ball</p>

  <p><b>[Morgan Schneiderlin has admitted that a testing spell at Manchester United caused him to lose his joy of football]</b> I did lose my joy of football a little bit because when you don’t play, you don’t play with freedom and everything is very hard. Since I’ve come here the manager knows what I’m all about. He placed confidence in me in the past and he has done so again. It’s a joy to work with him every day. He knows how I want to play, he knows my strength and it’s a case of him giving the best product, if I can say, to be the best player I can. I’m very happy to find this joy of football again and hopefully it will carry on for me.<br /><br />We just want one thing today - to catch the team above us. That’s our main focus because it’s the only way we can improve every day. We’re going to try the Europa League for sure. The seventh place could still qualify us, so we are going to try to maintain this seventh place and be in Europe. But after that for us it’s just a case of trying to catch <b>[Manchester United]</b> because the most dangerous thing now is to be seventh and there’s nothing to play for because our performance will drop dramatically</p>

  <p><b>[Morgan Schneiderlin has accused Louis van Gaal of turning him into a robot at Manchester United]</b> This first year with Louis Van Gaal sticks in the throat. I didn’t take any pleasure on the pitch. He left me little freedom in my game, even though I have quite a lot of experience in the Premier League. With him, I felt like playing a robot. They said to me, ‘You must never go and get the ball in this part of the pitch, you must not do this, that’. These instructions may have disturbed me a little<br /><br />When a player wonders during a game - ‘But what does the coach want me to do in this situation?’ - he begins to be less efficient. Especially at Manchester United, in a context where all matches are scrutinised by the media and where one can quickly be criticised from everywhere</p>

  <p><b>[Everton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin happy with late-season resurgence at Everton]</b> I always believed in myself. I worked and I did what I had to do off the pitch to get back in the team. I had the chance to come back into the team against Cardiff (3-0 win on February 26) and then had a little injury which put me back. But since then I think I have done well and the team did well, too, so I’m happy.<br /><br />It’s always important to have consistency in our game. We’ve always had the quality. Against Tottenham, we showed if we concede the first goal, we can still play with confidence, with desire. Even if the first 20 minutes were not good enough, we didn’t let ourselves get down and we regrouped. We did well. That’s the most important thing, to learn from our mistakes in the past. That’s what we did, so fair play to everyone. Our last 25 minutes of the first half was good and we had some chances to score goals. In the second half, we were more compact with better organisation. We hurt them twice, but it was just a shame we conceded the goal that doesn’t allow us to take the three points. But it’s a good result against a top team. It’s good for the future</p>

  <p><b>[Morgan Schneiderlin admits to having endured a tough time at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> under <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a>]</b> I have mixed feelings. When I arrived at United, it felt like the club was in a transition period. With Louis Van Gaal, it was not easy to adapt to his methods. At <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>, I was very free in my movements. With him, I had the impression that he was trying to control everything, it was very rigid. I had a hard time accepting the fact that every pass I made, I needed to be able to explain why I had made that pass or move. In the game, I was not really released, it was not great and we had a complicated season.<br /><br />Mentally, I also took a shot because six months before, <b>[France boss]</b> <a href="didier-deschamps.html">Didier Deschamps</a> told me that I was a potential holder for him <b>[at Euro 2016]</b>. Finally, I did not play at all, so I only had 10 days of preparation when I returned to Manchester. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> told me that he liked my qualities and that he was interested in me when he was at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, but that there was <a href="ander-herrera.html">Ander Herrera</a> and <a href="marouane-fellaini.html">Marouane Fellaini</a> that he knew better and had better preparation, so I played very little from there.<br /><br /><b>[Schneiderlin added on his current situation]</b> I still have two years of contract and I am a bit divided. I arrived, I had a good performance, and the next season was a bit more complicated. For the moment I am intending to respect my contract, after that we will see. If the club wants to sell me and I am offered an interesting project, anything is possible. I mostly want and need to play, I feel that I have reached my best level physically, so we’ll see</p>

Maybe I jumped out of the boat too quickly when I didn’t play for three months. When I look at other players having a great career at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, they all had a spell of four or five months when they didn’t play<br /><br /><b>[The 29-year-old believes he is still an easy target for critics because of his style of play]</b> If you are in midfield, you are 1-0 down and your team has run after the ball for a minute and I try a long pass and miss it, people might clap because it is an attacking move, but my team-mates might have to for another two minutes to get the ball back. If we are winning 1-0 and I make a short pass that allows the team to breathe, people think it is clever. Some people say I pass square but I don’t see it. Look at <b>[Sergio]</b> <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Busquets</a> at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. I don’t compare myself to him but tell me the passes he does that I don’t? Because they win games, everyone says he’s the cleverest midfielder in football. Football is about perception.

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and France midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin has urged people to wake up to the severity of the coronavirus pandemic]</b> It is a tragic situation. I speak a lot with my mother who tells me it is a very difficult time for people who are working in hospitals, how much it takes from them mentally and physically. I try to support her as much as possible. People told me it was a bit relaxed <b>[back in England]</b>, that they hadn’t really realised how serious it was. They finally realised. But like in France, not everybody is respecting the rules given by the Prime Minister. It’s going to take a little time for it to get into people’s heads. They will adapt as they go along and see they have no choice but to stay at home given the seriousness of the matter<br /><br />They will make the best possible decision. Football comes second. We will have to adapt. The club has given us the date of April 17 to resume training. It seems pretty fair. We are prepared to play until August if necessary. I know it will be difficult with the end of contracts in June for some players. I hope that it will be postponed a little longer so I can play again this season<br /><br />I have been on crutches and immobilised since my operation. I still have two weeks to wait without being able to put my foot on the ground. My wife has to support me! When you have an 18-month-old child, it is hard to watch series on television. Since the weather was good for the past two days, we took advantage of the garden with the little one. He could run around. We play little games together.</p>
