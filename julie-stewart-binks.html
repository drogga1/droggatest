<blockquote>
  <p><b>[American sideline reporters add unique element to soccer games]</b> The access we get with MLS is unparalleled. Sideline reporters see things that no one else has the opportunity to see or hear - that’s why you’re down there. You have to prove why you’re useful. No one else has your vantage point, so show them what they can’t see and hear from TV.<br /><br />I have a very good relationship with an assistant on each bench and I’ve cultivated that over the last three years and I’ll go to them for information. If someone’s coming off, we’re not necessarily sure if it’s an injury sub or it’s tactical so I’ll go to them and ask: ‘Who’s coming on, who’s coming off, why?<br /><br />It’s instant information that in a European match you’re not going to get until either after the game or even days later<br /><br />I’m feisty, I definitely consider myself a pitbull. I’m going to go for information and I’m not going to back down if someone tells me no. Because that’s my job. My job isn’t just to be a PR mouthpiece, my job isn’t to hide an injury because a team wants me to, my job is to tell people what’s going on.<br /><br />I think people don’t realize how much goes into the scenes that you don’t see on TV. What we end up getting on TV is the tip of the iceberg<br /><br />It’s a bit of a thankless job in the way that you put so much into it and you might only be on TV for a total of a minute in an entire game, so you have to be OK with that. But if you are someone that loves news and loves reporting and really loves hustling for something that no one knows, then it’s an awesome job</p>
