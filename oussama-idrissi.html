  <p><b>[AZ Alkmaar winger Oussama Idrissi dumps Netherlands for Morocco]</b> I can not eliminate the feeling, but playing for Morocco was also a rational choice. Then the Moroccan football association reported and I was asked whether I saw myself playing in the Moroccan shirt, but I did not hear from the <a href="knvb.html">KNVB</a> anymore, because Morocco was on my way. I do not choose Morocco because I am against the Netherlands. I was born and raised here with the standards and values of this beautiful country, I am a footballer who I had to make a decision with my parents, and I wanted to get the most out of myself</p>

  <p><b>[Moroccan footballer Oussama Idrissi has expressed his gratitude for the support he received after he chose to represent Morocco instead of the Netherlands]</b> I am very proud and honoured that I will join the Moroccan National Team in the near future in sha allah! I will represent my country as a real Atlas Lion <b>[…]</b> as a Muslim you basically follow the culture of your father. And my father is Moroccan</p>
