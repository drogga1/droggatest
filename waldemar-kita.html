  <p><b>[Nantes president Waldemar Kita reveals he did not want to receive money for Sala]</b> The truth is, I don’t even want that money, and I may never get it. I don’t want to make money on someone who died tragically. I’m not interested in that<br /><br /><b>[When asked why he had therefore not brought the issue to a halt]</b> I am not involved at all in the case. The lawyers are in charge of it.</p>

  <p><b>[Ligue 1 should have been decided by standings at half-way mark]</b> We were the only ones with Amiens <b>[to defend this option]</b>. I think it was logical, we had done one part of the season and not the other, I think we had to do it like this or continue. I respect what was decided, even if I don’t find it very logical. It’s dramatic for clubs, you have to say it the way it is. We are prepared to find solutions but it is dramatic. Now, <a href="nantes-fc.html">Nantes</a> finished in 13th place, we could have finished much higher so, already, just on that, there is a shortfall, not to mention TV rights.<br /><br />I see that England will resume training next week, apparently they will end up behind closed doors. In Germany, in Austria, in countries in Eastern Europe, this has already started. Italy, Spain and Portugal also want to finish the season. Afterwards, I also have the impression that elsewhere the TV rights have not been questioned like here</p>
