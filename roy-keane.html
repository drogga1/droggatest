I thought, hmm, the dynamics are changing here. He said he had read my book. I felt he was thinking from the start that I wasn’t for him. He sort of knew this wasn’t going to be a long-term relationship<br /><br /><b>[When Sunderland slumped into a run of six defeats in seven games in October and November]</b> It started with a demand to know where I had been the previous day, that he wanted me available at all times. Then there were accusations about how often I came in, about moving my family up. And it was the tone. It didn’t upset me, what happened at Sunderland. It was a business decision. Even for me I suppose it was a business decision. I couldn’t give my heart and soul with this fella on my shoulder. That, I’m sure, is how he works.</p>

Was this the press conference that was done within half an hour of the private meeting with, what’s his name, the lad who organised the media? Piss-up in brewery springs to mind, but there you go.<br /><br />In defence of Mick, what was going on was a joke. I know when I became a manager myself I appreciated what a hard job it is. So for Mick to have had to organise even the training grounds, you’d have to go over and have a look at them and so on. And I’m sure that was part of the build up of pressure with all of us. When you’re a manager, trying to get footballers is hard enough, without having to make sure there’s footballs and training kits there<br /><br /><b>[Ahead of Ireland’s first appearance at a major tournament in a decade, Keane said he was glad to see a more upbeat mood from the team and added that <a href="james-mcclean.html">James McClean</a> should make the squad]</b> Personally I’d throw him in there. I know he’s young, but sometimes it doesn’t matter. He affects the game.

I don’t think he knows the meaning of the word. It doesn’t bother me too much what he has to say about me, but to constantly criticise other players at the club who brought him a lot of success, I find very, very strange. I just don’t think the manager needs to do it. I don’t know how many books he’s written now but you have to draw the line eventually, to say, ‘Listen, these players have all been top servants to Man United and a lot of these players helped the manager win lots of trophies’. Can you imagine if we never won a trophy what he would have said? We brought success to the club, we gave it everything we had when we were there</p>

People are on about a hostile atmosphere - brilliant, bring it on. Everyone seems frightened to death, particularly the media. There’s a lot of negativity. Strangely enough, I’m sure, if we qualify, you will be first to celebrate and have a jolly-up over there. From the players’ point of view and from the manager and the staff - we have got a top, top manager and we will be ready. I don’t know what you are worried about. The reason we play these games is to get involved in tough qualifying matches. It’s going to be tough, obviously, but, my goodness, we have got to look forward to the game. It’s a tough game, particularly away from home, but, from the angle I’m looking at, certainly over the next few days, we have just got to make sure we get our own act together, make sure we are right tactically and we pick the right team and, if we are at it, we can give them a tough game. I think every game is going to be vital for us. We have said since the draw was made no doubt Germany will be hot favourites but every minute of every game will be vital. There will be vital moments and starting with Sunday, we need to be ready. It’s a difficult start but we are ready for it. We will be ready on Sunday. That’s why you play the game. There’s nothing to be frightened of.</p>

  <p><b>[Everton are putting pressure on Seamus Coleman and James McCarthy to prevent them from playing for the Republic of Ireland]</b> I worry that <b>[McCarthy]</b> is under lots of pressure, particularly from Everton’s point of view. Every time an international match comes around, it always seems to be Seamus and James who are under pressure. They’re turning up or they mightn’t turn up, or they’re struggling. I think Martin has been more than fair when it comes to friendlies. These are big qualifying matches now. Ask most international managers and it’s a difficult role when a player turns up and he isn’t quite fit or he is struggling; we’ve had that a number of times with lots of players.<br /><br />It’s the big downside of international football: you have to be fair to their club and the player but you also want them out there representing your country. It’s difficult for James as well. There is a player between the two managers, I know from experience, they’re under pressure. You always get the impression from Everton that Seamus and James are both barely able to walk, that type of thing. So when they turn up and they’re walking through reception, it’s ‘Praise the Lord’. It’s a miracle. If it carries on next year, it’s going to put a lot of pressure on James. Roberto has never played at senior international level and maybe he doesn’t realise how big the games are for us. We could argue all day, I just think we need to get the balance right for the qualifiers. I think Martin has been more than good.</p>

From a selfish point of view, from an Irish point of view, you want players like Seamus playing in the Champions League and getting a taste of football at that level. Saying that, joining United might not mean Champions League at this moment in time.<br /><br />I’ve very little time for Mourinho. I look at United and the run they’re on now.

People talk about getting into the top four because of the financial rewards and it was great for teams like Leicester to qualify but for the big teams, Man United, Chelsea, Arsenal, celebrating fourth? I say shame on you.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United legend Roy Keane has slammed the side’s performance under Jose Mourinho this season]</b> They are now sixth in the league, I think they are 19 points behind Chelsea. The manager and the players should be embarrassed by that. For a club like Man United be as far behind Chelsea as they are, it’s an embarrassment. With the squad they have and the players they have, the money they have spent, it’s not good enough. Mourinho has come up with plenty of excuses over the last few months, but there is no reason why United should shy away from dealing with these challenges. For a club like Man United to win the League Cup and the Europa League, with the teams that are in it, you would expect them to do that<br /><br />Wayne needs to be playing regularly, to keep in shape and stay on top of his game. If Wayne is going to stay at United for the next year or two and play 10 or 15 games as season, it’s no good to anyone. If he is going to be a bit-part player at United then forget about it.

It goes to show where they’ve been all season, the amount of draws they’ve had. You can see tonight, just almost having that defensive mindset for the whole night.<br /><br />A team like Manchester United at home to Celta Vigo? Go and get the job done, win 2-0 or 3-0 - it was there for the taking. But they could not get to that level, which they’ve not done for most of the season. They need to be more ruthless. It’s not just tonight, it’s been all season. For a team like Manchester United, with the players they have on the pitch, whether the mentality is coming from the manager, you can make lots of excuses.

If you’re worried about the physical side of any sport, then play chess. It’s part of the game, whether it’s hurling or American football. You see the rugby lads. When you cross the line, there is an element of risk involved. They all want to play but know the risk. I’m sure there is research. But there is a chance you might get hurt. It is part of the game.

He feels it is right for him.<br /><br />It is part of the game, players picking up injuries. He is a centre forward and he gets a few knocks from centre-backs; I’m sure he has given out a few himself. It’s a physical game</p>

You expect big players to come on and change the game. He came on and did nothing. We saw with the first goal, his reaction to it was like a schoolboy. He doesn’t smell danger. The reason you’re part of a team is that when your team-mate makes a mistake, you cover for him and make up for it. No-one is helping each other and they’re not playing like the great United teams where you have to dig a result out even on an off night. They’re playing as individuals and don’t seem capable of being able to do that.<br /><br />When I played for United I always thought when you put on the jersey you felt great, enjoyed the history, the pressure, the badge and expectation from supporters. When I look at this team I get the impression they don’t enjoy the expectation and pressure. The goals were shocking ones to give away. I’m not surprised United lost because you don’t know what you’re going to get. The goals, oh my goodness, we talk about tactics and systems but the players have to do their jobs. That’s the least you expect<br /><br />The manager will take responsibility. When you see him getting interviewed he’s not shocked. He works with them every day and knows they’re short of being one of the best teams in Europe. They need some more players, they’re three or four players short. Some of them aren’t good enough but it’s not their fault. If you get selected of course you’re going to play for United but they’re short and their record over the last three or four years will tell you that. The worry for me was that the manager was saying him and his staff and the players won three trophies last season. My goodness, the manager was including the Charity Shield as a major trophy. My god, you know you’re in trouble</p>

Part of my make-up when I played with players was if my strikers are scoring 25-30 goals like Dwight Yorke, Andy Cole, we have to win trophies. Liverpool haven’t done that yet. If they end up winning the Champions League and he scores in the final, then start giving out the prizes. He still has to do a bit more for me and that is getting his hands on a trophy at club level.<br /><br />I can’t see it on that performance. Roma will be better at home but Liverpool tore them to shreds. They could have scored 10. Pretty straightforward tactics, get the ball forward early and let the attackers do the rest.

Now we don’t see what Pogba’s like on the training pitch or when they’re travelling to matches, but if the guy’s not pulling his weight it doesn’t matter who you are, he deserves to be left out.

I think <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> fans will forgive a lot of things once players go out and give their lot, with these new signings and the lads that have gone out the door, Ole had to make these changes and only time will tell if it will work.

But I still think it’s so early in the season, we’ve got to give these lads a chance to mature at the club.

When you glance back and look at some of the players, just as important as anything else - and we talk about what <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> might lack now - they were brilliant lads, brilliant team-mates to have.<br /><br />They were just great lads who were well grounded. I always felt at United that we always had a good dressing room and that’s not to say we didn’t have difficult days. I just always felt we had good characters. The manager would remind us every now and again before we’d go into certain big games, you are in the trenches are you happy with the lads around you? I’d always look around the lads in the United dressing room and go, yes<br /><br />They were all brilliant lads and that was a huge part of it. Could they play? Were they talented?

And when I played with <a href="paul-scholes.html">Scholes</a>, <a href="nicky-butt.html">Nicky Butt</a> and <a href="juan-sebastian-veron.html">Juan Sebastian Veron</a>, they were keener on getting forward so I just automatically started sitting a bit deeper, and I enjoyed that role as well because there are big demands on that role<br /><br /><b>[On that being the best Roy Keane during that era]</b> My contract was up so I thought I’d play for a new contract or if I leave <b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> on a free transfer, I’ll get a better deal somewhere else.

Players should not feel under pressure, particularly at the big clubs. I know everyone is different, different circumstances, but your contract with the club is a personal matter and this idea that all the players have do to this is nonsense, it’s up to the individual and if they want to stick to their wages, while they have a billionaire in the background, then do that.

  <p><b>[Keane: I didn’t have much in common with <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> and Ferdinand]</b> Your dressing room’s always changing, as most summers you have one or two new faces that come in. The dynamic changes as young players come in. To be honest, when I was getting towards the end of my career, I was looking around the dressing room and we had players like Wayne and <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a>, <a href="darren-fletcher.html">Darren Fletcher</a> and <a href="john-o-shea.html">John O’Shea</a> and things were changing. The dynamics were changing, and I always used to roll with it - I didn’t mind because it would give you a new type of energy, especially if they were good players who could help us win trophies. But towards the end, I remember thinking that with some of these lads, I didn’t get them and their banter, their humour. I was barely having a conversation with any of them, but I was constantly looking at the bigger picture of whether they were going to be good players for Man United. That was the most important thing. Even with Wayne and Rio, I didn’t get their banter and what it stood for sometimes. Towards the end at United, with the players that were coming through, I didn’t always get them. I thought personality-wise, they’re not for me. I was professional, and they were all very good players, so I was delighted to play with them, but in terms of having banter, a cup of tea or a coffee with them, forget it</p>

  <p><b>[Former club captain Roy Keane later revealed he advised Ferguson to drop his Rock of Gibraltar case against Magnier, but to no avail]</b> Somebody I met in Ireland had told me to tell him (Ferguson): ‘You are not going to win this.’ I mentioned it to him. And I told him that I didn’t think it was good for the club, for the manager in a legal dispute with shareholders. I felt I was entitled to say that. He was just a mascot for them. Walking around with this Rock of Gibraltar - ‘Look at me, how big I am,’ - and he didn’t even own the bloody thing!</p>

  <p><b>[Keane ‘sick to death’ of De Gea after <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> goalkeeper concedes against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>]</b> I’m shocked at that goal. I’ve watched a lot of football over the years, but to give away that goal, I’m fuming here watching this game of football. I am sick to death of this goalkeeper. I would be fighting him at half time. There’s no getting away from it, I would be swinging punches. It’s a standard save for an established international goalkeeper. I am flabbergasted. I can’t believe Shaw is heading the ball up in the air and running forward. I’m staggered at <a href="harry-maguire.html">Maguire</a>, that an international player, you can’t get done like this.<br /><br /><a href="harry-maguire.html">Maguire</a> and De Gea, I wouldn’t even let them on the bus after the match. Let them get a taxi back up to Manchester. These are international players, we can analyse the game until to the cows come home. You do your job, we’re trying to get onto the top four, God forbid about winning trophies. I’m disgusted. <a href="harry-maguire.html">Maguire</a>, De Dea, hang your heads in shame. You’re playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and you’re letting players run past you? Get close to people, move your feet. De Gea. The most over-rated goalkeeper I’ve seen in a long, long time.</p>

  <p><b>[Roy Keane has taken aim at Republic of Ireland assistant manager Keith Andrews, stating that the former WBA and <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> midfielder is a bullshitter]</b> If I can make one point about new Irish staff. I’ve heard a lot of bullshitters over the last 10 years and Keith Andrews is up there with the best of them. Sometimes I was too hard. Sometimes I was too soft. If I was critical, looking back on my own career and how I dealt with people, even in management - and people mightn’t believe this - but I reckon that sometimes I was too nice to people.

Even pre-season, any game I ever took it easy in, I guarantee you I was the worst player on the park. I couldn’t do it. I just couldn’t do it. It just wasn’t in my make-up … I had to be full pelt. If I lightened up too much in football, I would never have got to England. And if I did, I wouldn’t have lasted two minutes</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> still at least a ‘year or two’ away from competing with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> &amp; <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>]</b> They’re a few players off yet. They have obviously strengthened but the league table doesn’t lie. Look at their points total. I know people say they’ve had one or two decent results - against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - but it’s all about the points. So, no, I don’t see United competing in the next year or two for the league. I think there’s going to be improvement and they will close the gap, but there is a bit of work to be done for Ole and the players. They’re missing something. They haven’t been consistent enough<br /><br />People have analysed it and said United’s strength at the moment is on the counter-attack. But the problem has been when they had a lot of possession; breaking teams down. With one or two players coming back, United will certainly be pushing to get that fourth position but trying to get fourth and winning the league is a big leap. They need one or two players. I think United are short at the back</p>

  <p><b>[Roy Keane says <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> ‘can get <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> competing for titles’ if he adds consistency to his game]</b> Obviously <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> has had his critics because he is so talented. If you are not performing week in, week out people are going to get on your back. I always say there is a compliment in that. People know he’s an outstanding talent but for some reason, it hasn’t gelled. He obviously had the injury problem this season. Just because a player is having a difficult time doesn’t mean they aren’t giving their all. Sometimes a player might be carrying a few knocks. Players lose a little bit of confidence<br /><br />Everyone is quick to criticise <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> for his off-the-field stuff, but let me tell you if <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> was winning week in and week out for United people would tolerate his off-the-field activity, his social media activity. The key for <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, if he wants to become a really important player for Man United, is consistency. It’s no good turning up every two or three weeks and producing your piece of magic. I think he is more than capable of doing it, he has done it before. But do it week in and week out and get Man United competing for titles. I have a lot of time for him. I think he’s a talented boy</p>
