  <p><b>[Everton legend Alan Stubbs believes Jurgen Klopp only has himself to blame for Liverpool drawing the Merseyside derby]</b> I would have been delighted when I saw Liverpool’s team yesterday. It’s not to say that it was a considerably weaker team, but when you don’t play your best players in a derby … A lot of Liverpool fans would have turned up to the game thinking, ‘what’s he doing’? This is a derby, it’s not just another game, and I think foreign coaches sometimes don’t get it as much. He’s got only himself to blame really.<br /><br />I honestly think with those players <b>[Coutinho and Firmino]</b> on the pitch it would have been really hard for Everton to get a result. No disrespect to <b>[Dominic]</b> Solanke but, if you put Coutinho up there, as a defender you’re thinking, ‘oh, no’. The movement is completely different, the link-up play is different, the speed is different. Klopp has got to hold his hands up, and I think he did that after the game. When he was questioned about his team selection he said, ‘I appreciate that, that’s my department, I’ll take it <b>[the criticism]</b> if that’s the case’, but he certainly looked a frustrated man. And he’s got only himself to blame.</p>

  <p><b>[Alan Stubbs believes the 37-year-old will hold his own and look to stamp his authority quickly on a squad that has rather lost its way of late]</b> He’s got an opinion, he had that as a player. He wasn’t afraid to say something if things weren’t right on the pitch. He’s got a very strong opinion of how he wants to play and how he wants to manage. He’s one of them, who if somebody crosses him, I don’t think he’d have a full-blown argument with them, but they won’t be at the club long. I think this is where the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> hierarchy have really got to back Mikel, if it is Mikel <b>[who gets the job]</b>. There are obviously a few big personalities there who will try and run the dressing room, I think we all know who the difficult ones are without even saying, and Mikel will have to cycle through them very quickly. The club have got to back him to say OK, if that’s a problem, get them out no matter what wages they’re on</p>
