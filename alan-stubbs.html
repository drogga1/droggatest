  <p><b>[Alan Stubbs says Talk of Manchester United plotting a £50 million ($63m) raid on Aston Villa for John McGinn comes as no surprise]</b> It’s no surprise. John has gone from strength to strength every time he has stepped up from club to club. His move from St Mirren to Hibs was what he needed and then in going from Hibs to Aston Villa he has really taken his game to another level and that’s all credit to him.<br /><br /><b>[Celtic had been in the running to land McGinn prior to his move to England in 2018, but Stubbs claims he was never really Brendan Rodgers’s type of player]</b> John’s not really a pretty or elegant player. He’s a bit of a rough diamond, a throw-back, the sort of player that’s missing from the game. There’s too many of those players who look the part rather than those who play the part<br /><br /><b>[It could be argued that £50m is rarely spent on players of that ilk]</b> To be honest, the figure is irrelevant, it’s only what someone is prepared to pay for a player. But what you can say is that John’s very much on an upward curve</p>

  <p><b>[Alan Stubbs believes the 37-year-old will hold his own and look to stamp his authority quickly on a squad that has rather lost its way of late]</b> He’s got an opinion, he had that as a player. He wasn’t afraid to say something if things weren’t right on the pitch. He’s got a very strong opinion of how he wants to play and how he wants to manage. He’s one of them, who if somebody crosses him, I don’t think he’d have a full-blown argument with them, but they won’t be at the club long. I think this is where the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> hierarchy have really got to back Mikel, if it is Mikel <b>[who gets the job]</b>. There are obviously a few big personalities there who will try and run the dressing room, I think we all know who the difficult ones are without even saying, and Mikel will have to cycle through them very quickly. The club have got to back him to say OK, if that’s a problem, get them out no matter what wages they’re on</p>
