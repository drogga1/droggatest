  <p><b>[Paolo Maldini on Maradona]</b> <a href="diego-maradona.html">Diego Maradona</a> was not only the greatest player but also the most honest. He was a model of good behaviour on the pitch - he was respectful of everyone, from the great players down to the ordinary team members. He was always getting kicked around and he never complained - not like some of today’s strikers</p>

  <p><b>[Paolo Maldini on Steven Gerrard]</b> What I have always liked of Steven is that on the pitch he was very quiet, but was capable of inspiring all his teammates with great strength, not so much with words. His story is one of those stories to be told, one of those fairytales - just like it happened to me - to be narrated to your children and grandchildren. I still remember his face <b>[in Istanbul]</b> and the pain he was in from cramp but he was still going around tackling everybody. He put everything into it. For you guys, he was an example for all the others. I think Steven has been and is an absolutely complete player, because he had personality, technique, he could set the play and also defend, and he could score goals - penalty-kicks, free-kicks. So really a modern, complete player. I have a very clear memory of the final we lost in Istanbul, when he was helping his teammates with difficulties in defence. He started playing at the back and tackled every single player of Milan. But I must say that what probably made the difference was his example for all his teammates</p>

  <p><b>[Paolo Maldini on his son]</b> Daniel Maldini is a playmaker, a goalscorer, a No.10. Of the family, starting with my father and coming to my son, he is the only one with those attitudes. He is more of a poet with the ball. He’s a little ambidextrous like me. In him, I see my character and see myself physically by how he moved as a child. A bit like the people who saw my dad in me.
