  <p><b>[Paolo Maldini on <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>]</b> <a href="diego-maradona.html">Diego Maradona</a> was not only the greatest player but also the most honest. He was a model of good behaviour on the pitch - he was respectful of everyone, from the great players down to the ordinary team members.

  <p><b>[Paolo Maldini on <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>]</b> What I have always liked of Steven is that on the pitch he was very quiet, but was capable of inspiring all his teammates with great strength, not so much with words. His story is one of those stories to be told, one of those fairytales - just like it happened to me - to be narrated to your children and grandchildren. I still remember his face <b>[in Istanbul]</b> and the pain he was in from cramp but he was still going around tackling everybody. He put everything into it. For you guys, he was an example for all the others. I think Steven has been and is an absolutely complete player, because he had personality, technique, he could set the play and also defend, and he could score goals - penalty-kicks, free-kicks. So really a modern, complete player. I have a very clear memory of the final we lost in Istanbul, when he was helping his teammates with difficulties in defence. He started playing at the back and tackled every single player of Milan. But I must say that what probably made the difference was his example for all his teammates</p>

If he had been on the opposite side, it could have gone differently. There isn’t a big difference between the two teams. Real Madrid had on their side a winning mentality and a high-quality squad. Juventus came really close - many times you need a bit of luck and Juventus was never very lucky in the finals.</p>

  <p><b>[Paolo Maldini insists that AC Milan dominated the 2005 Champions League final against Liverpool]</b> Yes I think I watch the Istanbul game again for the first time after a year. It was then I realise how well we had actually played. We dominated the game for about 110 minutes out of 120 total. But football is that type of sport and sometimes it’s cruel. It reminds me of how strange and peculiar football can be<br /><br />Let’s say that playing in that <b>[Athens]</b> final was a bit of a gamble. But as I knew it would be my last chance to play in a Champions League final, I did everything I could to be there. That’s why, after two days spent celebrating, I went to Belgium to have knee surgery. I think the strength of that group was being able to reach the final again in a 2007 season that wasn’t especially great. Once we got there we had everything to lose really, because if we lost again to Liverpool then it would be something very difficult to erase</p>
