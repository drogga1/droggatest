  <p><b>[Federico Chiesa has offered an indication as to where he could end up if he leaves Fiorentina for the Premier League]</b> I really like <b>[Leroy]</b> Sane. He plays for Manchester City along with other great champions of the calibre of Kevin De Bruyne. They play beautiful football and I like the way Sane interprets the role. So I enjoy watching Sane, but also Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and other wingers who with hard work have achieved remarkable objectives. I’ll say Sane, though, because he is only a year older than me. To see a player of this age doing so well in a team that is targeting Champions League success is wonderful.<br /><br />I don’t know, because I am focused on training and the weekend’s game, so I don’t look beyond the fixture list. The rest will come when it comes<br /><br />I never supported a club as such, but I was very passionate about the Milan full of champions, with Ricky Kaka always being my idol. It was Kaka, Andriy Shevchenko and the others. I really liked watching that Milan side</p>

  <p><b>[Federico Chiesa, Fiorentina’s NxGn hotshot with big shoes to fill]</b> I’m just thinking about proving my value all the time, even if those numbers <b>[€60m]</b> seem a bit exaggerated. My only priority is to show, Sunday after Sunday, who Federico Chiesa is. I’m happy here at Fiorentina. I’m only thinking of the next game</p>

  <p><b>[On his journey]</b> For two or three years, I really struggled to get any playing time, as my physique wasn’t as well-developed as others my age. When you are 14 or 15 years old, it feels like this desperate disappointment. I thought many times about giving up, but my family always believed and ultimately so did I. When I wasn’t playing, I’d try to think: I’ll play the next one. Working hard in training really paid off. It’s the push that got me to Serie A and now has me trying to improve week by week. It’s the same attitude as Cristiano Ronaldo. He doesn’t have the talent of Messi, but has won the same number of Ballon d’Or trophies. An exemplary professional like him proves if you want to reach the top and stay there, focusing on every tiny detail is crucial.<br /><br />It is a strange feeling if you think about it, but that is my secret: I don’t consider the transfer market valuation at all. I just try to focus on doing well on the pitch. Fiorentina will be the ones to evaluate any offers if they come in. I am only in my third season as a professional football player, so I’ve achieved nothing yet</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> have insisted that Federico Chiesa will not be sold during the summer transfer window, amid ongoing speculation over a potential switch to <a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a>]</b> We read continuous news spread by others about the future of Chiesa and where he will play next season. The current owner is keen to point out that Federico is a <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> player tied to the club by a long contract and therefore, as far as we are concerned, Chiesa will play in Florence next year and must be the symbol for the team that will be built.</p>

  <p><b>[Federico Chiesa, who scored his first international goal in the rout, praised Mancini for the positive impact he has had on the side since taking charge 18 months ago]</b> We enjoy it on the pitch during a match, we enjoy ourselves in training, and it’s a pleasure to be here. Coach <a href="roberto-mancini.html">Roberto Mancini</a> drilled that enthusiasm into us from the first day, he told us we are a strong national team and we’re proving it on the field. The coach asked me to play like this, to move constantly, be positive, attack the space and be open to receive passes. I just do what the coach asks. I quite rightly feel good, especially after my first goal! I still have a lot to do in order to earn my place at the European Championships</p>
