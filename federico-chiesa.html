  <p><b>[<a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> have insisted that Federico Chiesa will not be sold during the summer transfer window, amid ongoing speculation over a potential switch to Inter Milan]</b> We read continuous news spread by others about the future of Chiesa and where he will play next season. The current owner is keen to point out that Federico is a <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> player tied to the club by a long contract and therefore, as far as we are concerned, Chiesa will play in Florence next year and must be the symbol for the team that will be built.</p>

<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have been informed that <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> have no intention of parting with Federico Chiesa, with <a href="rocco-commisso.html">Rocco Commisso</a> vowing that his club ‘won’t make the same mistake as with Roberto Baggio’</p>

  <p><b>[Federico Chiesa, who scored his first international goal in the rout, praised Mancini for the positive impact he has had on the side since taking charge 18 months ago]</b> We enjoy it on the pitch during a match, we enjoy ourselves in training, and it’s a pleasure to be here. Coach <a href="roberto-mancini.html">Roberto Mancini</a> drilled that enthusiasm into us from the first day, he told us we are a strong national team and we’re proving it on the field. The coach asked me to play like this, to move constantly, be positive, attack the space and be open to receive passes. I just do what the coach asks. I quite rightly feel good, especially after my first goal! I still have a lot to do in order to earn my place at the European Championships</p>
