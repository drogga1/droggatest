  <p><b>[Vinnie Jones says Wimbledon’s FA Cup final triumph over <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> still my favourite football memory]</b> It’s a massive part of my life, in 1988 when we beat <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. It’s something you never forget, something nobody forgets - we’re quite a few years on now and it seems like yesterday. It probably ranks, in football terms, as number one. I played in the third round at Wealdstone as a non-league player, and it was massive for us then. And a couple of years later, there I was beating the mighty <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Jones praised the Wimbledon fans for their part in the lively atmosphere at Wembley, despite playing in front of a crowd which was largely made up of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> supporters]</b> It was a sea of red for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, and there was this blue section, I’m sure our fans were <b>[outnumbered]</b> four, five to one in the stadium that day, but they never stopped singing all the way through, from start to finish.

  <p><b>[former Wales international Vinnie Jones the latest to attack Raheem Sterling’s performances]</b> I know there’s been a lot of criticism for Sterling. He is getting in all the right positions, but sometimes you look at Sterling and you think, if he didn’t have that pace he’d be playing for Exeter or someone.</p>

  <p><b>[Vinnie Jones &amp; <a href="paul-gascoigne.html">Gazza</a> recall iconic crotch grab]</b> It was a spur-of-the moment thing and it definitely wasn’t planned ahead of the game. But an old under-12s manager of mine had once told me, ‘Just grab ‘em by the balls if they get too close’. And that had obviously stuck in my mind. So I just reached out and I was spot on. There was no fiddling about… straight on the button and I didn’t let go. And to be fair to the boy, he had a bit of luncheon on him</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea’s stars won’t win trophies because they aren’t a team]</b> In my day, if I was the captain, I would have gone over to him and said: ‘Get your backside off! If the manager wants you off, you’re off, mate!’ But no one seemed to do that. With the old Chelsea boys when I was there, Wisey (Dennis Wise) would have probably grabbed him by the top of the socks, but I would have got him by the scruff of the neck and dragged him off<br /><br />The guy came for £71m, they’re not going to go too nuts on him, are they? They’ve got to have him in the next game, it’s an important game against Tottenham so I think Sarri has taken a bit of a sidestep to try and save face</p>

  <p><b>[Vinnie Jones says in reference to his films]</b> I hope you enjoy me bashing the s<strong>t out of some of them prima donna actors. I do love it. It’s not a profession it’s actually a hobby - beating the s</strong>t out of ‘em’<br /><br /><b>[In his 2013 autobiography, It’s Been Emotional, Vinnie wrote]</b> That incident <b>[kissing Russian singer Lama Safonova outside a Moscow bar]</b> caused the biggest test of my 20 years of marriage. We’ve been through everything and this angel is still there for me through thick and thin…I had risked everything that mattered to me over a stupid night out in Russia<br /><br /><b>[His love: The footballer-turned-actor, 55, shared a throwback image with wife Tanya, who passed away from cancer aged 53 last year, while penning an impassioned message about sobriety]</b> That is the lowest I’ve seen Tans in all the time we have been together… Now I know we have a lot of work still to do, but we both love each other more than anything on the planet and that is getting us through. That is why, for the first time in my life, I have started seeing a psychologist. I have virtually given up drinking alcohol. I’ve been going to see (my psychologist) once a week for eight months. For an alcoholic to combat problems, he or she has to admit to those problems first.’<br /><br /><b>[Speaking to The Guardian after he quit drinking]</b> The less I drink, the more my anger fades. I think that’s how it started in the first place. My parents got divorced when I was young, and alcohol seemed to trigger everything off. The problem’s not the bottle - it’s the case. I’m the case or nothing, last man standing. I haven’t had a drink for six months<br /><br /><b>[His sobriety anniversary comes ahead of the release of his new book]</b> I have written this book to honour the life of my extraordinary late wife, Tanya, and to help people going through grief find a way forward. Losing Tanya has been the worst thing that’s ever happened to me and her family and friends, but I don’t want her loss to be in vain. She would have wanted all of us to help others navigate their grief because she was always trying to help people in her own life<br /><br />Losing Tanya has been the worst thing that’s ever happened to me and her family and friends, but I don’t want her loss to be in vain. I’m very proud to have written this book, and I hope it both honours who Tanya was, and gives comfort to readers who have lost someone. It is rare to find a book that elicits such a strong and emotional reaction. I am full of admiration for the strength he showed and continues to show, in sharing his vulnerability so candidly. I hope this will be a book that helps people in the depths of the unspeakable find an outlet for their grief.</p>
