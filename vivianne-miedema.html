  <p><b>[Netherlands women vs Sweden women. Vivianne Miedema says their current run in the competition was beyond their expectations]</b> We have done amazing and we can be really proud. We have been complaining a lot that we have not played the best football but in the end we are in the semis<br /><br /><b>[A strong Gunners core has been the secret to the success of the Dutch, with <a href="danielle-van-de-donk.html">Danielle van de Donk</a>, Dominique Bloodworth and Sari van Veenendaal both turning out for the London club last term]</b> Obviously it is really easy because we have been playing together for two years. I just need to look at Dominique Bloodworth and I know where she is going to play the ball. It is the same with DVD, we just have that connection. It helps me a lot and it helps our team a lot, and I am happy that we have got that</p>

  <p><b>[Vivianne Miedema says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> targeting Women’s Super League &amp; cup double]</b> Obviously it’s a big challenge but I’ve had this situation before. I did it at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> <b>[Munich]</b> and obviously we’ve felt that pressure at Holland, non-stop, when we play a European qualifier. It’s something you probably need to get used to, but I think we’ve got a stronger squad than we did last year and a lot of confidence as well going into the season.<br /><br />Our main focus will always be winning the league and I definitely think we’ve got the quality to do that. But it’s going to be harder. For me, there’s only more hunger. I want to win the title again. I go to clubs because I want to win titles<br /><br />Like I said, I believe that our team is stronger than it was last year and I hope everyone stays fit. We’ve got more players we can use and that <b>[means]</b> we don’t just <b>[have to]</b> focus on the league. Obviously, we want to win the league, but we also want to win a cup. That’s probably our main goal this season<br /><br />I think it’s going to be, especially for the bigger clubs who’ve got a lot of players going to the World Cup and coming back from it, it’s going to be a hard season. It’s managing players all season long, everyone comes back in a different state. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> have lost a couple of players, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have not lost anyone and have got some players in… I’m really excited to see where it’s going to go next year. I think it’s going to be a tough league<br /><br /><b>[Few are better placed than <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s No.11 to assess what impact they will have on the Gunners, then]</b> They’ve got experience. I think Jill is a very creative midfielder that we kind of needed and the others girls are just really decent players. You know that they always turn up. When you need them, they’re always there. That can only help us, especially with the amount of games we’re going to have, it’s good to have a bigger squad that can give 100 per cent every single game. That’s really going to help us compared to what we had last season</p>

  <p><b>[Miedema masterclass reminds <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> of huge WSL title challenge despite win over <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I used to be the playmaker but now I’m responsible for scoring goals. That’s a different type of pressure but it’s one that I’m really enjoying. I’m not an out-and-out No.9, I like to think I’m a mix of a No.9 and 10.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal star Miedema scores six and assists four in record-breaking WSL performance]</b> I think I’m not bothered about scoring goals at all. I’m not going to put that pressure on myself, no. It’s not the type of player I am. If I need to put on paper what my goals are for this season it will always be winning the league with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> or winning the cup with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. If trophies and individual awards come that’s absolutely fine but I don’t think it ever has to be the main focus.</p>

  <p><b>[We want to challenge for the Champions League]</b> I don’t think it’s realistic to say that we need to win or that we need to challenge for the Champions League this year. We’ve obviously just come back this year. We do have a really strong team but we’re not comparable right now with a <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>. I think my main goal is going somewhere that I can grow together with the club and help the club grow and that’s obviously the choice I made at the time when I joined <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, but also the choice I made when I came here. I could have gone to clubs that was probably set up a lot better and who wanted to win the Champions League but I’m here because I wanted to build something. That’s what we’ve done, that’s what we’re still doing. We’re obviously not there yet but you can see that we’re getting better and stronger every season</p>

  <p><b>[Miedema finishes superb 2019 in style]</b> I would say I play more like a 10. I know I have my goalscoring qualities, but I like setting people up. I like to drop and pick up the ball and see if I can send someone through on goal. I like to see if there is someone in a better position than me. I am not bothered if I don’t score for one or two games if I know I have assisted others or that I have played well<br /><br />I think my main goal is just going somewhere that I can grow together with the club and help the club grow and that’s the choice I made when I came here. I could have gone to clubs that were probably set up a lot better and who wanted to win the Champions League but I’m here because I wanted to build something. That’s what we’ve done, that’s what we’re still doing. We’re obviously not there yet but you can see that we’re getting better and stronger every season. I think that’s my biggest motivation</p>
