  <p><b>[Arkadiusz Milik says he isn’t expecting to be underestimated by Arsenal]</b> No, I don’t think that anyone is underestimating me. I play for Napoli, which is a great team. These are fan discussions and I don’t want to feed that debate, because I just try to give my all for the team. But fans love to discuss and debate things like this, that’s what fans do. It’s completely normal and happens all over the world, fans from every team say: ‘this guy isn’t good enough’ or ‘this player is way too good’. That’s how football works. No <b>[I’m not frustrated]</b>, not at all. I’m already used to it<br /><br />I’ve seen it two or three times. A lot of fans have sent me the clip of the goal on Instagram as well. So I could watch it again on there. I was happy obviously, but I didn’t think too much about it. We won the game and that is the most important thing at the end of the day. That’s the only thing that matters once the match is over<br /><br />The hardest time for me was after the first <b>[knee]</b> injury. They told me that the recovery period would be very long, so that was the hardest moment I have gone through during my life. I truly believed that I would not be able to return to playing at the level I am now. In the end everything went the way that I wanted it to go, though. I’m still here at Napoli, I’m growing as a footballer and I’m getting playing time. That’s what helps me keep a smile on my face. The second injury was easier to deal with because after three or four weeks I was already walking normally. So I was confident that I would be able to play again, that I could come back and would be running around the pitch again. Therefore I was much calmer and time went by quicker</p>
