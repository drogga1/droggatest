  <p>Sam Mitr spokesman <a href="thanakorn-wangboonkongchana.html">Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana</a> said Thursday that former transport minister <a href="suriya-jungrungreangkij.html">Suriya Jungrungreangkij</a>, a key figure of the group, has confirmed he will lead 70 members to join Palang Pracharath. Mr Thanakorn said the 70 members comprise 30 former MPs, and 40 local politicians, businessmen and new-generation people with ‘illustrious backgrounds’<br /><br />The Sam Mitr group, seen as the regime’s recruiting arm, has been accused of working to secure a political support base for the newly-established Palang Pracharath by poaching former MPs from other parties, many of whom previously belonged to the Pheu Thai Party<br /><br />Sam Mitr members are largely split into three camps. The first faction is made up of former MPs from the North, the Northeast and the Central Plains. The second faction is full of members with ties to the regime, while the final faction features those who are closely acquainted with the group’s stalwarts, according to a source</p>

  <p>The source said the wrangling over key cabinet portfolios among the Palang Pracharath’s coalition partners is over, and that the Bhumjaithai Party is likely to take control of the Transport Ministry with Saksayam Chidchob – the younger brother of Newin Chidchob, the de facto leader of the Bhumjaithai Party – being transport minister<br /><br />The PPRP’s Sam Mitr (Three Allies) faction was reportedly unhappy with the allocation <b>[transport minister for Saksayam Chidchob]</b>, as it wanted to reclaim the agriculture and transportation ministries from the Democrats and Bhumjaithai</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Deputy Prime Minister <a href="prawit-wongsuwan.html">Prawit Wongsuwon</a> said on Thursday he will start work as the Palang Pracharath Party’s chief strategist next Tuesday, and a priority will be to look into the government being defeated for a second time during voting in the House on Wednesday. Gen Prawit, speaking at the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, said he would look into how it came about. The problem must be solved<br /><br />The coalition government, which has a narrow majority in the House, lost to the opposition by 11 votes during debate on the wording of a parliamentary regulation on Wednesday. The coalition mustered only 223 votes to the opposition’s 234 when MPs decided the wording of a regulation on when the terms of members of the House whip committee would end<br /><br />The government supported retaining the criterion the committee members’ jobs would end when the House ends its term or ceases to exist ‘for other reasons’. Two MPs from the opposition Pheu Thai Party disagreed with the wording, saying it implied a coup. The constitution stipulated the House would serve until it either completes its term or is dissolved. The opposition prevailed on the wording</p>
