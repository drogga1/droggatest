  <p><b>[Arsenal and England legend Kenny Sansom believes Kieran Gibbs Is <a href="ashley-cole.html">Ashley Cole</a>’s Successor For England]</b> Kieran has all the raw materials, and all the attributes, to become a top-class England full-back - but I can’t see him taking over from <a href="ashley-cole.html">Ashley Cole</a> for another two or three years. There is no point in moving Cole aside while he is at the top of his game, and Kieran still has to go through the same learning process that <a href="mike-ashley.html">Ashley</a> went through at a similar age with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I played in a team with Graham Rix in front of me - he liked to drift inside and left space for me to get forward in wide positions, and I’m confident Kieran would fit into an England team set up like that tomorrow. But he would have to adjust, and curb his instincts to get forward, if he was playing behind an out-and-out left winger, so he has to keep learning his craft - and he couldn’t wish for a better place to learn it than <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Switching from one full-back position to another]</b> I felt <a href="glen-johnson.html">Glen Johnson</a> stopped learning when he went to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, and it was only when he joined Portsmouth, and <a href="harry-redknapp.html">Harry Redknapp</a> told him ‘You aren’t the finished article yet, son’, that we saw the best of him. <a href="micah-richards.html">Micah Richards</a> is another one who is probably going through the same process now. He was unbelievable when he broke into the England set-up three years ago, but he’s had to take stock and hopefully he is ready to push on again</p>
