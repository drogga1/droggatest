At the age of 23, I always believed he had the possibility of becoming the best No 9 in world football because he has absolutely everything. When you work with Rom, you understand he lives for the games. It’s all about football in his life. He always wants to do more in training. Rom is the goalscoring threat. From the age of 21 to 23, he has changed a lot. He wants to improve, he works on hold-up play and using his body. He has been working on his movement in the box</p>

  <p><b>[Roberto Martinez paid tribute to <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> following his two-goal display in Belgium’s 3-0 win over Scotland]</b> I appreciated the love fans have shown towards this national team and Romelu in particular. He is a boy who has been very successful these last three seasons. He creates opportunities and scores a lot. I see him very disciplined, and during this international break he has displayed a lot of desire. Sometimes, I’m sad when I see that Romelu does not take advantage of his play on the pitch.<br /><br /><b>[De Bruyne was the standout performer in the match]</b> It’s not a single player match, everyone contributed to this victory. Kevin did indeed have a big influence, he was both active and patient. But Eden Hazard was also very important, taking responsibility, while <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> made the net shake twice. When I see how Thorgan Hazard is progressing - he was not even in the 23 at the beginning of my term - how <a href="thomas-meunier.html">Thomas Meunier</a> held 90 minutes after Timothy Castagne’s match, I think we have plenty of options, and that’s fine.

  <p><b>[Belgium coach Roberto Martinez has revealed what makes Eden Hazard such a formidable prospect on the pitch]</b> He is so short he uses his arse to get out of one-to-one situations that other players cannot. It is his centre of gravity. He’s got bags of quality and a great eye for football; and that allows him to always take the best decisions up front. Another thing he has is that he’s not affected by emotions, not even what people say about him. He is very calm and quiet.<br /><br /><b>[Martinez has no doubt that Hazard will take Spain by storm]</b> He has evolved a lot, but his biggest progression is in terms of personality. Belgian football has given him a huge responsibility, and he has reacted great to it. Eden was the star, the captain of the team that finished third in the World Cup - and now we know he is ready to lead any project. There are a lot of famous names around, but you have to look into the essence of the footballer, how he influences his team. He is a gem because he has bags of quality and plays within the structure of the team. He is at the same level as Neymar or Mbappe</p>

  <p><b>[Roberto Martinez says <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a>’s goalscoring record should have earned him more respect in England]</b> Romelu hasn’t been appreciated for most of the time he’s been in the British game. And the reason is very clear. Everyone analyses what he hasn’t got as a number nine. Everyone wants to tell him the first touch should be better, that he should be stronger in the air, that he needs to make more room. But what they miss is his outstanding trade as a goalscorer. Look at his stats. He is one of the most significant scorers at his age. Like any player, if you are going to highlight the things they don’t do well, you wouldn’t get the feeling of a good player. But in Romelu’s case, he’s always been a top goalscorer<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether there is a better midfielder then Kevin De Bruyne in world football]</b> No, no, no, definitely not. Kevin De Bruyne is a modern playmaker. <a href="xabi-alonso.html">Xabi Alonso</a> at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> - when they received the ball, everything had to slow down and this allowed them to execute the pass.

It’s true that he was sad with the episode he had to go through but I’m sure that’s something everyone in football will try to help him and the environment to eradicate. There’s no tolerance for that. I think Romelu is one of the modern footballers that he was born with the attention with the media following him at the age of 16 in Belgium.<br /><br />He had a media crew following around. They followed the expectation of a team having to win at Anderlecht with the Champions League participation. Then he had a big transfer to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, then he had time at West Brom before a big transfer fee to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>.

I thought the first 15 minutes against Russia is the best I’ve seen Scotland for many years. From their intensity, the intent, the quality in the wide areas to be able to get a really good formation and get players in good positions. Then there is the emotional side. Sometimes you have something to lose and you start performing in a different manner. We have to be very, very careful.

I think he’s in the best moment of his career. This campaign has started with a freshness and real driven feeling of playing at his best and when he does that he’s as good as it gets. There’s no other midfield player that can create space, a playmaker that can execute the passes that he does. It’s a joy to see him fitting into the group. It’s fair to say today was a big win for us. It’s a big, big step. We need to keep getting tighter as a group and keep getting better<br /><br /><b>[While in career-best form, the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> star was coy when asked if there were any other players in the world performing as well as he has been]</b> Fortunately I don’t have to judge that. I just have to play well. I’m just content. I’m feeling good. I have already played many matches and am starting to come into my rhythm. That is important, because there are still many games to play. When your career is over, you can see what you have done afterwards. But right now I just want to win competitions. The faster we do that, the better. That can also be very important for the rest of the season<br /><br />It wasn’t just the quality of play - we know the quality we have. Today we had to be very good in many aspects. We had to work very hard off the ball - Scotland are growing into becoming a technical team. We had to be clinical and the first goal shows you that. From then on, it was very easy to switch off.

So, getting a historic result at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> could be the start of a new campaign. It really is more important than a Merseyside derby - Merseyside derbies are very special but I think in this case there’s a lot to win for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. I was a manager in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> for seven consecutive years, 255 games, and I know that things can change very quickly. The season can change and probably you need an outstanding result that sets the tone and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> could be the place<br /><br />It’s only 13 games into the season. Obviously it hasn’t been a real bright start in terms of getting the points that probably <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, with the investment, would expect to get in this initial third of the season. Still, it’s one third, and sometimes you need to go through pain and trauma as a team to become strong again. The time to make the assessment will be more at the end of the season and see how the campaign has allowed the team to gel together and become as strong as it can</p>

He was aware that he wanted to improve his performances and somehow be at his natural level. I have watched it with great pride. To see Thibaut have to continue working and reach the level he has reached is because he is perfectly prepared to be in <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s goal. The easy thing would have been to throw in the towel or start blaming third parties when you’re in such a difficult situation. Thibaut did the opposite. He showed great maturity, great self-criticism, to the point of becoming essential at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. There are no goalkeepers like Thibaut in modern football. It has been a source of pride to see him grow so much on a human level and give the level he has given this season<br /><br />I think Eden has had a very good reaction to the operation, you always have to be very aware of how it adapts and how it happens each week. The signs have been very positive. Now he has had the opportunity to focus, to recover without having the anxiety of wanting to be on the field of play. There are no games, there are no Euros… it is something that has benefited us. You have to understand that there will be other players who, one more year in their careers, can bring them a difficulty to be in the squad. At the team level, you always have individual cases that favour you and that do not favour you. In Eden’s case, let’s hope he can be back on the field again if <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> resumes before the end of August. I am very confident that Eden will be able to enjoy football again before the season ends</p>

Straight away you get that sad feeling of a football institution, which means so much to the community and its fans, that goes into administration. In Wigan Athletic’s case it was an even bigger shock. You need to look back at the change of ownership in November 2018, you’re talking about 19 months. This is a wonderful family club that had no debt whatsoever, had fantastic assets with the two training grounds and a stadium, and all of a sudden is in a situation to go into administration. So I was totally shocked<br /><br />It has been an inspirational club for many families around the north-west, but other clubs as well, that things can be achieved if you plan and work well, that you can play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, reach Europe, and engrave your name in the most famous cup competition in the world.
