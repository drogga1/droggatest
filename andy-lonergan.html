  <p><b>[Fellow <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> goalkeeper Andy Lonergan says Alisson is the best goalkeeper in the world]</b> Firstly, as a person, he is the most humble guy I have ever met. Ever. As a goalkeeper, there is no-one in the world near him. He makes everything look easy and he can do absolutely everything. You might watch Match of the Day and see him make one save, but if you watch him for 90 minutes and see what he does to affect the game, his decisions, his handling, his passing. Everything is outstanding<br /><br />I don’t want to say just being among this group is enough because if I don’t train well I am disappointed and I want the next day to come around so I can put that right. A ‘well done’ from the lads, a ‘you’re on fire today’ shout … that’s the reward for me. That’s the reward. It could be from <b>[Mohamed Salah]</b> or <b>[James Milner]</b>. That is another motivation because if you are on their team, say <a href="james-milner.html">Millie</a>, <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Hendo</a> <b>[Jordan Henderson]</b> or Virgil <b>[van Dijk]</b>, you don’t want to let them down. You have to perform because they are not shy of giving you a rollocking.<br /><br />That is just the standard. If Mo gives the ball away, they are going to be onto Mo. That is why they are doing as well as they are. The standards are ridiculous. You get people and players at clubs who say: ‘See him, he’s not a trainer, he doesn’t fancy it, he just plays on a Saturday.’ Well, here, if you don’t train, you don’t play. Simple. The professionalism is unbelievable. I have been guilty in the past of thinking: ‘They’ve got it easy those <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> boys. They are not playing every midweek, they have the best travel etc’. But the schedule is absolutely relentless and add to that the training is never less than 100 per cent. The training pitch is where they make the Saturday easier. It is like the boxer who says hard work is the camp, the enjoyment is the fight. It is the same here.<br /><br />My friends will say: ‘Who is not the best person? Who is this or who is that?’ I mean this: it is the most honest, down-to-earth squad that I have ever been in. People might find that hard to believe, but they are such genuine, good lads. There is just one goal for all of them. We win on Saturday and on Sunday morning we have a five-minute meeting in the dressing room and the gaffer is like, ‘next game.’ That is what it has been like all season. Win the next game. The title has never been mentioned, never been mentioned at all, we just focus on winning. Some of the lads</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool goalkeeper Andy Lonergan has been singing the praise of Alisson]</b> Me and Kirky <b>[Chris Kirkland]</b> speak about him with other goalkeepers and I say ‘However good you think he is, he is better than that’. You watch him on a Saturday or in the Champions League and you think he is brilliant, but there’s just so much more to it than that. He’s technically the best. Everything he does is the best but his mentality and his sort of calmness… I can’t put into words how good he is. It’s just a joy to be part of the squad that he’s involved in<br /><br />It’s been brilliant. It’s obviously strange with the procedures that you have to go through to get on to the training pitch, but once you are on the pitch as goalkeepers you are working at a distance and it’s safe enough anyway so it’s back to normal. No settling in period, just straight into it. There is me and Alisson and the two goalkeeper coaches on one pitch, four or five on the other and the other half of the squad come in an hour or two later. When everything has been cleaned up and disinfected, then they come in so that’s how it’s working at the moment</p>
