  <p><b>[on Tony Adams]</b> <a href="tony-adams.html">Tony Adams</a> was the captain of the best England team I’ve ever seen - Terry Venables’ Euro 96 side - as well as four <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> title-winning teams, bestriding the eras of <a href="george-graham.html">George Graham</a> and <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>. Adams was the best purely defensive defender England have ever produced - an absolute rock for the Gunners and the only player to captain a title-winning team across three different decades. If a young <a href="tony-adams.html">Tony Adams</a> were to come on the scene now, any club in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> would be happy to pay tens of millions for him</p>

  <p><b>[Quote on Sir Bobby Charlton]</b> Some say <a href="bobby-charlton.html">Bobby Charlton</a> was a scorer of great goals, rather than a great goalscorer. Yet no player has scored more for England and no player has scored more for its greatest club, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>.<br /><br />So his 49 goals for England and his 249 for United can’t all have been 25-yard thunderbolts - it just seems that way in the mind’s eye. When he hammered one into the top corner from long range it was as if he were a man possessed, desperate to separate the leather casing from the bladder.<br /><br />I made virtually all of my 57 England appearances alongside Bob and I can remember few greater competitors and few greater professionals. His fellow greats like Best and Moore did not lead blameless lives away from the game but Bob was dedicated to his craft.<br /><br />His sainted image made it difficult when you played against United though, because although I never heard him swear at a referee, Bob would moan at them constantly and they would be so in awe of the great man that they’d usually do as they were told.<br /><br />I can remember, more than once, yelling: F***ing hell ref, why don’t you just give Bobby the whistle, you might as well! But this is a man who survived the Munich air disaster in 1958, won the World Cup in 1966, the European Cup in 1968 and played a key role in the appointment of <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a> as Old Trafford manager in 1986. He’s history in the flesh is <a href="bobby-charlton.html">Bobby Charlton</a>. He’s our greatest living football man</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on John Terry]</b> He may be one of the most controversial players in the history of the British game for non-footballing reasons but <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> has been one of its most reliable and consistent performers out there on the pitch. A defender’s defender - unbelievably solid with such a none-shall-pass attitude - Terry has been the captain and linchpin of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s recent golden years</p>

  <p><b>[Legendary former England and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> striker Jimmy Greaves has returned home from hospital to continue his recovery from illness]</b> We are delighted to let you all know that Jimmy is now back at home recuperating with his wife Irene. He has been very ill and we are hoping he will be fine going forward. I’ve spoken with his sons and they have asked for the press to respect his and the family’s privacy at this emotional time and we sincerely hope there will be further good news in the weeks to come. If and when there is any more news we will let you all know. Thanks to the thousands of you that have sent goodwill messages. We love that so many of you still hold Jimmy so dear to your hearts and it’s lovely to know that there is still so much love for him in the World.</p>

  <p><b>[Greaves son Andy also confirmed the news while speaking to the media and expressed his gratitude towards the NHS workers who have been treating his father over the last week]</b> Mum was delighted to welcome Dad home last night and we can’t thank the doctors and nurses, and all the NHS staff who cared for him, enough. He hasn’t been a well man for some time but the way he keeps fighting everything that comes at him continues to make us proud. As well as all those who have cared for Dad in the past week, and in the past five years, we would like to thank the public for their support. Dad has been touched by all the messages we have been able to pass on - it means a lot to him and to us as a family</p>
