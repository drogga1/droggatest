<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Baltemar Brito on his team mate <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> at Rio Ave between 1980 and 1982]</b> He was an attacking midfielder, usually playing behind the target man. He had great ability, but what may have held him back is that he already had his life sorted in a way at the time - his mother was a teacher, his father, a coach.<br /><br />Our impression was that football was like a hobby for him. Although he enjoyed playing it, he was a bit lazy, he didn’t work as hard as he should have done physically. He did what he had to do and that was it. He didn’t go the extra mile. He wanted the easy life, to have the ball at his feet; he was not willing to go to war for that. Perhaps, this is what stopped him from being a better footballer. I don’t think he came to Vila do Conde to play, but rather to spend some time at a Portuguese league club, have this experience and also kill some time while his university plans were on hold. He wasn’t there to fight for a place in the team - he didn’t have that ambition.<br /><br /><a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> bagged a lot of goals for the reserves. He was always asking for the ball. When we didn’t pass it to him, he moaned a lot - he was a bit annoying on the field.</p>
