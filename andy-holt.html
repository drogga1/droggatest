  <p><b>[In a series of tweets, however, Stanley owner Holt strongly criticised <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s stance]</b> He’s a disgrace. I’ll never understand why top clubs and top <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players don’t stand up and stay united with clubs and players further down the pyramid. This is pure selfishness of the highest degree<br /><br />I’d drag myself out of bed to play the replay. Because it’s the right thing to do. I wouldn’t give a sh*t how tired I was. I’d do the right thing. I’d give a bit back instead of being a grasping, selfish type<br /><br />We spoke about <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup and how top <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> <b>[clubs]</b> would rather be playing exhibition matches in China building their profits and brands. That’s why <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> were considering significantly increasing the first prizes far more than the earlier rounds proportionately<br /><br />We have only just given up 5th round replays. They’re back for 4th round replays. They join in the 3rd <b>[round]</b>.<br /><br />Jurgen, @LFC, you’re embarrassing yourself. You’re tarnishing your reputation. Rethink where you go from here. You’re killing <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup. There’s calls to kill the Carabao Cup. You’re killing us<br /><br /><b>[For lower-league sides like Shrewsbury and Accrington, the domestic cup competitions represent a vital source of income in terms of prize money, gate receipts and matchday earnings]</b> The FA are bending over backwards for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. It is their fault. They should know: ‘Give them an inch and they’ll take a mile’. The bigger issue is @LFC undermining the success enjoyed by @shrewsweb who DESERVE their day in the sun and a proper pay day</p>
