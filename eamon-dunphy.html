<blockquote>
  <p>[Eamon Dunphy has hit out at Martin O’Neill’s decision to exclude Damien Delaney from his latest Republic of Ireland squad] It’s not right that the Irish team should be deprived of a player because of personal differences. It’s wrong. This guy is playing in the Premier League, he’s a very good player. He’s been in the Premier League all year.<br /><br />We have Paul McShane, who’s playing for Reading and he’s not a very good defender. The guy at Derby County [Richard Keogh], not a very good defender and has had a couple of nightmares. And, we’ve got a Premier League player and we’re not even putting him on the plane? That’s not right for the fans, the other players; this guy should be in the team really, and he certainly should be in the squad<br /><br />I think Damien felt that he was never going to be a first choice at the time and declined to go to America. I mean that didn’t augur too well, whatever he says about it, he said that he would make himself available if he had a decent chance of getting into the squad, or into the team. I wasn’t in the position to actually make those decisions. I couldn’t guarantee anybody in the side. So we went our separate ways at that time<br /><br />It’s not right that the Irish team should be deprived of a player because of personal differences. It should not be happening. This guy is top class. We don’t have any Premier League defenders apart from John O’Shea- the other guy is injured, from Stoke [Marc Wilson] So, something is not right there</p>
