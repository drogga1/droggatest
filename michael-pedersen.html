  <p><b>[Michael Pedersen says ‘Extraordinary’ <a href="martin-braithwaite.html">Braithwaite</a> can shine for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> We haven’t seen Martin play a lot for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> because of the corona break, but he is much more a <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> type of player than many may believe. He has the tactical ability to fit into different tactical set-ups depending on the clubs he has represented in his career so far, and I know that he can play with a vision and anticipation in his game that is quite extraordinary. He is very good in that phase of the game, where he can see options that a lot of other players don’t see, where he can create space for other players, which is quite rare, since most players focus on creating space for themselves. His timing in his runs is amazing, and he anticipates the dangerous areas to attack into before they appear. Good players run into the danger areas as soon as they see them, but the best players spot the areas, then they wait with their run until the perfect moment with the maximum effect - that is football intelligence, and Martin has that ability. This is why he is a <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> player, in my opinion. And this is why I am looking forward to watching him play for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> when <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> restarts because with such great team-mates, he will have a great possibility to show his skills at the very highest level.<br /><br />Martin was very ambitious as a teenager and I could see huge potential in him. He wanted to hear about my own experiences not only as a coach but also as a player - and especially my time in Spain. We talked and worked a lot together in Esbjerg. I’m happy with what he has become and happy that I could help him to focus on taking the right decisions and develop in the right way to play in the big leagues<br /><br />My Denmark U17s have a lot of the same mentality. I have worked with them very much in the same way that I worked with Martin. I’ve seen many talents hit a wall when they have faced a tough time in football, and believe me, all players will face tough times. So I prepare them for that with my coaching methods, and this group of players have reacted extraordinarily well to my philosophy, developing a unique winning mentality, and that’s why this team have won 22 out of 23 games - against some of the best countries in international youth football. I have been asked whether this is the best Danish youth national team ever, and I can only say, that we have delivered some of the best results ever, if not the very best. I also qualified for the Euros with my first U17 team due to a great collective understanding of teamwork, but this team have been unique. Together we have created a level of winning mentality, teamwork and team spirit that has allowed the stars of the team to shine and has made a very deep squad hit an extremely high international level. Some of the players are already playing abroad at clubs well known for talent development - <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>, Salzburg and Leipzig - and they chose not to go to even bigger clubs because they felt these sides provided the best environment to improve. Many players have said ‘No thank you,’ to big international clubs because they believe they could still develop in Denmark, but I am sure - and I know them well - that many of them have the potential to go far in international football and will move abroad in the next few years. It is such a shame that this extraordinary team lost their chance of a great, maybe historic result at the U17 Euros this year because of the coronavirus.<br /><br />It was an opportunity to show the result of my coaching work to the international football world. I must admit that I had hoped to be able to do that since I am now quitting the Danish FA and this summer will be able to move on to new challenges and ambitions in football. I am proud of not only the results, but also the way we have won all these games. We have played to our own strengths, almost always having most possession. We are good with the ball even against the greatest football nations, but we can also change our style and still win. When, for example, England were trying to overpower us playing very quick, physical and aggressive football. As a coach you seek inspiration from the best, and for this team I have taken inspiration from both <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>’s passing and possession game and from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, who have developed in such an impressive style under <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> and are now able to play with a high tempo, high pressing and direct, but also with a lower press, being more possessive and creating wins out of that. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have mastered multiple ways to win and that shows great coaching work by Klopp</p>
