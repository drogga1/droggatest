  <p><b>[<a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> stars walking fitness tightrope as football returns]</b> We have noted a lot of players are doing long-distance running to keep fit because that’s what they have access to. Not every player has a home gym. So we are seeing that they are now about 60 per cent on sprinting, accelerating and decelerating, from what they do in a training session or match. They can’t replicate that in <b>[home]</b> training. That’s where the data is incredibly valuable. It isn’t just about preventing Covid-19 spreading through the squad - the sports science is about building match fitness to reduce the risk of injury. Normally you would have a pre-season over six weeks and be able to spread the minutes out across the players. Now you have got such a short window to get ready, this is where sports scientists and physios come into their own. You need to ramp up the intensity, but any ramp up in intensity is going to risk injury. I think that the clubs who manage that the best will be the most successful.<br /><br />It is inevitable that muscle and soft-tissue injuries will happen because match fitness has not been replicated in lockdown. We have already seen it in the Bundesliga<br /><br />I think medical teams will be on high alert to withdraw players on the slightest of tweaks or pulls in matches and that’s where the five substitutions come into play to allow them to do that. Players recover faster when taken off early<br /><br />We will see novel or innovative ideas from clubs in recovery from matches as smaller teams usually have a week between matches, so we will see a lot of active recovery rather than high-intensity training sessions before games<br /><br />Sadly, it is inevitable that there will be injuries, but these guys are in the best hands</p>
