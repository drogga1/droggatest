  <p><b>[Liverpool’s €160 million sale of Philippe Coutinho has proved to be incredible business]</b> I know fans were worried it was the wrong move but that kind of money means it is good business. And I don’t think there are many players Klopp has bought or sold in his time at the club you would say was a terrible buy, or who we are missing. In fact, I would hold my hands up and say his transfer business has been incredible. He has not turned his squad over or brought in a massive influx of players. And his approach is good for the dressing room. That is another reason why the fans should trust him - he knows what he is doing whether it be tactics, on the training ground or in the transfer market.<br /><br />You cannot say they are better without him <b>[Coutinho]</b>, because we do not know where they would be in the Premier League if he had stayed - but they have definitely adapted. There is more emphasis on the front three to create more for themselves now, because they haven’t got Coutinho behind them to create for them. And there is a better balance to the team too. Everyone is talking about the difference <b>[£75m defender]</b> Virgil van Dijk has made - and he has been immense at the back - but having another midfielder who is more defensive-minded than Coutinho has definitely helped as well. Liverpool have been improving as the season has gone on anyway, and there are several reasons for that, but it will have taken people by surprise that they have kicked on the way they have since selling Coutinho. They obviously believed they could deal with him leaving - and they have</p>

  <p><b>[Istanbul 2005 brings only a grimace, the memories those of disappointment rather than delirium]</b> My opinion of the club changed. When I hear Istanbul described as the greatest night in Liverpool’s history, it leaves a bit of a sour taste.<br /><br />I was supposed to be in the squad. The squad used to be put up on the board at Melwood, a squad of 18, and a couple of days before Istanbul the squad went up and I’m on the list. I’ve never got changed so quickly in my life! I got a shower, got in the car and was on the phone to everyone telling them: ‘I’m going to Istanbul, in the squad for a Champions League final!’ I was over the moon. Then about two hours later I get a phone call from Pako <b>[Ayesteran, assistant manager to Rafa Benitez]</b> saying they’d made a mistake on the list, and that Josemi was in instead of me. I couldn’t believe it<br /><br />The worst thing for me was it had happened before, earlier in the season. We had been due to play Tottenham at Anfield and I was not on the squad list. I was due to report for training on the Saturday and I went out for a mate’s birthday on the Friday night. I got to Melwood, put my boots on to train and the squad arrived for their pre-match walk. Rafa says: ‘What are you doing?’ I told him I was training and he told me I was starting against Tottenham! I had to tell him I’d been out the previous night and he kicked off at me, saying I was unprofessional. We had a disagreement and I ended up on the bench against Tottenham. So for the same situation to arise with Istanbul, but obviously in a far bigger game, was so frustrating<br /><br /><b>[the non-playing members of the squad were left behind, placed on a separate plane so as to accommodate the starters’ wives and families]</b> That was unforgivable. I can remember watching it on Sky Sports News and thinking: ‘What’s going on?!’ A couple of lads did their own thing, got taxis and caught up to the bus and got on, but the rest of us just went home. We got a half-hearted ‘sorry’ when we went back to training after the summer and that was it. For me, that night spelt the end of my career at Liverpool, because of the way I was treated. It changed my opinion of the club because there are a host of people who could have handled things better. We may not have played, but we were part of that squad and should have been treated as such. For Rafa, during that season it was all about ‘the squad’ and everyone was in it together. Then after Istanbul, it became almost as if those 18 players had won the Champions League alone. When really others had played their part. Mellor had, Pongolle had, Le Tallec had, Scott Carson had. It wasn’t just me who felt that way. I know Neil Mellor and Sinama-Pongolle felt the same. It’s sad that a night like that can be tainted over something that could have been handled much better<br /><br />I was at Aston Villa and Gerard Houllier was the manager. We had had a falling out and I had been bombed out of the side and told to train with the youth team. Then in the January <b>[2011]</b>, Kenny Dalglish wanted to sign me on loan with a view to a permanent deal. I wanted to go, but whether I am right or wrong, I always felt <b>[Houllier]</b> made it very difficult for me to go back to Liverpool, almost like there was a jealousy that I was getting the chance and he wasn’t. It was like he got one over on me. That was one of my biggest regrets in football. I would have taken a pay-cut to go there, but my agent at the time never relayed that fact to Liverpool. He was just in it for himself. It never happened and I regret it.<br /><br /><b>[On Andy Robertson]</b> Nobody saw it, did they? But he’s such a good player and he’s been brilliant since he arrived. He has made himself indispensable. He’s got everything, he’s good at defending, his delivery is one of the best in the league, he’s quick, aggressive and he suits the way Liverpool play completely. I’m made up for him. It’s very difficult to become a crowd favourite as a full-back, but he’s got that. He has won everyone over so quickly. He’s the Scotland captain now, which is great for him. He’s proven he can do it at the highest level<br /><br />I have a few regrets. But you can’t dwell on them too much. I look back on what I achieved, the games I played, the clubs I played for, playing for my country, and I can be proud</p>

  <p><b>[Daniel Sturridge could be Liverpool’s secret weapon in the Champions League this season]</b> We are talking about having a £50m player at your disposal because he is potentially a world-class striker. Of course, it is important that he knows his role at the club because if Liverpool’s front three of Sadio Mane, Firmino and Mohamed Salah are in form, they are still going to play most of the games. But all players need a rest, especially when you are in Europe and the games come thick and fast, and there are going to be times when Sturridge, and others, will get their chance.<br /><br />When you are in that situation as a player, and it looks like your days could be numbered, there is only a way back if you really want it. Having that desire is the big thing that Sturridge demonstrated, long before he scored the opening goal at Anfield on Tuesday. In pre-season, when Reds boss Jurgen Klopp wanted to see him fit and hungry, his attitude was exactly right. I watched him a lot and his performances were impressive too. That is why Klopp handed him his first start in a Reds shirt since November 2017 because, when you get Daniel fit and firing, you cannot ignore him</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah is out of sorts for Liverpool]</b> I just don’t feel that the Liverpool’s front three are clicking in the same way they have done in the past. Sadio Mane was outstanding against PSG, and was the one Liverpool forward who looked up for the fight. He got into some good areas, ran at his full-back whenever he could and tried to make things happen. But Roberto Firmino was very poor. He did not hold the ball up, or do his usual job of bringing other people into play. Too many passes were misplaced, and his touch was not great. And I know everyone is talking about Mohamed Salah being back in form, but I don’t see it myself. I still think he is out of sorts - he is trying to play as an individual and is not enough of a team-player - and that was the case on Wednesday night too.<br /><br />As good as Liverpool’s midfield three are at protecting their back four and making it difficult for the opposition, they do not get forward much. That is the biggest difference between this season and last, and is part of the reason why their defensive record is so good. Every time Liverpool go forward now, James Milner and Georgino Wijnaldum hold back when, previously, the team would have midfield runners going beyond their front three. That occupied opposition defenders and freed up space for Mane, Firmino and Salah - but it does not happen as often anymore, and it is an element they have lost from their attack<br /><br /><b>[Warnock said of a supposed long-ball approach from the Reds]</b> Instead of the dynamic and intricate inter-play we saw from them last season, when they were trying to find the front three with 10 or 15-yard passes, they are playing balls up to them from 30 or 35 yards instead. That is not the kind of play you would associate with Liverpool but it is a change Klopp made in pre-season and he has carried it through the start of this campaign. It has been effective in the Premier League - Liverpool are second, still unbeaten and have only conceded five goals in their first 13 games - but it has not worked for them away from home in Europe</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah will come good for Liverpool]</b> I think everyone is talking about it and we expect him to score for Liverpool. But off the ball, he is creating chances for the likes of <b>[Roberto]</b> Firmino and <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane to score, by dragging more players on to him. The midfield have dried up a bit behind him but he will come good, he keeps on getting in the right areas.<br /><br />For Liverpool to get that psychological edge of points on the board, after a big result against Tottenham, it could be big. I think Liverpool have been fortunate in the last few months, the Jordan Pickford error, the Julian Speroni error - they have been fortunate with goalkeepers making errors, and the Lloris mistake could be a pivotal error. For Liverpool fans, it is amazing to win a game like that. I still think both teams are going to drop points. I think the games Manchester City have - playing Tottenham three times in a week <b>[Champions League plus Premier League]</b> - plus they have to try and get a result at Old Trafford. Manchester United’s form has dipped a bit but in a derby it will go out the window. So, I think <b>[the Southampton]</b> game is massive. Ralph Hasenhuttl has changed Southampton’s approach and it will be a tough game</p>

  <p><b>[Warnock weighs in on Crystal Palace Wilfried Zaha’s failure at Old Trafford]</b> He wasn’t in a good place. I met him in the chairman’s office. We were talking to him and it was obvious how he felt when he had been let down by Manchester United. When I spoke to him I could understand why. He was only a young lad then, he needed help and an arm around the shoulder. It didn’t appear that he got any of that. That is what you do, you go away, rekindle that enthusiasm. He has always had tremendous skill and in the next few years I am sure he will go to one of the top few clubs in Europe</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Warnock says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s recent experience in European competition gives them the edge over <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> in this year’s Champions League final]</b> <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s experience of having been in three European cup finals in three years will be key because they know what to expect in the build-up to the game and the hype around it, the expectation. I think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have that advantage. I look at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and think they can beat them, but the biggest fear is getting beaten by them. That is the biggest worry because to get to a Champions League final and then get beaten by another team from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is a tough pill to swallow.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>’s men overcame <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> in dramatic fashion in the last four]</b> There is always that pressure that if you lose you’ve lost the Champions League final - you’ve got to swallow that for the rest of your life. But they’re quite a youngish squad and they might think they may not have this opportunity again in their careers. Reaching the Champions League final is a great achievement and they might think the ‘pressure is off, enjoy the game’. That’s the way I think you have to look at it when you are playing in an event like this. You try to put it to the back of your mind and play with freedom.<br /><br /><b>[Warnock also compared the current <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> squad to the one which won the 2005 Champions League under <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafa Benitez</a>]</b> The difference in this squad and our squad at the time is that they have built momentum over two or three seasons. They are real contenders and they have got goals all over the pitch. It’s not that we relied on one player, but if you look at <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>’s performances, it was often if he played well, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> played well.

  <p><b>[Stephen Warnock says <a href="andy-robertson.html">Andy Robertson</a> is arguably the best left-back in the world]</b> Both Andy and Trent on the other side had incredible seasons. I think last season with the protection that Andy got from the midfielders, whether that be <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a>, <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a>, <a href="gini-wijnaldum.html">Gini Wijnaldum</a> or <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a>, he knew he was able to make those runs forward without leaving gaps behind him. When he is going forward, the quality of delivery he possesses is brilliant. You see a lot of full-backs or wingers who get in a good position and they panic and try and overhit the ball. But the one thing you see with <a href="andy-robertson.html">Robbo</a> and Trent is they don’t panic and they have composure; they slow themselves down in those positions and their quality comes out.<br /><br />The biggest thing for me with <a href="andy-robertson.html">Robbo</a> is - and I know everyone talks about his assists and quality going forward - defensively he is superb. Your modern day full-back can often attack, but can he defend? <a href="andy-robertson.html">Robbo</a> can do both comfortably and for me, and I’ve said it before, he is arguably the best left-back in the world at the moment.<br /><br /><b>[Warnock added on Robertson, who is now a Champions League winner and skipper of his country]</b> He is Scotland’s captain on merit. When he first came into the club, I don’t think at the time anyone would have predicted just what he has gone on to achieve so far and the level he is playing at. Would <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> have thought that? I’m sure he would have thought he would have gone on to a certain level, but to the level he actually has? You have to give <a href="andy-robertson.html">Robbo</a> so much credit for that. Maybe part of it is working day in, day out in an environment like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s with world-class players. That can bring the best out of you. When you’re making your runs down the wing and crossing balls, and they’re finding your teammates’ runs and you’re clicking, then you are going up 10 or 15 per cent</p>

Often you see youngsters, 16 years old, and they take too many touches because they’re nervous, they want to get the ball under control. He’s pinging balls in, one-touch and round the corner, clever play. I thought his miss last night, when he hit the crossbar early on from so close, might have dented his confidence. It didn’t at all. This guy is full of confidence and you could see it in his performance, how well he did. Very unfortunate not to score late on, he can be delighted with his performance<br /><br /><b>[Warnock feels the academy graduates have already taken on board <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s unique philosophy]</b> They all try and play in a similar way.

  <p><b>[Stephen Warnock warns <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> his place in <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s strongest XI may be under threat]</b> In their next game, at home to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> on Sunday, who he picks might also depend on how he thinks <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> will line up. If <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> play in a 3-5-2 shape then <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> will want someone in midfield who can get between their lines to cause problems.

I would expect <b>[Georginio]</b> <a href="gini-wijnaldum.html">Wijnaldum</a> to come back into the team too and with <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a> cemented in the side, that would mean no place for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s captain, Henderson. That would not be a message that Henderson is out of favour, though. Far from it.<br /><br />When you are part of a squad at a club like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or City, you have to understand that the team is being picked to win a specific game, and if you are left out it is nothing personal. All of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s midfielders are going to have a part to play in the next few weeks, especially if <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> decides to rest some of them in certain games - but I would urge caution there. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s next game in Champions League Group E is at home to Genk on Tuesday 5 November, before they play champions <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> five days later.<br /><br />There will be plenty of people who will want <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> to put out a weakened team against the Belgians, but my mind-set would be not to take any chances. If I were a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> player, I would want to go into the City game feeling sharp and I would not want a week off beforehand. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> will know far more about their fatigue levels, however, and that is another area where he has got some big decisions to make.</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Warnock says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> need to get <a href="joe-gomez.html">Joe Gomez</a> back alongside <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> as quickly as possible]</b> I’ve said for a long, long time now that <a href="joe-gomez.html">Joe Gomez</a> makes <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a> such a better player. <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a> has that opportunity to go tight to players because he knows Gomez has that pace in behind. Gomez can give you two or three yards - he will still catch you. So he <b>[<a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a>]</b> knows that he can go tight himself. I just think the way Gomez plays as well suits <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a>. Partnerships are not always the ones that you think will work as well as they do. They complement each other so well</p>

  <p><b>[Warnock was at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s last fixture, their Champions League last-16 defeat to <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> on March 11]</b> You and I were at the game. The first thing I heard when I got to the ground was that the tunnel was shut. No media. Protect the players at all costs. If we’re honest we were all a bit blasé about it, we didn’t realise the severity of disease, just how contagious it was. We were all sat in the media room, anyone could have had it and we wouldn’t have had a clue. It’s only come to light in recent weeks just how bad it is. Before that there was naivety from a lot of people thinking it wouldn’t affect them, and now we’re seeing the full effects. Looking back, it is surprising game went ahead. The biggest surprise to me was that Madrid fans weren’t allowed to travel in Spain, but were allowed to come to England, we don’t know the impact that that decision had, do we? I’m surprised it took so long, seeing how quickly other leagues reacted. I don’t think it had hit our country the way it hit others, but <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> thought they could ride it out for longer. Looking back - was it the right thing to do?<br /><br />No one can prepare for this. World leaders don’t know how to deal with it, so how do you deal with it from a football perspective? The country, the world, has come to a halt. At the end of the day, for the players football is a job. When they can’t go to work, they’re going to be affected. The hardest thing is that it’s out of your hands. You can’t go into training to train harder; someone could pull the plug on the whole thing. The mindset of the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> players has been so positive, they just have to be ready for whatever comes. There’s no other way. If you start thinking negatively it won’t achieve anything.<br /><br />I think it might also offer some perspective for players. For a footballer, there are days when you think ‘I can’t be bothered with this’ and it does become a job. I know fans will say ‘if I could change positions with you just for a day’. I get that. This step away shows players what could be taken away from them. It’s almost like players now can get the feeling that I got when I retired, it’s been taken away you can’t do anything about it. I miss it like crazy, the banter in the dressing room, and players will be craving it now, believe me. They’ll have their WhatsApp groups and their chats, but it soon slows down. You have to change your mentality and look forward, think of the positives. The biggest thing is to try and put yourself in a routine, set a goal every day. The people around you are so important</p>

  <p><b>[Since that game against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s side have almost doubled their lead at the top to 25 points]</b> That was another moment in the season where everyone looked, they had gone to <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> and destroyed them. <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> were second in the league at the time and everyone thought if <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> were to win the game or draw, it would draw people back in. It was the best display of the season, for me</p>

  <p>The worst thing was the flight home, though. They put the wives of those who had played on the plane, ahead of some players who had made key contributions in Europe that season, which was just shocking. We got back to John Lennon Airport on a later flight to the team and, when we landed, the victory parade had already started. You could not get to the bus because of the crowds, so I just went home. That was the moment I made my mind up that I had to leave the club</p>

  <p><b>[Football club owners must ask themselves why the number of black managers in the game remains so low, according to former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> defender Stephen Warnock]</b> This is a question more for owners of football clubs - people who are employing people. Are they getting the same opportunities? We’re not sure. You look at the <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> rule when that was brought in. We had a similar sort of thing coming into the game in England and <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, the Football League and <a href="fa.html">the FA</a>. What’s the process that clubs go through and how do they look at managers?<br /><br /><b>[Spells at <a href="macclesfield-town-fc.html">Macclesfield</a> and MK Dons preceded the former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> midfielder’s move to <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a>, and <a href="neil-warnock.html">Warnock</a> insists each individual should be appointed on ability - not skin colour]</b> It wasn’t even a talking point. It wasn’t even something that had crossed any of the players’ minds at all. He was the right man for the job. He had done a great job at <a href="macclesfield-town-fc.html">Macclesfield</a> then he did a good job at MK Dons and he deserved a shot at coming into <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> and being a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> manager. There was nothing about race discussed in any way, and nor should there be. He was there on merit as being the worthy candidate who got the job</p>
