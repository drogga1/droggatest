  <p><b>[Mehmet Durakovic proves <a href="ange-postecoglou.html">Postecoglou</a> not alone in Asian exploits]</b> My wife and family was supposed to come out but were not able to. It is difficult to be alone and I am not used to being by myself. There is so much great food in Malaysia and fantastic restaurants so here you don’t think about cooking. Before I could do toasted cheese sandwiches and scrambled eggs but I am getting there. Thank God for the internet. I ordered a treadmill to keep me fit.<br /><br />I have been watching videos of our games, analysing players, other teams and old games. We have video conferences every week and they all have fitness programmes but it is not easy. Some of them live in apartments and can’t go out so they have to train indoors. It is not easy to keep them motivated and enthusiastic. You do as much as you can and you keep your fingers crossed that everyone is happy and healthy<br /><br /><b>[Perak’s final game this year, a 2-2 draw at Sabah, went ahead without fans. It left the club in second after four games of the season but it was a strange experience]</b> Playing in an empty stadium does have an effect on players and it feels like a practice game<br /><br /><b>[It is likely that when the Malaysia Super League restarts however, it will be without supporters]</b> I hope it doesn’t happen but it is better than no football. The main priority is the safety of players, staff and referees. When everything is safe then we can play.<br /><br />I’ve been reading about the A-League. If they don’t play the games, then there are money issues, it is difficult from the point of view of the clubs. There have not really been any approaches but I do watch the league on television. I am very happy the way things are going here and I have had some success. As a foreign coach, to last in Southeast Asia and Malaysia is very difficult unless you have had a lot of success. It is just the way it is. You have to deliver or the job will be given to someone else. I am happy here but one day, I would like to go home to Australia and coach</p>
