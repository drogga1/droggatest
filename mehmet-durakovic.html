  <p><b>[Mehmet Durakovic, he admitted that the team conceded soft goals]</b> It was a tough challenge for us. First half we should have scored at least three, four goals and that’s football. If you don’t put your chances away, sooner or later you’ll get hammered. We tried to push forward, but they caught us with counterattack, and when you don’t pick up, they will score goals and it was very unfortunate for us because we played well in the first half</p>

  <p><b>[Mehmet Durakovic readies to battle emotions for Perak’s cause]</b> At the moment, I’m not really feeling that much to be honest because I’m concentrating on my team. Tomorrow <b>[Saturday]</b>, it will be different. When I see the colours there, it will be a bit emotional. I will always have something in my heart for Selangor but as a professional, you move on. Perak is my team now and my obligations is to them. I’ll try to do my best<br /><br />Selangor has got a very good side, both experienced and young kids. There’s still got most of the core players. Half of the squad is still there. P. Maniam is there and he knows me inside out. Good luck to them. They’ve been doing well and I’m very happy for them, as long as they don’t win tomorrow <b>[Saturday]</b>,<br /><br />We will just see the games I have of Selangor. We will see how Maniam has been using his players. Every coach has got his own tactics but we’ll try to do our best against that team. It’s not going to be easy. They’ve got some good results at home<br /><br />I can tell you honestly. This is my 7th day with Perak. There’s are no favourites in Malaysian football. Yes, maybe on form and on paper. If you don’t concentrate and focus for 90 minutes, anybody can beat anybody on their day. Whether you play Kelantan, Penang or JDT <b>[Johor Darul Ta’zim]</b> - anybody is beatable. It’s who turns up on the day. Who is mentally stronger and tougher will win the game<br /><br />To be honest, you’ve got to stop making mistakes. If you don’t make mistakes, you’ve got a good chance of winning the game. If you’ve got good chances and you don’t put it away, you’ll then get punished. That’s what happened to us. First half we could’ve been up 3 or 4 nil but it wasn’t the case, we missed all the chances. Everyone wanted to go score and we left ourselves exposed to counter attacks. We have to be smarter, technically aware and we have to keep position<br /><br />I’m getting to know the players. Honestly, I’ve only known a few players from Selangor. In one week, we had three games and it’s not been easy. But we will get there, I’m trying to know my players and they are trying to know my style</p>

  <p><b>[Former Selangor player and head coach Mehmet Durakovic led Perak to a 1-0 victory over his old club]</b> I’ve got mixed feelings to be honest, but it’s nice to win. Even though it happened against Selangor, everybody knows it’s in my heart. <b>[I have]</b> mixed feelings but I’m very happy.<br /><br />This is part of football, we move on. I don’t hold any grudges against anybody <b>[at Selangor]</b>. Selangor is my state, Selangor is my team, <b>[and]</b> it will always be. But now that I’m the head coach of Perak, I’ll do my best for them. This is football, this is my job, and we move on. But this is something special for me tonight<br /><br />..Selangor are a young team, congratulations to all of them because they put up a good fight tonight. But I think the overall experience and the players that we have came through in the end<br /><br /><b>[When asked about his thoughts on his new charges]</b> I think Perak have a not bad squad, I’ve just been here not even eight, nine days. I’m getting used to the players, they’re getting used to me. So far I’m happy with the fighting spirit that they have, we’re working on a lot of things now that we have a bit of time. There are a lot of things to improve, but we will fix them<br /><br />Everybody knows Kedah are a good side. They’ve been together for three, four years, they’ve been in two Malaysia Cup finals and won one Malaysia Cup. They know each other inside out. …It won’t be easy but at least I can have a bit of a break this week <b>[before the cup tie]</b>. So I’ll get to know the players a little bit longer and better. We’ll go back to Perak and concentrate on Kedah next week</p>

  <p><b>[Mehmet Durakovic remained happy with his charges for most parts, despite crashing out of the FA Cup after a 0-2 defeat to Kedah]</b> We gave them two chances and they scored two goals. It is not easy to come back. Overall, we made a couple of mistakes and we got punished. But I’m very happy with the fighting spirit of the players. Long season to go, let me get to know these players.<br /><br />No <b>[we didn’t get the tactics wrong]</b>. I thought we did quite well, especially in the first half. We knew they love to play football so they can have all the possession they want in the back third. But in the middle third and up front, we’re doing quite well<br /><br />We gave a freekick away and they scored from a set piece. We gave another ball away and they score from the cross. Two crosses, two goals. Not once but twice <b>[players losing concentration]</b>. I don’t want to say nothing about the referee. I’ve got no comment to be honest. You all saw the game, nothing for me to say<br /><br />I think he has dislocated his shoulder. Unfortunately, he’ll be out for a while. Not easy to play with 10 men. Kedah are a very good side</p>

  <p><b>[Mehmet Durakovic and Shahrom Kalam both agrees that Perak still have plenty of room for improvement]</b> In all honesty, I was really happy in the first half. We played so well in the first half. In the second half, it was basically a couple of mistakes and we conceded a couple of silly goals. At least my players pushed on to get the equaliser and we did but we should have gotten three points.<br /><br />That is what <b>[missing chances]</b> is happening the last few games. We have so many chances but we didn’t put the ball into the net and that put the pressure on the defenders. If you don’t score sooner or later, they will have chances and that’s what happened<br /><br />I think in the second half especially where we played, the pitch was very very heavy. We made a couple of mistakes and they caught us on the break. I don’t want to make excuses but it was not the best pitch to play football</p>

  <p><b>[Under Mehmet Durakovic, the Bos Gaurus have shown promising performance]</b> I am confident that we can still challenge. If at Sarawak we scored three goals, which is something that is not easy to do, that shows that our players are still fighting.</p>

  <p><b>[Coach of Perak, Mehmet Durakovic chose to look at the positives]</b> We played really well. The game plan went perfectly. But they scored a fantastic goal through Baddrol. It was a fantastic game where both teams want to play football, so everyone should be happy. It’s not easy. The pitch was very heavy but both team tried to play football and that makes me happy enough.</p>

  <p><b>[Perak head coach Mehmet Durakovic was visibly upset following his side’s 3-0 trouncing by T-Team]</b> We were sloppy, we gave them chances. Three chances and three goals, and the game was finished… It’s not good enough, we keep making mistakes and it’s costing us games.<br /><br /><b>[When asked about his plans for their next league match, against Sarawak]</b> We’ll go back, look at the video <b>[of the T-Team match]</b>, basically, stop making mistakes</p>

  <p><b>[Former Socceroos defender Mehmet Durakovic - who had a spell in charge of Melbourne Victory from March 2011 to January 2012 - is in charge of Perak in the Malaysia Super League]</b> <b>[Working abroad]</b> just opens up your mind. There’s so much money, there’s so much passion, there’s so much sponsorship. It’s really, really big business here. Football is the number one sport here. You’re dealing with presidents, you’re dealing with big sponsors, you’re dealing with royalty. In Australia, you don’t deal with that.<br /><br />You’re dealing with people, who are really too busy to worry about football. You have to take charge. So basically, they just give you control of everything, so you have to respect that<br /><br />One thing about Asia, everybody knows each other and they go on respect, they go on reputation. If you do well, you’ve got a good name. If you don’t, then as a player or a coach, you don’t last long</p>

  <p><b>[Durakovic determined to secure Malaysia Cup quarter-finals berth at Shah Alam]</b> I am very happy with the commitment shown by the players in Wednesday’s match against Johor Darul Ta’zim <b>[JDT]</b>. I am also satisfied with the performances demonstrated by them. They have tried their best but unfortunately failed. I hope the players will forget the failure and bounce back against PKNS FC tonight.<br /><br />We are aware that tonight’s game will be a very challenging one for the team because the players are fatigued due to the tight schedule and the fact that they have had to travel for home matches due to the temporary closure of the Perak Stadium for repairs.<br /><br />The players and I are determined to appear in the Malaysia Cup knockout stages again, by confirming their place in the quarter-finals when we play PKNS at the Shah Alam Stadium tonight, as we are very close to qualifying for the quarter-finals, because we are now leading Group B and need only one more win.<br /><br />I’ve been made to understand that Perak have not been in the quarter-finals for quite awhile, and I want the players to take it all the way to the final. I will make sure my players show a spirited performance in the game tonight</p>

  <p><b>[Mehmet Durakovic was a happy man after his Perak side confirmed their ticket to the Malaysia Cup quarter final stage after handing PKNS a home defeat]</b> We came here to win the game. We had a game plan, it worked and we are into the quarter finals. Perak havent been there for nearly 5 years and it was very important for them to qualify. And we did it with class, so I’m very happy tonight.<br /><br />No, I’m not worried at all <b>[about players getting too tired]</b>. These players are professional and they give their best. If I see that they are tired, I would change them. I’m very happy with their performance. I can’t ask for anything more. It was not easy tonight. We have 6 games in a row away. We travel everywhere by bus and it’s very hard. To the players credit, they hang in there and give their best for 90 minutes and we win the game</p>

  <p><b>[Durakovic to continue to entrust Hafizul Hakim as first choice despite JDT blunder]</b> We’re all human beings and we all make mistakes. We’re part of a family. I want to build a family culture here. If I take him out, it will only kill him. He’s a very very good man. He’s a very good goal keeper. He plays for us, he plays for Malaysia. I think Hafizul is a fantastic goal keeper and he has a fantastic future.</p>

  <p><b>[Mehmet Durakovic proves <a href="ange-postecoglou.html">Postecoglou</a> not alone in Asian exploits]</b> My wife and family was supposed to come out but were not able to. It is difficult to be alone and I am not used to being by myself. There is so much great food in Malaysia and fantastic restaurants so here you don’t think about cooking. Before I could do toasted cheese sandwiches and scrambled eggs but I am getting there. Thank God for the internet. I ordered a treadmill to keep me fit.<br /><br />I have been watching videos of our games, analysing players, other teams and old games. We have video conferences every week and they all have fitness programmes but it is not easy. Some of them live in apartments and can’t go out so they have to train indoors. It is not easy to keep them motivated and enthusiastic. You do as much as you can and you keep your fingers crossed that everyone is happy and healthy<br /><br /><b>[Perak’s final game this year, a 2-2 draw at Sabah, went ahead without fans. It left the club in second after four games of the season but it was a strange experience]</b> Playing in an empty stadium does have an effect on players and it feels like a practice game<br /><br /><b>[It is likely that when the Malaysia Super League restarts however, it will be without supporters]</b> I hope it doesn’t happen but it is better than no football. The main priority is the safety of players, staff and referees. When everything is safe then we can play.<br /><br />I’ve been reading about the A-League. If they don’t play the games, then there are money issues, it is difficult from the point of view of the clubs. There have not really been any approaches but I do watch the league on television. I am very happy the way things are going here and I have had some success. As a foreign coach, to last in Southeast Asia and Malaysia is very difficult unless you have had a lot of success. It is just the way it is. You have to deliver or the job will be given to someone else. I am happy here but one day, I would like to go home to Australia and coach</p>
