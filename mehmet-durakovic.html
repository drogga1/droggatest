  <p><b>[Mehmet Durakovic, he admitted that the team conceded soft goals]</b> It was a tough challenge for us. First half we should have scored at least three, four goals and that’s football. If you don’t put your chances away, sooner or later you’ll get hammered. We tried to push forward, but they caught us with counterattack, and when you don’t pick up, they will score goals and it was very unfortunate for us because we played well in the first half</p>

  <p><b>[Mehmet Durakovic readies to battle emotions for Perak’s cause]</b> At the moment, I’m not really feeling that much to be honest because I’m concentrating on my team. Tomorrow <b>[Saturday]</b>, it will be different. When I see the colours there, it will be a bit emotional. I will always have something in my heart for Selangor but as a professional, you move on. Perak is my team now and my obligations is to them. I’ll try to do my best<br /><br />Selangor has got a very good side, both experienced and young kids. There’s still got most of the core players. Half of the squad is still there. P. Maniam is there and he knows me inside out. Good luck to them. They’ve been doing well and I’m very happy for them, as long as they don’t win tomorrow <b>[Saturday]</b>,<br /><br />We will just see the games I have of Selangor. We will see how Maniam has been using his players. Every coach has got his own tactics but we’ll try to do our best against that team. It’s not going to be easy. They’ve got some good results at home<br /><br />I can tell you honestly. This is my 7th day with Perak. There’s are no favourites in Malaysian football. Yes, maybe on form and on paper. If you don’t concentrate and focus for 90 minutes, anybody can beat anybody on their day. Whether you play Kelantan, Penang or JDT <b>[Johor Darul Ta’zim]</b> - anybody is beatable. It’s who turns up on the day. Who is mentally stronger and tougher will win the game<br /><br />To be honest, you’ve got to stop making mistakes. If you don’t make mistakes, you’ve got a good chance of winning the game. If you’ve got good chances and you don’t put it away, you’ll then get punished. That’s what happened to us. First half we could’ve been up 3 or 4 nil but it wasn’t the case, we missed all the chances. Everyone wanted to go score and we left ourselves exposed to counter attacks. We have to be smarter, technically aware and we have to keep position<br /><br />I’m getting to know the players. Honestly, I’ve only known a few players from Selangor. In one week, we had three games and it’s not been easy. But we will get there, I’m trying to know my players and they are trying to know my style</p>

  <p><b>[Former Selangor player and head coach Mehmet Durakovic led Perak to a 1-0 victory over his old club]</b> I’ve got mixed feelings to be honest, but it’s nice to win. Even though it happened against Selangor, everybody knows it’s in my heart. <b>[I have]</b> mixed feelings but I’m very happy.<br /><br />This is part of football, we move on. I don’t hold any grudges against anybody <b>[at Selangor]</b>. Selangor is my state, Selangor is my team, <b>[and]</b> it will always be. But now that I’m the head coach of Perak, I’ll do my best for them. This is football, this is my job, and we move on. But this is something special for me tonight<br /><br />..Selangor are a young team, congratulations to all of them because they put up a good fight tonight. But I think the overall experience and the players that we have came through in the end<br /><br /><b>[When asked about his thoughts on his new charges]</b> I think Perak have a not bad squad, I’ve just been here not even eight, nine days. I’m getting used to the players, they’re getting used to me. So far I’m happy with the fighting spirit that they have, we’re working on a lot of things now that we have a bit of time. There are a lot of things to improve, but we will fix them<br /><br />Everybody knows Kedah are a good side. They’ve been together for three, four years, they’ve been in two Malaysia Cup finals and won one Malaysia Cup. They know each other inside out. …It won’t be easy but at least I can have a bit of a break this week <b>[before the cup tie]</b>. So I’ll get to know the players a little bit longer and better. We’ll go back to Perak and concentrate on Kedah next week</p>

  <p><b>[Mehmet Durakovic proves <a href="ange-postecoglou.html">Postecoglou</a> not alone in Asian exploits]</b> My wife and family was supposed to come out but were not able to. It is difficult to be alone and I am not used to being by myself. There is so much great food in Malaysia and fantastic restaurants so here you don’t think about cooking. Before I could do toasted cheese sandwiches and scrambled eggs but I am getting there. Thank God for the internet. I ordered a treadmill to keep me fit.<br /><br />I have been watching videos of our games, analysing players, other teams and old games. We have video conferences every week and they all have fitness programmes but it is not easy. Some of them live in apartments and can’t go out so they have to train indoors. It is not easy to keep them motivated and enthusiastic. You do as much as you can and you keep your fingers crossed that everyone is happy and healthy<br /><br /><b>[Perak’s final game this year, a 2-2 draw at Sabah, went ahead without fans. It left the club in second after four games of the season but it was a strange experience]</b> Playing in an empty stadium does have an effect on players and it feels like a practice game<br /><br /><b>[It is likely that when the Malaysia Super League restarts however, it will be without supporters]</b> I hope it doesn’t happen but it is better than no football. The main priority is the safety of players, staff and referees. When everything is safe then we can play.<br /><br />I’ve been reading about the A-League. If they don’t play the games, then there are money issues, it is difficult from the point of view of the clubs. There have not really been any approaches but I do watch the league on television. I am very happy the way things are going here and I have had some success. As a foreign coach, to last in Southeast Asia and Malaysia is very difficult unless you have had a lot of success. It is just the way it is. You have to deliver or the job will be given to someone else. I am happy here but one day, I would like to go home to Australia and coach</p>
