  <p><b>[History has taught us that during World Cup years, the main Ballon d’Or contenders often arrive from the Mundial-challenging nations. The victors from 1990 (Lothar Matthäus), 1994 (Hristo Stoichkov), 1998 (Zinedine Zidane), 2002 (Ronaldo), and 2006 (Cannavaro) proves this. It must be pointed out that, despite denials, France Football and <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> considers players on their achievements from the previous season and does not take into account form and fortunes at the start of the new campaign. But <a href="diego-milito.html">Diego Milito</a> isn’t one of the 23 best players of 2010]</b> It’s not right at all. It’s not a question of whether <a href="diego-milito.html">Milito</a> would have won the Ballon d’Or or not, but he definitely should have been on the list. I was startled when I saw that he wasn’t. The award is based on performances from last year and he scored so many goals and won the treble.</p>

  <p><b>[Inter legend Sandro Mazzola admits to being crazy about Alexis Sanchez]</b> I am crazy about Alexis Sanchez. For me he is perfect for this team because over time he has evolved and now scores several goals a season. Inter need someone like him.<br /><br />Yes, <b>[I like Inter’s attack]</b> because it has technical strikers with pace and quality. I expected more from Gabigol, but the first season in Serie A for foreigners is complicated. We have to have patience. <b>[Antonio]</b> Candreva and <b>[Ivan]</b> Perisic have quality, even if they can do more</p>

  <p><b>[Sandro Mazzola says Keeping ‘phenomenon’ Lautaro will be difficult &amp; <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Vidal</a> would be a ‘great signing’]</b> Lautaro is a player that I like very much. When I watch the games I usually imagine what I would do in every situation in which an attacker receives the ball and I am usually able to guess what the player will do. With him I never get it, he always does something that surprises me. He’s a guy who doesn’t fool just me, he is able to fool any defender and any rival. He’s a phenomenon.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether Inter will be able to keep Lautaro on their books]</b> It will be very difficult. They may have to sell some other players to be able to keep him, but I would do anything to keep him on the team<br /><br /><b>[Discussions are held regarding a possible deal for <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Arturo Vidal</a>]</b> Without a doubt. <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Arturo Vidal</a> would be a great signing, he is a player that I like very much. I wonder how <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> would get into his head and allow him to play with freedom. I think they would work very well together, as they already did in fact<br /><br />The truth is that if you recover all of the injured players then they would not need to sign anyone else. I think this year’s Inter squad is very competitive as it is</p>
