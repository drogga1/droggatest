<blockquote>
  <p>[Legendary American broadcaster JP Dellacamera gets his moment after staying in background for decades] All I said was ‘Goal.’ In my goal call I didn’t say “They win the World Cup.’ I just set the stage, one word and laid out. To me that was my signature call, and it’s the way I’ve always thought of announcing. Don’t be bigger than the moment.<br /><br />Initially that’s what I wanted to be was a hockey announcer. I was doing minor-league hockey and got a break doing indoor soccer. Indoor soccer led to outdoor soccer. Even though I’ve done other things since - I’ve done basketball and hockey with the Thrashers - my living has really been 90 percent soccer and now it’s pretty much 100 percent soccer<br /><br />[British play-by-play voice] I never think about that stuff. I do this because I love this. I don’t do it because of money, recognition. I do it because I love it. If awards come to me, that’s fantastic. I never think, this is something I should have gotten or I deserve. I’m not wired that way. Through my career, I’ve never asked anyone why they didn’t use me on something, just like I never asked them why they did<br /><br />I don’t know anybody who’s been an announcer for even 20 years let alone much more than that, I don’t know anyone that could say, ‘No, everything’s been great. I never had a a hiccup in the road. I think anybody that says that is probably lying. I think if you last as long as I did, I think that means the good has outweighed the bad, and I have no complaints, I have no regrets. it’s been a great career, and I’m not done yet</p>
