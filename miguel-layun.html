  <p><b>[Mexico defender Miguel Layun says he’s headed to Russia with the goal of lifting the World Cup]</b> With an enormous hope, with a huge desire to break through and achieve the goals we have in mind, and, above all with the desire to enjoy it a lot.<br /><br />I’m not going with the mentality of getting through the round of 16. I’m going with the mentality of being champion. I think in any competition you participate in, you do so to win it, and this isn’t different. I know it’s a tournament where the best players in the world are there and the best national teams, but ultimately I always compete to win<br /><br />It was a really positive experience. I’m happy with what I experienced this season. Lord willing, the things that need to will happen for me to be able to continue here next year and several years more. Now, I’m waiting. I already expressed my desire to continue and I’ll be waiting for any update on the part of the people who make the decisions</p>

  <p><b>[Miguel Layun puzzled by Osorio critics]</b> I’ve never been able to understand the criticism toward ‘El Mister’. I never have, and I never will, honestly. Because you see someone who puts himself into things like he does for this group, for this team, it’s difficult to see that from the outside, without knowing the intricacies of things or living the day to day like we who are part of this group. It brings up a very radical and very tough question.<br /><br />Sometimes it seems baseless to me. Because if we’re able to turn around and realize that we qualified for the World Cup, if I’m not mistaken, without a problem. I don’t remember suffering during this process to be here. At the end, we’ve had two results that have affected us. That’s a fact. The game against Chile, but for me that’s a circumstantial game. There’s that and the game against Germany in the Confederations Cup. So, sometimes it’s tough to leave behind all that has happened, but we think he’s doing really good. He’s as happy as we are, but he’s already thinking about the next game. For me, the manager is a genius</p>

  <p><b>[No resting on laurels]</b> I think we, when we started this adventure, the World Cup, what we achieved in qualification to get here, I think it was a great job. After that, we’ve said among ourselves many times, why don’t we aspire to something bigger? We’re not guaranteed anything because we’re dreaming of something, but it doesn’t take anything away either.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico World Cup star Miguel Layun causes Sevilla double-take with La Liga quality tournament]</b> I’m like everyone, waiting to see if something gets confirmed. In a tournament like the World Cup, I’m totally concentrated on what I want to get here, but of course this topic about knowing what my future is going to be is always there. They’re the ones who have to make some statement. I’m trying to be, and always am, the most professional possible like I was with Sevilla. I gave everything to the club and went through a good period in my career there. For me, participating at such an important club in Europe has been really special, I said that for me it was a dream to be able to continue with the team.<br /><br />I still haven’t dismissed the possibility of staying in Sevilla, because for me it’d be really great. I see it as complicated. I think if they had the intention <b>[to keep me]</b> they already would’ve communicated with me or with my agent</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico players say round of 16 qualification was deserved]</b> For me, we qualified on our own merit. I don’t have anything else to say because I don’t see any other way of seeing it. We played two great games, we won six points and we’re leaders of the group. It’s true there was the chance we’d be out, but we did the work before and that allowed us the opportunity today to qualify even though we lost.</p>

  <p><b>[Hector Moreno suspended for Mexico’s round of 16 match vs. Brazil]</b> Hector is a very important player, but at the same time we have 23 players who are here with a big dream and we’ll try to do things as well as possible. The manager is in charge of that, the mister will make the choice about who will replace him. If we make changes, if we play the same way, we don’t know.</p>

  <p><b>[VAR not bothering Mexico]</b> It’s a weird topic. I’ve had it in the league, I had the chance in Portugal to play with VAR. It’s something so new, it’s different. Suddenly there’s a certain stress in every play on the field. It’s a new rule, we have to accept it, be aware of it and play with that as well.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico’s fifth-game curse continues as Osorio’s plan falls short against Brazil]</b> They scored the goals at the right moments, and that’s it. I think it was a really well-fought game, a game where we worked. I got the feeling that it was a Brazil that was worried about what we can do. That means we’re getting more respect from the biggest national teams and that’s not unimportant.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico defender Miguel Layun has slammed Neymar for his antics during Brazil’s 2-0 win over Mexico on Monday]</b> This is football. If he does not want to be touched he should try doing something else. He is more concerned about being on the floor. If he wants to lie down, he should go home and sleep. He was down and I touched him looking for the ball, I know all about his talents but I also know his tricks. We know Neymar and he likes to be the protagonist on and off the field. It’s obvious.<br /><br />Anyone who has seen the game knows exactly what I’m referring to. He’s like that. His personality is like that. You have to leave that aside and wish him the best like always. I think he’s a player with a lot of talent who hopefully one day dedicates himself to playing a little more. The truth is he be more spectacular if he dedicated himself more to playing football instead of … doing other things. Ultimately, I think that’s what’s important. I think maybe he was a bit worried and that was his way of getting rid of the stress he had.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico defender Miguel Layun had surgery to remove a cancerous tumour and has been given the all-clear]</b> My wife and I decided to have a general health check and there was a small surprise that neither my wife nor I had imagined. The first thing that I was told was that they had found a complex cyst.<br /><br />The question began to arise that it wasn’t a cyst and was a tumour, but when you mention the word tumour and that it could be cancer, you see it in a different way. It was a malignant tumour - we were talking about cancer - and in the end the entire tumour had to be removed. Thank God I can say that I had cancer, but it is already cured<br /><br /><b>[Layun, who is sitting out the Gold Cup because of his treatment, said he went for a final check on Friday]</b> So now it’s just a case of checking that it does not come back</p>

I’m his fan and I would like to meet him and be able to share with him<br /><br /> scared me to think about retirement. I am 31, I am going to be 32 years old in June, and I am in the final stretch of my career. I have really enjoyed my career, but I’m not sure what I am going to do and I have always been a hard-headed about that, I always have in mind where I want to go and that <b>[not knowing what I’m going to do]</b> caused me stress. I would like to retire in <a href="monterrey-fc.html">Monterrey</a> or in America. They are the only two places I want to dream that I am going to retire, but I do not know, maybe life still takes me to a different place</p>
