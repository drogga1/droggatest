  <p><b>[Manuel Lanzini has admitted to being in talks over a new contract at West Ham and is happy to commit his future to the club]</b> Yes, we are talking with the club about staying and, of course, I want to stay. It is like my home. It is my fifth season now, I love the fans, the fans love me and the club is amazing<br /><br /><b>[He is also back in the Argentina squad after missing the 2018 World Cup and 2019 Copa America through injury. Those fitness struggles have been a source of frustration for all concerned]</b> When I was injured, it was really hard, it was a bad time. It was before the World Cup, it was going to be my first World Cup and I wanted to play. It was difficult, but I want to say thank you to my family, my girlfriend, my son and all the people that stayed with me. It’s difficult because you can’t help the team. You see the team may have lost, drawn or play badly and you just want to help. I spoke everyday with Manuel Pellegrini and he understands me and I understand him. I did a really good recovery and since I started to play again, I believe I have done really well<br /><br /><b>[He added on West Ham’s ambition]</b> We hope to stay near the top six and try to get into the Europa League, that is the most important thing for us. We know that it is difficult because in the Premier League you never know, all the teams are very good. We have signed very good players and spent a lot of money, but we need to work hard to achieve this</p>

  <p><b>[Manuel Lanzini has signed a new long-term contract with <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> United]</b> I’m so happy to sign a new contract for <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>. I think it’s the best decision for me. I’ve been here for a long time and I’ve said in an interview before that I like <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>, I like the fans, I like the staff and when I came here all the people were comfortable with me. I like to stay here. It’s a big decision but also easy, because when you feel good in one club and you like the club and the club likes you, it’s easier to decide these things. For me, it was not difficult. It was easy, because I love it here. I love London, I love the club, I am happy here, we have a very good team, we have a very good manager and the club wants to change and to be in more competitions in the future and that’s good for us</p>

When I turned, I didn’t set my foot firmly on the ground and all my weight fell on my knee. I knew instantly that it was going to be very bad</p>
