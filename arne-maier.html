<blockquote>
  <p>[Arne Maier is living the dream at Hertha] It is always a nice feeling to be praised. But no matter how much I may be praised at the moment, on the field that does not help me. There I am on my own and every time I have to go to my limits and not rest. But I want to emphasise that I like this torture. I’m living my dream<br /><br />Of course, on the one hand, it was a cool feeling that such big clubs were interested in me. On the other hand, I was only 13 years old, had my school in Berlin, my family and my friends, which is why I decided against a change at that time<br /><br />[Asked to name those most likely to make the breakthrough] First of all Kai Havertz [of Bayer Leverkusen]. I have known him for several years. He is a good friend of mine and I have followed his development closely. But there is not only Havertz, also players like Thilo Kehrer [at Paris Saint-Germain] have a lot of potential and can play an important role in the national team at some point. Of course, each of us wants to someday play for Die Mannschaft - me too. That’s the dream<br /><br />[On Julian Draxler] When I was young I saw on TV how he scored for Schalke in the DFB Cup against Nuremberg and was immediately impressed. On the field he has superior quality. He is a great guy that I admire greatly. In my apartment there is one of his jerseys on the wall</p>
