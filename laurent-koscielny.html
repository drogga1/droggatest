  <p><b>[Laurent Koscielny believes Karim Benzema’s absence from the France squad will be a small handicap at Euro 2016]</b> Without Karim, we would take a small handicap to the Euros. But we have alternatives. Both players must be saddened to find themselves in this situation. They love Les Bleus and have done a lot for the team.<br /><br /><b>[Koscielny asserted his belief that France can win the Euros on home soil]</b> I believe, of course. Our group is winnable, but we must always be careful. There will be an incredible expectation. Since the World Cup, we have felt a solidarity amongst the group, happy to be together with young people surrounded by some old. We will live for one and a half months together, it is necessary that the atmosphere is good</p>

  <p><b>[Laurent Koscielny insists the Arsenal squad remain fully supportive of Arsene Wenger]</b> Of course we are behind the manager. The players have the responsibility on the pitch, the boss has responsibilities too and we have to be together. It is difficult to say if it is his fault or our fault. The club are together and we need to stay together. Everything outside our bubble, we don’t think about. The boss is here to give his best for the club. He has been here for 20 years and has always loved the club, the players have as well. But yes, as a period it is difficult so we need to stay together and fight.<br /><br />We know we are in a bad situation a bad period, we tried but nothing is with us. We tried to fight and play football but you could see the confidence is very down. We miss a lot of things during the game against Brighton but we need to push more again and again. The confidence will be back slowly. We know we need to win to have a little bit more confidence in us. We lost a little bit of our quality but we need to stay united. It is a bad period but we need everyone who like this club - players, staff and fans - to be together and to fight to stay the highest we can. You need to put your head down and work. Just like this, we could be back at the top. We will fight until the end of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Iwobi has been challenged to realise how good he could become]</b> He has huge potential and he needs to realise how good he could become. Right now, he is definitely on the right path to do just that. He is working hard at training and his confidence is high since Unai Emery arrived. If you look at him he has everything. He is strong physically, quick, good technically and his movement is good. He needs to be more efficient and clinical so he scores and assists more. He is very receptive and listen to advice so I have no doubt that he will continue his progression.</p>

  <p><b>[France defender Laurent Koscielny admits difficulty rooting for France in World Cup]</b> The World Cup will remain a dark spot of my career. The injury was hard to accept. The result was even harder because they won the World Cup. I have a selfish side. I tell myself that I could have been part of the adventure and won the Cup. And I would have it in a corner of my head for the rest my life. It’s difficult and no one can put themself in my shoes. I was really happy for them, but also disgusted. You can not feel like a world champion, as the 60 million French could. It’s a strange feeling that during the tournament I wanted them to qualify, but at the same time I wanted them to lose. That was my feeling at the time<br /><br />It’s my first big injury, mentally you’re getting very strong, you’re learning a lot about football and life, I’ve worked every day at St-Raphael, and put my family aside. These are things in life, and you have to face all of that, during my rehabilitation, I was selfish, I only thought of myself, and I did not pay attention to my family<br /><br />Deschamps called me once <b>[since the World Cup]</b>, during my birthday in September. Lot of people disappointed me, and there are lots of other coaches. It feels like a slap on the face. I think I gave what I could give to the French team.The national team has a very good generation with great players. My injury has not changed my decision: for the Blues it’s over for me. But I remain a supporter of the French team<br /><br />I have a new state of mind, there was the Laurent before, and the Laurent after. I want to continue to Arsenal, and come back quickly, I do not know what level I can have. but I want to fight</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil is approaching the form of his life]</b> Mesut’s deserved all the plaudits he got after his performance against the Foxes. He was incredible. His goal bailed us out before the break and then his pass for Hector on our second goal is the best ball you will see all season. And he added an assist for Auba after a great dummy and understanding with <b>[Alexandre]</b> Lacazette. When Mesut is in this form, he is unstoppable and makes us win. He has extraordinary qualities. There are not many players like him in the world right now capable of producing a pass the like for Hector, beating four opposition players with just one ball. His display on that night will stay in people’s minds for a very long time. It is a case of ‘I was there when Ozil had that performance against Leicester.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal’s club captain Laurent Koscielny claims he is a better person and mentally stronger after coming back from a six-month injury lay-off]</b> It makes you a better person, a better man. I talked to a lot of people who had been injured like me, or in their knees, so it’s like six months <b>[out]</b>, and they told me that you miss football a lot and when you come back you are so hungry. You want to eat everything and grow on the pitch and just enjoy and be happy with what you can do on the pitch. These are real things that I have in me. I’m hungry to play football again and to play with my team-mates, so I don’t think people will say ‘you have been injured and will be less stronger than before’. I think you are mentally stronger than any people who didn’t have an injury like you’ve had.<br /><br />When you are fit, you have a lot of friends and a lot of people who love you and everything, and when you are injured all these people forget you. But it’s nice because for me I don’t forget and I can realise which people are with me and love me, so it’s important for my life to know about this. You miss everything. You miss the love you can have with your team-mates, you miss the pitch, you miss all the conversations with your team-mates during treatment or gym sessions</p>

  <p><b>[Laurent Koscielny has aimed a veiled dig at former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger]</b> Our record against the other big six teams this season is positive. We have won 12 points compared to six last season. It shows how we are approaching those games differently. It is not just about attacking. We are more intelligent, we are more measured in our plans. We can change tactics halfway through a game, we can set up differently. The manager is using different formations and it shows his flexibility and the players’ too which is a good thing. Of course, we still need to do better away from home in the big games but we are on the right path.</p>

We know Napoli played in the Champions League this season. They are a good team. We did the job at home. Today we knew if we scored they needed four. We fight to defend and suffer together.</p>

  <p><b>[Laurent Koscielny concedes that Arsenal are in a bad moment]</b> We are not happy because we lost three games. We are nearly at the end of the season and we know we’re in the final sprint. Every point, every game, is very important. Today we wanted to win but we played against a good team. Of course we played with 10 men. This week we are in a bad moment but we need to stay together. I believe in the quality of each player in this squad because in the last few months we’ve played well. When you go 22 unbeaten, it’s not easy and I think everyone fought for this. I want to keep the heads up because this is football. The end is nearly here and we didn’t fight this whole season for nothing.<br /><br />The away form is not good at this moment. We won away at Napoli and it was a difficult game because it’s a very tough atmosphere, but when the confidence is a little bit down then it’s tough to come back. We need to stay together every day to give more for the team. We need to give five more per cent every day to get this confidence and come back at our top level. We have the quality and we’ve shown that this season, but now we have five games in front of us and every one is so important for our future. We need to fight<br /><br />Of course we’ve played a lot of games every three days, but we have a big squad. We need everyone to be ready and help the team to produce the best results. We’ve lost some players with injury but we still have a team full of good players. Confidence is the most important thing in football, more than the quality. It’s about working together and giving that commitment to the team. Alone, we can do nothing. Together, we can achieve our targets</p>
