  <p><b>[Laurent Koscielny on missing out on Russia 2018 glory]</b> The World Cup will remain a dark spot of my career. The injury was hard to accept. The result was even harder because they won the World Cup. I have a selfish side. I tell myself that I could have been part of the adventure and won the Cup. And I would have it in a corner of my head for the rest my life. It’s difficult and no one can put themselves in my shoes. I was really happy for them, but also disgusted. You can not feel like a world champion, as the 60 million French could. It’s a strange feeling that during the tournament I wanted them to qualify, but at the same time I wanted them to lose. That was my feeling at the time</p>

  <p><b>[Laurent Koscielny says he decided to leave <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> months ago after much consideration as the centre-back completed a €5 million move to Bordeaux]</b> As you know I engaged with <b>[Bordeaux]</b>. After nine years spent at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, I took the decision to leave. I have spent wonderful years with this club, nine years during which I learned, evolved, grew up. This experience made me the player I am today. My decision to leave has been discussed for months with my club, my team-mates, my coach, and it has been a well thought decision. I see this departure like a new turning point in my life as a player but also in in my life as a man and a family man. However I hope you understand, and in any case I cannot be thankful enough for these years past at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I am aware of everything that the club and you supporters have brought to me. But it is time for me to go home so today my will is to join <b>[Bordeaux]</b>. This is a new challenge that I count on taking with determination</p>

  <p><b>[Koscielny reveals why he quit <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> as he responds to <a href="ian-wright.html">Ian Wright</a> over ‘shame’ comments]</b> A <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> season is very long. It requires a lot physically and mentally. I didn’t feel I could play 40-50 matches and I didn’t want to end my career with injuries. I’ve gone down a level, but to take more pleasure. Either I finished there or changed clubs. With my family, we felt it was time. Everything was in my thinking: football, my physical state, my wife, my children, the daily life we could have. I can only say that I left with my head held high. All of those I worked with for nine years… everyone respected my decision to return home with my family.<br /><br /><b>[In a clip released on social media following his switch to France, Koscielny is seen removing the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> shirt to reveal the Bordeaux jersey he’s wearing underneath]</b><br /><br />I’ve always been upstanding, respectful and loyal. I always gave my maximum. I spoke with the coach, who was understanding. And as for the rest…</p>

  <p><b>[Laurent Koscielny has spoken about his reasons for leaving <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in the summer]</b> I can understand that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans did not expect me to leave. Nobody expected it. To put it simply, I was not happy as I was on the first day I signed. And with my family, we needed to go back to France and have a new challenge<br /><br />I’m happy for <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>, and for his role as captain. I wish them all the best, even if they are in a difficult period. But this is where we see a team and a collective ready to fight together and bounce back<br /><br />To be a coach in the future? You have to test it out. I feel very good in the world of football, so why not take the clause of my sporting director (to be a coach after the end of his career)? What is sure is that I will not be a pundit!</p>
