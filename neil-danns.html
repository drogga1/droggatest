  <p><b>[Guyana players like midfielder Neil Danns are crossing the Atlantic more often and seeing the same staff each time they travel for matches]</b> I think it’s that regularity, just really getting to know each other and implementing stuff in team that has helped us to prosper. I’ve personally had five years. We’ve had a lot of people come in and out. I think it’s just nice to have someone come in and give us regularity.<br /><br /><b>[Neil Danns feels have set down a foundation for the nation to build on]</b> It means so much. From where the structure of everything was when I first came to where it is now is just night and day. It’s completely different. To be a part of that is something you can always take with you. Hopefully, this is just the first stepping stone on the road to improving Guyana’s future and inspiring the next generation. You can always look back, and you would like to think that you played a good part in it</p>

  <p><b>[Saying there has been a power shift from Central America to the Caribbean is too knee-jerk, but those changes implemented by Concacaf did not happen in a vacuum]</b> I think that’s one of the most critical things. These regular camps and friendlies and competitive games obviously help the lads get to know each other. It gave them a lot of experience which will stand them in good stead for the future. The implementation of the Nations League is massive. Now most of the games are going to be competitive, and it always gives the guys something to fight for</p>
