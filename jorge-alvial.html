  <p><b>[Man Utd ignored 40 calls to sign <a href="alphonso-davies.html">Alphonso Davies</a> as Bayern now benefit from Canadian teenager’s potential]</b> It was my first player that I recommended to United when they hired me. The first time I saw him he was playing at the Dallas Cup tournament and he was a very good player. He was only 14 then, he went back to Vancouver and then when I was watching him on videos with my son, Javier, and said: ‘Wait a second. We remember that player, that is Alphonso.’ And that is when I called.<br /><br />I had just got hired at that time and I called and said I wanted to go and see this player. So I went and right away, I am being honest, right away I recommended him. I feel very, very strongly about him. He is physical, intelligent. I felt strongly about him, if not stronger than I did when I recommended <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a> to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, and I took him for a trial at 14-years-old. When I saw what he had without proper development and coaching I knew that the kid would come to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> or to any team, and he would just jump. I sat down with him when I went to see him and I had a conversation with him. That is what I do when I scout, I had a conversation with him and you can tell the kid he was smart, he wanted to learn, he was witty at the same time. He wasn’t the typical kid who just wanted to be a superstar and wanted to make some money and buy a car. The things he was just saying. This kid has everything. But, the things that he showed at that age I went ‘Wow. This is a superstar’. Right away for two years, I recommended him at Man United. Without a doubt in mind, and I wrote over 40 reports when I was at Man United. I would love to be back, it is a beautiful place. But, I had no doubts in my mind. No doubt</p>
