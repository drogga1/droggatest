  <p>[Lozano may be set for the exit door] We’ve always been a selling club. We can’t resist the big signings from Europe or the amount the teams offer us. We hope to stand by him until a suitable offer arrives and we might have the economic possibilities to get another player.</p>

  <p>[Manchester United have been following the progress of PSV star Hirving Lozano for many years] I can’t say anything exact on Hirving’s future, as he will have to decide with his attorney and his family, who I know have always been influential in his decisions. Who will be his next team? What I can tell you regarding Manchester United is that I definitely know that they hold him in high regard, and not just recently. They have known the player for many years, and not just from his time at PSV. They know exactly the level he can reach.</p>
