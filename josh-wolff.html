<blockquote>
  <p>[Austin FC announced on Tuesday that former U.S. national team forward Josh Wolff would be handed the job as the club’s first head coach] It is a tremendous honor to join Austin FC and begin the process of building Austin’s team into a world-class club for all of Austin to enjoy. My family and I want to thank <a href="anthony-precourt.html">Anthony Precourt</a> for granting us this amazing opportunity to be a part of this incredible city and this extraordinary undertaking<br /><br />[The Texas city already has a stadium deal in place, and Wolff is looking forward to the chance to bring a new club into the league] I know that Austin has a true love of soccer, and it is the opportunity of a lifetime to be part of the first ever major league team of any kind in the Capital of Texas. Our stated ambition is to establish ourselves quickly within MLS as a vibrant, attacking side and we want to reflect the diverse, competitive, and passionate makeup of our club’s home, both on and off the field. We look forward to integrating within Austin at the completion of my current U.S. men’s national team duties, to begin the process of building our team in advance of the 2021 season</p>
