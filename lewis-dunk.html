<p>: 2019 06 01
Arsenal have been urged to look at Bournemouth’s Ryan Fraser and Brighton duo Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy as they prepare to spend a reported £45 million budget</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Lewis Dunk says Brighton travelled to the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Emirates Stadium</a> on Thursday knowing they could turn the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> crowd against their side]</b> I think if we put them under pressure, and got into them early like we did, I think it was going to be tough for them. They are going through a tough time, and if we got on top of them, the crowd would go against them and we managed that. I think it was probably partly our fault that we didn’t kill the game off in the first half. We got into some really good positions, we missed a couple of great chances and if we had come in at half-time leading by more of a gap, I don’t think they even come back into it. We gave them a little chance, but we came back at the end<br /><br /><b>[There were boos at half-time and full-time, with <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Freddie Ljungberg</a> experiencing something of the opposite to a honeymoon period in his first games in charge]</b> We were probably expecting more but it was credit to us the way we can play football. In the end we won dirty if you look at it in the second half. They reacted well after us being on top for the whole of the first half and they showed a good reaction, changed the game and brought on <b>[Nicolas]</b> Pepe. He changed it a little bit for them in their favour and we couldn’t get a foothold but, in the end, we showed great character after to come on and win the game. We have changed a lot and we are showing what we can do, we have got to take credit for the way we performed there and take the positives from it</p>
