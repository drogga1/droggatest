  <p><b>[A 2-0 home loss to Cardiff was a potentially devastating blow]</b> It’s our job and every single one of the players wants to be in the Premier League. It’s the best league in the world, so why would you not want to fight to stay in it? We have to put the performances in and get the points on the board that keep us safe. We’ll make sure we do that until the end of the season. You get those games where you just have to dig in - we were so frustrated when things weren’t going well, but we’ve shown we can react to those disappointments</p>

  <p><b>[Brighton defender Lewis Dunk says that his side are not focused on their involvement in the Premier League title decider]</b> It’s about us doing our own jobs, as a professional footballer you just want to go out and win the games you play. We’re not thinking about their title challenge, we’ve got a good week to prepare for the match and we’ll focus on ourselves and see what happens. It will be nice to go out and have the pressure off slightly this week, we finally have no pressure - I think that might have held us back in recent weeks, but it’s done now, and we’ve earned our place for another year.<br /><br />We showed why we belong in this league, but in the second half of this campaign we haven’t produced that sort of performance enough. We have to build on this sort of showing next year - I thought we were excellent for the first half of this season, if we repeated that points tally in the latter half of the season we’d be near the top half of the table. We have to focus on that first half of the year, it shows it’s tough in this league, but we have things like that to aim for next season. We’ve got one game left now and it’s a big one - we showed on Sunday that although we were safe we went out and performed and put our bodies on the line</p>

  <p><b>[Lewis Dunk says Brighton travelled to the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Emirates Stadium</a> on Thursday knowing they could turn the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> crowd against their side]</b> I think if we put them under pressure, and got into them early like we did, I think it was going to be tough for them. They are going through a tough time, and if we got on top of them, the crowd would go against them and we managed that. I think it was probably partly our fault that we didn’t kill the game off in the first half. We got into some really good positions, we missed a couple of great chances and if we had come in at half-time leading by more of a gap, I don’t think they even come back into it. We gave them a little chance, but we came back at the end<br /><br /><b>[There were boos at half-time and full-time, with <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Freddie Ljungberg</a> experiencing something of the opposite to a honeymoon period in his first games in charge]</b> We were probably expecting more but it was credit to us the way we can play football. In the end we won dirty if you look at it in the second half. They reacted well after us being on top for the whole of the first half and they showed a good reaction, changed the game and brought on <b>[Nicolas]</b> Pepe. He changed it a little bit for them in their favour and we couldn’t get a foothold but, in the end, we showed great character after to come on and win the game. We have changed a lot and we are showing what we can do, we have got to take credit for the way we performed there and take the positives from it</p>
