  <p><b>[Neymar is not worth the €222 million Paris Saint-Germain paid to sign him]</b> I’m not proud of the transfer fee, nor of the fact I’m the most expensive player ever. That’s just money and nothing else. I cannot help it. Personally, I would have paid less for myself. I always wanted to be special. That was my goal very early - actually from the moment I started playing football for a club. That was at the age of 11. It may sound clumsy, but from then on I’ve tried to get better every single day and get to my best. I really worked and sacrificed every day of my life to become a professional one day. That was the only dream I ever had. I dreamed of playing for Santos’s first team, being invited to the national team and one day going to Europe. It was not foreseeable at the time that I would succeed, but I kept thinking about it. There was nothing else for me. I’m proud that I’ve achieved my childhood goal. That was, and is, most important to me. As a player you always have to show who you are and assert yourself. Just referring to the transfer fee does not help you and says nothing about how good you really are.<br /><br /><b>[Neymar missed that match four years ago due to a back injury]</b> I felt as beaten as the team was and was affected like everyone else. The expectations on us in our own country were almost inhumanly high and Germany are an excellent opponent. We knew it would be hard. Unfortunately, it went as it did. Now we finally have the opportunity to wipe out the last World Cup. Maybe we will meet Germany again - and then hopefully we will have a real revenge</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar has refuted accusations of going to ground too easily]</b> I saw <b>[the jokes]</b> but I took them with humour. Even yesterday I posted on Instagram a joke with the children about it. My football is to dribble, to face the opponent. I can’t stand in front of the opponent and say, ‘My dear, excuse me, I want to score a goal’. I can’t do that, I have to dribble past him, I have to try to do something and he will not allow me to go past and he will try to foul me. A lot of times I’m faster and lighter than other players and they tackle me, and the referee is there for that. Do you think I want to suffer tackles all the time? No, it’s painful, it hurts. After the games I stay back four or five hours putting on ice. It’s complicated but if you haven’t experienced that you will never understand.</p>

There are names that will forever remain etched in history, there will always be important Brazilians in football. Ronaldo, Romario, Ronaldinho Gaucho, Kaka, Zico, Rivaldo - I could go on forever. There are many players who were important in their own unique way, that’s why it’s so difficult to just pick one.

  <p><b>[Neymar lifts lid on <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>’s historic 6-1 Champions League win over <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>]</b> Two of my friends said that <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> had a great team - and they did - and that they had already qualified, this and that… But I got up and said: ‘You are my friends, you work with me, but it seems you don’t believe we can turn this game around. We will reverse this situation, and I promise you two goals’. We had trained in the morning and I saw each player’s face. Everyone was happy, nobody was down or worried about reversing the situation against <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. We knew it would be very difficult to reverse the game. Our conversation was about playing football as it had always been <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s play to display good football, to turn a football game into a show. We knew we would win. We didn’t know if we would go through to the next round, but we knew we would win because we knew we would play our part very well.<br /><br />When the game began, it started with a different vibe. I was challenging everyone, running more than ever. It was one of, if not the biggest match I’ve ever played in and one of the most emotional. We scored the first two goals quickly so we were thrilled. We went into half-time 2-0 up with two more goals to score. The team we had was different - we didn’t go about screaming in the dressing room. No, it was a conversation. We were very calm, very focused, relaxed and the only conversation I remember having was: ‘Keep calm, let’s do it goal by goal’. We were not worried about going into the next round. I think that’s why we played really well that day. We were not desperate. We were quiet and focused. The atmosphere after the second goal was different. We saw that the fans were believing. They kept shouting, encouraging us.<br /><br />When we scored the third goal, it was Leo <b>[<a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>]</b> who scored. I won the penalty, he scored it. The fans were on fire and we thought: ‘Let’s go, now we’re going to go through’. At that moment, we suffered a blow, <b>[Edinson]</b> <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Cavani</a>’s goal. When we conceded the goal, we saw everyone was half-hearted, doing that face: ‘We’re f*cked’. It became more difficult, it was practically impossible. Everyone thought we would score another, but now we had to score three. We still tried to keep playing our football, to continue to score goals, to see what would happen. We just hoped not to concede any more goals. One goal had already complicated things because we had to score three. Two? Forget about it. I still believed. I still wanted to score those two goals I promised to my friends. Oh, it gives me shivers, a lot of strong emotions definitely<br /><br /><b>[Moments later, <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> won a penalty and it was the Brazilian who was charged with the responsibility to take it]</b> I was going to give it to Leo, but Leo told me to take the penalty. He said: ‘No, you go’. I said: ‘Me?’ He said: ‘Yes, you do it’. My only thought was that I could not miss that penalty, because if I missed the penalty I would end the stadium’s dream of going through to the next round. It was the most I’ve ever focused on a penalty, and thank God I managed to score. I kept the promise of two goals. That was the moment I thought we had it. I asked Leo: ‘Why did you let me take that penalty?’. He said: ‘I felt at that moment that you would score the goal, that you were more confident’. I think he had that feeling, and it turned out alright. The penalty brought the possibility, the strength, to score the sixth goal<br /><br />In that game, the most striking goal was <a href="sergi-roberto.html">Sergi Roberto</a> 9484afd5836d307b314a404d745a9a68. It was the goal that made us go through. It’s the goal that will be remembered in history and I’m happy to have made the move, but his goal was special - that’s when the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> exploded. That was the most important goal. I think that, in terms of excitement, in terms of making everyone crazy, that was one of the most important goals in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> history. I wasn’t crying, I was over the moon! It was crazy. I had never seen <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> like that. After the sixth goal, the explosion was huge, both for the players and the fans. It was something that I don’t think I’ll ever live through again. That’s why I’ll remember it for the rest of my life</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar is relieved the investigation into rape allegations against him has been closed]</b> This will be a chapter in my life that I’ll never forget. For many reasons. The main one ‘THE DAMAGE’ it caused to me, to my family and to all the people that really know me. I’ll be sincere and I won’t say I’m happy, but I’m relieved. The wound will always be here, so that I can remember how the human being is capable of doing good things but also BAD ones! Yes, my world has fallen apart and I fell to the ground … but as a jiu-jitsu legend says: ‘For many people the ground is the end of everything but for us that’s just the beginning’. May it be the beginning not only for me but for all those who suffered this kind of false allegations and MAINLY to all WOMEN who are REALLY a victim of this act.

  <p><b>[Neymar is determined to make history for <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> when the Champions League returns in August]</b> This period was atypical, but the main focus was to keep safe, with steady body and mind.

I can barely wait to enter the pitch and to, if it’s God’s will, make history</p>
