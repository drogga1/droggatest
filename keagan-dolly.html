  <p><b>[Keagan Dolly’s father accuses Patrice Motsepe and Mamelodi Sundowns of misleading the public]</b> When they were interested in Keagan‚ we as a family really didn’t want him to go back to Sundowns. Because we had struggled to get him out of Sundowns when he was a junior. But they <b>[Sundowns]</b> kept on pressing - ‘They want Keagan‚ they want Keagan’. And we sat down as a family and a company‚ and discussed what the good way was for Keagan - it was a buyout clause - that was the only way we would let Keagan go back to Sundowns. They didn’t want to put that in. Eventually they came around.<br /><br />My director‚ Paul Mitchell‚ was doing the negotiations with <b>[Sundowns’ commercial and legal manager]</b> Yogesh Singh, and before anything he would come back to me as the father‚ and say; ‘What should we do and how are we doing it?’. We came up with this figure of around €750 000, and they <b>[Downs]</b> agreed to it in principle. Mitchell flew to Cape Town with the contract‚ and Keagan signed it‚ and we all had to sign it.<br /><br />All of a sudden there was a phone call from <b>[Downs president]</b> Patrice <b>[Motsepe]</b>. He wanted the buyout clause to be €1.5-million, and it was a shock for us. Why now‚ after we agreed as professionals? What went wrong? Myself and Paul weren’t available‚ but we went around discussing and putting our heads together. Must we sign it? And eventually for Keagan‚ from where he had been at Ajax‚ where that <b>[his salary]</b> was peanuts‚ let me be straight‚ playing for three years in the PSL - that was not good for him. He needed more. And we decided that‚ OK‚ it’s good for him‚ let’s sign the contract, but in the contract - this‚ I know - the amount that was in this second contract of 2015 was the <b>[same]</b> amount that was in the first contract of 2014, and all of a sudden it’s a mistake. And I don’t know - honestly‚ how can you make a mistake like that? I’m not a lawyer‚ but there were two lawyers involved. Yogesh Singh and another lady‚ who I believe was called Govender … They handled these contracts. Are you telling me they couldn’t pick up a mistake after 15 or 16 months?.<br /><br /><b>[Ramon strongly believes that Sundowns never thought his son would be wanted by European clubs when they first agreed to the contract]</b> What I think is that they never thought a European club would come for Keagan. Then now they’re claiming it’s a mistake. They claim it was one mistake - it’s a whole new clause there. There’s a currency change‚ there’s a date in 2015’s contract‚ the amount has changed. There are a lot of things - 10 or nine changes - different wording and changes. We accepted it. Like we had accepted the first contract signed in 2014. And now we accepted the one in 2015. And they <b>[Sundowns]</b> accepted it, because both lawyers signed - Yogesh Singh and Govender, and how can it be a mistake when there’s a whole different clause? Everything has changed - the whole lot</p>

  <p><b>[Mamelodi Sundowns have released a letter in which Keagan Dolly was invited to the Manchester City academy last year]</b> Mamelodi Sundowns has decided to release the email that it received on 25 August 2016 from Brian Marwood, Managing Director of City Football Services inviting Keagan Dolly and Mamelodi Sundowns to the Manchester City Football Academy.<br /><br />This email was part of the ongoing communications and exploratory discussions that Mamelodi Sundowns initiated with City Football Group in 2015 and representitives from City Football Group visited Mamelodi Sundowns and attended some of its games. It is clear from the email that City Football Group and its scouts had been following Keagan Dolly ‘for quite some time’. Part of the discussions between Mamelodi Sundowns and City Football Group were to ‘park’ Keagan Dolly in the short term, at one of the European Clubs that had a partnership with City Football Group.<br /><br />We are disappointed and concerned by the continuous lies and misrepresentation which is spread by Paul Mitchell, Keagan Dolly’s agent, which makes any cooperation difficult. Mamelodi Sundowns does not want to be seen as a Club that can be blackmailed to sell players because of misrepresentations and pressure in the media. Mamelodi Sundowns remains committed, as stated by its President Patrice Motsepe, to immediately release Keagan Dolly to any Club which comply’s with the buy-out clause which was upheld by the PSL Dispute Resolution Chamber.</p>
