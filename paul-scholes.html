  <p><b>[Paul Scholes retires from international football. Scholes, 29, who won the last of his 66 caps in England’s Euro 2004 defeat against Portugal, admitted he had thought long and hard about retiring]</b> This is a decision I have not taken lightly. I have been considering retiring from international football for a while now<br /><br />I started my international career in 1997 and have enjoyed seven years of great football, playing in the best competitions, with some of the best players under the best managers<br /><br />Euro 2004 was fantastic but afterwards I felt the time was right for myself and my family to make it my last England appearance. I would like to thank everyone at England for the wonderful years I had playing for the team and all the experience I gained. I wish them all the best and good luck for the future</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Scholes says When he go he will miss football, not the life of a footballer]</b> How long will I go on? I’d think two years at the most. I have one year left on my contract and, hopefully, I’ll get another one, but I suppose it all depends on how you’re feeling and how you’re playing<br /><br />I can’t say that I can’t wait to finish, but I am looking forward to finishing being involved with everything that goes with it. I suppose people are just very invasive and are always wanting to know what you’re going to do. The only thing I will definitely miss is the football, not the general life of a footballer<br /><br />At the moment, though, I just think two years would be about right. I feel OK right now and as long as I feel OK then I’ll carry on<br /><br />It’s difficult to say whether I want to bow out at the top <b>[with United]</b> or not. I’ll just have to see, when the time comes, whether I want to carry on playing somewhere else at a lower level. But I don’t look that far ahead<br /><br /><b>[Moscow secured redemption, but Scholes admits that he and United should not have waited quite so long to get their hands on the European Cup once more]</b> Moscow meant everything. It was a great night to win probably the biggest trophy in club football. Maybe we were a bit lucky towards the end, but I was always hopeful we’d win it again<br /><br />When you’ve got a team like we have, especially one playing as well as we were doing in the last year, I always thought there would be a chance and luckily we did it<br /><br />But I don’t think it matters how much you win because, as soon as you win it, the day after you look forward and try and win it again. I would have liked to have won it more, or even just got to the final a bit more. Hopefully, we can do better this time than we did after 1999, when we had to wait another nine years<br /><br />I don’t have my medals on show, though. They’re just locked away somewhere. I got a medal in 1999, but I don’t view myself as a double Champions League winner. You’ve got to play in the final for it to count<br /><br /><b>[Scholes says he does not see the appeal of trading United for another club]</b> If other players fancy a move and a bit of money, then good luck to them. But if they’re at a place like this <b>[United]</b>, I don’t think they realise how lucky they are to be playing here<br /><br />It’s always a step down after here. There are obviously big clubs in the world, but while certain people think it might be a progression if they move somewhere else, when you leave here, I don’t think it is. I’ve had everything I need. I’m at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and I’m from Manchester, so what more do I need?</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Scholes feels Wayne Rooney would be best utilised in midfield for England’s Euro 2016 qualifier with Switzerland]</b> It is quite obvious to me that we do not have a midfielder with the range of passing to exploit these three attacking players <b>[Welbeck, Sturridge and Sterling]</b>. It is a radical solution, and one I would propose just for the Switzerland qualifier, but I would play Wayne Rooney in midfield. He is the best passer in the team and he can play that role better than anyone. One thing you can be sure about Wayne is that he is not bothered about taking risks. If he saw the pass was on, he would hit it. If it did not work out, that would not deter him from trying it again and again. He would make that pass more often than not. The absence of a specialist midfielder capable of passing the ball with flair concerns me. Steven Gerrard could do it at his peak but he has stepped away from international football. Frank Lampard was never that kind of player. I look through the current squad and wonder who will provide the range of passing required. Moving Wayne would be a compromise for Roy Hodgson because this England team is not so blessed with goals that it can afford to lose its top goalscorer from the front line. During and after the World Cup I argued for Wayne to be played as a centre-forward but, with these three ahead of him, he could be a huge influence. And he could still make runs into the box.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Scholes believes Jack Wilshere has developed into England’s best player]</b> I thought Jack Wilshere had two very good games for England during the last week. I would go one step further than that and say that, at the moment, Wilshere is England’s best player. The penny has dropped and he has added another dimension to his game. He has always been capable of that intricate passing game. Now he can play the ball long, too.<br /><br /><b>[On Wayne Rooney]</b> The quality of some of those passes into Wayne Rooney in Estonia was very high. You cannot underestimate the importance of eye-contact between a midfielder and a striker in those situations. Wilshere mentioned it in one of the interviews that he gave and I would agree that it is critical. With the great forwards I played with, it was often the case that you did not need a call or a signal. Often, it was just a look and it was enough to know where they were going. Wilshere and Rooney seemed to have that</p>

But now they are a ghost of the side they had once been. They still pass the ball relentlessly, but that old drive and tempo are not nearly as urgent. The breathtaking speed and penetration have gone. When I try to find a way of summarising the attitude of the team, and of some longer-serving individuals, I keep alighting on the word ‘bored’. As for <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, his achievements put him in a different category to the rest of us who played the game. But even so, in him, as much as anyone, I detected that mood of boredom. He has never been a player given to chasing the full-back when his team lose the ball, but now, more than ever, he keeps his movement to an absolute minimum</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Nemanja Vidic</a> of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> Take it from me, Vida is one very hard lad.

Well, Vida does fancy it, no matter how tough the assignment. He relishes the physical challenge of the game, the heading, the tackling, the getting in against fearsome opponents when the chips are down. It took him a little while to settle when he arrived in Manchester, but soon he proved himself to be top quality, not only as a warrior, but also in his use of the ball. Vida is a natural for the role of captain, leading from the front</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Nemanja Vidic</a> of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> It might surprise you to hear that Nemanja, who arrived from Spartak Moscow, was not the powerful centre-back he became over his years with the club. There was nothing of him when he arrived. He was skinny and relatively easy to push off the ball. <b>[. . .]</b> he took a battering in his first few weeks at the club - in training as well as matches. <b>[. . .]</b><br /><br />Nemanja must have realised quite early on that he was not strong enough to play in the centre of defence at that time, so he did something about it. For the next year, every time I walked past the gym, I would see Nemanja in there lifting weights. He turned himself into a big, strong centre-half who was capable of knocking strikers out of the way. He always had a great ability to head the ball, but allied with his strength he became unbeatable in the air.<br /><br />Throughout his United career, we would play away at difficult grounds and it would be Nemanja heading crosses and set pieces when the team were under pressure. In training, he was different. He always fancied himself as a No 10, and he was a very skilful individual. It was a shame that his injuries got the better of him at the end of his time at Old Trafford</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Scholes believes Manchester United can win the Europa League and finish in the top four]</b> It’s not just Europe, with the League Cup, the FA Cup and the league. It’s going to be difficult for them but I think they’ve got a squad big enough to handle it. The players at this stage of the season are fit enough, they don’t need to be doing much training. I think training will just be a token gesture really and they’ll just focus on games now, playing Saturday-Wednesday-Saturday-Wednesday or whatever it may be and just getting on with the games and hopefully going on a good run and winning the games<br /><br />Each game at this stage of the season is so important because it’s the busiest, and this is where you win your trophies: from February to May. This is the business end of it really, and you just go from one game to another. Whether it’s the FA Cup or League Cup or Europa League it doesn’t really matter, you’re just trying to win all the games<br /><br />Roma I would say are probably the other big team in it, they’re a good side. There are some Spanish teams in it too, Celta Vigo and Athletic Bilbao. Bilbao are always a decent team, but I think United are capable of beating any of these teams and going all the way. With the league not looking nailed-on, although I do think they’ll finish in the top four, it’s a great chance of getting to the Champions League. The Europa League has become a big competition purely because of the Champions League status it has at the end of it. I don’t think it will come down to that, I think United will finish in the top four anyway, but it’s something to fall back on. At the end of the day it’s nice to win a trophy as well<br /><br />I think when they were favourites at the start of the season that was possibly to do with the name, but now I think there’s a real genuine belief that they can win it not just because of the teams that are left in it but because of the way they’ve been performing of late: they look like a team that can score goals, like a team that can beat most teams, especially the teams that are left in the Europa League. The squad’s massive and that big squad is going to be needed because they’re going to have so many games with the league games, they’ve got the final in the League Cup which will be done and dusted in a couple of weeks, and if they stay in the FA Cup they’ve got FA Cup games so there’s going to be games every week. But I think that’s why they spent so much money to have a squad capable of dealing with that</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Scholes says Zlatan Ibrahimovic still has the demeanour of a 30-year-old]</b> There’s always going to be doubters. I wasn’t 100 per cent sure myself when a 35-year-old centre-forward comes over, but when you look at him he’s not a 35-year-old really with his physique and the way he looks after himself, he’s still a really fit lad. You’re probably still looking at a 30-year-old really!.<br /><br />He’s been very good. I would have been worried if he’d been here the last couple of years, but the style of football they’re playing now suits him down to the ground. You knew he’d be good because he’s played at big clubs all around the world, it was never a signing that was a risk really as you knew he’d be capable of scoring goals and it’s proven so<br /><br />The only thing I would have liked to see is someone supporting him a bit better with a few more goals, that’s the only thing and probably where the problem is: there’s probably a little bit too much pressure on him scoring goals. But he’s delivered, you have to say that. Twenty-plus goals in a team that’s sixth at the minute is fantastic</p>

And to see somebody like Zlatan Ibrahimovic playing and training with him every day will only bring him on.<br /><br />It’s always a gradual rise, I suppose. Ryan Giggs was different, he was 17 and was banged straight in because he was that good and you couldn’t afford to leave him out. With us, or with me at least, there was always chance to leave you out because as young players you’re going to be inconsistent and you need to sit back and watch and learn at times. I think Marcus is in the ideal place to be doing that<br /><br />He had a great first six months or so, didn’t he? He’s quietened off a little bit, but still I really like him.

  <p><b>[Paul Scholes says he wouldn’t hesitate offering Michael Carrick a new one-year contract at Manchester United]</b> He’s definitely worth another year, Michael. He’s not a player who burns himself out in games, he’s more of a controlled player, he’s a fit lad but he always knows where to be on a football pitch. He’s always in the right place, he plays his position brilliantly and when he came into the team from October onwards there were something like 16, 17 or 18 games maybe where they didn’t lose. He had a big influence on people like Paul Pogba, he got the best out of him and Herrera. He’s just tailed off a little bit over the last couple of weeks but I still think he’s got a part to play.<br /><br />It was a big help for me when I was playing.

It’s difficult to tell since we don’t know what’s going on at the training ground but he’s been fit for a few weeks now and whether his focus is totally on football or on something else I don’t know, but for one reason or another the manager’s not playing him. If he was fit and flying and playing the way he should be, and training the way he should be, he would definitely be the first-choice left back.<br /><br /><b>[Mourinho’s treatment of Shaw comes after the Portuguese handled Armenian forward Mkhitaryan similarly earlier this season]</b> It’s his right to do that, isn’t it? He sees them every day in training, he knows if they’re doing well enough day-in, day-out to be in his team on a Saturday. It was a puzzle about Mkhitaryan, we just didn’t know what was happening with the player we’d seen for so long but there was obviously something that wasn’t quite right in his performance when he did play, or in his training performances. But now he looks like a totally different player. Martial I think he’s done similar things with. I think he’s left him out for long spells, he brought him in against Watford and he did really well. He’s a young player as well, people forget how young he is. He’s going to make mistakes a lot but I think it’s clear to see the potential he has. He could be one of the real top players in the world</p>

If you’re going to win leagues, that’s not enough, it’s just not enough.

We had four centre-forwards - <b>[Andy]</b> Cole, Teddy <b>[Sheringham]</b>, Ole <b>[Gunnar Solskjaer]</b> and <b>[Dwight]</b> Yorke - and when they through bad spells, which every footballer does, someone else was waiting to come in. That helped their performances because they knew that if they didn’t perform then they would be taken off. Maybe Lukaku needs that, too</p>

The personnel hasn’t changed from last season - they still conceded chances last season and the keeper was magnificent, he made three or four world class save every game and we aren’t seeing that this season.

You’re going to be losing a player who you know can be world class. Can you talk about getting better players next to him? Who is out there that’s going to improve him? If he’s got a manager that is strong enough with him, you go back to <b>[Massimiliano]</b> <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> at Juventus, and the players he was with there, he did a job in that team. He worked his absolute backside off, which he should be doing every week. You get the feeling now that he has come to this club and thinks he’s the big fish, he needs to be the one showing off every week, he’s doing things he doesn’t need to be doing on a football pitch. You see his stud roll, he needs to become more clever about what he’s doing.<br /><br />His strengths are running, passing the ball, getting into the box, scoring goals, assisting goals. Once he starts stud rolling and trying to beat men, it’s not his game, he becomes easy to play against. If he passes the ball forward and runs, there’s nobody in the world who can stay with him.

He left him out and didn’t have that much of an effect on him. He thinks he’s the big player, the one that needs to show people he’s the best in the world and he doesn’t. He just needs to play simple, he’s got team-mates around him who should appreciate him and do appreciate him. He’s a good lad, as a young player he wanted to learn, he was desperate to learn. I just don’t think he’s getting the maturity, the sense is not coming to him.<br /><br />At Juventus we saw the best midfield player in the world, without a shadow of a doubt. I think it’s because he had a strong manager, a top manager behind him and great players. Not just decent players like he’s got now, he had special players to guide him and to lead him. I don’t think United have that. He could be a player who needs a Bryan Robson or a Roy Keane next to him just to give him a little rollicking every now and then. If he doesn’t get that he just carries on in his own little fantasy world, thinking he’s the best. He’s part of a team, it’s not about him. It’s not just about me doing tricks and being on YouTube and showing Real Madrid or Barcelona how good I am. It’s about being part of a team at Manchester United.

When I played we had four centre-forwards, who were brilliant, and they were centre-forwards.

  <p><b>[Paul Scholes suggests <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> might actually have been trying too hard and losing his value to the side as a result]</b> It seems like he thinks he has to be a footballer, that he has to come into a number 10 role. He doesn’t, that’s the last thing that he needs to do. He’s not got the ability to do that. His strengths are running in behind, getting on the end of crosses, and the midfield players have to tell him to do that. ‘Don’t come in here, don’t come as a number 10, you can’t play’. I don’t mean disrespect to him. He’s someone who has to run in behind, and he can finish. He can score goals</p>

When you are on the left, you can create a lot more things on your own, giving that little bit more to the team.

  <p><b>[Scholes accuses <a href="didier-deschamps.html">Deschamps</a> of overreacting to get <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> midfielder suspended for Champions League final]</b> You just deal with it don’t you. I was gutted at the time but there’s nothing you can do about it. I tackled <a href="didier-deschamps.html">Deschamps</a> and I’ve seen it a few times. I don’t think it was a foul, to be honest with you. It was right in front of the ref, he screamed like a big girl, like a big baby which didn’t help me. It got me booked and I missed the final but I may not have played in the final, you never know<br /><br /><b>[Scholes says this was proof of the strength in depth <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> had throughout his fearsome squad at the time]</b> We had massive games. Big games against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> to win the league, <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> cup final the next Saturday and then the Champions League final. I was devastated to miss it, of course I was. Roy was as well. But it didn’t matter who was missing, we still had the capability in the squad, someone can fill in and do just as good a job</p>

We got absolutely battered in the Bernabeu one year. 3-1 it was in the first game but what a team that was. It’s not far away from that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> team.

  <p><b>[Scholes is very much a member of the Fernandes fan club]</b> Sometimes it just takes one player to turn a team around and knit a team together. I don’t like talking about City, but you think of <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> - that player that links all the play together, and I think we’ve found him in Fernandes. He’s totally transformed the team. It’s gone from watching a little bit of a dull team, to one player coming in and all of a sudden they look like they’re going to create, they look like they’re going to score goals every time he’s in possession of the ball. He’s fitted in straight away. <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Nemanja Vidic</a> and <a href="patrice-evra.html">Patrice Evra</a> really struggled for the first six to eight months. I think they signed in January. It wasn’t until the season after when they really got used to it and picked up and went on to have really amazing careers. But this lad, he’s picked it up straight away, and it’s been a real benefit. I keep saying he’s transformed the team, but I really think he has<br /><br />Paul has got a little bit of work to do to get into the team. Before the outbreak happened and the stop happened, you have to say that the players that were playing - <a href="nemanja-matic.html">Nemanja Matic</a>, <a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a> and <a href="fred.html">Fred</a> - they were really doing well in midfield. It’s not going to be straightforward for Paul. He’s got some work on his hands just to get back into the team. But we all know what Paul’s capable of. He’s a top player when he’s on form. The better players you play with - surely that can only be to the benefit of the team</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Scholes has backed <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> to secure a top-four finish]</b> Yes I am. I think if we didn’t have this break, I think we were certainties to get it. There’s just no knowing how we’ll come out of it. I think we’ll be fine. We’ve got big players coming back into the team, which we didn’t have in Marcus and Paul coming back into the squad. If they can come back, hit the ground running I think they’ve got every chance. It’d be great to get to an FA Cup final as well, although it’ll probably be a little bit strange with no fans there - but still, it’s a trophy and you’d like to win it. You just have to wait and see but I think they’ve got a great chance. What is it, three points behind <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>? Our fixtures do look quite favourable. Fingers crossed we’ll come back in the same vein of form and hopefully get that Champions League spot at the end of the year</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Scholes has recalled being man-marked by Park Ji-sung in training]</b> I do remember you trying to man-mark me, but you weren’t the only one, Wes! Do you know who the worst one was? Park Ji-sung. He was a nightmare! He was unbelievable. Do you remember when he did it against <b>[Andrea]</b> <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Pirlo</a>? Ah, he was unreal! He had energy all day and discipline. The discipline was unreal. He just used to come up to me, look at me and not say a word, stand right next to me… ‘Oh Jesus, here we go!’ ‘Come on, ginge!’ - Just say something to me, have a laugh with me! But he was unbelievable at it. He just used to come and stare right into my face, stare right into my eyes, ‘You’re not getting a kick today’<br /><br /><b>[Scholes also revealed that he initially rose through United’s academy ranks as a centre-forward]</b> I grew up as a centre-forward. I was just a goalscorer which you find hard to believe to where my position went on but I always liked playing in midfield. Eric Harrison always said I’d be a central midfield player and possession was everything we did when you’re 11-12 years of age in the academy, it was just always about possession so over the years you’re just watching players and you learn how to do it</p>
