  <p><b>[Paul Scholes retires from international football. Scholes, 29, who won the last of his 66 caps in England’s Euro 2004 defeat against Portugal, admitted he had thought long and hard about retiring]</b> This is a decision I have not taken lightly. I have been considering retiring from international football for a while now<br /><br />I started my international career in 1997 and have enjoyed seven years of great football, playing in the best competitions, with some of the best players under the best managers<br /><br />Euro 2004 was fantastic but afterwards I felt the time was right for myself and my family to make it my last England appearance. I would like to thank everyone at England for the wonderful years I had playing for the team and all the experience I gained. I wish them all the best and good luck for the future</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Scholes says When he go he will miss football, not the life of a footballer]</b> How long will I go on? I’d think two years at the most. I have one year left on my contract and, hopefully, I’ll get another one, but I suppose it all depends on how you’re feeling and how you’re playing<br /><br />I can’t say that I can’t wait to finish, but I am looking forward to finishing being involved with everything that goes with it. I suppose people are just very invasive and are always wanting to know what you’re going to do. The only thing I will definitely miss is the football, not the general life of a footballer<br /><br />At the moment, though, I just think two years would be about right. I feel OK right now and as long as I feel OK then I’ll carry on<br /><br />It’s difficult to say whether I want to bow out at the top <b>[with United]</b> or not. I’ll just have to see, when the time comes, whether I want to carry on playing somewhere else at a lower level. But I don’t look that far ahead<br /><br /><b>[Moscow secured redemption, but Scholes admits that he and United should not have waited quite so long to get their hands on the European Cup once more]</b> Moscow meant everything. It was a great night to win probably the biggest trophy in club football. Maybe we were a bit lucky towards the end, but I was always hopeful we’d win it again<br /><br />When you’ve got a team like we have, especially one playing as well as we were doing in the last year, I always thought there would be a chance and luckily we did it<br /><br />But I don’t think it matters how much you win because, as soon as you win it, the day after you look forward and try and win it again. I would have liked to have won it more, or even just got to the final a bit more. Hopefully, we can do better this time than we did after 1999, when we had to wait another nine years<br /><br />I don’t have my medals on show, though. They’re just locked away somewhere. I got a medal in 1999, but I don’t view myself as a double Champions League winner. You’ve got to play in the final for it to count<br /><br /><b>[Scholes says he does not see the appeal of trading United for another club]</b> If other players fancy a move and a bit of money, then good luck to them. But if they’re at a place like this <b>[United]</b>, I don’t think they realise how lucky they are to be playing here<br /><br />It’s always a step down after here. There are obviously big clubs in the world, but while certain people think it might be a progression if they move somewhere else, when you leave here, I don’t think it is. I’ve had everything I need. I’m at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and I’m from Manchester, so what more do I need?</p>

But now they are a ghost of the side they had once been. They still pass the ball relentlessly, but that old drive and tempo are not nearly as urgent. The breathtaking speed and penetration have gone. When I try to find a way of summarising the attitude of the team, and of some longer-serving individuals, I keep alighting on the word ‘bored’. As for <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, his achievements put him in a different category to the rest of us who played the game. But even so, in him, as much as anyone, I detected that mood of boredom. He has never been a player given to chasing the full-back when his team lose the ball, but now, more than ever, he keeps his movement to an absolute minimum</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Nemanja Vidic</a> of Manchester United]</b> Take it from me, Vida is one very hard lad. Sometimes you might hear criticism of foreign players who might have plenty of fancy tricks on the ball, but throw them into battle on a freezing wet February night at Bolton, or Stoke, or <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a>, and they just don’t fancy it. Well, Vida does fancy it, no matter how tough the assignment. He relishes the physical challenge of the game, the heading, the tackling, the getting in against fearsome opponents when the chips are down. It took him a little while to settle when he arrived in Manchester, but soon he proved himself to be top quality, not only as a warrior, but also in his use of the ball. Vida is a natural for the role of captain, leading from the front</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Nemanja Vidic</a> of Manchester United]</b> It might surprise you to hear that Nemanja, who arrived from Spartak Moscow, was not the powerful centre-back he became over his years with the club. There was nothing of him when he arrived. He was skinny and relatively easy to push off the ball. <b>[. . .]</b> he took a battering in his first few weeks at the club - in training as well as matches. <b>[. . .]</b><br /><br />Nemanja must have realised quite early on that he was not strong enough to play in the centre of defence at that time, so he did something about it. For the next year, every time I walked past the gym, I would see Nemanja in there lifting weights. He turned himself into a big, strong centre-half who was capable of knocking strikers out of the way. He always had a great ability to head the ball, but allied with his strength he became unbeatable in the air.<br /><br />Throughout his United career, we would play away at difficult grounds and it would be Nemanja heading crosses and set pieces when the team were under pressure. In training, he was different. He always fancied himself as a No 10, and he was a very skilful individual. It was a shame that his injuries got the better of him at the end of his time at Old Trafford</p>

But I genuinely get more enjoyment from watching even my son’s team, Royter Town.

A game that I’ve thought ‘Wow!’ It’s difficult to think of any. You hear about people saying English football’s the best football there is around. I think Spain’s by far the best league. Germany has better teams. In Italy probably the strength in depth isn’t great</p>

His strengths are running in behind, getting on the end of crosses, and the midfield players have to tell him to do that. ‘Don’t come in here, don’t come as a number 10, you can’t play’.

The lad has got ability, he’s a young player, he’s not played much football. I think against the better teams in midfield they may get found out. Which is why I’m saying against the better teams, counter-attack. I don’t think they are the type of team when they play against the top teams, like Chelsea or Manchester City, who are going to go toe-to-toe with them with possession. I just don’t think they are a good enough team to do that</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd legend Scholes picks out three signings Red Devils need]</b> It’s a team that really lacks creativity.

Also maybe a patrolling midfield player who can set all the play up as well, take the ball off the back four and link it through to the forward. And I also think they’re desperate for a No. 9, I don’t think they’re good enough in the forward areas. But it’s the start of Ole’s rebuild, he didn’t think <b>[Romelu]</b> <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> was good enough for that, he didn’t see a place for <b>[Alexis]</b> Sanchez so he’s got rid of them.

When you are on the left, you can create a lot more things on your own, giving that little bit more to the team.

They had the Brazilian <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>, <a href="luis-figo.html">Luis Figo</a>, <a href="fernando-redondo.html">Redondo</a> was unreal, Raul, <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a>, <a href="fernando-hierro.html">Hierro</a>, <a href="iker-casillas.html">Iker Casillas</a> in goal, that was a team that was just ridiculous. We came up against some ridiculous teams. We did alright against them but <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> just had that edge over that great <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> team</p>

  <p><b>[Scholes is very much a member of the Fernandes fan club]</b> Sometimes it just takes one player to turn a team around and knit a team together. I don’t like talking about City, but you think of <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> - that player that links all the play together, and I think we’ve found him in Fernandes. He’s totally transformed the team. It’s gone from watching a little bit of a dull team, to one player coming in and all of a sudden they look like they’re going to create, they look like they’re going to score goals every time he’s in possession of the ball. He’s fitted in straight away. <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Nemanja Vidic</a> and <a href="patrice-evra.html">Patrice Evra</a> really struggled for the first six to eight months. I think they signed in January. It wasn’t until the season after when they really got used to it and picked up and went on to have really amazing careers. But this lad, he’s picked it up straight away, and it’s been a real benefit. I keep saying he’s transformed the team, but I really think he has<br /><br />Paul has got a little bit of work to do to get into the team. Before the outbreak happened and the stop happened, you have to say that the players that were playing - <a href="nemanja-matic.html">Nemanja Matic</a>, <a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a> and <a href="fred.html">Fred</a> - they were really doing well in midfield. It’s not going to be straightforward for Paul. He’s got some work on his hands just to get back into the team. But we all know what Paul’s capable of. He’s a top player when he’s on form. The better players you play with - surely that can only be to the benefit of the team</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Scholes has backed <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> to secure a top-four finish]</b> Yes I am. I think if we didn’t have this break, I think we were certainties to get it. There’s just no knowing how we’ll come out of it. I think we’ll be fine. We’ve got big players coming back into the team, which we didn’t have in Marcus and Paul coming back into the squad. If they can come back, hit the ground running I think they’ve got every chance. It’d be great to get to an FA Cup final as well, although it’ll probably be a little bit strange with no fans there - but still, it’s a trophy and you’d like to win it. You just have to wait and see but I think they’ve got a great chance. What is it, three points behind <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>? Our fixtures do look quite favourable. Fingers crossed we’ll come back in the same vein of form and hopefully get that Champions League spot at the end of the year</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Scholes has recalled being man-marked by Park Ji-sung in training]</b> I do remember you trying to man-mark me, but you weren’t the only one, Wes! Do you know who the worst one was? Park Ji-sung. He was a nightmare! He was unbelievable. Do you remember when he did it against <b>[Andrea]</b> <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Pirlo</a>? Ah, he was unreal! He had energy all day and discipline. The discipline was unreal. He just used to come up to me, look at me and not say a word, stand right next to me… ‘Oh Jesus, here we go!’ ‘Come on, ginge!’ - Just say something to me, have a laugh with me! But he was unbelievable at it. He just used to come and stare right into my face, stare right into my eyes, ‘You’re not getting a kick today’<br /><br /><b>[Scholes also revealed that he initially rose through United’s academy ranks as a centre-forward]</b> I grew up as a centre-forward. I was just a goalscorer which you find hard to believe to where my position went on but I always liked playing in midfield. Eric Harrison always said I’d be a central midfield player and possession was everything we did when you’re 11-12 years of age in the academy, it was just always about possession so over the years you’re just watching players and you learn how to do it</p>
