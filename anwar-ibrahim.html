We also need to know that space should be given to <a href="mahatir-muhammad.html">Tun Mahathir</a> as Prime Minister to determine what is best. In this regard, it is not just about Anwar’s case.

  <p><b>[Anwar Says He Will Succeed Mahathir as Malaysia Prime Minister Around 2020]</b> There’s an understanding that it should be around that time, but I don’t think I should be too petty about the exact month. But there is this understanding that he will resign at the appropriate time<br /><br /><b>[Anwar dismiss reports that Minister of Economic Affairs Azmin Ali or Mukhriz Mahathir, the prime minister’s son, would be considered for the role instead of him]</b> There’s no sign of any party introducing or promoting or lobbying for other names. This does not stop other individuals with ambitions with their own design. And this to me is quite irrelevant. Whether it has been discussed, whether it has been given legitimacy, the answer is no<br /><br /><b>[Anwar reserved his strongest comments on the impact of the forest fires burning in Indonesia]</b> We should feel outraged and I consider this an ecological warfare. It is not a small matter. It is affecting essentially millions of our people. We have to be stronger, regardless of whether it’s Malaysia, Singapore or Indonesia - I mean these are big companies. Why are we not making sure they are being held accountable and at least bear part of the cost</p>

It has created a lot of questions from our partners so he should come forward to give his side <b>[of the story]</b><br /><br /><b>[Asked in what capacity Mr Azmin met the opposition lawmakers]</b> That is why we want his explanation whether it is representing the government or party. If it is based on his capacity as the government, why weren’t other lawmakers invited?<br /><br /><b>[When he was pressed on whether the meeting was appropriate after the PH loss in the recent by-election, Mr Anwar said]</b> Sometimes our friends do not learn from our experience like the huge defeat in Tanjung Piai</p>
