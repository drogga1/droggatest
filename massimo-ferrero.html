  <p><b>[Sampdoria president Massimo Ferrero has confirmed that Lucas Torreira has left the club to join Arsenal for €30 million]</b> Sampdoria do not sell unless there are excellent offers. We do not look for buyers. We have natural talents whose values increase exponentially. Sampdoria is a stepping stone. It’s a family-run club and that allows players to grow up. It’s normal they have aspirations to play for big clubs, but I do not need to sell out. Torreira has left for €30 million. I bought him from Pescara when no one believed. We bet and we won, paying just €3 million. The money that comes in is used to keep the club going. Sampdoria is a stepping stone. It’s a family-run club and that allows players to grow up.</p>

  <p><b>[Massimo Ferrero, the president of Sampdoria, one of the city’s two top-flight clubs, had called for all of this weekend’s Serie A games to be postponed as a mark of respect]</b> I thank president Gaetano Micciche and all of Serie A for the sensitivity shown to Sampdoria and its fans. Postponing the games Sampdoria-Fiorentina and Milan-Genoa represents an important act of solidarity that Genoa and the Genoese people, who are living days of profound pain and sincere astonishment, will not forget. It is also right that the rest of Serie A goes ahead and starts in other stadiums: that takes nothing away from the sense of closeness and fraternity that all of Italy showed it has in its soul as a nation that gets back on its feet every time. Genoa will get back on its feet again too: stronger, more secure and even more beautiful.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a> president Massimo Ferrero said the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> season ‘must end here’ because of coronavirus]</b> Let’s organise ourselves to say that this championship must end here and now. I say it with a heavy heart, because I do want to resume, but only when I can see our beautiful stadium with fans beating their drums. I saw Sampdoria-Verona behind closed doors and it hurt my soul to see it played in silence. How can you celebrate a result in that desolate landscape? Why bother playing a game without fans, the colours all around, the noise and cheering, this is football, this is entertainment and 90 minutes of pure adrenaline. A game without fans, what even is it?</p>
