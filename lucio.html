  <p><b>[Lucio on his former <a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a> team-mate Marco Materazzi]</b> It’s difficult to talk about <a href="marco-materazzi.html">Materazzi</a>, because I arrived in Italy in 2009 and the last time I saw him play well was in 2006. Perhaps it hurts him that before I arrived he’d never got past the Champions League Round of 16. I always had an excellent rapport with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>. He once said that if he had to go to war, I’d be the first person he’d bring with him. <a href="marco-materazzi.html">Materazzi</a> was a very nasty player - he went in to hurt opponents. I heard him say that. He behaves the same way off the field - as a nasty person</p>

  <p><b>[Lucio on Silvio Gazzaniga’s <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup trophy]</b> It was the most incredible sensation. Becoming a world champion was to realise a childhood dream. To hold that beautiful World Cup, with all its glamour, was the greatest satisfaction and feeling of joy. I will take that moment with me for the rest of my life and, to ensure I never forget, I have a replica at home. I am just so grateful to have had the chance to be a world champion and hold that trophy</p>

  <p><b>[Lucio hands some advice to Brazil’s <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> U-17 World Cup side]</b> Every game is decisive from now on. That’s what makes a World Cup so appealing after all. But I think the team can do it. So, boys: keep working hard with love, passion and commitment and always believe in your dreams</p>
