  <p><b>[Lucio on his former <a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a> team-mate <a href="marco-materazzi.html">Marco Materazzi</a>]</b> It’s difficult to talk about <a href="marco-materazzi.html">Materazzi</a>, because I arrived in Italy in 2009 and the last time I saw him play well was in 2006. Perhaps it hurts him that before I arrived he’d never got past the Champions League Round of 16. I always had an excellent rapport with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>. He once said that if he had to go to war, I’d be the first person he’d bring with him. <a href="marco-materazzi.html">Materazzi</a> was a very nasty player - he went in to hurt opponents. I heard him say that. He behaves the same way off the field - as a nasty person</p>

  <p><b>[Lucio on Silvio Gazzaniga’s <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup trophy]</b> It was the most incredible sensation. Becoming a world champion was to realise a childhood dream. To hold that beautiful World Cup, with all its glamour, was the greatest satisfaction and feeling of joy. I will take that moment with me for the rest of my life and, to ensure I never forget, I have a replica at home. I am just so grateful to have had the chance to be a world champion and hold that trophy</p>

  <p><b>[Lucio - ‘Great opportunity for India to make a mark globally’]</b> I think <b>[hosting the FIFA U-17 World Cup]</b> is a great opportunity for a country like India to make a mark on the global footballing scene. With some of the world’s best young talent set to land on these shores, it’s only bound to help the development of the sport within the country. India could be getting a first-hand look at some of the biggest footballing names in the years to come.<br /><br />It’s important to start developing footballers from a grassroots level and provide them with good facilities to train. Coaching education is important as well. The kids need to have the right guidance in their steps to becoming a professional footballer<br /><br />Experience is all important. To be able to play in a global tournament, against some of the best players in the world of the same age group is a very unique experience. The added pressure of having to perform while wearing the national jersey can add great value to a player’s experience and will stand them in good stead for the future<br /><br />Brazil have a good team and will always been a tough match for any opposition. But there will also most certainly be several other teams who are bound to have some very talented squads. As a proud Brazilian though, I’ll certainly be hoping that they have a long run in the tournament. Football is something that plays a very big part in Brazilian culture. Throughout the years, we’ve had a great numbers of players represent the team who’ve become global icons and they certainly do act as great motivation for the younger players.</p>

  <p><b>[Lucio hands some advice to Brazil’s <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> U-17 World Cup side]</b> Every game is decisive from now on. That’s what makes a World Cup so appealing after all. But I think the team can do it. So, boys: keep working hard with love, passion and commitment and always believe in your dreams</p>
