  <p><b>[USWNT slammed for celebrations in record-breaking World Cup win with 13-0 win over Thailand]</b> They’re the No.1 team in the world and for me, I’m disgusted, honestly. You’re going up against a team that’s first time in the World Cup, they’re just happy to be there. Celebrate, I get it, like a <a href="mallory-pugh.html">Mallory Pugh</a>. But these people counting their goals, this … I’m embarrassed. I was a female professional athlete; there’s kids watching this and to be celebrating when it’s eight, nine, 10. I said in the pre-game, yes, you want to score a lot of goals, yes, you want to make your mark because of the goal difference. But there’s a way to do it, and that is not the way for me</p>

  <p><b>[Morgan celebrated her incredible night by counting off each of her goals on her hand. This did not sit well with former Canada star Kaylyn Kyle, who compared Morgan to an all-time great Canadian striker]</b> We played against the Americans before where you have a player like Christine Sinclair scoring three goals and she would never even think about counting how many goals she has on one hand. For me it’s disrespectful, it’s disgraceful. Hats off to Thailand for holding their heads high.</p>
