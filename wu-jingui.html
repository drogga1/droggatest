  <p><b>[Shanghai Shenhua’s technical director has launched a scathing attack on big-money imports to the Chinese Super League]</b> There is a growing consensus in European football that, if you crave rip-offs, just go to China. Nowadays, agents of foreign coaches broadly tempt their clients into signing a three-year contract with Chinese clubs and, after only one year, they quit and walk away with a compensation package.<br /><br />We are indeed the stupid nouveau riche with money to burn. Few foreign stars here play from the opening day of the season to the final day because most of them are plagued by constant injuries. You could find fault with their blatant disregard for professionalism in everyday training as well as in their private lives. Many come to China to abandon themselves to alcohol and nightclubs. They have been given free rein.<br /><br /><b>[Regardless of his apparent anger at the CSL’s influx of foreign talent, Wu confirmed that Carlos Tevez is on Shenhua’s radar]</b> The coach <b>[Gus Poyet]</b> and club both agree on the need to bring in such a high-level player. We are pulling out all the stops to seal the deal. The market is constantly changing but I believe where there’s a will, there’s a way.</p>

  <p><b>[New Shanghai Shenhua manager Wu Jingui has taken aim at overweight striker Carlos Tevez]</b> I won’t pick him right now. He’s not ready physically. He’s not fit to play. He is overweight, along with <b>[Fredy]</b> Guarin. I have to take responsibility for the team and the players as well. If you are unable do your utmost to play, there’s no point in picking you.</p>

  <p><b>[Carlos Tevez’s Shenhua out to emulate Red Devils after derby humbling]</b> We understand the fans’ frustration and we feel gutted by this result as well. Our sorrow was amplified by the fact that it was a derby. When Man City rejuvenate and dominate, Man United feel awful too. Shenhua are a club with a rich history and we are convinced that the club will rise above the problems, just like Man United.<br /><br />Moreno told me at halftime that he was tired and suffered an injury to his thigh. I can’t take a chance on him. We will play another important game in three days, so he was replaced by Carlos Tevez.</p>

  <p><b>[Demba Ba grabbed at his opponent, while also motioning towards his skin colour to officials and other players. Unconfirmed reports claim Li repeatedly shouted ‘you black’ towards Ba]</b> I learned that a Yatai player used insulting language towards <b>[Ba]</b>. Around the world, it has been stressed that there should be no insulting speech toward black athletes. The Chinese Super League has players of many different skin colours. We should respect our opponents and there should be no discrimination. I cannot calm down now. I feel great regret about the lack of respect to a player.</p>
