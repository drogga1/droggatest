  <p><b>[Sheffield United boss Wilder has lauded Dean Henderson’s impact and is keen for the young shot-stopper to return to Bramall Lane]</b> Dean made it clear to us that he has a very strong interest in coming back to Bramall Lane, and Manchester United are happy to go along with that. He wants his United contract sorted out first of all but, in terms of putting another temporary deal in place, I think we’re in a good place with that one. United are pleased with what happened when he came here, with the way his game developed and the way he progressed over the course of the year</p>

  <p><b>[Sheffield United have secured the return of former Everton defender Phil Jagielka to Bramall Lane on an initial one-year deal, the newly-promoted Premier League outfit have confirmed]</b> I don’t have to sign players for the fans to pat us on the back, we’re signing Phil because he is a really good footballer and a great character to have around in our first season back in the Premier League. He’s got an obvious history with the club which is fantastic but meeting up with him and seeing his desire makes me delighted to see Jags back at home. He’s had a fantastic career, he was deserving of his move when we dropped out of the top-flight last time and he went to a fantastic club and played all those games in the Premier League and captained England. To have Phil in and around our changing room in one of the most important seasons in our recent history is going to be invaluable. He’s come to play, he knows he’s got to earn his place, but I’m buzzing having spent time with him and seen the desire he’s got to succeed at the back end of his career.</p>

  <p><b>[With Ravel Morrison having his sights set on returning to the top of his game, new boss Wilder feels that Bramall Lane is the ideal place for the Englishman]</b> Ravel is an undoubted talent and we are delighted that we have put together a deal that suits all parties. I’ve spoken to a number of people about him and it is clear that he has serious ability. We are getting a fantastic footballer with a tremendous pedigree and this is a great opportunity for Rav, we believe we can help him get back to the level he wants to be. He’s done extremely well during his time with us and it was great to have him in Portugal. It wasn’t about him coming and being on trial because we knew about his abilities. Taking him with us was basically getting to know him and what he’s about, what makes him tick and how he integrates with the players. Trips like what we have been on are invaluable for that</p>

The boy had an outstanding season for us last season and wants to come back. I’ve always respected Manchester United’s position but they’re keen for him to come back, Dean wants to come back and play regular football - which is refreshing for a young player, who wants to prove himself - and I want it to happen as well<br /><br /><b>[There could be more to come after that, with agreements having already been reached with Luke Freeman, Phil Jagielka, Callum Robinson and Ravel Morrison]</b> We’re really close to another addition, so we’re quite excited. I think we’ll break the record a third time and might break it again, which is exciting news as a club. We’re not going to go silly and put the club in a situation that hurts us down the line, though. I want another four to come in, which will give us a nice number to work with.

It is a fantastic bit of business for us in the current market and we are looking forward to him joining up with the squad</p>

He has great pedigree which includes playing internationally and playing in the Premier League. He is an excellent all-around central midfielder. He is someone who can do everything we want a midfielder to do. Mo has played as a defensive midfielder but he can also play further forward. Overall, we feel this window has been a great success</p>

But I will leave that for everyone else to talk about because I have said too much about it<br /><br /><b>[Wilder added that he’s adamant a mistake was made and that the referee should have made the sensible decision to disallow the goal]</b> I’ve been to see the referee and he has been honest about it. We make mistakes and I believe he made one too. It happened that quick and I thought he could have been helped by his colleagues a little bit. We talk about the new rule where if the referee touches ball then he has to blow up, so surely if he is in the way and hinders us then he makes a sensible decision.

They’ve worked unbelievably hard to get into this situation this season, they have worked unbelievably hard to get into <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and they are a really tight group as well. At first, I didn’t want to play the remaining games behind closed doors but my point of view now is that, if that is what it has to be in order to finish the season, then that is what it has to be. There’s no compromise in this. We have to finish the season, however long it takes. The idea of freezing positions as they are now is not for me, even though you look at the table and think it wouldn’t be a bad result for this club from a selfish point of view. Everyone will look at it from a selfish point of view and they have to come out of that. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> season is a race. It is 38 games. No matter how many points somebody is ahead or how many points somebody is behind, it’s sport and anything can happen.

The majority of teams will be the same. From the physical aspect, where you are going to be is going to be the key element. We did have momentum and we were on a great run. Everybody has their own situations, with injuries and form, and sometimes the break comes at the right time. That will be a question for Dean <b>[Smith]</b> as well as me. I’m sure Dean would say it was a great time because he gets players back fit, regroup and kick-start their season. It’s a brilliant club, I have an awful amount of time for Dean and what he’s done.

  <p><b>[The apology did little to appease Blades boss Wilder, however, as he could not understand how all of the cameras could miss the incident and that video technology was not used to rectify the mistake]</b> I think the goalkeeper was in the Holte End when he caught it - or dragged it back. My issue is obviously one of frustration. Seven cameras haven’t picked it up - the most technical league in the world - everything we see at every angle and it hasn’t seen a goal. That is disappointing from our point of view. We went to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> last year, John Lundstram’s big toe was offside and I was hanging around at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">White Hart Lane</a> in the pouring rain for 10 minutes waiting for a decision. I don’t understand why I can’t wait 10 minutes in <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a>. The statement has come out and it is unprecedented, unbelievable. I did have a laugh and joke beforehand that we have had some poor decisions go against us and I said I wouldn’t bet against one going against us this evening. We were waiting for somebody at Stockley Park to show a bit of courage and say they will make that decision but if they’ve not seen it and seven cameras haven’t seen it I suppose he will say that it was not their decision to make. It was a really strange afternoon and evening. Quite difficult as well. We should never underestimate the effect of playing in front of supporters. That was quite difficult for both sets of players. Most times we would be talking about a pretty average game but we are not, we are talking about a decision that has affected the result. We were all going into the unknown today. I thought the tempo would have been a bit quicker. I love coming to this place. We’ve had some great battles. It is a club I have a huge amount of respect for but it is double difficult - you can’t replicate it when there is no-one in the ground</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Wilder: Individual errors hurting Sheffield United]</b> If you look at the goals we have been conceding they are really poor individual mistakes. Up until now we’ve had the platform to produce very good performances because we have been disciplined defensively and not given away soft goal. From our point of view it’s not an issue of the overall structure or amount of effort but games are decided in both boxes<br /><br />We’ve not been clinical enough and certainly, I think seven out of the eight goals we have conceded have been individual errors and in some cases a series of errors. It’s something we have to cut out, the basic errors are really hurting us and it comes down to concentration, discipline and awareness. There’s a couple of boys whose form has dipped from the standards they have set all season and we have to help them through. Cut out the individual errors and I am sure it will be a close game and I am sure we will because we are determined that this season doesn’t just fade away</p>
