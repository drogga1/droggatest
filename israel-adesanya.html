  <p><b>[Israel Adesanya says he’s the new face of UFC, tells <a href="jon-jones.html">Jon Jones</a> to keep his nuts out of his mouth]</b> My confidence? Get my fucking nuts out of your mouth. This guy is trying to force my hand. I’m not stupid. It’s not about me not being confident. I will fuck this motherfucker up when I fight him.<br /><br />I just have to do what I have to do. I have to defend my belt. I just defended my belt and I am the new unified king. I have three or four more killers I have to fuck up at middleweight first. And then I will move up in weight. And then I will jump up and fuck this guy up. I plan everything from the jump. I have shown everyone that this is what I am going to do and how I am going to do it. I already said Raiders Stadium, Las Vegas in 2021.<br /><br />And he is contradicting himself because he says, ‘I think I’m alright here (at light heavyweight) I’m not going to move up to heavyweight. Why do I have to go up? I don’t have to fight ‘DC’ at heavyweight.’ Now ‘DC’ is retiring and now he might move up to heavyweight<br /><br />He’s just contradicting himself and trying to take my moment. You can’t even fuck with me right now, dude. Look at me! Who the fuck is the new face of UFC? Do you think <a href="jon-jones.html">Jon Jones</a> can ever pull some shit like that? I saw him with that bullshit as Nelly entrance when he did the electric slide. You can’t fuck with me on anythings<br /><br /><b>[In Adesanya’s view, Jones simply doesn’t like the fact that there is now a new face of the promotion stealing his - and everyone else’s - shine]</b> He is jealous. He sees the freshman that is fucking taking all the shine. He sees the new dog in the yard. And they are intimidated and jealous and they do not know how to act.<br /><br />He’s a fan and he’s always been a fan. But, he just tries to do what he does and, just wait your turn. I am not going to be one of these guys who doesn’t defend his belt. I am going to defend my belt actively. I am not going to be like him and fight twice a year. Let me defend my belt, then I will move up and fuck him up.</p>
