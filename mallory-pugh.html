  <p><b>[USWNT star Mallory Pugh leaves UCLA to turn pro]</b> This decision was certainly not easy for me to make. UCLA is such a special place, and being a Bruin was an incredible thing. UCLA Soccer brought amazing things to my life, and chasing after a national championship with my friends and teammates would’ve been special, but I could not turn down this opportunity.</p>

  <p><b>[On Carli Lloyd]</b> She’s just Carli - she can do it. I think that just shows her quality. You don’t really see that a lot from players who can play the 10 role so well and then can also play the nine role so well. Credit to her that she’s made the transition perfectly … Just having her as a leader out there and just kind of following is just super inspiring.</p>

  <p><b>[USWNT players thankful as nutrition bar company helps level wage gap]</b> When we first heard, my jaw dropped. To have a company come in and do that for us is really amazing and it addresses all the different stuff that’s been going on, so to have a company supporting us in that way is really cool.</p>
