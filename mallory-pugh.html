  <p><b>[Lavelle’s fellow World Cup newbie Mallory Pugh on her own media social habit]</b> I’m not on social media <b>[at the World Cup]</b>. I’m learning this process so it’s testing what works best for me and for right now, it is to stay off social media and just be solely in this environment.</p>

  <p><b>[Rose Lavelle’s teammate for club and country Mallory Pugh said of Lavelle’s performance in France]</b> I wasn’t surprised honestly. I know that Rose is such a great player and I had a feeling that that was her time. She stepped up and she executed and the rest is history</p>

  <p><b>[Mallory Pugh, <a href="rose-lavelle.html">Rose Lavelle</a>’s teammate with the USWNT and the Washington Spirit, as well as her roommate at home in suburban D.C., saw her close friend’s experience firsthand]</b> I know that Rose has had a tough path to get to where she is now. I live with her at home, so just seeing all the work and just the way she has truly grown into the player she is, it’s inspiring for me and it makes me want to be better</p>
