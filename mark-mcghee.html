  <p><b>[Robert Lewandowski’s brilliant goalscoring form for Bayern Munich does not make Poland a better team]</b> Lewandowski is in form and scoring goals. He has proven to be a fantastic acquisition for Bayern Munich, but in general I don’t think they are that different from a year ago than we are. I don’t know that as a team they have improved. I don’t think they have left us behind in any way. We have total respect for him, a fantastic player - but we have players in form as well, players who scored at the weekend. Lewandowski is the guy they hope will get goals for them so we have to pay him attention. Poland are dangerous, they will feel they can score, but I don’t think we intend to do anything different than we have done until now. We will still be very difficult to beat. If they are going to do better than us they are going to have to do well. We feel we have to match them in every area.</p>
