  <p><b>[Brazilian tactician, Vanderlei Luxemburgo, admitted that the only superstar currently playing in the Campeonato Brasileiro is Sao Paulo midfielder Hernanes]</b> For me there is only one superstar in Brazil: Hernanes. He has everything a footballer needs. He can play with both feet, he marks, he’s dynamic, and he can get past players with ease. He is a player who is good at finishing, and he also helps at the back. I prayed so that Muricy wouldn’t put on another striker. Roque Junior is returning, and we needed his experience. I had to take a risk. I had to take off Mauricio who is 19 years old and I left on Roque, who is 32</p>

  <p><b>[Vanderlei Luxemburgo tells <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a> supporters to forget the <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a> of Barcelona]</b> Forget the player from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or the Brazilian national team. He’s 31 years old, he is no longer a physical force. But he has the talent and we have to take advantage of this. For him, the training sessions aren’t good, playing is the best way for him to find his rhythm</p>

  <p><b>[Flamengo’s Vanderlei Luxemburgo urges <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a> to show his true colours]</b> Taking <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a> off is something normal, I have done the same with other players. The thing is that I need to keep <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a> on the field. He was signed to be the star, the main reference. Taking <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a> off is easy, but he needs to be on the field and feel the fans demanding things from him. I put him on <b>[against Figueirense]</b> because he could decide the match in a set-piece, in an individual play. We need the best <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a>, the player who can make the difference for us</p>

We still have to play the last game, against a rival that is fighting for the title. It is a crucial game and we are still looking for our place <b>[in the Copa]</b></p>

I’ve worked for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and I know that such a special player worries opponents - big opponents. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> don’t have a player now that makes the opponent feel they are dead.

We are talking about the biggest club in the world. If the results aren’t coming, the pressure will always be huge, but <a href="florentino-perez.html">Florentino Perez</a> is a clever and successful man, and I believe that he knew this would be a difficult season for them. It would never be easy to replicate the previous titles. He knew it. So, I believe that he’s calm now, waiting the right time for doing more investments in the squad to make Madrid champion again</p>
