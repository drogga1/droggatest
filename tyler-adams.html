  <p><b>[RB Leipzig midfielder Tyler Adams is in danger of missing the start of the Bundesliga season as he recovers from a lingering groin injury]</b> Our medical department are doing everything they can, but Tyler’s injury is complicated. Suddenly you’re pain-free and expect to get involved again, but it’s misleading</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT star Tyler Adams signs contract extension with RB Leipzig]</b> I’m delighted to have extended my contract with <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> until 2025 and to continue being a part of this fantastic, ambitious club. I’ve developed a lot both as a player and as a person during my time here. The philosophy and play style of the club really suits me and I love everything that the city has to offer. I would like to thank the club and my family for everything they have done to support me so far. I will continue working hard every day to achieve both mine and the club’s goals. We still have a lot ahead of us and I’m looking forward to continue working with the team and the coaching staff to achieve our goals<br /><br />Tyler is a very demanding and intelligent player, who has already shown how versatile he is and what a fantastic mentality he brings to the team. We’re delighted that we could secure his services until 2025, even more so because we know that he’s not at the end of his development yet and certainly has the potential to become a key player for us. He suits us and our philosophy perfectly and we’re looking forward to continuing a successful journey with him.</p>

  <p><b>[Tyler Adams says <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>’s <a href="giovanni-reyna.html">Giovanni Reyna</a> is just as talented as <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a> and makes everything look easy]</b> I think his ease with the ball <b>[makes him special]</b>. He’s a player that personally for me, you have players like Christian, you have players like Weston <b>[McKennie]</b> and then you have players like Gio who make everything look easy. These are the players that you just enjoy playing with because you can give them the ball in tough spots, you know he’s going to make things happen. He just goes about his business, he’s not bothered by anything<br /><br /><b>[Adams, who made his full debut at 18, rubbished that notion, as he believes age should be no impediment to playing for your country]</b> It is crazy to me <b>[that people question <a href="giovanni-reyna.html">Reyna</a> joining the national team]</b>, because in my eyes, it’s not based off of age, it can’t be based off of age, it’s based off of getting your best players into the pool as quickly as possible, getting them experience. It’s only going to make him better, it’s only going to give him more experiences playing at that kind of level. The kid is making it look seamless receiving the ball in tight spaces against <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, I’m sure he’s going to be able to receive a ball from one of our players against a top national team.</p>

  <p><b>[Tyler Adams says he’s prepared to play any position that <a href="gregg-berhalter.html">Gregg Berhalter</a> asks him to with the U.S. men’s national team]</b> A lot of people brought that <b>[statement]</b> to my attention. But anywhere he puts me, I’m ready to go<br /><br />Playing a lot of games at a young age definitely prepared me the jump to the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. When I came here, my ability to be on the ball and make plays only escalated, because I was having so much of the ball. I had to think plays ahead, and see the game quicker. As I grow, it’s getting easier<br /><br /><b>[RB Leipzig have only been in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> since 2016]</b> I think this was the year we showed everybody we’re title contenders. Looking forward, we’re only going to get better with experience. He added: I’ve been good since <b>[December]</b>, and I’m happy about it. We had a new coach, and I wanted to prove I was capable of being a key player in how he wants to play.</p>

  <p><b>[Tyler Adams says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> target Werner can play for ‘the biggest clubs in the world’]</b> It’s hard to say one thing. People are often focused not just on his goalscoring ability but how fast he is, he’s absolutely rapid. That’s not one of the qualities that sticks out the most. The quality that sticks out the most is how many ways he’s able to score. He can score from the left, the right, centrally, we played him as a number ten and he was running out of the midfield and scoring goals. There’s just so many roles you can fit him in, that’s what makes him such a unique piece. If you’re able to score in that many different ways, you’ll be able to play at the highest level for a really long time, for the biggest clubs in the world, for the national team. He’s a pleasure to play with. It makes it easy playing as a midfielder knowing you can play the ball over the top and he’ll catch it no matter what. He’s a great guy and a great player</p>

  <p><b>[Tyler Adams says If the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> season got back underway tomorrow, <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> would be ready]</b> It’s just a little bit of a peculiar situation that we’re in. A lot of people are talking about how there are no sports and how there’s not a lot going on, but we have to value people’s lives, first and foremost. For us, we were able to <b>[return to training]</b> with a smile on our faces, and being able to see a couple of my team-mates at a time has been a good feeling. We’re still able to participate in passing sequences, a little bit of running to keep our fitness up but most importantly, it’s a great feeling to have a ball back at our feet and be able to pass and smile again out on the pitch<br /><br />If the game started tomorrow, for instance, I think that we would be ready to play; our team had such a strong mentality and the form doesn’t really matter. We know that once we get back out on the pitch we’re going to take care of business. We’re fortunate enough to have a very deep squad this year; the depth has been able to contribute to a lot of our success, so if we have to cram games in short weeks, I think that our team is perfect for that scenario. You know playing at certain venues can be difficult. I am not saying it won’t be difficult anymore, but it will have a more neutral flavour, so for us, it will be about doing our homework and focus on our tactics. We are going to look at this in a positive way</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT midfielder Tyler Adams: It’s all or nothing going forward]</b> I really have to prepare myself that the next time I put on the U.S. jersey, it’s all or nothing, there’s no more preparation matches. It’s either you go out there and win or we’re not going to another World Cup. It’s unbelievably odd. For me it’s even more odd because I haven’t played with the national team in a year<br /><br /><b>[CONCACAF president <a href="victor-montagliani.html">Victor Montagliani</a> said in April that the format for the federation’s World Cup qualifiers may have to change due to the pandemic]</b> I think for a lot of guys it’s going to be different because you might see guys get called into a <b>[World Cup]</b> qualifier that I’ve never been into camp <b>[with]</b> before but you have to find a way to get your best players on the field, so it’ll be interesting</p>
