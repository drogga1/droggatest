<blockquote>
  <p><b>[How Luka Modric went from rejected youth player to the best midfielder in the world]</b> We met as kids in the Zadar youth team, we were together briefly at Hajduk and always in the Croatian youth teams. I was rated as a bigger talent at the time, but that is football… some bigger talents than Luka and I failed to make a career.<br /><br />As we were finishing elementary school, we played some games for Zadar and beat Hajduk. That is when the Hajduk people invited me to come. Luka came to Hajduk about half a year later and only spent 15 days there<br /><br />I can’t say he failed at Hajduk… you can’t see all of a boy’s qualities in such a short period. But the fact is he returned to Zadar and a few years later he went to Dinamo. That is where he became a player.<br /><br />As a kid, he was a normal boy and did nothing to stand out off the pitch. But he was only interested in football. I don’t believe people who claim they knew Luka would become top class after seeing him play as a kid. Nonsense! Only after he become Dinamo’s leader was it clear he would become a top player</p>
