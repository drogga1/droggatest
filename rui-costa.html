  <p><b>[Rui Costa says <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> gives his all for Portugal]</b> No-one will want to make the difference in Tuesday’s game more than <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. To be criticised by other teams is a sign of his importance. What cannot happen is him being criticised by our fans and our country. He is one of the best players in the world, he is the captain of the team and we have to be proud to have him with us. We cannot think he will have to decide the match alone, but that he will do everything to make Portugal qualify for the Euro 2012 finals</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> director Rui Costa says We fear no one, we have a chance of beating <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are a great team, with great players, but <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> are also a great team and we fear no one. It will be a very close tie, but <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> have a chance.<br /><br />We are amongst the eight best teams in Europe, with all merit. We could not wish to get an easy team, because there were none. We have to play both at home and on the road, and the fact that you play at home is getting less and less important, though it is always good to play on your stadium. It does not scare us that we play at the Estadio da Luz first and then at Stamford Bridge<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on his preferred opponent for the semi-finals between <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>]</b> Our immediate concern is not who wins the tie between <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. We have to beat <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and to be focused only on this tie and then think about what comes next, if we go through</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United, Juventus and Liverpool have been offered hope in the pursuit of Joao Felix]</b> Someone called him my heir. Or the new Kaka. The truth is that Felix is only Felix. He has an extraordinary sense of play and he has a rare ability, he can guess what will happen in front of the goal. He is a modern number 10, a second striker with a remarkable sense of goal, he scored 10 goals in the league. €120m release clause? We will try to keep him as long as possible, this applies to Felix as it does to all the others. This is the club’s policy, then we will see why we are aware that the clauses exist and that certain players cannot be held back indefinitely in Portugal<br /><br /><b>[On Ruben Dias]</b> If he will go away I don’t know. We would like to keep him still and Ruben knows that here he would have a lot of attention. The club needs to sell to make cash. We will see how the summer market will develop</p>
