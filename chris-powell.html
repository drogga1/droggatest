<blockquote>
  <p>[Charlton Athletic legend Chris Powell thinks that Chelsea are not damaging the English game and points to Tammy Abraham as an example of a player who seems ready to play at the top level next season] It’s brilliant for individuals to be on loan. The loans that a player like Tammy Abraham has had have helped him develop. He has been to Bristol City and he played in the Premier League with Swansea City, then back to Aston Villa to score 20 goals. He’s a player that now understands the rigours of playing week in, week out. Similar to [Mason] Mount who has gone back to Chelsea, similar with Harry Wilson at Liverpool - all of these players have had a good experience, what is not to like about that? You will see a lot of Championship players being loanees from the Premier League, clubs know that this is a good level of football. It is a very competitive environment. It develops you as a player and a person<br /><br />[And Powell picked out one of Frank Lampard’s protégés from last season, Jayden Bogle, as one to watch this season] Players such as Bogle, the right-back at Derby who had such an exceptional first season, you hope that a player like him can carry on and kick on. I hope he shows everyone it wasn’t just for one season under Lampard’s tutelage. It is about creating a career for himself. There was talk about Premier League clubs moving for him, but he has stayed so far at Derby. I hope he can progress because you want them to have careers and play initially for their local side. He has been with them for a long time and hopefully they can move forward.<br /><br />Jack Clarke has gone back on loan to Leeds from signing for Spurs. Hopefully he can have a big say on how Leeds perform next year. There’s a couple of young players at West Brom who have played a few games. Let’s hope that carries on under Slaven Bilic. There’s no secret that Spurs have looked at Sessegnon, but you think it should have been done by now. There’s no stopping either team from making it happen. If it does happen, I can’t see why he doesn’t keep playing regular football. He made a big impression in the Championship and found it a bit tougher in the Premier League but that’s to be expected of a young player who never played at that level. If he does stay, I am sure he will show everyone what a good player he is again. If it doesn’t happen with Fulham, if they don’t go up and get to where they need to go, then if he is still there then he will move on</p>
