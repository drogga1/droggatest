  <p>UNLESS YOU’RE WILLING TO PICK UP A WEAPON &amp; DEFEND YOUR COUNTRY, I SUGGEST YOU STOP CRITICIZING THOSE WHO DO<br /><br />They are very old now, lurking behind the scenes, but are actually the masterminds. They are working with some foreign-educated and far-left academics to plant wrong ideas into the minds of students. The old <b>[communist]</b> members who became politicians and academics still have their implanted communist chips.<br /><br />Now, there is unrest in Hong Kong. A visit <b>[by Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit]</b> can be viewed as giving encouragement and support. <b>[Focusing on Thailand’s university students, Apirat said]</b> Hong Kong protesters are mostly youths. I ask, ‘If one day you feel disappointed and someone brainwashed you to take the streets, would you come out?’</p>
