  <p><b>[Besiktas goalkeeper Rustu Recber has warned <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> to expect a hostile reception like they have never seen before when they arrive in Istanbul to kick off their Champions League campaign]</b> The level of hostility at the Inonu is unique. United have been to <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a> and Fenerbahce, but the Besiktas fans are in a league of their own. They are the noisiest, the most passionate, and they stay with the team for 90 minutes. The noise is incredible. It will be a new experience even for those United players who think they have seen everything. Our fans can really make it hell<br /><br /><b>[Now nearing the end of his career at 36 years of age, Rustu says his biggest regret was not joining United after Ferguson showed interest following the tournament in Korea and Japan]</b> There was an opportunity to go to England. My agent spoke to Sir Alex and he wanted me as his goalkeeper. In the end I allowed my heart to rule my head and I joined <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. But my experience there was a bitter one and looking back I should have gone to England</p>

  <p><b>[Rustu Recber Confident Besiktas Will Turn Things Around]</b> We have played well in all our games, but haven’t been able to convert that form into results. There is something called luck in football - and I don’t think luck was on our side during those weeks. The longer we went without scoring, the more the pressure grew and it hurt our forwards’ confidence. Nevertheless, we have a quality squad and a very experienced coach. Everything can change. We will never lose our belief that we can win the championship. We are a very big team. We won’t give up until it’s mathematically impossible. We will give everything to defend our title. We plan to get through to the next round, but we haven’t managed a win yet, so our aim is to win the rest of our games. Then, if we can’t make it, our objective will be to play in the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Europa League</p>

  <p><b>[Former Besiktas goalkeeper Rustu Recber has slammed his ex-club and Fenerbahce for rescinding the deals of Ricardo Quaresma and Alex, respectively]</b> Both sides <b>[Fenerbahce and Alex]</b> have made mistakes. Alex had been a very helpful player for Fenerbahce. He should’ve seen the end of this season in Turkey. The timing was completely wrong. Aziz Yildirim’s decision to terminate his contract has come out of anger and it was also wrong. If he <b>[Quaresma]</b> had played throughout the season, maybe Besiktas could be leaders now. I don’t understand why he was sacrificed so suddenly. This is also a marketing mistake. They made him lost his value. His <b>[Kocaman’s]</b> additions were a hit-and-miss. <a href="dirk-kuyt.html">Dirk Kuyt</a>, Mehmet Topal, Raul Meireles and Milos Krasic have all been insufficient for the team. That’s a mistake on the one who made those transfers</p>

Besides none of the German goalkeepers have been successful in Spain. I met with Valdes when he was very young. At the time he seemed a bit crazy but he has matured into a very good and experienced goalkeeper. I would advise him to continue at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>.
