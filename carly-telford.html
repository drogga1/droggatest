  <p><b>[Carly Telford called <a href="steph-houghton.html">Steph Houghton</a> ‘one of the greatest English players of all time’ after England’s Women’s World Cup semi-final defeat to the United States]</b> The fact that she picked up the ball and took <b>[the penalty]</b> is inspiring in itself. To do that in such a big moment, as a captain, as a leader … For me, she’s one of the greatest English players of all time. She’ll go down for that. Missing a penalty, so what? It’s a big stage, it’s a big moment. 50-50 they go in, they get saved. That’s just how it is. Yes, not to say if she scores that we go on to win it or we go on to lose it. It doesn’t mean anything. For me, it’s just brave enough that she took the penalty in the first place. I’m proud of her.<br /><br />For me, the older ones, we’re probably looking at it like maybe that was our last chance to get to a World Cup final. You can see that potentially we know this is our last World Cup for a lot of us. If my body holds together then I might make the next one, but I doubt it. We know, that’s probably the devastating thing. We know how close we were and how close we are to being number one and lifting a trophy eventually. But we’ve come up short again. I think that’s the hard thing. Everything just felt so right for us again but we’ve come up short. But we’re handing over a baton to an amazing group of youngsters that have done it before and can go into major tournaments with their heads held high<br /><br />Once there was a time when we couldn’t get close to the Americans. There’s a lot of respect when they’re having to play defensive against us and blocking out into a five or a four. So we got massive respect from them but at the same time, we didn’t win, it’s not good enough. We came into this tournament saying we wanted to win it and that’s why we’re all devastated. We’re very, very close to the USA. We know that. But look, it’s fine margins when it comes to tournament football and they punished us where they could</p>

  <p><b>[Carly Telford says England are still not over their semi-final defeat at this summer’s Women’s World Cup]</b> I think it will take a long time for a lot of us, especially the older ones that might not get another chance to go to one. We know how close we were, how close it was, the opportunity we had and it was just a really bitter pill to swallow. I don’t even know how to start to get over that and I think the only way to do it is switching onto the next thing. I think we probably lingered a bit over that World Cup at <b>[the]</b> last camp, whereas now we’ve kind of parked that bus where we can just focus on the new cycle<br /><br /><b>[Telford has noticed differences already between starting that international break and the current one]</b> I’d say even just looking at everyone on Monday when we met up, everyone looked fresher, everyone seems a lot more lively. We can make excuses, it was a bit of a World Cup hangover, I think we have not a great track record after major tournaments. But I think the difference is everyone is a few weeks into their seasons. The hardest thing people don’t realise is the mental shift you have to have after a major tournament. You put three years of effort into six weeks and the mental overload of we’re going to win, we’re going to win, and okay, you fall at the first hurdle, you’re out in the semis, okay we’re going to get bronze, and then you come out with nothing. I think you don’t realise how much that hits you<br /><br /><b>[Now, with first choice ‘keeper <a href="karen-bardsley.html">Karen Bardsley</a> out injured, the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> shot-stopper has a real chance to impress ahead of the Olympics and she is ready to take it]</b> When you finally get to play in a major tournament, that’s the first time you really get to experience the feeling that you want to feel, if that makes sense. You turn around and look up into the crowd and you see everything. This is it, this is the feeling, this is the moment you’ve been waiting for. It’s like 12, 15 years of fighting, and I’m like, ‘I don’t want to give this up’. I do not want to give someone else a go<br /><br /><b>[<a href="mary-earps.html">Mary Earps</a> is in fine form for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, Ellie Roebuck promises to be an England regular for years to come and Sandy MacIver, currently in college in the United States, has also had call-ups recently]</b> Mary, Ellie and Sandy are fantastic goalkeepers and doing so well and are so hungry too. It’s so nice to see. <b>[They’re]</b> pushing us on to be better. We’ve got someone like Ell who you can put in goal at 20 years old and feel very comfortable. When you see her on the team sheet no one is going, ‘oh no, fucking hell’. It’s Ells. She plays for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, Champions League. Mary, who has had a great couple of games for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>, you know she’s capable for England. KB, me, Sandy. Ultimately, we want to be the best goalkeeping unit in the world and anyone of us could play at any time. I think you can see that</p>
