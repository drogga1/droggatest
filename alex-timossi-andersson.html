  <p><b>[Alex Timossi Andersson is hopeful he can make a positive impression on his <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> trial]</b> Of course, it’s great to go to a team that I’ve dreamed about since I were little. I may not be as nervous as last time <b>[at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>]</b>. Now I have a little known of what it’s like to be in a big club again. Then one is a little easier. I’ll do as well as I can, then we will see</p>

It was nice because it released the nervousness. <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> was there, and I’m glad I scored the goal in front of him. United were very pleased, so we will see what happens. For me it’s a great lesson. I now know more about how it works in England and what is required at that level</p>
