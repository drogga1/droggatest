  <p><b>[Junior Firpo is flattered to be linked to Barcelona but is keeping his focus on Real Betis]</b> I’m not unsettled. That news is coming out and the truth is that it is a compliment and a source of pride to be linked to important clubs such as Barcelona. But I am focused on Betis because it is my club and I also have huge gratitude because they have given me everything. I think it’s a sign that I’m doing things right. I think I’m in a great club and in a great team and that has helped me a lot. Last season we had an inconsistent campaign but we had great victories in the league, we were close to reaching the Copa del Rey final and we played in European competition. It went well for me and therefore that has helped me. But I insist, I am focused on Betis because that is precisely what has made me get here<br /><br /><b>[Junior, though, accepts a move to Barca could allow him to develop further]</b> For me, Jordi Alba is the best left-back in the world, a great player capable of defending and also attacking dangerously. If one day I play with him, apart from competing with him, I’m sure I could learn a lot by his side. What I cannot deny is that it is an honour and a source of pride to be associated with Barcelona, ​​which is a great club and has a great team. I am now at the top in Betis and what has to happen will happen<br /><br /><b>[Junior caught the eye during a goalscoring performance in Betis’ win against the Blaugrana last season at Camp Nou]</b> The truth is I had a great game, I scored one goal and made another and we won. The team played a great game and, regardless of who you support, for the spectator that Barca-Betis game was a show for how the two teams played and and for the offensive play that was seen. Surely people had a lot of fun</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona have completed the €18 million signing of Real Betis defender Junior Firpo]</b> One of the young talents that shone during the past year in La Liga, Junior is a concern for rival defences. His electricity and his tireless running allow him to recover quickly the defensive position. In addition, Junior Firpo dominates in possession - a fundamental aspect of the Barca game</p>

  <p><b>[Old Messi tweets come back to haunt new Barcelona recruit Junior Firpo. Since signing from Real Betis for €18 million, Firpo, now 23, regularly crosses paths with Messi and stressed there’s no bad blood between them]</b> I see him every day in the changing room. I know you’re asking this because of the old tweets I made but that’s in the past and we’ve squashed that. It isn’t something I want to make a bigger deal out of. I don’t think he even knew. I was a kid who came through the academy at Betis and I don’t think Messi is going to care about that<br /><br /><b>[The left-back has declared that the old tweets were done without proper foresight and happily apologised]</b> It’s something that doesn’t matter and that I can explain without problem. They are things that are done at 15 when nobody knows you and when you cannot think that this will have an impact years later. I have to apologise and I do it humbly and without problems</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona have apologised following backlash to a tweet involving Junior Firpo sent after their 5-2 win over <a href="real-betis.html">Real Betis</a> at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> on Sunday]</b> <a href="barcelona-fc.html">FC Barcelona</a> wish to sincerely apologise for any offence caused to <a href="real-betis.html">Real Betis</a> and their supporters regarding a tweet sent out on Sunday evening.

  <p><b>[Junior Firpo has admitted that his first season at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> has not been easy]</b> This season has not been easy for me, I had a small injury when I was in my best form too. I always want to be positive, I come to a new club and a new city with great players, I am in the adaptation period. I really want to go back to training and play. I want to show I am the player that I really am and for the reason why I signed, which has not yet been shown<br /><br /><b>[Setien spent two years in charge at <a href="real-betis.html">Betis</a> before taking the top job at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, and played a vital role in Firpo’s early career development]</b> My relationship with him is good, he was the first elite coach who trusted me.
