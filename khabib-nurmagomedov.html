Well accustomed to the Dagestani culture and patriarchy even at his young age, the boy knew better than to question his father’s wishes. Khabib tucked his chin and dove for the bear’s front paw</dd>

  <dd>On a Monday afternoon in Almaty, Kazakhstan, thousands gathered outside the upmarket Royal Tulip hotel in below freezing temperatures. Teenagers and young men dressed in sweatpants, hoodies, and other forms of casual attire – were there for an entirely different purpose: a glimpse of Khabib Nurmagomedov, the UFC’s first Muslim star. Under the bright lights of the ten full-sized chandeliers illuminating the room, Khabib Nurmagomedov took his seat alongside his cousin Abubakar Nurmagomedov, and fellow UFC fighters Zubaira Tukhugov and Islam Makhachev. Khabib Nurmagomedov spoke about his dominant performance against Michael Johnson at UFC 205, his imminent goal to become the first Russian UFC champion, and a potential showdown with UFC superstar Conor <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a>. Despite being a Russian citizen of Dagestani heritage, Kazakhstan’s largest city was overrun with Khabib Nurmagomedov fans - a reminder that his popularity has been without borders. His religion provided common ground with the Kazakhs, 70% of whom practice Islam</dd>

  <p><b>[Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov has always stressed the importance of education, which he has always prioritized over success in sport]</b> Your brain needs training just as much as your body. If any of you want to do sport, within your abilities, you shouldn’t forget about school, or about following recommendations from your doctors and parents<br /><br /><b>[Who originally brought up this idea (child clinic charity event) with you?]</b> The idea came from Eagles MMA team PR manager Arslan Dotsiev, who was in contact with the ‘Happy Charity Group’. They originally came to the Eagles MMA team presentation, we’ve known each other since then. We’ll keep working together from now on<br /><br /><b>[Is it especially important to you to take part in charity events during the Muslim month of Ramadan?]</b> To be honest, I didn’t pick the month, I just had this opportunity because I’m in Moscow now. If I were away now, it would have been hard for me to come here. But I promised to do it half a year ago. So I had to keep my word. But it’s Ramadan and all the good deeds are twice as important <b>[for Muslims]</b>. So it’s twice as pleasant for me to be able to do this during Ramadan<br /><br /><b>[Do you have any certainty about your UFC comeback?]</b> I’m going through rehabilitation, as I said. I can’t give you a certain date. But it’s going to be this fall. I’ll take this summer to rehabilitate. In the fall, I’ll start my preparation and at the end of the fall I want to have a fight<br /><br /><b>[Do you know if UFC will give you another chance to fight for the belt?]</b> Yes, I know. We’ll repeat the same fight again <b>[with Ferguson for interim lightweight belt]</b>. I have no interest in any other fight. I have to finish my business with Tony Ferguson</p>

  <p><b>[There is a lot of concern around Khabib Nurmagomedov’s ability to make that weight before fighting Edson Barboza]</b> Everybody is about weigh-in. I’m excited, too. All the time, everybody is excited about the fights. Now, everybody is excited about the fights and the weigh-in. It will be interesting<br /><br /><b>[Khabib Nurmagomedov was hospitalized on the day of the weigh-ins with severe abdominal pain, which turned out to be coming from his liver]</b> To be honest, I don’t remember this time. I don’t remember what happened. They brought me to the hospital and I only remember feeling something so bad. I almost died<br /><br /><b>[Khabib Nurmagomedov vs Tony Ferguson]</b> This fight is very important because people are talking about how I cannot make weight. The last time, this was my fault. That’s why people are waiting – to see if I can make weight and stay busy. Now, my weight is good. Three weeks out, I will lose 3 or 4 pounds. Two weeks, another 4 pounds. The last week, I’m going to cut, like, 13 pounds. I have never been this light. The last week will be 13 to 15 pounds<br /><br /><b>[Tony Ferguson’s eyes are now on <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a>, but Nurmagomedov doesn’t believe the Irish star is rushing back for that fight]</b> Conor made $100 million <b>[to fight <a href="floyd-mayweather.html">Floyd Mayweather</a> in August]</b>? Why would he come back for $10-15 million? I think Conor needs big motivation to fight because he has money. He’s already a two-division champ.<br /><br />In the lightweight division, the most important fight is me and Tony. I have to fight with Tony. This weight division is a little bit weird right now, but I’m going to change this at the end of the year. In March or April, I’m going to fight Tony for the title<br /><br /><b>[Khabib Nurmagomedov vs Tony Ferguson]</b> I think the UFC does want that fight because we can make a lot of money in pay-per-view. Of course, Russian people cannot pay $100 for a pay-per-view, but maybe the UFC can make it in Russia for $10. It’s a very big sport in Russia. If UFC makes this pay-per-view, 10 million people in Russia will buy it. The UFC has to make business in Russia. Maybe they are waiting for me to take the belt and have me fight <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> in Moscow.<br /><br />It’s a very big fight, but I came here to take the belt and make history. You can’t make history only with money. I want to win this fight and stay busy. This is my crazy dream. Others will fight so many times in a year. I can do this, too. I have to stay healthy. This is a perfect moment for me</p>

It’s OK. He prayed for me, with me all the time with my heart. We talk with him everyday about my weight, my plan, my everything.

This is my style, you know. This is what I do all my life<br /><br />Because all my life I train hard. This is why injuries are coming. But now, in the last couple of years, I changed a lot of things. It’s working too. Now I train a little bit smarter. I take care of myself. I’m tired of injuries and surgeries, rehab, then comeback and talk about this.<br /><br />…I feel great. I want to show I’m very excited about this comeback…I want to compete in one year maybe three or four times. This is my plan for next year. Now I’m healthy, now I feel good…I want to stay busy.</p>

I think that a few more years of fighting will be my limit. I do not want to fight all my life. A lot of young, hungry guys are coming and I know to be undefeated and undisputed is impossible. One day, you are going to lose and one day you need to stop, you just have to know when.<br /><br />I am going to compete in the coming years. I am 31-years-old, which is not too old for the sport, but I will reach my limit by the age of 33 or 34. Right now, I have a couple more years to compete with the toughest challengers in the world. Whatever opponent they give me, I am going to fight and improve my legacy and self.

  <p><b>[Khabib brags about smashing Conor McGregor]</b> In the last couple of years, I’ve gone out there and won, and it doesn’t bring me any real joy to be honest, well, with the exception of one fight, let’s say. In that fight, I beat that guy with pleasure, I’ll tell you<br /><br />I had fights in my career where I understood that I could hurt my opponent more, but I’d talk to him, tell him to give up so that I don’t beat him too hard. For example, if I had a painful hold where I could break something, I wouldn’t tighten it all the way. I’d just fix it so that the opponent would tap out because I have no aim to hurt anyone in this sport. Yes, we compete in a very brutal contact sport, but it’s never my goal to inflict a lot of pain on my opponent. If I understand that I’m winning, I don’t aim to hurt someone bad. Well, except for one fight</p>
