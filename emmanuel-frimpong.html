  <p><b>[Former Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong has accused Samir Nasri of being a bully]</b> After the game, everybody came into the changing room and Arsene <b>[<a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>]</b> was quiet, you know. He didn’t talk, and then Nasri basically stood up in front of everybody and said we lost the game because of me. Ok, I can understand that, but I was thinking, ‘Why would somebody - especially me playing, I think that was like my second game - why would any professional do that to a young player in that kind of moment?’<br /><br /><b>[When Nasri later moved to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, Frimpong breathed a sigh of relief and even took to Twitter to question <a href="jack-wilshere.html">Jack Wilshere</a>’s good luck message. Not long after the social media swipe, <a href="alex-song.html">Alex Song</a> would hand Frimpong his phone while at Arsenal’s training ground, with an angry Nasri awaiting him on the other end]</b> I took the phone and then it was Nasri on the phone threatening me. I told him, ‘I’m not one of the players that’s afraid of you. If you want us to sort it out as men, we can sort it out as men’. To be honest, at that time when he left Arsenal, I could tell him what I actually thought about him because he was there so I could basically let him know my feelings. So I just told him that I don’t like him, I don’t respect him and I will never respect him as a professional player. You can ask Aaron Ramsey, you can ask <a href="jack-wilshere.html">Jack Wilshere</a>. I never disrespected anybody. But for me, the truth is I’ve never liked Nasri and I will never, ever like this guy. Even if he gives me five billion dollars, I will still not like him<br /><br /><b>[Frimpong and Nasri would have one final run in when Arsenal and City squared off in early 2012 with the Frenchman cementing his bad reputation to his former team-mate]</b> During the game, he told me he could buy me. That’s how stupid this guy is. He probably could then because he had millions, but that’s no respect. That’s what happened. I feel like he was a bully, I feel like he didn’t know his responsibilities as a senior player to be able to help younger players</p>

I watched the game against <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> and it wasn’t good. Our defence is certainly weaker, when you compare it to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>. <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> has been making some mistakes, and in my opinion, there’s little difference between Luiz and Mustafi; I would rather see Callum Chambers selected.

They have to improve the defence to challenge</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong says the club were dealt a huge blow when <a href="robin-van-persie.html">Robin van Persie</a> left to join <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> I think the problem for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> has always been how do they keep hold of their best players? It’s a problem with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I hope that trend has finished with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, because when Robin left, he was probably the best player in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at that time, and it took a lot of quality out of the team and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> suffered again. That was the problem with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> at that time; that we kept losing our best players and it was disappointing.<br /><br />When Robin was at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> that year, he was fantastic - he was the captain, he was the top goalscorer, he was the best player in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. And for him to go to <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> was quite disappointing. The club knew better, and I don’t know what goes on behind closed doors, but I think there was a bit of a problem. I listened to an interview with Robin a couple of weeks ago, and he spoke about the situation at the time, you just have to respect the man in his decision. Sometimes these things work like that. You just have to wish him well because he served <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> very well when he was there<br /><br /><b>[A year before Van Persie’s move, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> saw another star player leave as <a href="cesc-fabregas.html">Cesc Fabregas</a> joined <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> I think I was more disappointed when Robin went to <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> because at that time he was the captain and he was the best player in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. And losing Robin was much more of a blow than losing Cesc because Robin was bringing goals to the game, he was winning us games. He was playing really well for us at the time so I feel like he was a big blow at the time, and more than when Cesc left. These things happen in football, and you can’t control it. It’s something that is difficult for the club when you have players who are on less than a year’s contract, they want to leave and you want to make money; it makes sense<br /><br /><b>[However, the 27-year-old doubts that <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>’s team would have been able to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title had they held on to Van Persie]</b> To be honest, and as an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fan, I don’t think so, because the players we had at the time were not good enough to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> had the squad; they had the players. You can’t win the league on <a href="robin-van-persie.html">Robin van Persie</a> alone. They had <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a>, <b>[Wayne]</b> <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> was there at the time, and they had quality players to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Even as an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fan, we didn’t have that quality. We had good players, but they had great players, and even if Robin had stayed I don’t think we could have won the Premier League</p>
