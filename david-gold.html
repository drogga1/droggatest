  <p><b>[Hammers co-owner David Gold say he wished he had done things differently]</b> This is undoubtedly the worst moment in all the years I’ve been supporting <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>. I honestly believed with the players we brought in in January and the imminent return of <b>[Thomas]</b> <a href="thomas-hitzlsperger.html">Hitzlsperger</a>, we had done enough to pull clear of danger. I know that Scotty Parker shared that belief with me and we both had confidence that we would retain our Premiership status</p>

  <p><b>[Gold apologises to <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> fans after transfer anti-climax]</b> Sorry for keeping you up late but at the last moment the main deal collapsed and the rest folded like a pack of cards. Stay strong. I’d like to thank <b>[co-chairman]</b> <a href="david-sullivan.html">David Sullivan</a> and Sam for their efforts to secure new players during this window. However, no matter how hard you tried, there are people out their that you just can’t do business with</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham ended up having to let Dimitri Payet go for half of his £50 million valuation]</b> He’s worth between £40-50m. In the open market he’d have fetched at least £35m.<br /><br /><b>[West Ham were able to bring in Jose Fonte and Robert Snodgrass]</b> It is stronger in the sense that the morale is great now. There was a period of time, a couple of months ago, where morale was reducing. We had to make that decision, we didn’t want him to leave and were desperate to keep him. The manager wanted to build the team around Dimitri but, sadly, sometimes it becomes impossible. You do everything you can and then you suddenly realise ‘this isn’t going to work’ and you bite the bullet. He’s let the fans down, he’s let the football club down and I’m hugely disappointed</p>

  <p><b>[Premier League club owners have called for the UK government to make exemptions for football players when it comes to dealing with immigration after leaving the European Union]</b> The Premier League is the greatest league the world has ever known. It’s a fantastic advert for Britain, for England. I know people talk about the wealth that’s there, but these players are on huge salaries and all the tax is going into the exchequer. Why would you stifle that? Why would you want that to change? It’s a great advert. The Premier League goes around the world and it’s ever expanding. I don’t see a government doing something potty to disturb that. I don’t know about free movement but the structure would be that the best players would receive work permits. It’s already affecting us because players are more expensive to buy because of the <b>[drop in value of the]</b> pound.</p>

  <p><b>[On Arsenal Fan Base]</b> I don’t really think Arsene Wenger is under serious pressure for his job. The man has been there 20 years and everybody knows how he works and I think if he wants to stay that will be that. He will stay. The Arsenal fans are a bit like Manchester United’s - they believe they have a right to trophies. They expect to win everything so this is very difficult for them.<br /><br />I think Arsene Wenger will be ok. He will weather the storm and I don’t accept there is some sort of dressing room revolt going on. He has been there long enough to know how to sort that out<br /><br /><b>[On Sam Allardyce capable of staving off the spectre of relegation]</b> It doesn’t surprise me. He’s done it time and again. He’s a hugely experienced manager but it’s not all about him. The chairman and new owner have given him a lot of money and they have bought some high quality players. And let’s be honest, it wasn’t rocket science to appoint him because this is the sort of thing that Sam has been doing at most clubs he’s managed. The England thing was an absolute tragedy for the man - it was the one job above all others that he really wanted - but he’s something of a survivor and has now come back and is doing what he’s good at<br /><br />The win over Arsenal was extraordinary and really surprised me because they had beaten us 3-0 and played very well so to get turned over like that by Palace was an incredible result. Palace really punished them</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> chairman rules out <a href="jack-wilshere.html">Wilshere</a> move]</b> We are interested in all good players but we have to face the facts here - we have got good midfielders. We have got a good defence, we have got good midfielders, we have got good wingers. We need strikers and that is the key to everything for this season so we are focused first and foremost on bringing in two strikers<br /><br />It’s clear to most fans that we are desperate for centre-forwards. <a href="andy-carroll.html">Andy Carroll</a> is injury-prone as we know, we have had an injury problem with <b>[Diafra]</b> Sakho and we have just got to bring in centre-forwards. We have got to find the money. Without strikers, you struggle in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. You struggle in any division because strikers are your key players. You have to spend your money wisely but it must be on strikers, particularly strikers that have had experience with <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> football - the very best we can afford.<br /><br />We have tried the route of going overseas to bring in players - that hasn’t worked. We had a very difficult season because players we brought in from Europe didn’t make the grade and we paid the price. We struggled.<br /><br />We were actually flirting for some time with relegation because we couldn’t score goals. That is why we have got to bring in players with <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> experience and that is what we are working on now. <b>[Co-chairman]</b> <a href="david-sullivan.html">David Sullivan</a> is working day and night in an effort to solve this problem</p>

  <p><b>[Bilic paying the price for West Ham’s ineptitude]</b> Our target is to recruit a manager that will build a team capable of saying a fitting farewell to the Boleyn Ground next year and do justice to the outstanding surrounds we will call home from August 2016.</p>

  <p><b>[David Moyes has left his role as West Ham United manager after keeping the club in the Premier League]</b> I’ve enjoyed David Moyes, I’ve enjoyed his company, I’ve enjoyed working with him, he’s a proper professional - his record speaks for himself. As we speak David Moyes is on the list of managers and we’ll be selecting one in due course. I’d like to think it was David Moyes, I really hope so.<br /><br />We were disappointed at our performance right the way through the year. We changed our manager which is always a difficult time for us. When I look back, I’m looking to see why did it happen? Was it because of the manager situation, was it because the players weren’t good enough? In actual fact, what I have discovered, if you look at the injury list right the way through the season, there was a time just before Christmas we had 12 senior players injured, unavailable for selection. No team can suffer that kind of situation</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham co-owner David Gold insists the influence of agents in football must be clamped down upon]</b> They are certainly sucking tons of money out of football. We are all trying to pay less, they are doing nothing for football. I can’t believe it is even a discussion. Other than agents, everybody else is against them.<br /><br /><b>[On whether agents were a disruptive influence]</b> That goes with the territory. They are certainly doing that<br /><br />The FA certainly is line with our feelings that something has to be done. From the beginning it’s not been something that we want and they don’t want. Now it’s FIFA and UEFA we need to come into line and we are hoping they come up with something</p>

Declan made his choice and I think that is what’s behind it as far as Keane is concerned. It’s pretty shameful when a former professional talks the way he did about a young man. It was low, outrageous, unfair and arrogant to pick him out of all the England players. It wasn’t even an analysis of the boy who is 20 years old who has barely started his career in the international team for God’s sake<br /><br />This isn’t the first time he’s done it. In a previous game he said he should be sitting in the studio with the pundits rather than being on the pitch. Shocking!
