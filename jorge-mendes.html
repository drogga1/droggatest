  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo only wanted to play for Juventus]</b> In January 2018, I and the few people who knew what was happening thought it would be very difficult to bring Cristiano Ronaldo to Juve. However, I want to make it clear that the idea started with the player himself. Ronaldo told me he only wanted to play for Juventus. That’s where it began and I was in talks with the Bianconeri directors for months, so we all know how those negotiations ended up. Now Cristiano is happy with the club and his team-mates, he is satisfied with Serie A and truly happy at Juventus.<br /><br />Many have asked me about Juve and the Champions League. It will take a bit of luck to win it too, but Cristiano Ronaldo’s arrival has certainly made Juventus stronger. I’d say all of Italian football has benefited from his presence</p>
