  <p>[Man Utd legend Scholes takes on first managerial role at Oldham] Paul has won everything there is to win in football. He is a man who will bring a lot of footballing knowledge and his hunger to succeed in management will be there for everyone to see. It’s no secret how much he has wanted this job in the past and how much he loves this club, so I’m very happy to bring him into our family at Oldham Athletic. Paul will have my backing 100% and hopefully we can work together to bring success back to this club.</p>

  <p>[Oldham Athletic owner Abdallah Lemsagam revealed his shock after head coach Paul Scholes resigned by text message] I am disappointed by Paul’s decision to resign and surprised by the reasons he has given in his statement. Both myself and the staff at the club gave Paul all the support and autonomy that he asked for. I personally was always supportive of any decisions Paul made or consulted me on reassuring him that he was the man in charge. I continued to encourage him despite the results and reassured him that his job was secure. I was content to remain in League Two for this season and working with the team we have for the remainder of this season is important. He did not raise any concerns at all about the team or any other matters informally or formally, prior to his resignation. He gave no opportunity or indications that he needed to address any issues at all. Management is a difficult job and both myself and everyone at the club would have worked with Paul to find solutions, had we been given the chance. I personally believed that he would be the manager to take us forward this season and next and I know many of you felt the same. As a club, we wish him well again and thank him for his contribution.</p>
