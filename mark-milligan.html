  <p><b>[Mark Milligan admits why he left Melbourne Victory for Al Ahli]</b> I choose to take the move to Al Ahli obviously because of the size of the club. In negotiations they were very keen on acquiring my services and I think when a club is pushing that hard you know you’re going to play a role in what they’re trying to achieve. Obviously they have high expectations of the team and sitting second on the table, still in the cup and Champions League so I think the challenge of coming into such a big club in the Asian region was too good an offer to sort of look past.<br /><br /><b>[However in making his debut for Al Ahli against bitter rivals Al Ittihad in a 0-0 away draw, Milligan saw first hand the magnitude of support in the region]</b> The fans there are fanatical. I was fortunate enough to play my first game in the derby against Al Ittihad and there were 62,000 fans there…it was unbelievable. They have high expectations on the club too, and I like those pressures to succeed</p>

  <p><b>[Australian midfielder Mark Milligan has inadvertently gained some precious insight into new Socceroos boss Bert Van Marwijk]</b> I think it was very important we <b>[Australia]</b> appointed a coach with such a reputation. I’ve been fortunate over the last few weeks in Saudi to hear just how highly they speak of him. They speak unbelievably about him and obviously what he’s achieved with all his teams and at World Cup level too. I think it was important not only we had a coach of his experience but a coach with his sort of successes.<br /><br />It’s very exciting times for us with the national team. We spent four good years under Ange and under a new coach it’s always a little bit nerve-wracking I guess to see what he does and what he does in terms of which players and I just want to make sure I’m a part of that. Hopefully in the next few months leading to that, I can keep playing well with Saudi team and hopefully that translates into national team time</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Milligan on the <a href="ffa.html">Football Federation Australia</a>’s ground-breaking deal that closes the pay gap between the men’s and women’s national teams]</b> It’s been clear for everybody to see how much it <b>[women’s football]</b> has grown over the last few years, and especially how well our Matildas have been doing. I’d only really heard and read about the successes they were having, and to be able to go across and witness it first hand was extraordinary. The timing for me probably couldn’t have been better, because it really drove home how important it was during these negotiations that they got what they deserved. Going forward, what a value they are to the Australian footballing community</p>
