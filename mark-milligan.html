  <p><b>[Mark Milligan has given the thumbs-up to the Socceroos new formation, despite a 1-1 draw with Iraq in Tehran]</b> I think it’s going to be a very effective formation for us going forward. It worked well in patches and obviously in other areas it needs some work. It’s just getting that total understanding of the way we’re doing it. We’ll have a little bit more time to work on it now and fine-tune things before Tuesday night<br /><br /><b>[After going ahead through a Matthew Leckie goal just before half-time, Iraq grabbed a point with a goal in the last quarter-hour]</b> It’s a tough one to take. I think we worked very hard in very difficult conditions to get ourselves in front and to give it up late on is obviously disappointing, but it’s sometimes hard to play in those situations. They sort of threw caution to the wind and their formation and everything went out the window. They pushed a lot of players on and maybe we had some chances to punish them going the other way. We didn’t, and they kept coming<br /><br />We aim to win every game, so we’ll be going into that match with the same mentality. Obviously we’ve fallen short tonight and in the last few games, so we’ll be looking to rectify that</p>

  <p><b>[Socceroos midfielder Mark Milligan has opened up on his heartbreak after a transfer to Championship side Bolton Wanderers fell through because of the FIFA world rankings]</b> I was absolutely gutted with the final result from the visa board. I was pretty much done and dusted <b>[to join Bolton]</b> and was so close to getting my move to England. Obviously it dragged on a little bit in the end because we were sort of waiting for new rankings to come out in the hope it will push <b>[the Socceroos]</b> a bit closer to the top 50. In the end it didn’t but <b>[the visa board]</b> held out for that long and other <b>[opportunities]</b> passed by. A lot of teams make signings or make offers and when you turn them down, they’re not there days later.<br /><br />Yeah absolutely. I work extremely hard on keeping my body right. Although I’m getting on a little bit now, I don’t feel like I’ve missed a beat since the off-season and coming back in pre-season<br /><br />Hopefully <b>[we can get through]</b> these next two games - and we don’t know what’s going to happen after that - but <b>[I’ll be]</b> looking at possibly going to a fourth World Cup. There isn’t anyone at the moment that can say they’ve done that. That’s something that definitely drives me and although we fell short with the national team rankings, and it did hurt me, I still have a lot of passion and pride playing for my country. As long as I have that, I’ll be over the moon for any selection that I’m picked in going forward</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Milligan believes there is no doubt Australia will be at their fifth consecutive World Cup]</b> Whether it’s Wednesday that it’s announced that we’re going to a World Cup or whether we have to wait a bit longer, it will happen. Obviously that’s worst case scenario but there’s a long way before we have to hit that panic button. I still truly believe that we will go out Tuesday night and we’ll put in a good performance. Going to consecutive World Cups has been very important not just for the national team but for Australian football, the A-League and lower leagues.</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Milligan admits why he left Melbourne Victory for Al Ahli]</b> I choose to take the move to Al Ahli obviously because of the size of the club. In negotiations they were very keen on acquiring my services and I think when a club is pushing that hard you know you’re going to play a role in what they’re trying to achieve. Obviously they have high expectations of the team and sitting second on the table, still in the cup and Champions League so I think the challenge of coming into such a big club in the Asian region was too good an offer to sort of look past.<br /><br /><b>[However in making his debut for Al Ahli against bitter rivals Al Ittihad in a 0-0 away draw, Milligan saw first hand the magnitude of support in the region]</b> The fans there are fanatical. I was fortunate enough to play my first game in the derby against Al Ittihad and there were 62,000 fans there…it was unbelievable. They have high expectations on the club too, and I like those pressures to succeed</p>

  <p><b>[Australian midfielder Mark Milligan has inadvertently gained some precious insight into new Socceroos boss Bert Van Marwijk]</b> I think it was very important we <b>[Australia]</b> appointed a coach with such a reputation. I’ve been fortunate over the last few weeks in Saudi to hear just how highly they speak of him. They speak unbelievably about him and obviously what he’s achieved with all his teams and at World Cup level too. I think it was important not only we had a coach of his experience but a coach with his sort of successes.<br /><br />It’s very exciting times for us with the national team. We spent four good years under Ange and under a new coach it’s always a little bit nerve-wracking I guess to see what he does and what he does in terms of which players and I just want to make sure I’m a part of that. Hopefully in the next few months leading to that, I can keep playing well with Saudi team and hopefully that translates into national team time</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Milligan on the <a href="ffa.html">Football Federation Australia</a>’s ground-breaking deal that closes the pay gap between the men’s and women’s national teams]</b> It’s been clear for everybody to see how much it <b>[women’s football]</b> has grown over the last few years, and especially how well our Matildas have been doing. I’d only really heard and read about the successes they were having, and to be able to go across and witness it first hand was extraordinary. The timing for me probably couldn’t have been better, because it really drove home how important it was during these negotiations that they got what they deserved. Going forward, what a value they are to the Australian footballing community</p>
