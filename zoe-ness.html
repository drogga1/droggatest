<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Behind Glasgow City’s battle for Scottish football supremacy with Celtic and Rangers]</b> You can see the impact <b>[the national team’s success]</b> has had across the league, in the quality of players, the quality of teams. There’s been a few young players that have moved down to England from the Scottish league, but I think the quality across the board has improved. Having that support and that structure around training, being able to have a lot of the girls full-time, was a big thing<br /><br />We’ve trained like four nights a week for I don’t know how many years now. With the club and the national team, I was probably training as much as, if not more than, a pro player would do, but then just trying to balance work with it. People say: ‘You’ve won the league so many times in a row and you’ve won this, and you’ve won that, it must get boring, it must be easy’. But it’s not. You’ve literally got a target on your back and people want you to fail, they want to beat you, try harder against you</p>
