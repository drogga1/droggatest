  <p><b>[Julian Green saves Greuther Furth from relegation]</b> It was an exhausting few days and we are all really happy. I had a really good feeling all day long and we did very well at the beginning and then we got one, two good opportunities for goal. I had two shots in front of the goal, also in the games before that went just off, and today it went in. And I think there is no better time than today. We are all happy</p>

  <p><b>[Four years after his World Cup goal, Julian Green hoping to revive USMNT career]</b> Some things have changed. Some new faces, but the rest is the still the same. I think soccer is always the same and that’s what we’re all here for.<br /><br />It hasn’t been frustrating. Of course I always want to be here and play with the national team, but I moved from Bayern to Stuttgart and it was more important than to be here. I would say last season was very good for me. I played every game and now I’m back here. It’s perfect for me and I will continue<br /><br />I felt it in myself. I felt every game I got better and better. I just feel more comfortable on the pitch. It was a very important season for me so now, for me, I moved up my game a little bit. The season was very important for me</p>

  <p><b>[Former Bayern Munich winger Julian Green says he is sure that football will challenge the established US sports for popularity]</b> Football is getting bigger, but it’s not yet on a level with the NHL, NBA and NFL. But I’m sure that will change in the next few years. It’s a good thing that many talented Americans like Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Josh Sargent move to Europe and get educated at a young age.<br /><br />Until I was eleven, I even played in the club at home in Miesbach. Then I had to decide - and chose football. In the NHL, Tampa Bay Lightning is my favorite club and I try to watch a lot of games, but of course that’s not always possible with the time difference<br /><br />Guardiola is an exceptional coach and tactically very good. I also got on well with him personally. And his German speeches got better over time</p>

  <p><b>[Julian Green has signed a new deal with Greuther Furth]</b> We have improved every year now and I want to do my part to ensure that we continue to pursue this development. Working with the coaching team, the whole team and everyone in the club has been a lot of fun. I am convinced of the quality that is in our team</p>
