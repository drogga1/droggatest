  <p>[Know Bengaluru FC’s rivals - Maziya Sports &amp; Recreation Club] We don’t want to talk about chances of the knock out stages yet. We are fully focused on going match by match. If we start to talk about everything before the matches, we can’t be good at concentrating on the match. We have good national team players and foreign players in our team. But we have to know that the other teams are from this region and they also have national team players in those teams.</p>

  <p>[Bengaluru FC were victorious in their AFC Cup Group E opener against local rivals Mohun Bagan] I expect a different Bengaluru tomorrow. They rested their players in the league it means they are giving importance to AFC Cup. So we need to be ready for that. It’s going to be a difficult game against Maziya. They won their first game in Bangladesh. We expect a really tough game tomorrow. I don’t feel pressure of being the runners up. There will be pressure on any team who always want to win. But this is a challenge for us to come here and do our best and try to win.<br /><br />[Marjan said that Maziya would go into the contest as underdogs] Depending on last season yes Bengaluru is the favorite, but I believe in my players. Tomorrow we will be challenging Bengaluru hopefully if the commitment, hard work we do with bit of luck I believe we can get the result here</p>
