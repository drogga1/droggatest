  <p><b>[Mehdi Benatia speaks after scoring a brace in <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>’s 4-0 win over <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> in the Coppa Italia final]</b> <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> always do something special, it’s not the first time. This group wrote their names in the history books of Italian football. We have a winning mentality, there is a great unity and we can continue</p>

  <p><b>[Medhi Benatia gives more insight on Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> While we were all in normal clothes, he put on shorts, took his music and went to the gym. So then I thought: this guy is not normal. When you witness him up close, as I was lucky enough to do, you respect him even more than before. He has sacrificed all his life for football</p>

  <p><b>[Former team-mate Medhi Benatia says <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> wanted Miralem Pjanic]</b> He still has three years on his contract and <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> are doing well. It is true that in every window he has the chance to leave: <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> are interested in him, and before that even Real have looked at him but, in the end, he has stayed with the club. His love for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, where he feels confidence, prevailed: in the dressing room he is one of the leaders, he knows how to make himself heard and respected. But, we know, situations can change; the club could decide to sell him. But if it depends on the player, he will stay in Turin. He never told me he wanted to move; on the contrary. With <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> he changed his mentality: now he plays to win, always<br /><br /><b>[Benatia has no doubts over his enduring quality]</b> Mire is always able to find you a solution when there are opponents pressing. He has more quality than the others. <b>[Rodrigo]</b> Bentancur has a bright future ahead of him and will become one of the best, but at the moment he is still a step below. He is also self-critical. I called and complimented him on a game, he was tense and said he played badly because he had lost two balls in dangerous areas. This stop will do him good to return to being the strongest in Italy and among the best in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> defender Medhi Benatia has questioned <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>’s man-management skills]</b> He is tactically the best coach in the world, I don’t see one better than him. But I did not like him very much in <b>[terms of]</b> the relationship with the players, from this point of view he did not impress me.<br /><br /><b>[He said of <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>’s links to another of his former clubs]</b> He could certainly be the right profile for <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, but, in my opinion, <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> has an excellent idea of football. This year, perhaps, has been a bit more complicated for <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, but change always requires patience. And we must not forget that we are talking about a team still in the running to win everything. So, the work overseen so far has been good. And I don’t think it’s fair to talk about other coaches right now, the <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a> have a good one.</p>

  <p><b>[former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> team-mate Medhi Benatia says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is the absolute number one]</b> He is the absolute number one, as a footballer and as a person. He is very intelligent, even off the pitch. His brain is always faster than anybody else. I am happy to be his friend. I always wish him the best<br /><br /><a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> is a great coach and a great person. I had no problem with him or anyone else. But he made promises to me that he didn’t keep. In pre-season in the States, the coach told me that I was going to start with <b>[Giorgio]</b> <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Chiellini</a>. And that <b>[Leonardo]</b> <a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Bonucci</a> would have to earn his place. Leo is a champion, but it was expected that I would start and, perhaps, at the first mistake someone else could have played in my place. At that moment things were going pretty well for me. I scored two goals in the Italian Cup final and we were talking about a contract renewal. After that, I found myself making four bench appearances without playing even a minute. Then, apparently, <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> had made fun of me. I started to lose my mind and I told him that I would never play for <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> again while he was the coach. But with the club I have an extraordinary relationship, we are still in touch and I’m happy to have been able to work with these people, because it’s the best you can aspire to.<br /><br />No, I don’t have time to think about regrets. I don’t like looking back. I don’t like to say ‘I should have done this or that’. I’m happy, that’s okay. It could have been much worse. So, no regrets for my life</p>

  <p><b>[Medhi Benatia has told his former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> co-star <a href="blaise-matuidi.html">Blaise Matuidi</a> that the midfielder is an essential part of the team]</b> You were a worker, an important player for the team. You remember what <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> said. Sometimes he said some bullsh*t, but he said you were an essential player in all the teams you have been in, playing 30, 40, 50 games with all the coaches. That was simple, you just have to look at your career. You were essential. Some are a season with 15 goals and the year after they disappear. How much did you win? 25 titles? It’s the consistency of staying at a high level, it depends on how hard you work<br /><br />I’m missing <a href="francesco-totti.html">Francesco Totti</a> in my shirt collection. He wrote to me for my birthday, gave me best wishes and told me that he is angry with me, because on Instagram when they asked me to show the shirts of the legends I didn’t show his. I said to him: ‘I played twice against you at Udinese, we insulted each other the whole game. I sign for Roma. He sees me and says: ‘Hey Moroccan, I hope you’re going to be quieter than when I played against you’. We laughed and stuff. Since then, he became my guy. Now he will send me one, he still has it at home</p>
