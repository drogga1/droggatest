  <p><b>[Gonzalo Higuain and Medhi Benatia to miss Sevilla clash]</b> Gonzalo Higuain will not be on the plane to Spain after sustaining bruising to his left thigh in the final minutes of Saturday’s win over Pescara. The forward’s condition will be monitored closely over the coming days. Medhi Benatia, meanwhile, has not yet fully recovered from a knock to his right knee.</p>

  <p><b>[Medhi Benatia has blasted Michael Oliver for crushing Juventus’ Champions League dreams with a controversial penalty call]</b> I’ve seen it in the match, I’ve seen it on the TV, you can’t whistle for a foul on this kind of action. When you put in that much effort, against a great team like this, you can’t have a referee whistling for a penalty like that in the 93rd-minute, because honestly this is a game which should have ended in extra-time. I’m proud of my team, but I’m more and more disgusted by the world of football.<br /><br />What I say might seem harsh, but when you make an effort like that you can’t afford to have the referee give a penalty kick in the 93rd minute and crush the hopes of the people. There’s some work behind all that. If I’d made a clear foul I’d have said it honestly: ‘I touched him, but otherwise he’d have scored into an empty goal’. But that’s not the case! I did everything I could not to touch him, but at the end of the day football is still a contact sport. So it’s possible my right thigh touched him, but I didn’t shove him or anything. There it is, it’s bad, it’s bad. We’re disgusted, but that’s life, that’s football.</p>

But I can hardly play a game every so often. Last year I did well because I had more continuity. Unfortunately, now I do not have it. Part of my job is that I always have to work to make myself ready, but it is not a pleasant situation. I am available to the team, as long as I stay here, I will give my best. It’s normal that this is not good for me. I’m 31 and I have to try to play as much as possible. Let’s see in January what will happen, how much I have been used, if Juventus need me.<br /><br />We have people like Cristiano Ronaldo, Dybala or Douglas Costa and, when you put them all together, it is normal that we have to be much more careful because they are phenomena, but you cannot ask them to defend and to attack, to score. When we have the ball we can create even more, but we leave a little more space and it is something on which there is a lot to work on. We have to go back to being a team capable of not conceding goals for 10-15 matches</p>

I want my kids to grow up in an Islamic atmosphere, and I could go to clubs in the UAE or Saudi Arabia but I preferred to be with Al Duhail, and there are a lot of Moroccan players who play in the national team and are with the Gulf clubs. <b>[Morocco]</b> coach Herve Renard knows me well and if he sees that I do not deserve to be with the national team, I will respect this decision.</p>

It is true that in every window he has the chance to leave: <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> are interested in him, and before that even Real have looked at him but, in the end, he has stayed with the club. His love for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, where he feels confidence, prevailed: in the dressing room he is one of the leaders, he knows how to make himself heard and respected. But, we know, situations can change; the club could decide to sell him. But if it depends on the player, he will stay in <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a>. He never told me he wanted to move; on the contrary.

I called and complimented him on a game, he was tense and said he played badly because he had lost two balls in dangerous areas. This stop will do him good to return to being the strongest in Italy and among the best in the world</p>

This year, perhaps, has been a bit more complicated for <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, but change always requires patience. And we must not forget that we are talking about a team still in the running to win everything. So, the work overseen so far has been good.

  <p><b>[former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> team-mate Medhi Benatia says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is the absolute number one]</b> He is the absolute number one, as a footballer and as a person. He is very intelligent, even off the pitch. His brain is always faster than anybody else. I am happy to be his friend. I always wish him the best<br /><br /><a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> is a great coach and a great person. I had no problem with him or anyone else. But he made promises to me that he didn’t keep. In pre-season in the States, the coach told me that I was going to start with <b>[Giorgio]</b> <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Chiellini</a>. And that <b>[<a href="leonardo.html">Leonardo</a>]</b> <a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Bonucci</a> would have to earn his place. Leo is a champion, but it was expected that I would start and, perhaps, at the first mistake someone else could have played in my place. At that moment things were going pretty well for me. I scored two goals in the Italian Cup final and we were talking about a contract renewal. After that, I found myself making four bench appearances without playing even a minute. Then, apparently, <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> had made fun of me. I started to lose my mind and I told him that I would never play for <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> again while he was the coach. But with the club I have an extraordinary relationship, we are still in touch and I’m happy to have been able to work with these people, because it’s the best you can aspire to.<br /><br />No, I don’t have time to think about regrets. I don’t like looking back. I don’t like to say ‘I should have done this or that’. I’m happy, that’s okay. It could have been much worse. So, no regrets for my life</p>

That was simple, you just have to look at your career. You were essential. Some are a season with 15 goals and the year after they disappear. How much did you win? 25 titles?

I said to him: ‘I played twice against you at Udinese, we insulted each other the whole game. I sign for Roma. He sees me and says: ‘Hey Moroccan, I hope you’re going to be quieter than when I played against you’. We laughed and stuff. Since then, he became my guy.
