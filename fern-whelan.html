  <p><b>[England international Fern Whelan calls on FA to do more for black female players]</b> I haven’t spoken about it too much. I don’t know if that’s because I haven’t been asked about it. From the ages of eight to 16, I was in teams where I was the only black player. I didn’t think about it too much, but there were derogatory terms that I wasn’t comfortable with and, I’ll be honest, it was really bad at the time that things were allowed to slide. It becomes a subtle racism then; not aggressive. It wasn’t in my face, and was passed off as banter, but you’ve crossed a line: names like ‘darky’, games of ‘bibs v darks’, and it’s only now when I look back and think ‘those things are awful’. They shouldn’t have been allowed to be said, but I guess I took it on the chin. I knew I was more than that, I knew that wasn’t me, I’m more than a black female: I’m a black female who’s educated, I’m a black female who’s in football. I tried not to rise to it<br /><br />Is it because the game is transforming into a more full-time, professional, elite status? Is there still the same availability for young black girls?<br /><br />The women train where the men train now, at elite training centres, and a lot of these are actually quite difficult to get to. At Brighton we train at Lancing, which is quite out of the way, we have Cobham which is similar, as is <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>’s training centre, Mellwood. Is that potentially one of the reasons?<br /><br />Is the access falling away a bit for people from poorer backgrounds, who maybe don’t have the access or the travel facilities to get to these places? Maybe young black girls are enjoying playing the game, but when it gets a bit more serious at academy level, can they actually get to training? Do their mums and dads have time to take them there?</p>
