<blockquote>
  <p>[Kenedy is hoping to avoid forming part of Chelsea’s loan army again in 2019-20] I learned a lot from my time there. I was very happy with the amount I played. It was a great experience for me so I must say thanks to the club and the manager. Now I have to start again here at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and work hard, step by step. My hope now is to do a great season here at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. That is my dream<br /><br />[Kenedy added, having impressed in friendly dates with Kawasaski Frontale and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>] I am very happy with the amount of minutes I played in Japan. It was a great experience. I am really pleased for the opportunity the manager is giving me and the amount I have been playing in pre-season. When I was at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> before I played a lot as a left-back, but now I have been playing further forward. My past experiences as a left-back have helped me be a better player now</p>
