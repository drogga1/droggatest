  <p>[Newcastle have completed a deal to take left-sided midfielder Kenedy on loan from Chelsea for the duration of the season] I’m so happy to have come back to my second home. I am so happy with this interest from Rafa Benítez, that he came back for me. I want to keep it going, the work that I did here before, for the new season. I have received many, many messages on social media from the fans. They made me feel appreciated, so I wanted to come here in this new season and give everything on the pitch.<br /><br />The first game - my debut - was really, really good because I didn’t expect an atmosphere like this. And the game against Leicester was amazing because I’d never seen support like that. The supporters were really amazing. I really appreciate that because I didn’t expect anything like this. The fans were something different. I felt honoured to be here; it was something really special and I’m a fan of Newcastle’s fans</p>

  <p>[Newcastle’s on-loan Chelsea forward Kenedy sees his future away from St James’s Park and back at Stamford Bridge] It is not that I didn’t succeed at Chelsea. I arrived at 19, very young. It was good to be loaned to get more playing time; better than staying at Chelsea and not playing. I hope this year I can make a good season for Newcastle and go back to Chelsea to continue. I have a dream to return and to be a champion for the club.<br /><br />Just being in the Premier League is already a great achievement. A lot of people come and can’t play. For me, it’s been very good. My dream is to win a major title</p>

  <p>[Kenedy is hoping to avoid forming part of Chelsea’s loan army again in 2019-20] I learned a lot from my time there. I was very happy with the amount I played. It was a great experience for me so I must say thanks to the club and the manager. Now I have to start again here at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and work hard, step by step. My hope now is to do a great season here at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. That is my dream<br /><br />[Kenedy added, having impressed in friendly dates with Kawasaski Frontale and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>] I am very happy with the amount of minutes I played in Japan. It was a great experience. I am really pleased for the opportunity the manager is giving me and the amount I have been playing in pre-season. When I was at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> before I played a lot as a left-back, but now I have been playing further forward. My past experiences as a left-back have helped me be a better player now</p>
