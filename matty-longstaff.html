  <p><b>[Match-winner Longstaff talks about <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> side triumphed 1-0 against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> at St James’s Park]</b> Last night you go to bed dreaming of it but you never think it will happen. I’m over the moon, speechless. I found out I was in the team yesterday after training, the butterflies started going and I looked forward to it ever since, I was buzzing. <b>[The goal]</b> was hit and hope rather than a placed shot but it’s in the back of the net. You can’t describe the feeling, running away to the fans, it was surreal. I thought my first-half shot was in but it hit the bar. That was a bit disappointing but to get the goal front of the Gallowgate, it’s that little bit special</p>
