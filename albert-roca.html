  <p>[Bengaluru FC picked up their second victory on home soil as they downed Chennai City FC] We played well in the first half. We were lacking because we could not score the first goal in the first half. We let them believe that they could have a good result again. So it was to force them till the last moment. Unfortunately, it’s a shame for the clear opportunities that we had in the first half [we didn’t score]. In the second half we knew that they [Chennai City] would try to get us nervous but we took control of the situation and we deserved to win.<br /><br />We are lacking because we scored after both changes, but they are strikers and they are here to score. We could see that they were a little bit tired and we took advantage of this. Fortunately the first goal came early enough<br /><br />[On Cameron Watson] Cameron not play. He had flu. So we had to change the tactics and Eugene [Eugeneson Lyngdoh] had to play a bit back for that reason. It is quite normal. It’s going to be like this perhaps in the future. We have to use as many players as we can. Sometimes it is difficult. Eugene is a very good player. He knows his job. He can play a little bit behind or forward<br /><br />[On Lenny Rodrigues] Lenny had played well in the initial games. He is a professional and he knows his job. Perhaps a little bit more defensive but he is a person who can keep the ball and control the situation. So we need him because he’s one who would never give up and is one step forward [in his game]. We are very happy to have him in our squad<br /><br />[On Roby Norales] He has been here for only 10 days. By now we are very happy with him. He doesn’t talk too much English but he is always trying. He did well today [Saturday] as he went on the pitch with the mentality to be part of the squad. I hope the goal will help him to grow [at Bengaluru FC].<br /><br />These things happen everywhere. Even big teams know how difficult it is sometimes to score. You can see that even Barcelona, Manchester United had some problems to score in some games this season. Even if we have missed some good chances, finally we have won our games 3-0 and 2-0<br /><br />We have to be ready for that also. We know that we are perhaps one of the top teams in the league. The other teams know that they have to defend to get a good result here [against Bengaluru]. So we have to be focused and train on this when we play at home and away also. We have to accept our role and we have to see which are the ways to break this kind of defence</p>

  <p>[Albert Roca expects Mumbai FC to be defensive against Bengaluru FC] They will be mentally stronger after their 2 wins. They have the talent to create trouble for us. They will try to do so and we have to be prepared for a tough battle. But we’re ready for them.<br /><br />Let’s see what they propose. Perhaps, they might be defensive because they are playing against us but they have good players and we have to be ready. Our intention is to win. They have players like Thoi Singh who have played for us. If they defend, we need to push them hard and create chances. If they attack, we need to defend. We will change our approach according to how the opponent plays<br /><br />[On Santosh Kashyap’s side as a counter-attacking team] Mumbai have a lot of speed up front, with Victorino. We have to ensure we don’t allow them to hit long balls for him to chase. Our philosophy is to build from the back. Even though it is risky, we will not change. We are not a counter-attacking team and we try to control the game. We have to be very careful and deny them chance to counter-attack. They will get their chances but hopefully they wouldn’t punish us much<br /><br />Shankar [Sampingiraj] had some pain today. Fanai [Lalchhuanmawia] has started training but not ready to start yet. There are no other injuries. Cameron [Watson] had a stomach pain last game but he is ready for the game<br /><br />Yes, we’ve had new players since the AFC Cup final. But I’m happy with the squad. It is hard for the new players to understand the philosophy of the team but they are trying hard. They are striving to be at the level of the others as quick as possible. It is my job to ensure they are able to do that</p>
