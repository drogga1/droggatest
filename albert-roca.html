  <p><b>[Bengaluru FC picked up their second victory on home soil as they downed Chennai City FC]</b> We played well in the first half. We were lacking because we could not score the first goal in the first half. We let them believe that they could have a good result again. So it was to force them till the last moment. Unfortunately, it’s a shame for the clear opportunities that we had in the first half <b>[we didn’t score]</b>. In the second half we knew that they <b>[Chennai City]</b> would try to get us nervous but we took control of the situation and we deserved to win.<br /><br />We are lacking because we scored after both changes, but they are strikers and they are here to score. We could see that they were a little bit tired and we took advantage of this. Fortunately the first goal came early enough<br /><br /><b>[On Cameron Watson]</b> Cameron not play. He had flu. So we had to change the tactics and Eugene <b>[Eugeneson Lyngdoh]</b> had to play a bit back for that reason. It is quite normal. It’s going to be like this perhaps in the future. We have to use as many players as we can. Sometimes it is difficult. Eugene is a very good player. He knows his job. He can play a little bit behind or forward<br /><br /><b>[On Lenny Rodrigues]</b> Lenny had played well in the initial games. He is a professional and he knows his job. Perhaps a little bit more defensive but he is a person who can keep the ball and control the situation. So we need him because he’s one who would never give up and is one step forward <b>[in his game]</b>. We are very happy to have him in our squad<br /><br /><b>[On Roby Norales]</b> He has been here for only 10 days. By now we are very happy with him. He doesn’t talk too much English but he is always trying. He did well today <b>[Saturday]</b> as he went on the pitch with the mentality to be part of the squad. I hope the goal will help him to grow <b>[at Bengaluru FC]</b>.<br /><br />These things happen everywhere. Even big teams know how difficult it is sometimes to score. You can see that even Barcelona, Manchester United had some problems to score in some games this season. Even if we have missed some good chances, finally we have won our games 3-0 and 2-0<br /><br />We have to be ready for that also. We know that we are perhaps one of the top teams in the league. The other teams know that they have to defend to get a good result here <b>[against Bengaluru]</b>. So we have to be focused and train on this when we play at home and away also. We have to accept our role and we have to see which are the ways to break this kind of defence</p>

  <p><b>[Albert Roca expects Mumbai FC to be defensive against Bengaluru FC]</b> They will be mentally stronger after their 2 wins. They have the talent to create trouble for us. They will try to do so and we have to be prepared for a tough battle. But we’re ready for them.<br /><br />Let’s see what they propose. Perhaps, they might be defensive because they are playing against us but they have good players and we have to be ready. Our intention is to win. They have players like Thoi Singh who have played for us. If they defend, we need to push them hard and create chances. If they attack, we need to defend. We will change our approach according to how the opponent plays<br /><br /><b>[On Santosh Kashyap’s side as a counter-attacking team]</b> Mumbai have a lot of speed up front, with Victorino. We have to ensure we don’t allow them to hit long balls for him to chase. Our philosophy is to build from the back. Even though it is risky, we will not change. We are not a counter-attacking team and we try to control the game. We have to be very careful and deny them chance to counter-attack. They will get their chances but hopefully they wouldn’t punish us much<br /><br />Shankar <b>[Sampingiraj]</b> had some pain today. Fanai <b>[Lalchhuanmawia]</b> has started training but not ready to start yet. There are no other injuries. Cameron <b>[Watson]</b> had a stomach pain last game but he is ready for the game<br /><br />Yes, we’ve had new players since the AFC Cup final. But I’m happy with the squad. It is hard for the new players to understand the philosophy of the team but they are trying hard. They are striving to be at the level of the others as quick as possible. It is my job to ensure they are able to do that</p>

  <p><b>[Defending champions Bengaluru FC were restricted to a draw by hosts Mumbai FC on Saturday evening]</b> In the second half, I don’t understand why Mumbai were allowed to use all the minutes <b>[to waste]</b> but only three minutes were added on to compensate. Three minutes, that’s it? Three minutes is what it takes for a substitute to come on. What about the other minutes which they <b>[Mumbai FC]</b> were permitted on the pitch? Mumbai were trying to waste time. The officiating is not acceptable. This is not an excuse. This needs to be checked upon because it happens only in India</p>

  <p><b>[Bengaluru FC head coach Albert Roca cut an optimistic figure looking to reverse their six-game winless run in the 2016/17 I-League]</b> It is going to be a tough game tomorrow. We respect the East Bengal side who are coming. I believe in my team and the way we have played our last three games it has made us believe we are on our way to win. Perhaps things change tomorrow and we can win that game I think we deserved to win three games ago. We did a good job during the week and tomorrow is an important and a difficult test for us. We will look to get all the three points.<br /><br />They have good players who have scored a lot of goals. You cannot expect it to be easier without him <b>[Plaza]</b>. We have suffered a lot in defence and John <b>[Johnson]</b> is still not there. We still don’t have that player that we can count upon, be it a foreign striker or any other foreigner and it is a shame but we cannot cry and complain<br /><br />We haven’t been getting the goals but we have been the team who have been creating most chances, the team who are making more offensive actions. It is just that we haven’t been more efficient and we are still working on that. It is not easy. I just cannot pull up Vineeth and tell him to score more goals because he has already scored five. All of us as a team has to be concerned and try to do our best. It is true that we have failed in getting the final pass. We need to have a number 10 who manages all the action. We have to work more on getting the pass right for the last two or three metres and that is how we will get more chances to score finally. You need to have balance. Attack and defend well and have the efficiency in both boxes. We have conceded goals but not too much. We are perhaps a much better side on the training ground now and if we would have been a little bit more lucky or had more vision in the opponents box then we could have won games. We have to be more accurate and we have dominated all the games and control of the situations but without scoring it is impossible to win</p>

  <p><b>[Bengaluru FC suffered a 3-1 mauling at the hands of East Bengal at the Kanteerava Stadium]</b> The dynamics surrounding this match is so bad. We had expectations to go for a win from the first minute. We tried and it was not good. There remains a lot of doubt from the results and only results give you confidence. It’s never easy when you play with an experienced team <b>[East Bengal]</b>.<br /><br />We played better in the second half. We had opportunities to get back but the second goal really killed us. The team kept on fighting in spite of that<br /><br />I don’t want to talk about title chances, I want to fight. Only a few games remain but our intention is to fight every single game. Nobody likes this and nobody expected this at the beginning of the season. We have to take up a collective responsibility now. Maybe we could have won today as we were unlucky in converting chances early. The fans deserve to see us put a fight nd I have never seen my team so down. The game ended with players from the two teams involved in a heated tussle. Roca was asked to speak about the fight at the end of the game. I don’t want to talk too much about this. We have to be more respectful when we play teams like East Bengal. Every team wants to win but you have to play out till the last whistle is blown. You have to show the sensitivity both when you are losing and winning</p>

  <p><b>[Bengaluru FC sign Marjan Jugovic halfway through the season]</b> We hope the arrival of Marjan will add impetus to our attacking department. He’s tall, a proper target man and has very handy experience gathered across continents. We have been creating so many chances but have struggled to put them away and Marjan’s got his task cut out. I’m sure he will help get our season back on track.</p>

  <p><b>[Bengaluru FC’s Albert Roca - ‘India needs to embrace Spanish style of play’]</b> I think we have one of the best squads and have a lot of options up front. But we are not lucky in front of goal. We have to resolve the issue and we have brought in Marjan Jugovic. It is late but it is something that we cannot change and we have to manage the situation. We can’t put pressure on him but he has enough quality to help us. All the players are involved in this and we have to resolve this collectively.<br /><br />My philosophy is one where the ball is more important. Building out from the back is paramount. This is not something very common here. Even if the result doesn’t come, I can’t change. India has to understand this way. Indians are more like Spanish people.They are not physical or big. They need to be more tactical and technical. The better way for India to grow is by embracing this approach. It’s my humble opinion.<br /><br />We are a little bit far from the title. We want to take it game by game and have better performances. Last game, our performance wasn’t the best because the pitch was awful and even tomorrow the pitch won’t be good but it should be better than what Minerva had</p>

  <p><b>[Bengaluru FC coach Albert Roca expressed his displeasure with the way his opponents shut shop]</b> I think we have to disappointed for the result and not the performance. My team has played very well today. There is only one team which wanted to win on the pitch. The other team just wanted to waste time and clear balls. This is not football but unfortunately, we were unlucky in many aspects. The final result doesn’t show what happened on the pitch. My team fought until the last minute. Chennai were luckier than us.<br /><br />The refereeing decisions were not helping us. We are trying to push and press. If it is a penalty, the referee has to whistle even if it is the last minute. We didn’t understand many decisions from the referee. All such decisions normally go against us. I’m really disappointed with some of the referees. They are always against us. I’m tired and we are forced to fight against that kind of decisions as well. I try to think it was not done on purpose<br /><br />We have always tried to play football until the last 3-4 minutes. The other team does not want to go forward and only tried to clear the balls. The pitch was not in a good condition and it is an advantage for them at the end. They were happy with one point. I don’t like that kind of teams who sit and defend. But one has to wonder why Chennai don’t want to play for a win at home<br /><br />Udanta <b>[Singh]</b> and Daniel <b>[Lalhlimpuia]</b> only need to play more and they will develop. Unfortunately, the system in India allows players to mature very late. They need to play in intensive games. They have the technical quality but need to improve technically. They are on the way. They will be very important for India in the near future<br /><br />We don’t want to change our priorities in terms of performances. We will be ready for the AFC Cup. We were the finalists last year. We want to have a high level this year. We have been one of the top teams in India. We will do the best in all competitions. Our performances are getting better. We are far off the title but we will take it game by game and fight till the last</p>

  <p><b>[Albert Roca - Bengaluru FC need to create more chances]</b> Bengaluru cannot afford to see even as far as the second game. We cannot go in to tomorrow’s game thinking what will happen in the AFC Cup game. We know that if we play well and win, we will have better chances in the second game as well. Our mind is fixed on the first game. <b>[About title hopes]</b> As I said, we see only the next game. So we want to take three points against Mohun Bagan and give our supporters the joy they deserve.<br /><br />We need to be more aggressive. Especially in the box. Our strikers need to score more goals. We are generating a lot of chances. Unfortunately, the final touch is missing. The most important thing is to score. We have conceded chances that the opponents punish us from despite not making many chances. But that is football. But we’re still in the league and the cup, we have not given up.<br /><br />No coach likes that kind of scheduling. Everybody wants time to train properly, to prepare well. For me it is the same. But I don’t have that time. We have to accept the rules though, it’s the same for everybody. But for the nation it is time to see that this isn’t the right way, playing four games in ten days. Even for the people coming to watch the game, that isn’t good. It’s not an excuse, but something the federation has to see in the future<br /><br />We would have preferred he had come to us in better shape and condition, but that is not the case. It would have been good it he had come earlier, but circumstances weren’t that way. We have made a plan for him and are working with him on that. I think he has enough quality as he has shown in training sessions, but in the game, he looks out of his best condition. We look forward to have him help us in a short time<br /><br />We are not happy with the refereeing, that’s the truth. We are not happy with the performance of a few referees against us. But it is not an excuse. We have to try our best to score goals. If we score goals, this will be out of our minds. You saw Barcelona the other day, they wouldn’t have reached the quarter-final if the referee had not made the big mistakes against Paris Saint-Germain. So that happens, but Barcelona were creating a lot of chances. We are not Barcelona, but we want to create a lot of chances as well</p>

  <p><b>[Albert Roca - Bengaluru FC tried everything, what else could we have done?]</b> About mentality, it’s always the same. My team goes out to try and win the game. But there’s something, a little bit lacking, some quality in the final third. Today was a hard game, Mohun Bagan are a very good team. We tried, but it was difficult, and the final result is fair<br /><br />Nishu did a very good job in the last two games. He’s a 19-year-old guy, like Udanta Kumam and Daniel Lalhlimpuia. We have to give them time and opportunities to play these kind of big games so they learn and grow. He picked up a yellow in the first half, so couldn’t go all in after that. He can be an important player for the future<br /><br />We tried everything, we went to three defenders, two strikers up front, Sunil <b>[Chhetri]</b> behind them. What else could we have done? We cannot put twenty players. We were generating chances but it is difficult when there are two banks of four and they were refusing to attack<br /><br />What do you think? <b>[Laughs]</b> I cannot talk too much about the referees. We have seen decisions that change the destiny of the game. I cannot understand how that happens. Sunil was brought down in the box - that should have been a penalty, maybe even a red card. But the referee decided nothing. I have to be honest, also the goal of Mohun Bagan that the referee did not allow. Was it a handball? I don’t know, I will have to see. I cannot talk too much about the referees</p>

  <p><b>[Bengaluru FC’s Albert Roca - ‘We know we are out of title contention but we will try to win’]</b> Motivation is to play against Mohun Bagan. It’s a team that everybody respects and this is a big motivation. We know we are out of title contention but we will try to win that game for sure. It is a little advantage to them. In four days we have an important game in Maldives. We will have to manage the situation and play with a team tomorrow that can win. It’s a difficult moment for us. Players are coming from the national team and we couldn’t prepare the way we wanted to before this game. My team had seven players in the national team. But it’s difficult to manage. I will try to press my players and make a good match.<br /><br />Football is like this. It cannot be that every team is winning all time, it will be very boring then. We have teams like Mohun Bagan and East Bengal in the competition. Bengaluru made changes - one is the coach. I understand it’s not always easy to build something. I have been here even not one year ago. I have tried to move things and make changes<br /><br />We have had more opportunities to score. But it has not happened like that. It’s my mistake. But when we try to change things, it’s not so easy. We want to be more balanced, on the way to keep the ball and have possession but also create more chances to score<br /><br />It’s gonna be difficult tomorrow. They have to get three points and want to finish top. We are expecting a difficult game but we are current champions. We will try to do our best for our supporters and for the team. We have a lot of respect for Mohun Bagan and their history. But we have to be competitive. We will do our best<br /><br />Mohun Bagan has a good balance between defence and attack. Sony is one of the best foreigners in the league</p>

  <p><b>[Bengaluru FC manager Albert Roca cautious ahead of 4.25 SC clash]</b> To be honest, I would like more time to prepare. When you see the circumstances, you cannot do anything. You know the draft has been made on the 23rd July and we started training on the 26th. We had less than one month time with a new squad. We have to create the same feeling as we had in the last part of the season. It is not easy. I count on the attitude of the players. They have the motivation and are hungry<br /><br /><b>[Speaking about lack of preparation time and their pre-season in Spain]</b> You would like more time. The easy thing is to kick the ball and just run. I come from where I come from. I don’t understand football without playing on the floor. For others, it’s always a chance. It’s a shift of levels and it takes time. It’s a question of having more training sessions and quality of foreigners can help. I am sure Indians have shown good level in the I-League and the ISL and are ready for the challenge. The friendly games in Spain was important because the team that we will face will have the same orientation or even better than what we face tomorrow. Then you realize your weak points and strong points when you play against top teams. The idea is to put our players under pressure<br /><br /><b>[On John Johnson]</b> We have to accept it. We are really happy with John but we are also happy with the players competing tomorrow. Everyone is focused on that<br /><br />We have seen some videos. They are quite powerful to put us in trouble. There is no cinema in DPR Korea, so they can train three times a day! They have a good organization, the team is really united. They have worked in that system for a long time. But it is football. You just have to play. What I said earlier is that we need motivation. My first goal is to see that our boys are mentally strong</p>
