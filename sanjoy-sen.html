  <p>[Mohun Bagan head coach Sanjoy Sen earlier in the day had expressed his wish to play there as opposed to the artificial turf in Barasat] It is always good to play on a grass turf as chances of an injury are less for all the players. These are things beyond my hand but all I know that our players are focused and we know how well-drilled and technically adept Lajong players are given the fact that Thangboi Singto has been there for a long time.</p>

  <p>[Kolkata giants Mohun Bagan have grappled out two wins in their two opening I-League 2017 fixtures and] Saying that we will go to nine points is easy but we have to walk the talk on the pitch. We have brainstormed after the Lajong match and that is, of course, our target to win and get momentum ahead of the away games<br /><br />I have seen them on the telly. Manandeep [Singh] and Joel Sunday are good strikers. They have a good right wing half in Victor Amobi. Arashpreet [Singh] and Loveday [Eyinnaya] are good centre-backs. Ravi Kumar, the goalkeeper was with me earlier so I know some of them<br /><br />Yes, he was coaching in another age-group in my AIFF U-13 academy days under the guidance of Colm Toal. In fact, many of the current Minerva players had come for trials in their younger days. I remember Manandeep Singh, Ravi Kumar, Simranjeet Singh and Souvick Das clearly. This was eight-nine years ago. Things have changed since then and they have a lot of youngsters coming in<br /><br />There could be [a similarity between the styles of play]. I believe in playing a 4-4-2 and he does too. Many coaches around the world don’t like it though. Look at Arsenal where Arsene Wenger had been playing this for the last 16 or so years. Some like playing a back three system. Antonio Conte has brought this 3-4-3 from Italy into Chelsea and they are tasting success. For me and my boys, we are not ready to metamorph into such a system. I don’t like to experiment too much and follow a set pattern</p>

  <p>[Mohun Bagan are currently on an unbeaten run of six games in the I-League] The title race is not going to be Bagan vs Bengaluru. Lots of teams are yet to settle. There’s going to be competition. Teams like Chennai and Churchill are improving. They will only get better. If we’re going to win, we should treat every match as important. We’re not thinking about last three matches. It is not going to be easy. We have to fight for every ball and expect a tight match.<br /><br />We are playing two away matches now. We want to get six points from these matches. We don’t have any injury concerns in our travelling squad. If you have a proper squad, injuries are not a problem. If somebody is injured we have other players ready<br /><br />Every session we have to learn. There’s a lot of space to improve. Even though we scored 4 goals against Punjab, we’ve done things wrong and maybe we will correct them. I wanted a video analyst in my technical staff. At the end, we can analyse whether it is a success but it helps us a lot right now<br /><br />We want Indian football to move up, whether it’s ISL or I-League. Players [have to] look after their careers, whether they are playing in the ISL or the I-League. It’s good that the AIFF [All India Football Federation] is trying to clear the air over what’s to be done for the future. Maybe, in 2017, we’ll have a better picture</p>

  <p>[Draw between DSK Shivajians and Mohun Bagan. Sanjoy Sen felt that his side was poor in the first half and improved after the break] Actually, the game was very good. There were ups and downs. Both sides got chances and missed them. We struggled in the first half but we came back strongly in the second half. We could have won the game also - [Katsumi] Yusa missed a sitter, [Subashish] Bose struck the post. Same thing happened to them also and we did not concede thankfully.<br /><br />In this league, you are always going to lose points but the important thing is keeping on trying to win<br /><br />[On Sony Norde] [Sony] Norde did not have any fitness issue. He was running with the ball but struggled in the game. It happens to any player.<br /><br />It’s good that we had to face tough games. When we struggle and somehow manage to win, it is good for us</p>

  <p>[Sanjoy Sen returns to the action along with Mohun Bagan after opting not to travel for the away leg] Definitely we will start from zero. This is a must win situation for us. We will try to win handsomely. What I have heard is that we could have won by a number of goals but it didn’t happen last time around.<br /><br />I don’t believe in rotation. I gave some of the players rest. Within ten days we have to play four five matches in the league, so I have to rest players<br /><br />Let us win the match and then we can think of Bengaluru. We drew with Mohun Bagan at home 1-1. We do hope that we gave them a good fight and hopefully we can play a good match here away<br /><br />What I have heard is that they came back strongly after they were down by a goal. This shows the character of the team so we have to be cautious about that but we will look to win the match</p>

  <p>[Mohun Bagan’s Sanjoy Sen - Not interested in what East Bengal have done] Today or tomorrow we were going to lose in the league. We were punished for the way we defended today. If you defend like that, you don’t deserve to win. We have to come back strongly. When we won the I-League, we lost three matches. I am not interested on what East Bengal has done. We have to play there [in the northeastern region] and do well. I am not interested on what is going around outside the pitch</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Sanjoy Sen - ‘Mohun Bagan have to win six of the remaining seven matches’] We have to work on our defense. We will analyse but I have nothing to add. Mistakes happen. We have to pick out and prevent the mistakes and I would say that the full backs should have stopped the crosses from the wings.<br /><br />We played very well today. We passed, played through the wings, we would be commended if we scored but we didn’t<br /><br />Jeje missed three sitters. But there are times when he easily converts half chances. Meanwhile Sony looked much strong compared to the other matches. After the injury, it seems he is slowly coming back into his groove<br /><br />It’s tough but it’s possible. We are in the championship and we will do it</p>

<h4 id="2017-03-10-retrieve">2017 03 10 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>[Sanjoy Sen - I-League is the first priority for Mohun Bagan, not AFC Cup] Our sole priority is to get three points. In the last two matches, we lost five points. It is very important for us to pick three points to stay in the fight for the championship. Definitely I-League is the priority. Even when we play in the AFC Cup match, it won’t be without a fight. We will put out the full strength squad and try to win. But among the two competitions, I-League is our first priority.<br /><br />In both of the last two games we took the lead only to fail to win the game. There is no pressure. Of course, being Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, and Bengaluru FC these days, you always have the pressure to win the title<br /><br />I always respect Bengaluru and was supporting them when they reached the AFC Cup final. I always say that Bengaluru have been the model for all the other clubs to follow over the last three years. This season their graph hasn’t been that good. But they’re a very good side and on their day can beat any team</p>
