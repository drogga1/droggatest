  <p><b>[Mohun Bagan head coach Sanjoy Sen earlier in the day had expressed his wish to play there as opposed to the artificial turf in Barasat]</b> It is always good to play on a grass turf as chances of an injury are less for all the players. These are things beyond my hand but all I know that our players are focused and we know how well-drilled and technically adept Lajong players are given the fact that Thangboi Singto has been there for a long time.</p>

  <p><b>[Kolkata giants Mohun Bagan have grappled out two wins in their two opening I-League 2017 fixtures and]</b> Saying that we will go to nine points is easy but we have to walk the talk on the pitch. We have brainstormed after the Lajong match and that is, of course, our target to win and get momentum ahead of the away games<br /><br />I have seen them on the telly. Manandeep <b>[Singh]</b> and Joel Sunday are good strikers. They have a good right wing half in Victor Amobi. Arashpreet <b>[Singh]</b> and Loveday <b>[Eyinnaya]</b> are good centre-backs. Ravi Kumar, the goalkeeper was with me earlier so I know some of them<br /><br />Yes, he was coaching in another age-group in my AIFF U-13 academy days under the guidance of Colm Toal. In fact, many of the current Minerva players had come for trials in their younger days. I remember Manandeep Singh, Ravi Kumar, Simranjeet Singh and Souvick Das clearly. This was eight-nine years ago. Things have changed since then and they have a lot of youngsters coming in<br /><br />There could be <b>[a similarity between the styles of play]</b>. I believe in playing a 4-4-2 and he does too. Many coaches around the world don’t like it though. Look at Arsenal where Arsene Wenger had been playing this for the last 16 or so years. Some like playing a back three system. Antonio Conte has brought this 3-4-3 from Italy into Chelsea and they are tasting success. For me and my boys, we are not ready to metamorph into such a system. I don’t like to experiment too much and follow a set pattern</p>

  <p><b>[Mohun Bagan are currently on an unbeaten run of six games in the I-League]</b> The title race is not going to be Bagan vs Bengaluru. Lots of teams are yet to settle. There’s going to be competition. Teams like Chennai and Churchill are improving. They will only get better. If we’re going to win, we should treat every match as important. We’re not thinking about last three matches. It is not going to be easy. We have to fight for every ball and expect a tight match.<br /><br />We are playing two away matches now. We want to get six points from these matches. We don’t have any injury concerns in our travelling squad. If you have a proper squad, injuries are not a problem. If somebody is injured we have other players ready<br /><br />Every session we have to learn. There’s a lot of space to improve. Even though we scored 4 goals against Punjab, we’ve done things wrong and maybe we will correct them. I wanted a video analyst in my technical staff. At the end, we can analyse whether it is a success but it helps us a lot right now<br /><br />We want Indian football to move up, whether it’s ISL or I-League. Players <b>[have to]</b> look after their careers, whether they are playing in the ISL or the I-League. It’s good that the AIFF <b>[All India Football Federation]</b> is trying to clear the air over what’s to be done for the future. Maybe, in 2017, we’ll have a better picture</p>

  <p><b>[Draw between DSK Shivajians and Mohun Bagan. Sanjoy Sen felt that his side was poor in the first half and improved after the break]</b> Actually, the game was very good. There were ups and downs. Both sides got chances and missed them. We struggled in the first half but we came back strongly in the second half. We could have won the game also - <b>[Katsumi]</b> Yusa missed a sitter, <b>[Subashish]</b> Bose struck the post. Same thing happened to them also and we did not concede thankfully.<br /><br />In this league, you are always going to lose points but the important thing is keeping on trying to win<br /><br /><b>[On Sony Norde]</b> <b>[Sony]</b> Norde did not have any fitness issue. He was running with the ball but struggled in the game. It happens to any player.<br /><br />It’s good that we had to face tough games. When we struggle and somehow manage to win, it is good for us</p>

  <p><b>[Sanjoy Sen returns to the action along with Mohun Bagan after opting not to travel for the away leg]</b> Definitely we will start from zero. This is a must win situation for us. We will try to win handsomely. What I have heard is that we could have won by a number of goals but it didn’t happen last time around.<br /><br />I don’t believe in rotation. I gave some of the players rest. Within ten days we have to play four five matches in the league, so I have to rest players<br /><br />Let us win the match and then we can think of Bengaluru. We drew with Mohun Bagan at home 1-1. We do hope that we gave them a good fight and hopefully we can play a good match here away<br /><br />What I have heard is that they came back strongly after they were down by a goal. This shows the character of the team so we have to be cautious about that but we will look to win the match</p>

If you defend like that, you don’t deserve to win. We have to come back strongly. When we won the I-League, we lost three matches. I am not interested on what East Bengal has done. We have to play there <b>[in the northeastern region]</b> and do well. I am not interested on what is going around outside the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Sanjoy Sen - ‘Mohun Bagan have to win six of the remaining seven matches’]</b> We have to work on our defense. We will analyse but I have nothing to add. Mistakes happen. We have to pick out and prevent the mistakes and I would say that the full backs should have stopped the crosses from the wings.<br /><br />We played very well today. We passed, played through the wings, we would be commended if we scored but we didn’t<br /><br />Jeje missed three sitters. But there are times when he easily converts half chances. Meanwhile Sony looked much strong compared to the other matches. After the injury, it seems he is slowly coming back into his groove<br /><br />It’s tough but it’s possible. We are in the championship and we will do it</p>

  <p><b>[Sanjoy Sen - I-League is the first priority for Mohun Bagan, not AFC Cup]</b> Our sole priority is to get three points. In the last two matches, we lost five points. It is very important for us to pick three points to stay in the fight for the championship. Definitely I-League is the priority. Even when we play in the AFC Cup match, it won’t be without a fight. We will put out the full strength squad and try to win. But among the two competitions, I-League is our first priority.<br /><br />In both of the last two games we took the lead only to fail to win the game. There is no pressure. Of course, being Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, and Bengaluru FC these days, you always have the pressure to win the title<br /><br />I always respect Bengaluru and was supporting them when they reached the AFC Cup final. I always say that Bengaluru have been the model for all the other clubs to follow over the last three years. This season their graph hasn’t been that good. But they’re a very good side and on their day can beat any team</p>

  <p><b>[Mohun Bagan’s Sanjoy Sen - Defeat to Bengaluru FC won’t signal end of title challenge]</b> Even if they field a lighter side, we also have to play against Dhaka’s Abahani in three day’s time. We already know that they are a sufficiently strong side. I don’t know what lineup will they field, we will be in our full strength and try to win the game. We have to overcome adversities. We have been able to overcome the obstacles, be it the flight journeys between AFC Cup games and I-League games or be it the international break.<br /><br />There is nothing to speak much ahead of an important game. We have to perform on the field and win. It is one of the crucial games of the season. There is nothing new about Bengaluru FC. They are one of the strongest sides in the I-League. It is a tough game for us and we are in a tough place at the moment. We have to prove our doubters wrong and win three points<br /><br />They have proper players for all positions, <b>[Cameron]</b> Watson has been superb. Udanta <b>[Singh]</b> is growing everyday. They know what style we play and we know theirs. Our strikers did not capitalise in the last game therefore it was goalless, now they have to understand the importance of the game and seize the opportunity<br /><br />There is nothing to see or judge. He has had a long tiring flight journey. He needs rest. He is in the 18 man squad for sure but I am yet to decide if we are going to start with him or not.<br /><br />They arrived late and I did not ask them to train yesterday. The biggest thing is that they have played well against tough oppositions and now they are in a condition to play as well. Whatever training they do today should be followed up by proper rest. Rest is very important for them now<br /><br />We have been training for that and there have been many instructions given to them. Probably they are not able to carry them out during the game. Sometimes, they surprise me by their own tactics. The players know what to do in important games<br /><br />I do not think losing tomorrow is an option and it will mean the end of the title challenge for us. I have a feeling 34-35 points will probably be the target for the winning team this time, and we will still be in a position to achieve that<br /><br />May God bless him.

  <p><b>[Sanjoy Sen - Unlike Bengaluru FC, Mohun Bagan have a stake at winning every game]</b> Winning today was important but we still have five more games. There is a lot of road left to cover. It was nothing superb or extraordinary. We needed a turnaround and that was the most important. All departments from defense to the forwards and midfield were pleasing to the eye.<br /><br />People questioned if the international break would break the rhythm but for me the break was important as we did not have a great few games before that and the 14-day break provided rest to the injured players. Look at Sehnaj Singh, he had an injury and thanks to the break he performed exceedingly well today<br /><br />We too did not play Balwant and Jeje giving importance to the AFC Cup. Indian internationals did play. Vineeth, Daniel played and there are more India players in their squad than ours. We scored four goals when Sunil Chhetri played. We won 2-0 away when Chhetri played. We just lost this season in the AFC Cup but that is okay. That is a part of the game. It is their wish whom they want to play and bench. Our wish was to win. We won<br /><br />Bengaluru also have to play the AFC Cup and they have planned accordingly. We also have to plan like that. We are not Bengaluru FC because Mohun Bagan still have a stake winning every game. The space for errors are less<br /><br />Azharuddin Mallick pulled off the weight of the Mohun Bagan jersey with ease. Never looked like an Under-22 player playing. I did not want to play Jeje <b>[Lalpekhlua]</b> and Balwant <b>[Singh]</b> but it was important they played for the last 10-15 minutes<br /><br /><b>[On Sony Norde]</b> I talked to Sony after training yesterday. He wanted to sleep and when he woke up he was raring to go. Why not put him in<br /><br />I won’t single out individuals but no doubt Sony is one of the best players playing in India. We have played well as a team. If we played better, we will achieve something more important</p>

  <p><b>[Sanjoy Sen - Mohun Bagan are playing for three points against Abahani Limited Dhaka]</b> We are playing for three points. Yes there will be two three changes but the players are motivated to do well. No idea about them. We have to be cautious for the first fifteen to twenty minutes when we take to the field. Sony might not know all the players because it was three seasons ago when he played there. But I will definitely talk to him once we get to know their squad list.<br /><br />I was proud of my time at Churchill Brothers where I defeated Mohun Bagan 2-1 in the IFA Shield<br /><br />It has been tough for me to build the team but we have made some signing and looking to add some more. We have to play well because we have the opportunity to come top of the group<br /><br />I am not seeing this as a dress rehearsal for the Derby. I do not care about it now</p>

  <p><b>[Sanjoy Sen - Mohun Bagan won’t drop out of title race if we lose to East Bengal]</b> We are confident. We started dropping points after drawing against East Bengal in the last derby. We need to maintain consistency, the one part we have been lacking in throughout the season. We are not in a better position, we are trying to go to a better position by winning the derby. I don’t know if East Bengal are underdogs. I just know how important the game is for us. It’s not my headache what they term the game for them for themselves. If we win, we will be in a much better position, But if we lose we won’t slide out of the title race<br /><br />Doesn’t matter what teams they have left to play. I told that the I-League will be the most toughest. The champions-elect, what the people focused as have been shoved out of the title race. I think no team is weak, be it Minerva, Chennai or Lajong. They have gone from strength to strength and sorted their teams out as the league has progressed. All the remaining games we have, all are important and tough for us. We have to show more character in playing these games<br /><br />People think we are ahead because we have played two games in the last week. But you cannot say all this especially in EB vs MB when other things revolve around the game more. No advantage because they had a gap. They planned according to their fixtures list. We have too<br /><br />They are strong. Last time I remember Wedson got too much space and we will try to correct that. We will prepare after we get the team list. We still have a lot of time to go.<br /><br />If we could have scored more in the away games, we would have been top of the league and gotten more than 26 points. But the league is also a different aspect. We also are unbeaten at home and people have played that up. We need to answer through the away games we play after this. We need to rectify the records. I know that we had to play a home game in Siliguri, so we were mentally prepared for the fact that East Bengal will have more supporters in the stands</p>

  <p><b>[Sanjoy Sen - Broke the myth that Mohun Bagan cannnot win in Siliguri]</b> No, we are not champions yet. The I-League will not be decided by this result alone. We just are in a better position than we were. Last year’s experience tells me that we had lost points in the hills <b>[Shillong Lajong]</b>. We were in a favourable position then before we dropped points in the hills and now we are going back there<br /><br />We have broken the myth that Mohun Bagan cannot win in Siliguri. I have come here to win the I-League and that is my first priority. To win the league you have to play till the last match. If we can’t win the league, then the derby victory will mean nothing<br /><br /><b>[Pointing to the next game at Shillong in three days]</b> Lajong is a good side. They have a good record in away games, better than us at least. Now, we have to replicate them and get points in away games. I cannot say that East Bengal are not in the title race because mathematically it is still possible. They can win their three games. The league can be won with 34-35 points. There is an outside chance. This win will only be a corridor to the league if we win it. Football is not played keeping ifs and buts as contingents<br /><br />East Bengal were outplayed in every department of the game. We could have easily fulfilled each Bagan fan’s longstanding wish to overturn the 5-0 loss of 1975 if Duffy had converted and others followed suit. In recent times, East Bengal have been a good opposition in the last few derbies and have given a good fight. But, today, they were nowhere<br /><br />Of course, the myth has been broken like in my coaching career I have never won in Mumbai and likewise it was for Siliguri. The performance was needed to break the myth. Credit goes to all the players for this. This win, of course, gave me a lot of satisfaction from the last season when I was confined to a small room and we were losing 2-1 and then Jeje missed a penalty<br /><br />The goal from Sony Norde was very much needed. If you do not score in a derby you haven’t made it in Kolkata football. He made up for that as it was lacking in his repertoire - a goal in the derby<br /><br /><b>[On Azharuddin Mallick]</b> I thank almighty God that Azhar scored tonight. I always wish that he scores whenever he plays. I do not know after how long a Bengali boy has scored in a Kolkata Derby but he has made Bengal proud</p>

  <p><b>[Sanjoy Sen says If that was not a penalty, then there shouldn’t be any penalty in football]</b> If you are disallowed a genuine penalty, frustration comes to the players’ minds. A ball striking the hand inside the penalty box - If that was not a penalty then there shouldn’t be any penalty in football. I don’t need to mention the name of any player but it is definitely a penalty. Their coach admitted after the match that the ball struck the hand so if the referee can’t see then you can’t help. Regarding how a penalty I’m not complaining whether it was a handball or not I’m not complaining but it was exposed. All the 6000-7000 crowd knew. Only the referee couldn’t see it.<br /><br />Maybe. But in the first half, they created a lot of chances and we were under pressure, definitely first 20-25 minutes we were definitely under pressure. Our players failed to adjust to the pitch, maybe the bounce of the ground but they slowly adapted and came back into the game and created chances but what I feel is that one point is also good for us<br /><br />Maybe, maybe. It happens all over the world and I told the boys after the East Bengal match we are going to play a more difficult match, Lajong match will be more difficult than this derby so I know what can happen. The boys tried their level best, they fought till the end. Even in the last 5 minutes, we created a number of chances but in football if you cannot score with the chances you get, you cannot win. Let’s see in the match against Minerva. I don’t know. This is not instant readymade coffee. we have to go to the dressing room and then talk with the physio and then we can answer these questions. There are no readymade answers for these kinds of questions on player’s injury<br /><br />Jose Mourinho, how many matches has he lost on their home ground? How many matches have they drawn in their home in Old Trafford, how many matches has he won? It happens to all the teams. The top coaches have no answer and I also have no answer why these things happen. One point is good for us okay</p>

I have to bring a player with me and they will have no rest and food after training but he has to attend all these formalities. I don’t know Indian football is going up or down. The organisers of the I-League need to ask themselves if this is the right time to hold the press conference. Hold it in the morning or in the evening. We finished training, reached the hotel, took a shower and I have to rush here. Otherwise, we will be fined or something else.<br /><br />Thank you for the cooperation. Okay. Thanks<br /><br />We won’t rotate heavily. We are also playing the AFC Cup games. That is our headache. We will have to travel to Aizawl next weekend. Maybe they will offer their ground ar 12 noon and we have to train there. No problem<br /><br />We got the fixtures long ago, but things like flights getting delayed are not in our hands.

  <p><b>[Mohun Bagan’s Sanjoy Sen - Will need to be cautious against Maziya S&amp;RC early on]</b> The I-League right now is not my headache. We have got an AFC Cup game to look forward to. I am more concerned about that. Expect more than a couple of changes. But, this game is not a distraction from the domestic league. We knew we had to play this match and we have prepared our minds for this accordingly. So, there should not be any issues.<br /><br />Today morning during training, not only the foreigners were rested but some Indian players were rested too. After they came back from Ludhiana, I asked them if they are ready to train. Some of them were fatigued and they opted out<br /><br />I think the team that will be playing tomorrow, that is also strong. The moment we got the fixtures, we had a chat with the boys. The players have enjoyed, performed well both in the I-League and AFC Cup despite the adversities surrounding lengthy journeys for away games. Sometimes, it is a worrying factor for us. But, somehow we have managed and tried to do our best.<br /><br />It’s not the case. There are many more matches left. This game’s result won’t decide the final standings. But, definitely, this is one of the important games. I look forward to it<br /><br />You can take it either way. Whatever the format it may be, it is a challenging prospect for Mohun Bagan as a team. Let’s see how we perform. We played them last year. I know the coach and the style of play maybe. Even when we played Abahani Limited, we didn’t know much about the team. So, we could be cautious and test out the first 15-20 minutes of the game<br /><br />Winning is a habit, so is losing. If we can win maximum matches, it gives a lot of confidence to the team</p>

We had a practice session yesterday to acclimatise ourselves with the ground and climate. It is nice here and unfortunately, I was not in the technical area last time but I felt the passion of the people here in Aizawl despite being in relegation zone last year. So it should be amazing tomorrow<br /><br /><b>[On Aizawl’s recent form]</b> My players know the importance of the game. In the previous game, they played Churchill Brothers and won. We had incidentally lost to them. Aizawl were very good in that game and they have won 10 out of 16 games. They’ve played very well. Aizawl have shown the way for all the north-eastern states players. Unfortunately, no one from Aizawl FC is in the Indian national team but in the future, I think many players will make it. I thought even last year they played very well and they reached the Federation Cup final. Now they are vying for the title<br /><br />I don’t care if our away form has been bad or not. All that is important is that we are on top of the table and when we won the I-League in 2014/15, we secured the game in an away game. So in football, it doesn’t matter. It’s a must-win situation for Aizawl. We can win the league even if we don’t beat them tomorrow</p>

No complaint for the weather and rain because both teams were playing in the same condition. Definitely we were better than Aizawl but the result does not always go that way and we have to accept it.<br /><br />We were the better team because first half Duffy missed a sitter and Jeje was not given a penalty. Aizawl did not create many chances too. We dominated most of the exchanges<br /><br />First of all congratulations to Aizawl FC. We tried our level best but luck was not with us. The ambience and support was outstanding. Obviously they wanted their home side to win but they were very sporting<br /><br />It’s a great achievement for Khalid because this is the first time he is out from Mumbai so it is nice that an Indian coach has gone so far. It is actually a proud moment for all Indian coaches and great for Indian football<br /><br />If we can win the last match, there is an outside chance to win the I-League.
