  <p><b>[Makwan Amirkhani answers when asked if there was anything impressive about his upcoming opponent Mike Wilkinson]</b> Yeah probably his girlfriend. Nothing else<br /><br /><b>[He said that Wilkinson has]</b> one week left, so he better enjoy it with his family, before I come to London and make everybody cry there<br /><br /><b>[Makwan Amirkhani answers when asked what it was like to train in Stockholm before his debut against Andy Ogle]</b> Everything is much better. I’m more dangerous and powerful, faster more handsome because I’m hanging out with my friends ins Sweden, and it’s like normal for them to look good, so I have to keep up with that</p>
