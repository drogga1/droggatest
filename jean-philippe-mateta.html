  <p><b>[Mainz striker Jean-Philippe Mateta says Ibrahimovic is up there with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> - but the arrogant thing doesn’t interest me]</b> <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> (was my idol growing up). I was looking for a tall striker who ran quickly, that showed technical skills, who can dribble. What did I like about him? His goalscoring side. All he did was score. After <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, he is the greatest goalscorer in history. There is no debate. What he has done, it is incredible. But, aside from that, everything outside of that, when he speaks to the press and does the whole arrogant thing, that doesn’t interest me<br /><br />There were several offers, but it was up to the club to decide. Given their position in the table, the club wanted me to stay so that we could stay up. My goal is to win trophies, win the Champions League, the World Cup, the Euro, the Olympic Games. Germany (is the ideal league), I like it. But it’s the project that interests me, not the club. I don’t have a club in my head. A club which competes at the top of the league, which has ambition. I’m 22 years old. I have to play. I have to score goals</p>
