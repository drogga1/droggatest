<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Atletico assistant German Burgos to leave and pursue head coach dream]</b> At the end of the current 2019-20 season I will take my first steps as a head coach. I think that with over 10 years’ experience in the first division, I’m fully qualified to manage a team. It will be influenced by those people who have made me who I am as a coach and a person. I carry them in my soul. Luis Aragones, Carlos Griguol, <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Marcelo Bielsa</a> … people who have influenced me. It’s a normal step for a second coach who wants to become a head coach<br /><br /><b>[On his relationship with <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a>]</b> He’s a friend, we’ve known each other for such a long time. We understand each other with gestures, without gestures, with a glance, with a nod of the head. I’ve said this before but I’ve had lunch and dinner more times with <a href="diego-simeone.html">El Cholo</a> than with my own family. We’ve been together eight years in the Argentina national team, several years at <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> as players and eight years here as coaches. It’s a lot of time.<br /><br /><b>[Burgos spoke about his favourite moments at Atletico]</b> The celebrations at the Fountain of Neptune, those red and white rivers and there are two specific moments - the first one was when <a href="diego-simeone.html">El Cholo</a> and I hugged when we won the league. That first hug, then there’s that last hug we had in the changing rooms at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> <b>[when Atleti defeated <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in the last 16 of this season’s Champions League]</b>. And - listen to this - we owe ourselves the third one when we win the Champions League, because we have goals to be achieved.</p>
