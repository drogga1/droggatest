  <p><b>[on <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>]</b> The name <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> generates great interest as he is a legend and an icon. He has been a fantastic ambassador for football, not only in England but all around the world; he is a fan’s player and wherever he goes he captures the supporters’ and media’s attention. His legs may have gone lately but he produced some fantastic memories for England and that goal against Greece <b>[to take England into the 2002 World Cup]</b> sends shivers down my spine every time I think about it. He took responsibility as a footballer and is a great role model</p>

  <p><b>[The myth of Maradona: Was ‘Hand of God’ goal integral to Diego’s legacy?]</b> He came in and he was the last person we wanted to see. He didn’t speak English and I didn’t speak Spanish but when I asked him whether he had used the head or the hand, he pointed to his head. Maybe that was because it was a small room and he feared us because there were three Englishmen and we weren’t very happy! He probably took the safe option but that irritated me even more. If he had come in and said, ‘It was my hand and I apologise’, then I would probably have only hit him four or five times rather than the 20 I felt like. But I would pay a few thousand pounds to be in that room after the match again… Let’s just put it like that</p>
