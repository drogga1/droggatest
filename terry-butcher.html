  <p><b>[on <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>]</b> The name <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> generates great interest as he is a legend and an icon. He has been a fantastic ambassador for football, not only in England but all around the world; he is a fan’s player and wherever he goes he captures the supporters’ and media’s attention. His legs may have gone lately but he produced some fantastic memories for England and that goal against Greece <b>[to take England into the 2002 World Cup]</b> sends shivers down my spine every time I think about it. He took responsibility as a footballer and is a great role model</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham striker Harry Kane is the most logical option to captain England at the 2018 World Cup]</b> I think there will always be pressure on him when you look at the number of goals he’s scored for both Tottenham and for England too. So, why not make him captain? I think he thrives on pressure, I don’t think Harry Kane worries about that. He gets on with it. He has hit the ground running with England and Spurs. If you provide him with chances, he is never afraid to shoot. He isn’t about scoring the perfect goal, he’ll happily score a scruffy goal, a mis-hit goal, do whatever you need to do to get a goal. He also leads the line so well, coming short, helping people go in behind, he is a good team player. I would like him as captain - he is young enough to be in a lot of England squads in the future so why not make him captain. Give him that pressure. He does respond well to that.<br /><br />With the way the team is shaping up in the friendlies, the way Gareth wants to play, his methods are coming across now. It is a good and reasonably young squad that is together, knows what they have to do and everybody knows their job. I think we are going into the World Cup very well prepared but the expectation level, for the first time, is low. It would be nice to win both games <b>[against Holland and Italy]</b> but as long as you can see some progress, cohesion, understanding and a good shape to the team, everyone will buy into it. It is important to have the right shape at club level but Gareth is very astute and knows what he wants. I think he will go with a back three. It is a good idea to introduce that, knowing you can easily revert to a back four. England are now quite pliable, which they have to be - in the past they have stuck to one and changed the personnel rather than the system. That will give England a lot of confidence</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd’s makeshift left-back concerns England legend Terry Butcher]</b> Ashley Young is my pet hate and the one area Gareth Southgate seems to have a blind spot. He seems to think that because he is a forward-thinking player with experience who has had a good season for Manchester United, he can do a job for England. Your wing-backs have to be quick going forward and quick in recovery. Young is neither, which makes him reluctant to go forward because he is worried about the amount of cover he is giving the centre-backs. That one area down our left-hand side could be our undoing. You saw that in the second half against Nigeria at Wembley. And at the World Cup, just one weakness can put you out of the tournament. Without a doubt, it is vital Danny Rose is fit to play in the tournament.</p>

  <p><b>[The myth of Maradona: Was ‘Hand of God’ goal integral to Diego’s legacy?]</b> He came in and he was the last person we wanted to see. He didn’t speak English and I didn’t speak Spanish but when I asked him whether he had used the head or the hand, he pointed to his head. Maybe that was because it was a small room and he feared us because there were three Englishmen and we weren’t very happy! He probably took the safe option but that irritated me even more. If he had come in and said, ‘It was my hand and I apologise’, then I would probably have only hit him four or five times rather than the 20 I felt like. But I would pay a few thousand pounds to be in that room after the match again… Let’s just put it like that</p>
