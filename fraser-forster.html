  <p><b>[Fraser Forster has got his sights set on becoming England’s number one goalkeeper, overhauling his country’s current incumbent <a href="joe-hart.html">Joe Hart</a>]</b> There’s obviously quite a lot of English keepers around at the minute, but I think if you look at <a href="joe-hart.html">Joe Hart</a> he’s the number one at the minute. He holds the shirt off the back of what he’s done this season and what he’s done previously for England. I want to one day be England’s number one but that will take a lot of hard work. I need to go out and play as well as I can for <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> and try to force my way onto that plane <b>[for Russia]</b>. If I play well then it puts the pressure on Joe to be performing week in week out, then ultimately the manager has to make a decision. It’s a huge season for everyone and for me as well so I think, for me, I just want to come back and hit the ground running and have a great season. I want to work as hard as I can and keep improving<br /><br />It’s obviously a crucial game that we want to win and we’re under no illusions how tough that game will be. It’s important we go to Scotland and get those three points</p>

  <p><b>[Fraser Forster has re-joined <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> on a season-long loan from <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>]</b> I’m absolutely delighted to be here, it feels like I’m coming home and I’m buzzing to be back at this great club. Now, I just want to get back training and get back playing. Obviously, I know what the number 67 means to this great club. It’s an honour to wear the shirt and an even bigger honour to wear this number. I loved my time here before and I felt like it was the right number for me, I’m really proud to wear it, and I want to do my absolute best for this club. The gaffer has always been brilliant with me, and when the opportunity came up to come back and work with him again, it was one that was too good to turn down. I’m delighted to be back - Woodsy is still here, and I know a lot of the lads, which is makes it feel like I’ve come back home. With that in mind, I hope I can fit straight back in</p>
