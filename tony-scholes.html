  <p><b>[Stoke City have completed the signing of West Brom striker Saido Berahino for a fee of £12 million]</b> It’s no secret that we have been looking to bring Saido to the club for a long time and to suggest that we are pleased to have finally concluded the deal is an understatement. We’ve signed a young English striker who has already proven his ability in the Premier League. After a frustrating period he’s now desperately keen to reignite his career and we look forward to seeing him do that with us.</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney continues to be linked with a summer move away from Manchester United]</b> What I can’t do is shed any light on where the rumours have come from. That happens at this time of year. We have some speculation, some of it is based upon some truth, no smoke without fire, but other times you get wild speculation, and the Wayne Rooney one falls into the latter category. Wayne Rooney has been one of the best players of his generation. He has been, and still is, a great football player. But there have been no conversations whatsoever about Wayne Rooney coming to Stoke.</p>

  <p><b>[Stoke City have announced the signing of Paris Saint-Germain forward Jese Rodriguez on a season-long loan]</b> Jese was a man in demand when PSG made it clear they would allow him to leave on loan and we’re delighted he has chosen to join us. He hasn’t had the happiest of periods in his career in Paris but he’s still only a young man and is hungry to make a big impression in the Premier League. His pedigree speaks for itself and he will most certainly add to the firepower at our disposal.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Stoke City defender Dionatan Teixeira has died of a suspected heart attack at the age of 25]</b> Dionatan was a hugely popular member of our squad and it’s difficult to comprehend that he has passed away at such a young age. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his young family and friends at such a difficult time</p>
