<blockquote>
  <p>Turkey’s offensive in northern Syria has exposed President <a href="recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Recep Tayyip Erdoğan</a> to a furious international backlash, with threats of arms embargoes, sanctions that could tank his vulnerable economy and daily, stinging condemnations from Western allies. But in Turkey, where <a href="recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Erdogan</a>’s voice dominates, the military campaign has generated little public debate. Turkish celebrities and athletes have rallied behind the military. Opposition parties have been broadly supportive. Flag-waving Turks greet soldiers in border towns as they prepare for battle, and the news media memorializes <a href="recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Erdogan</a>’s utterances in headlines<br /><br />The stated goal of the mission is to clear Syrian Kurdish fighters from northern Syria, a pledge <a href="recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Erdogan</a> has made repeatedly to the Turkish public. Ankara considers the fighters terrorists because of their links to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which has fought a decades-long insurgency inside Turkey. The security establishment in Turkey shares <a href="recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Erdogan</a>’s goal and has carried out regular attacks on PKK fighters in northern Iraq for years, albeit with far less fanfare, Soli Ozel said<br /><br /><a href="recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Erdogan</a> says he intends to relocate hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees in Turkey to whatever slice of territory Turkish forces carve out of Syria. The plan is largely motivated by domestic politics: During elections, including recent municipal polls, Turkish voters have registered dissatisfaction with <a href="recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Erdogan</a>’s ruling party for its years-long support of Syrian refugees, which has entailed providing millions of migrants with access to state services<br /><br />The government has bristled at rare instances of internal dissent. When members of a pro-Kurdish political party tried to march in Istanbul on Sunday, nine people were detained. And when Mustafa Akinci, the pro-Turkish president of North Cyprus, wrote on social media that Turkey’s offensive would be bloody and called for ‘dialogue and diplomacy,’ he was denounced by senior Turkish officials, including <a href="recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Erdogan</a>.<br /><br />Hakan Demir, the website editor for Birgun, a daily newspaper, was detained last week after publishing a story that reprinted a statement by the Syrian Kurdish fighters who are the target of the Turkish offensive. The authorities came for him at 4 a.m. Thursday, when Demir was up watching the television show ‘Hannibal,’ he said. He was released later that day but is still being investigated, he said in an interview.</p>
