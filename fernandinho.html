He has done really well in pre-season and in the first few games he’s played in the Premier League. He’s tall, technically very good and he’s going to help us a lot this season and for the future<br /><br /><b>[Having to fight to play each week is a reality that seems to suit the former Shakhtar Donetsk man]</b> Normally, it’s human nature to relax once you’ve achieved your targets. This is going to be hard for us and we’re going to keep the guys’ heads up and keep moving forward. We must dig deep in the dressing room and not just rely on Pep to push us. We don’t just have a group of great players - we have a great group of human beings and this makes a huge difference. I think we all realise that in every training session and match we play, we have to improve, play great football and win our games because we want to win many more titles</p>

It wasn’t the way I wanted to come in, but in football these things can happen. Whatever the manager needs, I’m ready. It’s a different position, a different role now, and we’ll see.

I’m here to help so that’s fine. As for the future, we will see what happens. It’s better to think about now. Sometimes experience can help, even if you don’t play - talking to the players, helping to fix some things. This is the best way to be in the team, helping wherever you can<br /><br /><b>[Fernandinho, though, says he is still learning the role]</b> I’m still in an adaptation process. It’s something new for me although I did know since the end of last season that playing as a centre-back was a possibility. I’ve started training it from the beginning of this season so it’s still new, but I’m trying to learn from that experience. The way we play makes it a bit easier because we keep the ball with us most minutes. But when an opponent attacks more through crosses or behind-the-line runs… let’s see how I’m going to perform</p>

  <p><b>[Fernandinho insists he is happy playing at centre-back for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> at the moment]</b> Pep asked me if I would help him and I agreed to it. I said it wouldn’t be a problem because I’ve always been able to play in multiple positions throughout my career. After <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>’s arrival, my position varied more often; I played as a right-back, right-midfielder and a midfielder on the left too. As a holding midfielder, a left-back and a centre-back on both sides. So the only positions I haven’t played in under Pep are the three attacking ones and as a keeper<br /><br /><b>[Fernandinho added on learning to play in different positions as a youngster back in his homeland]</b> In Brazil, it’s very common for players to play on the street in barefoot. They get plastic balls or whatever they can find and use their imagination to create a game of football. Sometimes I’d start in goal because I was the youngest, then I played in the backline. Sometimes I would play in midfield and attack and we would rotate so we could play in every position whilst having fun at the same time. That helped me a lot when I started to train to become a professional footballer<br /><br /><b>[The City ace will come up against his former club Shakhtar Donetsk at the Etihad in the Champions League on Tuesday]</b> It’s pretty cool to take on a former club. Every time we take on Shakhtar they are difficult games, I am sure the next one will be no different</p>

We will see how long I keep playing too. To be honest I don’t think about that now. Of course I want to keep playing, but I don’t put on myself that I will play until 40 or something. I will play as long as I feel good and I can give a good performance back to the team. You have to look after yourself too and it’s the best way to perform.<br /><br />We have a player who played for so many years in Germany and then after in Brazil, played until he was 43. <a href="ze-roberto.html">Ze Roberto</a> is his name.

He was a winger, left back, midfielder, played for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, so many different positions as well. He was an inspiration for me because he was a top player and played at a high level until he was 43. As I said, I don’t want to say I will go on until then because we don’t know what will happen tomorrow, but I am happy and this happiness is making me keep playing and perform better<br /><br /><b>[Fernandinho joined City from Shakhtar Donetsk for £34 million ($44m) in the summer of 2013 and has gone on take in 270 appearances for the club]</b> I am feeling good, feeling confident. I’m happy to be playing in this position, to be playing alongside these players and of course this is motivation for me to stay in that way. I think this change has helped me grow up as a player. When you play in certain different positions you can understand the game better and try to help the other team-mates as well. I know what role the holding midfielder should do, the centre-back playing left or right and the full-back, it’s all really clear in my head. I think this has helped me get better. I think I adapted myself, playing the way I played. Sometimes we have a specific way to play, that’s all.<br /><br />So playing in defence, it opens your mind, especially under Pep because you can understand the game easier. We have a lot of meetings about tactics, positioning, how you have to move the ball, how you have to pass the ball, which player is free and which player you have to man mark. It helped me. For me, it doesn’t matter playing midfield or centre-back. Of course when I’m in good form and fitness, then my performance helps the team as well</p>

  <p><b>[Fernandinho gives insight into <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>’s meticulous planning]</b> I always say that the difference between him and the other coaches I’ve had during my time in football is that he looks at the smallest details. He gives you the information you need about the opponent and of course about yourself, and he spends a lot of time looking at where to find spaces and where to close spaces to create difficulties for the opponent. That’s important because the game we see, as players and coaches, is a bit different from the public who go to the stadium or watch the games on TV. Those details help you to improve, to perform better and to help the team. I now have to talk to the guys in front of me, to tell them to keep going. That’s another of the ways he has helped me during this time. But also, the principle of the game is still the same. We like to play with the ball, and when we don’t have the ball, we try to recover it as soon as possible<br /><br />I think the biggest challenge of moving to centre-back for me was that, as a midfielder, you are used to running a lot in front. You go to the battle in the middle and you can lose the ball or you can win the ball. But at centre-back, you have a lot of space behind us, between the central defenders and the goalkeeper, and you have to pay attention to that because most of the teams who come to play against us look to play those kinds of balls behind the back four. For me, in the beginning, it was a little bit strange adapting to that, but afterwards, I was able to do it</p>
