  <p>[How Kepa Arrizabalaga rose from the Spanish third division to chase down De Gea] I already knew him from his time with the Under-15s and Under-18s. We had also faced him with Bilbao Athletic (the Athletic youth team). I asked for his signing at the beginning of the season, but could not make it happen until the winter transfer window. I spoke with him to get him to join the team as soon as possible. I told him ‘if you arrive on Wednesday you will play the next match against Racing Santander’ and he arrived on Tuesday. He is a great professional, even being so young as he was and he still is. He is a very nice guy, affable and with very clear ideas. I - and many people [at the club] - knew that he had a great future and we saw it happening before our own eyes.</p>
