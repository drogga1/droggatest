  <p><b>[The San Jose Earthquakes have hired Mikael Stahre as the club’s new head coach]</b> I am very proud to be the new head coach of the San Jose Earthquakes and for the opportunity to work with Jesse Fioranelli and the other members of the organization. I’m going to give everything I have to the Quakes and I am very excited about being a part of the future of the club.</p>

  <p><b>[The San Jose Earthquakes have signed Swedish Allsvenskan top scorer Magnus Eriksson as a designated player]</b> I have had the opportunity to coach with and against Magnus for many years in Sweden. I have known him since he was very young and even played a role in his decision to pursue a career in soccer instead of ice hockey. He is a very versatile player, capable of contributing from multiple positions, and will always work hard for his teammates. I’m looking forward to having him on my side once again this season.</p>

  <p><b>[Mikael Stahre has seen his team go six matches without a win after beginning the season with a victory against Minnesota United]</b> I’m super disappointed from the results perspective, but I think we played with structure and I think we played with lots of commitment. The only thing we can do is to analyze, go home, and practice and do it again with a little bit better performance. Ten percent more. It’s really hard now, having just one victory after eight games, so we need victories for sure, but the only thing we can do is to just move forward, analyze, practice harder and hopefully we can get the victory really soon.</p>
