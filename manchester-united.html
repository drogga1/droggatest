To do that we have invested heavily in the playing squad and will continue to do so. At the same time, the exciting pool of talent coming through from our youth and academy sections is a result of increased investment in this area over the last five years. It’s important to note that while our successful commercial operation helps drive that investment, the priority is the focus on achieving success on the pitch. Similarly, it is worth noting that we are not looking at or buying players based on their commercial appeal. We agree that recruitment is critical.

This process is significantly more effective than four or five years ago<br /><br /><b>[The statement added in respect of the club’s search for a sporting director]</b> We are continually reviewing and looking at the potential to evolve our structure on the football side. Much of the speculation around this type of role focuses purely on recruitment. We’ve materially expanded our recruitment department in recent years and we believe this runs in an efficient and productive way. Many of the senior staff in these roles have been at the club for over 10 years. Recruitment recommendations and decisions are worked on by this department and the manager and his team, not senior management. We feel the players signed this summer demonstrate that this approach is the right one and any future appointment would complement this process.

  <p><b>[Manchester United file complaint against the Sun in wake of <a href="edward-woodward.html">Ed Woodward</a> home attack]</b> Manchester United has made a formal complaint to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) regarding the Sun newspaper and its coverage of the attack on the house of executive vice-chairman <a href="edward-woodward.html">Ed Woodward</a>.<br /><br />The complaint relates to the story ‘Ed Devils: Man Utd fans throw flares at <a href="edward-woodward.html">Ed Woodward</a>’s house in shocking scenes as anti-board protests continue to escalate’ carried online and on the back page of the print edition dated 29 January 2020.<br /><br />The club believes that the Sun had received advance notice of the intended attack, which included criminal damage and intent to intimidate, and that the journalist was present as it happened. The quality of the images accompanying the story indicate that a photographer was also present. Not only did the journalist fail to discharge the basic duty of a responsible member of society to report an impending crime and avert potential danger and criminal damage, his presence both encouraged and rewarded the perpetrators.<br /><br />We believe this was a clear breach of both the Ipso editors’ code and journalistic ethics. The decision to make a formal complaint to Ipso was not taken lightly. We will await its ruling with keen interest as an important test of the self-regulatory system for newspapers and its ability to uphold ethical standards in the press</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd send gifts to academy players after ‘overwhelming’ reaction to life in lockdown]</b> I’m sure it has been a challenging time for you and your families. You will have had to adapt to a new way of living, create new routines, take care of vulnerable family members, cope with new and ever changing information in the media and also keep up to speed with the deadlines and work set by your school. From the perspective of the academy and its staff we have been overwhelmed with how you have all faced up to the challenge; shown a positive attitude and kept smiling, got creative, looked out for other people, shown bravery and demonstrated kindness<br /><br />What the last eight weeks has reminded the academy staff is that it’s so easy for us to get focused on passing drills, feedback meetings, signing registration forms, measuring your height, retain and release decisions, selecting tour squads … that we can lose track of how lucky we are to be surrounded by an amazing group of talented individuals. Not just talented players but talented people. Children who can speak languages, write poetry, carry out research, draw, paint, play music, look after their gran, keep fit, make videos, write letters, help their parents around the house, cook a meal, bake a cake, design their own training sessions and invent new skills. Academies don’t measure this stuff. But it is these things who make you who you are, and ultimately it will be these things that make you successful in life</p>
