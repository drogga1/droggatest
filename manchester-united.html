  <p><b>[Man United strike partnership with LGBT charity Stonewall. Ruth Hunt said]</b> Manchester United’s support means we can reach millions of football fans both here and around the world, to encourage them to do their part in making all people feel welcome in sport. It’s crucial for organisations like Manchester United to show they not only welcome LGBT people, but are active in leading the change. At the moment, many LGBT people want to take part in sport, either as players or fans, but the behaviour of a minority can make them feel unsafe, unwelcome or unable to be themselves. There’s so much work left to do to ensure that all LGBT people feel able to participate in sport, and we hope to see other clubs take Manchester United’s lead and join the Rainbow Laces campaign to make this a reality.</p>

With just two days to prepare for the visit of Everton in the next Premier League assignment, boss Jose Mourinho was clearly wasting no time in readying his troops.

While this is partially explained by football’s broadcasting boom, the internationalisation of the clubs’ commercial operations, their investment into privately-owned and modern facilities, and overall more sustainable management practices, are also key reasons for this growth. In terms of media rights value, the English Premier League sits comfortably at the top of European leagues, although other major leagues have outlined well-defined strategies to compete for the attention of global fans.</p>

We are consulting with MUST as part of that review.<br /><br />We would like to thank fans for their patience while we work through the uncertainties around timing of forthcoming games, with an aim of ensuring that fans are treated fairly.<br /><br />We look forward to the resumption of football when we are advised it is safe and appropriate. In the meantime our priority remains the health of fans, players, staff, and our wider communities. Our thoughts are with everyone affected by Covid-19, as well as those fighting in the front line against this virus on behalf of all of us, and we urge all our fans to continue following government advice.</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd send gifts to academy players after ‘overwhelming’ reaction to life in lockdown]</b> I’m sure it has been a challenging time for you and your families. You will have had to adapt to a new way of living, create new routines, take care of vulnerable family members, cope with new and ever changing information in the media and also keep up to speed with the deadlines and work set by your school. From the perspective of the academy and its staff we have been overwhelmed with how you have all faced up to the challenge; shown a positive attitude and kept smiling, got creative, looked out for other people, shown bravery and demonstrated kindness<br /><br />What the last eight weeks has reminded the academy staff is that it’s so easy for us to get focused on passing drills, feedback meetings, signing registration forms, measuring your height, retain and release decisions, selecting tour squads … that we can lose track of how lucky we are to be surrounded by an amazing group of talented individuals. Not just talented players but talented people. Children who can speak languages, write poetry, carry out research, draw, paint, play music, look after their gran, keep fit, make videos, write letters, help their parents around the house, cook a meal, bake a cake, design their own training sessions and invent new skills. Academies don’t measure this stuff. But it is these things who make you who you are, and ultimately it will be these things that make you successful in life</p>

O’Neill had tested negative in the previous five rounds of testing.

Assistant manager Billy McKinlay will take charge of training as the Potters prepare for their game against Reading on June 20.
