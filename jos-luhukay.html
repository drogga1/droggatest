  <p><b>[Manchester United are being heavily linked with a move for teenage frontman George Hirst]</b> It is a decision which George has to make himself. I think it’s very difficult if a club like Manchester United have interest in him to say no. George must decide how he sees his future. I respect that. But it is George’s decision at the end. Whether it is a good decision or not, I can’t answer that. The future for a young player is not so easy but it is important when you make a decision you stick by that 100 per cent. If George stays here, I will be unbelievably happy. But I must also accept and respect when George makes a decision for the future elsewhere.<br /><br />George is a fantastic player but I can’t say where his future is. How far he goes in the future, I can’t say. It is why he must look first at what is the next step for him. Is it the Championship with us or is it maybe the Premier League? You then must have a look at how his career is going. You must keep an eye on young players and then see what is the next step and how is the situation after one or two years and how is the direction. It’s very difficult to say now. George is only a young player in the Under-18s so you never know how it will go in the future. I hope for him it will go in a good way</p>

  <p><b>[Sheffield Wednesday vs Leeds United]</b> Last season and this season, the team (Leeds) had quality and a good mix. They are very strong in the transition. It is a team who are good and balanced and it will be a very hard game. We have our home game with the fans behind us. We must enjoy the game, hopefully with a good result and have a nice weekend.</p>

We played a strong opponent who caused us problems but Viktor’s was a good individual goal and finish</p>
