  <p><b>[Milan Skriniar understands Inter Milan’s decision to part company with <a href="luciano-spalletti.html">Luciano Spalletti</a> and believes his side will challenge to win Serie A under replacement <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> next season]</b> <a href="luciano-spalletti.html">Spalletti</a> is a great person and a great coach, but the club made its decision. Now there is <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>, there are new expectations and we want to challenge for the Scudetto. Last season was satisfactory because we got into the Champions League, but we can always do better. The results in the final weeks of the season weren’t what we wanted, but our objective was to finish in the top four and we achieved that.<br /><br /><b>[Prolific striker Mauro Icardi’s future remains unclear]</b> Icardi is a great player and a friend, so we’ll see what happens. If he remains here, then we’ll be happy about that. Godin will make the squad even more competitive and that is the most important thing</p>

  <p><b>[Intermilan defender Milan Skriniar says new manager <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> is the ideal appointment to break Juventus’s Serie A dominance and lead the team to victory in the Champions League]</b> The time has come to win. When you play with the Nerazzurri shirt you can’t be ok with finishing second. I dream of raising the Champions League trophy with Inter. Juve has been winning for eight years but the right time has come to try to get closer and beat them. We work hard to win and we can do it but now we have to work even harder. A new coach has arrived and we are all loaded, we can’t wait to start the new season in a big way. We must always aim at the maximum, without ever being satisfied. <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>? He has the right mindset. We are a strong team and we must work with the goal of winning. The coach explains us every detail, we have changed our way of doing things with respect to the past.<br /><br /><b>[One of <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>’s first acts as manager has been the capture of <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> defender Diego Godin, who has joined the club on a free transfer after his contract at the <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Wanda Metropolitano</a> expired]</b> I’ll have to adapt to the three-man defence but I’m not worried. Godin has the experience and the winning mentality that is needed. He is used to challenging and stopping top players, he is a really good transfer</p>

Centre-back Milan Skriniar played a full part in both matches and admits there are improvements to be made]</b> It has been a mixed week because we played not badly in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and here tonight too. We kept the ball and created chances, but were unable to score the goals. <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> are a strong side, we all knew that. We have a lot to improve and that’s the beauty of it - we are constantly learning and developing. I think we need to be more aggressive in our defending around the penalty area, as <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> were very dangerous there too with their passes. We need to get closer to the forwards</p>

We really miss football and training, but what’s important right now is fighting this virus. I still train at home following the instructions of our staff so that I can keep in shape. Other than that, I spend time with my girlfriend and our two dogs. I play darts and watch TV. I hear people singing from the balcony every evening and that’s wonderful, even if I often don’t understand the lyrics<br /><br /><a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> because he was my favourite player when I was a kid.
