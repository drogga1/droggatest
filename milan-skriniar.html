  <p><b>[Man Utd &amp; Real Madrid target Skriniar has no reason to leave Inter Milan]</b> It’s the wish of me and the club. I don’t know about any particular offer, I have no reason to leave, and I don’t think Inter would sell me anyway. I also love the fact that we’ll play in the Champions League, I’m looking forward to it.</p>

  <p><b>[Quizzed on whether he has snubbed those at the Santiago Bernabeu]</b> No, honestly I didn’t even hear about that. I have no idea where that rumour came from, but I didn’t know anything about it.<br /><br /><b>[He said when asked if he dreams of becoming a captain]</b> I don’t think about these things. I only think about playing. I don’t think that something suddenly changes just because you have the armband. Obviously you have some extra responsibility, but whether you have the armband or not you always have to give everything on the pitch. You always have to do that, it doesn’t matter whether you play one minute or the whole match. And if you are the captain then you still do the same things in order to help the team</p>

  <p><b>[When asked to pick out his toughest opponents]</b> I don’t really know who the strongest is, because they are all different. Ronaldo, for example, was very fast and would fight for every ball. So it’s tough to single one out as the strongest. This season, though, maybe Dzeko was the toughest to mark, because he’s strong physically and he was the one that caused us the most trouble. Especially in the first half during that second game <b>[a 1-1 draw on April 20]</b>. Then in the second half we managed to close him down. Every now and then I also watch videos of the opposition strikers, so I can see where they like to go, see what their strengths and weaknesses are. But in the end I need to concentrate on my own performance.<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he could have predicted such a rapid rise to prominence]</b> No, definitely not. I always wanted to play for a great club like I am today, but especially after those six months where I didn’t play much, it wasn’t easy. But I always believed that one day everything can change and in the end that day came. I think that I can still get better<br /><br /><b>[Asked if fans have asked him to change his name]</b> Many times! At the start, when I had just joined from Sampdoria, it was a disaster. But now I don’t think they have a problem with it anymore, they’ve gotten used to calling me Milan</p>

I dream of raising the Champions League trophy with Inter. <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> has been winning for eight years but the right time has come to try to get closer and beat them. We work hard to win and we can do it but now we have to work even harder. A new coach has arrived and we are all loaded, we can’t wait to start the new season in a big way. We must always aim at the maximum, without ever being satisfied. <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>? He has the right mindset. We are a strong team and we must work with the goal of winning.
