<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> centre-back Jake Clarke-Salter has joined <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a> on a season-long loan</p>

  <p><b>[Jake Clarke-Salter has warned <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> that his patience is being tested, with the England Under-21 captain eager to step away from a role as a loan ranger and become a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> star]</b> I’d be silly to say I wouldn’t want to be in the position where I could play for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. Anyone would. It’s very hard to have patience at times, but you have to understand that there are world-class players at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. You learn to appreciate that<br /><br /><b>[Clarke-Salter has taken in two competitive outings for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, but his debut was made back in 2016]</b> I’m 21 years old now and, obviously, to keep going on loan as you get older is probably not ideal. It’s time to kick on. I need to play as many games as possible at a high and consistent level now. That’s my major aim this season. I need to show I have the physicality to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. If I can do that, who knows what the future holds. My main objective is to be a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> player</p>
