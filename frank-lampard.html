They were in a bad place last year. I went back and got treatment for a week last season when I was injured. The dressing room felt terrible. Guus Hiddink was there, they were 12th in the league. People were injured, they weren’t playing well and you could smell it wasn’t right. They needed to change the whole mentality. Conte has done that without changing too much in terms of players. He made a few additions and <b>[N’Golo]</b> Kante has been fantastic, but Conte was exactly what they needed. I’ve seen what he does. He runs them. They all look fit, lean and know their jobs. They are flying. I watched them against Hull. They were a bit off the pace but win 2-0. Arsenal got out of jail last week but I don’t see them or Manchester City churning wins out like Chelsea. I like Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp but they don’t have the consistency.<br /><br />Don’t forget <b>[Cesar]</b> Azpilicueta. He’s been brilliant. Costa and Hazard get the limelight but he’s basically a right back and a centre half. He is tailor-made for that role. He’s probably been player of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Frank Lampard fears early retirement]</b> Stevie made up his mind and was comfortable finishing the way he did. I wasn’t sure. I loved being in America. It was a great experience. People will be drawn to China because of the money but the lifestyle, everything about America, I couldn’t recommend it enough. I always wanted to play abroad. I had a chance to go to Italy when I was younger and that would have been tough because of the language. America is easier but I really loved it. But in terms of not retiring? I don’t want to leave and think to myself: ‘Maybe I should have stayed a bit longer’. I’m dwelling on it. I have turned down a few Premier League offers. But the fact is, after being at Chelsea for so long and a year with Manchester City, I don’t want to get involved in a relegation dogfight.<br /><br />I don’t mind challenges but there comes a point when you have to take stock. I understand my weaknesses. It’s late January now and to try and get fit and then get into a team and make a massive impact… I don’t feel I could give enough. I just want to make sure I make the right decision. I’ve appreciated getting options at 38. If something comes along that floats my boat, who knows? But nothing has, so we will see.<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he would consider joining the staff at Chelsea]</b> In an ideal world, yes, but I don’t think that’s reality. I have to think about myself. I’m finally going to start my coaching badges next week at B level. The FA are trying to help; <b>[FA technical director]</b> Dan Ashworth has been in touch. I know he’s also helping Stevie. There are opportunities to make it a quicker process than it was before. That would be great. I’ll be in football</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea legend Frank Lampard announced his immediate retirement from playing football on Thursday, at the age of 38]</b> After 21 incredible years, I have decided that now is the right time to finish my career as a professional footballer. Whilst I have received a number of exciting offers to continue playing at home and abroad, at 38 I feel now is the time to begin the next chapter in my life. I’m immensely proud of the trophies I’ve won, of representing my country over 100 times and of scoring more than 300 career goals.<br /><br />I have many people to thank. I thank my parents for instilling in me the values of hard work, dedication and professionalism, values which I have carried with me in everything that I do. I would like to thank the amazing team-mates, coaches, managers and backroom staff that I was privileged to work with. I’d also like to pay tribute to the clubs that I have represented. Firstly, West Ham United who gave me my debut in 1996. Thanks to the people there that believed in me at that young age. More recently, Manchester City and NYCFC. I greatly enjoyed my last playing years at these two clubs and really appreciate the support I received from City Football Group and both clubs’ fans.<br /><br />Of course, the largest part of my heart belongs to Chelsea, a club which has given me so many great memories. I will never forget the opportunity they gave me and the success that we managed to achieve together. It is impossible to give thanks individually to all the people that helped and supported me in my 13 years playing there. All I can say is from the day I signed until now and going forward, I’m eternally grateful for everything and to everyone. Chelsea fans gave myself and my teammates such incredible support. Their passion and hunger drove me on personally to give my best year after year. I couldn’t have done it without them<br /><br /><b>[He reiterated that desire to coach in his retirement post]</b> Looking forward, I’m grateful to the FA for the opportunity to study for my coaching qualifications and I look forward to pursuing the off-field opportunities that this decision opens</p>

  <p><b>[Frank Lampard says Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero is lethal]</b> I’ve been fortunate enough to play with great players. Didier Drogba I always rave about because he was an all round striker, gave you everything, but in terms of an out-and-out goalscorer and a finisher, Aguero is the best I played with. He can be quiet for a lot of the game and then he’ll score. He scores winning goals, he can score any kind of goal. Around the box he is lethal, he’s sharp. I like him. He’s a very confident lad. He has a way about him in his demeanour and how he trains every day, but he does produce and it’s great to see him producing<br /><br />I think we are all aware that Pep Guardiola likes to defend from the front. He’s very strong in his principles and he isn’t about to change now. With Aguero, it’s a tough one. By nature I don’t think he’s a centre forward to charge around and defensively give you loads, but Pep has set him a test now and said: ‘I need you to do that work for the team’. I think it’s improved him and now you’re seeing him be sharp. He’s hungry, so maybe he took that test on board</p>

  <p><b>[David Luiz is probably the best centre-half in the Premier League]</b> I think David Luiz has matured. He was a very good player before - we won the Champions League with him and Gary Cahill as centre-halves in the final - but the criticism of him at that point could have been ‘can he make a mistake and does he try and over-play?’. Since he’s been back, in a role in the middle of a back three, he has shown discipline and quality on the ball. His defensive stuff has been brilliant and I couldn’t leave him out. He’s probably the best centre-half in the league, for me, this season<br /><br />Why did I pick Michael Keane? I think we have to give credit to Burnley as a team and to a player who has been let go by a top team and had to go back down the ladder and prove himself. I’ve seen some games where he has been fantastic this year. He might not be in everyone’s team of the year - I could have picked anyone from Chelsea’s back three and didn’t want to overload with Chelsea - but you have to give respect to young English players who have made a mark in a team that are defending a lot. He has been outstanding. If he goes on, the big clubs will come calling</p>

  <p><b>[Frank Lampard questions Arsenal mentality]</b> I don’t think they’ve got a particularly strong dressing room, I really don’t. I don’t know them all personally but when you go through it you wonder who are the strong characters in that dressing room? There might be other players that are disgruntled, ones that are in and out of the team, and when criticism starts at a club it spreads. Sometimes players make excuses or all of a sudden they don’t like the manager. When you’re in that position, as Arsenal are, it becomes very difficult for the manager to deal with it. He has tried to deal with it but he hasn’t really drawn a big line. He’s drawn a half-hearted line. Now who knows where we are with it all?</p>

He’s doing more interviews, he’s speaking English, and those things important when you become a player of his level. I think last year, and I am huge Eden Hazard fan, there were times when he was so confident in his ability that he would beat someone twice in midfield - he’d beat them and then beat them again. Now, there is a real directness to his play. He’s more efficient and getting into areas to score goals<br /><br />I always name John Terry and Drogba as the best I played with. I always mention Zola as well because he was such an influence for me in my first few years at Chelsea.

Lukaku would be a great option. The only thing Chelsea have to look at is the inflated market which is around now. It’s tough. In terms of an all-round striker who is proven to have scored goals last year at Everton and for the last two or three seasons in the Premier League, he would be an option. But there are others and I wouldn’t want to try and second guess Chelsea. I’m sure they will want to find a player of the same type as Diego Costa. They need a physical presence, they have got a lot of skilful players behind, but they will need to find someone who can replicate what Costa did - give them a physical presence but also get them 20-plus goals a season.<br /><br /><b>[On Diego Costa]</b> He’s a fantastic striker. He will be very difficult to replace. I don’t know where Diego Costa’s mind is. If he stays, brilliant, if he doesn’t then you will have to go to the very top end of world strikers to replace him. That’s not easy to find. If Chelsea do lose him, they will have to make sure they get the right signing</p>

He’s only 24 years old but now it is up to Ross to prove his talents. I think he will do that at Chelsea, so it is a good move. He just needs to learn and listen to people around the place. The standards at Chelsea will be higher than what he’s used to. No disrespect to Everton but he came through there. There are consistency levels at Chelsea in what’s demanded of you generally in your game and that’s good. He’s at the stage of his career where he certainly needed that and I think Chelsea will be a great home for him on that front. He needs to try and get into the Chelsea team, which will be tough for him - that’s the first challenge. If he plays consistently then I think he’s a key England player in the making. He’s already an England player and he’s got that ability to create something out of nothing so let’s get him playing regularly to show what he can do for England and Chelsea.<br /><br />It is very important <b>[to get past Norwich in a few weeks]</b>.

It’s not as if they’ve suddenly stopped buying players. But other clubs are spending more and they have to be careful not to get left behind. The manager isn’t happy and he obviously feels his squad is a bit thin to battle on so many different fronts.

In terms of investing heavily, that will come in the summer. It’s very easy to say that Crouch and Carroll are not Chelsea signings but it’s not an indication of where Chelsea are going.

There is obviously a question over whether coach Antonio Conte will play with a striker or revert back to the false nine he used in the first leg. I would certainly consider picking Morata to lead the line with Eden Hazard and Willian behind. The striker has to play better than he has done in recent weeks. He needs to be physically stronger and hold the ball up more. He has the physical attributes and technical ability to do this. But what Morata can also provide is a target for Chelsea players to aim at and someone who can run in behind. He can do that job more naturally than Hazard, who without the responsibility of playing up front can get more involved in the game himself. What Fernando Torres did in 2012 shows what a recognised striker can give you against Barcelona. There is that opportunity to play balls over the top to get out.</p>

Ramsey has just over a year left on his contract and once again Arsenal have got themselves in a position where one of their key player’s deals is running out. It will probably come as no surprise to people that I like Ramsey. Like me, he makes late runs in the penalty area and he showed that with aplomb for the second goal at AC Milan last week. One wonders if he’s ever felt he’s the main man at Arsenal and that’s maybe why he might consider looking elsewhere. I feel some sympathy for him because his position has changed over the years at the club. Sometimes, because they’ve had so many attacking midfielders, he’s been dropped further back. On the other hand, I accept there maybe doubts over whether he performs consistently enough. He is class when at his best and I do feel there is another level for him to strive for. He showed great quality at the 2016 European Championships. Arsenal need to keep their good British players and build the team around them, with more strength and power as a priority.</p>

I have played in these knife-edge Champions League games knowing an away goal almost finishes you off and it’s not nice. It is not easy to play in, it’s not easy for the home supporters in the stadium. You can dominate and then that away goal knocks you again<br /><br />People should be careful to write off City. All of their focus is on this now - the Premier League title will be won sooner or later. They will have massive determination - not just because of what happened in the first leg but also due to their 3-2 defeat to Manchester United at the weekend. Pep Guardiola’s side are not used to going through a bad patch, they hadn’t lost two games in a row all season. This is not ideal. If they’d won the League beating United by four or five goals, as looked likely at one stage, that would have really set them up for the Liverpool game. But it’s not like they’re a team in crisis, they can turn most results around - 3-0 is not out of reach<br /><br />The past two Manchester City games did highlight some weaknesses in defence.

Yaya will not be short of offers from Premier League clubs either, and he apparently would prefer to stay in England.

I know it won’t be easy - managing a football team never is - but I’m really looking forward to the challenge ahead</p>

  <p><b>[Frank Lampard is used being told he isn’t good enough or that he doesn’t belong]</b> I have thought about coaching and I have been working at Chelsea with the academy all year, around my media stuff. Chelsea, of course, is like a dream job that will be there one day. But that is not always the route that it takes, so it might take me to go somewhere else before I can ever do that. We will see, but I certainly have ambitions to do it. How could I not take it if Chelsea offered me the job? Chelsea are my club and I feel like I have a lot to offer. But that’s obviously for other people to decide, for important people, if and when I am ready to do that</p>

  <p><b>[Frank Lampard believes England have the potential to go far at the World Cup]</b> I am hopeful about England’s chances. I think expectancy levels are slightly less and that is probably a good thing for the squad. They have a good team in terms of youth, particularly in attacking areas. England have some good players who are playing very well for their clubs in the Premier League. I just hope it can come together. Gareth Southgate is working very hard with the squad. We can certainly beat teams on our day. It is about getting momentum at the tournament. I expect us to get through our group and then we will see how far we can go. The World Cup is the time for new leaders to come out. Henderson is showing leadership at Liverpool in their run to the Champions League final, Kane in his performances and stature in the game is a leader. So I think there are players who are already leaders and will become leaders. And tournaments like the World Cup are moments when you have to stand up a little bit. I’d like to think England are not short on leaders.<br /><br />Everyone is doing the same now with youth setup and I think England were late to the party. The Spanish, French and Germans have had their academies for years and now England have that as well. And you are seeing the benefits with underage teams winning tournaments. But competition remains high across the board and we have talented groups of youngsters coming through in groups, which is great because it allows them to form relationships as they grow up. And hopefully we can have success again at major tournaments in the next five to 10 years</p>

  <p><b>[Former Chelsea legend and current Derby County manager Frank Lampard has stated his belief that England can ‘go all the way’ at the World Cup]</b> I think we can go all the way, I genuinely do. I don’t see why we would be negative enough to start going ‘oh we have to get to the quarter finals’. I think the team have shown in their performances - and this is not me getting ahead of myself - just look at the talent in our squad and the way they’re playing, why should we write ourselves off? Yes, the players will focus game by game and day by day, that’s tournament football, that’s what they have to do. But ourselves from the outside, we can look in and say ‘this team has a real chance’.<br /><br />I think it was one of a multitude of issues in previous years that we analysed everything specific on individuals and ended up creating a lot of arguments around what is a team sport - and we want the best for the team. I think huge credit to Gareth Southgate there that he’s been so fluid with the system, he’s changed the philosophy of the team over the last two years to the way they’re playing. We’ve got so many more options when we’re on the ball now because we’re not playing a very basic 4-4-2, which we played for many a year. So we can come into tournament football and feel like we can get a lot of possession in midfield which is key. Gareth’s made all these moves that make us talk more now about the team rather than ‘this position’ and ‘that position.</p>

It would be a great headline if he scores a hat-trick, so don’t ask me! I had a mantra where I didn’t like to speak too much because I made a few mistakes with things I said in younger days. When you play, you do the best that you can, and when you speak, you have to be careful what you say. Everyone is different - some wear their heart on their sleeve, some might have reasons for saying things the way they do, but you should only be judged by what you do on the pitch. After a negative result, I was always particularly careful what I said.<br /><br />We certainly weren’t at Chelsea, though we got painted as negative because we could also grind out a win when we weren’t at our best. We had a really good defence, not just the back four, but the whole team. We worked very hard to stop teams scoring, created a lot of chances and scored a lot of goals. We had <b>[Damien]</b> Duff and <b>[Arjen]</b> Robben on the wings, Joe Cole and Didier <b>[Drogba]</b> etc. We played a lot of good stuff. It became a little bit of a stick to beat us with, looking back.

Of course, it’s different to Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp, but I don’t think it changes because that’s what he is</p>

He’s so quick to leave midfield to go and press people, whether it be defenders or deep-lying midfield players which makes you the all-round midfield player. He should never be considered a number 10 because there’s so much more to his game, but he’ll score goals like a number 10. At some stage he will go back to Chelsea.

  <p><b>[Frank Lampard is adamant that he is not trying to copy any of the managerial greats he worked with]</b> I try to be myself; I think that’s very important. Copying anyone as a manager is a mistake. You have to find your own methods or your own ways. I certainly have no fear of tapping into a bit of the managers that I have worked with over the years, but I don’t think that I am similar to any of them. I try to take positive points from a lot of people I worked with. In terms of how I work, you have to be reactionary in games, but I try to take things in throughout the week and get all the information. Be as prepared as I can be and thorough with the staff that I have got. Then make decisions having done that work which I think gives you the best opportunity to have that success. In terms of style of play, I want to play good football. We want to try to play. We have been one of the teams in the Championship this season who try to play. We try to move the ball through the pitch, rather than being too direct, that’s not my style. It is not the way I want to play. I want my team to play good football, but on the other side of that, I want them to be really aggressive and win the ball back. So I don’t like to try and put myself into one style of play. I think it is important to be adaptable in terms of systems. You can’t always play that beautiful football that you are searching for because of the conditions and the opposition. So I think, in terms of trying to box yourself into one style I think it could be wrong in my opinion. But I want to play good football, I want it to be aggressive, I want the fans to see that we are a team that plays with passion and desire and wants to win games of football.<br /><br />I respect managers who have a belief in a philosophy or system. I have never worked with Sarri, but I did see his Napoli team play fantastic football. I think it has been unfortunate for Sarri himself, everyone has come up with this ‘Sarriball’ term, but I am not sure I have ever heard him actually milk that one or make it his own. I think he is just trying to win football games and he has brought in players who want to play the way he wants to play. Everyone has become a little bit focused on that fact. I think he is a very good manager. In terms of compared to my style, yes, I look at the players I have and what I can do with that. You try to play in the best way you can. When we played against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup, Sarri spoke to me after the game. He was very complimentary about us, but he was talking about all the games we played over the last weeks. He is not just looking at how Chelsea are playing, he is looking at his opponents, and he is trying to get good results for Chelsea Football Club. I have got respect for him. I don’t know him that well but I have got respect for him<br /><br />It was massively overplayed. It was overplayed to the point where it was false. We had a massive strength at Chelsea. We had fantastic managers at different times, but the strength was that the dressing room wanted to win and had a real desire to be winners. That’s certainly what I want as a dressing room, as a manager now. It is a very cheap and easy statement to say a problem at Chelsea is player power. Chelsea is a club that has changed managers. It is a club that demand results. I think rightly so, it has gone into that bracket now, and it has a way of working. I think as a player, all I would worry about is what I did every week. Was I at my best? All John Terry concerned himself about was that. Didier Drogba, Michael Ballack, Petr Cech and Ashley Cole; They were all great professionals. So if you call having strong personalities as a player <b>[a weakness]</b>, then I think that’s a cheap and easy way to look at it. It became more of a media word than something that was real. The fact is that Chelsea were not winning enough games in a period of time. They are getting judged just as Manchester City do, Manchester United do and Liverpool do. It is such a top end job and such a top end club that people look into every avenue when results are not perfect. I think player power was the first call, ‘let’s look at player power’. It is not the right answer<br /><br />We are very forward-thinking here at Derby. I came into the club that was already forward-thinking before I got here. We have got a fantastic analysis department. We are trying to certainly stay at the top of the game in that aspect. In the modern game, it is important that you use data and analysis. It is never my first call, but it is always a huge part of the process to be ahead of the game. I haven’t changed the medical team here at all. I think it is fantastic and you can see the facilities we have got here are excellent. It is Premier League standard. For the modern-day player, you have to have those foundations at the club to try to move forward and you must never stand still in any department. As a manager, I certainly don’t get involved in areas that are not my strength and you have to trust in the people that you have got working in those areas to try to maximise performance at the end of the day. So I think we are always trying to look forward and move forward on all those fronts</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea legend Frank Lampard is adamant Mason Mount has a bright future ahead of him]</b> Firstly, he has the potential to be a top player, and I mean that. He broke into the England squad which I thought was a great achievement after playing for us. I think he can go as far as he wants. I have seen a progression in him now. He has played two-thirds of a season now in the Championship, which is full throttle and very taxing on a young midfielder to be the creator that he is. Also the amount of work he does off the ball for us, which I think goes unnoticed, he has been fantastic in doing that for us. He is a player who really wants to learn and be at the top. It is as important as the talent itself. He works fantastically hard. He is a good team-mate and he has the talent to go to the top. He has been a pleasure to work with. His choices have been really good. He was very successful in the Chelsea academy and youth team, as a team and for him as an individual. He took a leap to go abroad. That in itself, in terms of his personality, says a lot and he performed brilliantly there in terms of goals and assists. He has come to the Championship and performed very well here as well. So I think everyone’s pathway is different. We know that at Chelsea it is quite difficult to get into their first team at 17, 18 or 19 years of age, but he hasn’t sat still. He has actually gone out and played and played a lot of games. I would be delighted for him <b>[to play for Chelsea]</b>. I know what a great lad he is as well. He works so hard, and he has a good mentality. If anyone deserves it, it will be Mason, and I would be absolutely delighted for him to get in that team<br /><br />It depends on the individual. Fair play to the ones who do decide that. If they feel it is going to enhance their career for whatever reason. I think it can be a different choice for many reasons. I think for some that it can be good to stay with their parent club. For some, it might be better to go out on loan in the UK, for some it is somewhere else. It will always come down to how dedicated and talented the player is, without a doubt. Choosing the right pathway is an important element of it but the ones who rise to the top, no matter the pathway, are generally the ones who have the right mentality and attitude</p>

But I know it will be a tough atmosphere for the players, but they need to rise to that. You need to try and turn that around in a positive for us. There is pressure in this game for both teams no matter what way you look at it. This is what the lads, when they were young boys, when they wanted to be football players, were dreaming about - these games, not the mundane ones we can play with a lot more ease. These are the pressure ones which define us<br /><br />The Elland Road game before has no bearing on this….We’ve played at Elland Road, we’ve played at Stamford Bridge, we’ve played at Old Trafford, we’ve played at Nottingham Forest. Tough atmospheres all around. The lads just need to know that’s what it is. It’s not going to be anything massively different from that. It is going to be a lot of noise, pressure when we have the ball or maybe on the referee. That comes with big football <b>[matches]</b>, it comes with big stadiums. It is something we will need to deal with it</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea have been urged to respect Eden Hazard’s wishes when it comes to a summer transfer]</b> I would certainly say that in the seven years Eden Hazard has been at Chelsea he’s elevated himself to one of the great players in their history, without a doubt, in terms of what he’s done on the pitch. It would be a shame for the Premier League and for Chelsea to lose him. But we have to also understand the individual’s wants and desires on the pitch and what they want to do. I actually don’t know <b>[whether Hazard will leave]</b>. The signs are that he might be leaving, it seems, if the clubs can agree on that and if that’s what the player wants.

My dream was to do as well as I can day in and day out to be successful. I can’t call that one. Those things happen or they don’t or whatever. My focus is completely on the here and now.

We’ve got a really difficult game, so it is what it is. That’s my standpoint on it and my focus is on us on Monday. I’ll say straight away to the Derby fans, my focus all year has been how well I can do in this job, because this club gave me an opportunity. And I want to finish that this season as well as I can. So that’s why my focus is so much on this game, and I’m thankful for that opportunity.<br /><br />I’ve got two years left on my contract here and I see no further than Monday. I will sit down with (owner) <a href="mel-morris.html">Mel Morris</a> after the game, which was planned before all this talk anyway, to see firstly what the result was on Monday, because that’s going to be defining how we chat and to see where the club goes forward.

It is very clear that we are a club that generally, barring a couple of seasons in recent years, are a club that has managed to be top four or winning titles. One of the benefits is I know the club. I understand what is expected so it was not even a conversation that I needed to have. I played here for many years and I know there are standards. There’s a baseline of being competitive.

At Derby last year, every day agents were ringing me all over the place. It’s quite a nice footing for me. If I came into a squad I felt was short that would be a huge problem, I don’t think it is. It does change the landscape slightly, of course, because we’ll see teams improve. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> have broken their record. Man United, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are buying players. Teams are going to improve. The important thing for us is not to focus on what everyone else is doing it’s what we can do here.<br /><br />I’m new into the hot seat. I know we’ve got a good squad and a lot of really good young talent. That’s certainly becomes a big focus of the year. First is to be competitive, but second, can we put some faith in the young players and see if they can get into the first team and show what they can do. I believe there are some there, not all of them, some might try and it might not work, it’s also a test for the older players to rise to that as well. I think the motivation should be there <b>[for youngsters to breakthrough]</b>, but I understand that if a door can seem locked for a long time then it can affect young players. I have spoken about it and I will make it very clear going in that the door is open if you prove that you are good enough, but I do think the motivation should be there. Hopefully, that will be a nice way to start the season, talk to the young lads and if they have had a foot in the first-team or not they should use that.<br /><br />The reality is we should be competing no matter what and my job is to try and find a balance between the players that think they are in the first-team squad and the players breaking through. There is no use me sitting here and saying I’m going to play all the young players. They have to show individually they can do it so the balance from me will be to remain competitive and bring them through. Every manager has their own idea whether they think they don’t want to know about young players too much and this is my first-team squad. My eyes will always be open to the young players but they have to show they are good enough because we can’t lower our levels too much. This is <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> so I am not going to be doing young boys favours and put them in the team. They need to prove themselves to get in the team and if they can do that I will be proud because it will be what I see as a big part of my job this year.<br /><br /><b>[Lampard is also keen on a softer style of man-management and detailed that he will trust his players to look after their own diets and habits off the field]</b> What we did at Derby and I will bring here is that I will have a respect for the players and they should behave like professionals. We will lay out everything. And the sports science, nutrition, medical, everything like that is spot on here. I know that from being here. So there are no excuses. To get a top performance the players have to live right. They have to train hard and rest well and if they don’t it becomes evident. I’m a manager who has faith to a point but if I see it’s not being done. It’s not about ketchup. I’m not banning tomato ketchup. They go home and they can have a whole tub of it, I’ll never know that. But if I see it showing on the training pitch, I would be strong on that because I think it’s important. When you’re dealing with small differences at the top of the league - and last year there was a gap to the top boys - then you have to try and bridge the gap</p>

This is no disrespect to Derby, a fantastic club for me, I was ambitious as a player, I wanted to manage at the top.

It is an easy thing to point to because the fact that I have come back, and others have come back but people have to be good enough and have the right attitude to come in and want to do it, not because you’ve played for the club.

I don’t know <b>[if this club is impatient with managers]</b>. The reality is that the owner has won 16 trophies in 16 years, a huge success, he runs it as his own desire, and his desire has always been for the best of the club. He has chosen me hopefully on that premise. I don’t know whether it will change. I do think it is a reality of football.

But the players have to own that. I will just try and set the tone for that. The players are the ones who will have to go out there and compete against a lot of fantastic teams out there. I want to be close to the players, someone who is close to them, I want to drive them on the training ground but I want to feel like they can talk to me, like to work hard, be constantly with them.

  <p><b>[Bohemians vs <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. A transfer ban, however, is the greatest of Frank Lampard’s problems]</b> The bonus is I’ll have quite a calm July. If I came into a squad I felt was short that would be a huge problem, I don’t think it is. I know we’ve got a good squad and a lot of really good young talent. That’s certainly becomes a big focus of the year. First is to be competitive, but second, can we put some faith in the young players and see if they can get into the first team and show what they can do. I have spoken about it and I will make it very clear going in that the door is open if you prove that you are good enough, but I do think the motivation should be there. Hopefully, that will be a nice way to start the season, talk to the young lads and if they have had a foot in the first-team or not they should use that. The reality is we should be competing no matter what and my job is to try and find a balance between the players that think they are in the first-team squad and the players breaking through</p>

This is what pre-season is all about and the quicker we get there, to the level we want, then the better. We wanted to win the game as you always do but it is not about that. It is about individuals getting fit and pushing themselves to the limit and I thought some of the performances - particularly from the younger lads - was really good. I have been really happy.

It is important we move forward on that and I know as a club we are doing our best to from top to bottom. Mason signing is great because of the impressive loans he has had. He is part of the first-team squad. Ruben has just signed which is great and I want Callum to sign and stay here. He has come through the academy and can be a big player for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and England. We, as a club, want him to stay for sure and I think he knows he has a manager here who will want to work with him to improve. That will take hard work. Nothing is given, especially when you are 18, but with all the attributes Callum has we want him to come through and be a big player for us now and in the future<br /><br />I am confident. I hate making too many predictions. It is an injury that came from the back end of last season. With the amount of games he’s played in the last few seasons it is important to be cautious, and with the type of player that he is, a very energetic and a fit lad, meant that pushing him at the start of pre-season was not necessary. We’ll take it a bit easy at the start and hopefully he’ll be ready for the start of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Frank Lampard says that the shock £8 million sale of <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> wasn’t down to player power and that he didn’t flex his muscles]</b> I would never have gone out to make any form of a mark. I think it would have been naive to try to flex my muscles or my power. I don’t need to do that. I just play it as I see it, daily. I watch how the players train, I watch how the players react in the dressing room, how the spirit is. And then I have to make decisions. And I have to try and create a squad that is in the image of what I want. And I wasn’t saying David wasn’t part of that, but I have to make lots of decisions every day and they are not all about trying to show power, they are just trying to do it my way because the last thing I want to do is look back on these times and go, ‘I wish I had done that differently and I didn’t quite do it’. These are decisions that I make daily. So, if it looks like that from the outside, it certainly wasn’t how I did it. It was purely football decisions on both sides. Not just the way I was thinking, but the way David was thinking. And at 32, I was that 32-year-old. I left here at 35-ish.<br /><br />It was slightly different, for me, but I wanted honesty and respect. It went both ways. We are also big characters, so when we do talk, then it is serious. We don’t beat around the bush, we got to the point pretty quickly and that was it. We have four centre-halves. Three full internationals, one is an under-21 international who I worked with last year. We have other players in defensive areas. It is an area of the pitch where I am very interested to see players stand up and play. To make that shirt their own as everyone has to in every position. I am very comfortable with the squad we have got and that’s not a slant on David at all. I know all of David’s qualities. He has got great qualities as a footballer and as a person. It is just a decision we came to.<br /><br /><b>[Lampard has dismissed claims that Luiz wanted to be untouchable]</b> I’m never surprised by players. He didn’t want to be untouchable, and I should make that clear. I’m never surprised by players. The huge difference between being a player and a manager is that, as a player, you can be very selfish and not worry about anyone else too much. When you are a manager, your responsibility is 25 players and more, everyone around the building. So never expect a conversation to go the way you think it might go. Also, when you are dealing with top-level sportspeople, they are driven and I accept that. We are all driven in different ways. I used to hate being subbed, I used to hate being dropped. I was terrible. I wouldn’t want to manage myself in certain ways! But as a manager, you have to understand that you have to have these conversations and so I’m never surprised by what any player does, they just try to get the best out of the situations for the club you are working for<br /><br /><b>[Lampard met Solksjaer for the first time on Wednesday at a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> managers’ meeting and gave his verdict on his rival]</b> Well, I enjoyed watching Ole. First of all, he seems like a very likeable man, I met him in the week at the manager’s meeting and he carried on that way. We played against each other but we wouldn’t have had too many social moments. I like to see someone who is obviously a legend at the club but also a people person. I like that. Even though I’m not at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, I like seeing the uplift he got as a manager when he went in. And he did. I watched their performances in Paris and others where they were fantastic. It was nice to see as a young manager, a young aspiring manager myself, for someone to come in and do as well as he has done. Now it’s a big test. The expectations don’t go anywhere for any of us, they are probably higher for us and that’s what we have to work with all of the time</p>

I think we saw elements of that against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> where the players have a freedom to use their attributes. The idea that he wins the ball probably as well as anybody in world football doesn’t mean that he has to sit in front of the back four and do that.

Across the front three, they scored 60-something goals last season between the three of them but every team is its own entity and it doesn’t have to be one way to win a game or to score a goal. We have to score from different areas of the pitch and that’s pretty clear. We need to score more goals at this moment, for sure. That’s work for the squad. We will have to find it among the group. I know those stats and I know how many goals <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> was part of, in terms of scoring and assisting. So, they are facts that are real and ones we have to try to address with work. Which means, can we score goals from other areas of the pitch?<br /><br />Can we be more clinical upfront? And then the challenge is clear for the strikers and the attacking players. Can you be the players to score those goals? Because I agree the top teams in the league tend to have players that are scoring regularly. They do win games that are tight, who do make you clear in games in good periods, that you score enough goals to put the game to bed. And that’s a challenge for us because it’s something we aren’t doing and we need to do<br /><br /><b>[The Belgian <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> provided 16 goals in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> last season to go with 15 assists as <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> finished third behind only <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> The Eden thing, we all know the reliance in terms of his output was huge and he is in the top bracket of players in world football, attacking players in world football, so you have to accept that. But I haven’t considered that, and the players should just play as they play. There is enough quality in this team to win games for sure without Eden. I understand certainly <a href="mateo-kovacic.html">Mateo Kovacic</a>, he has the ability and quality in his game and talent to chip in with goals, but I can’t ask them to be all things in one at one point, <b>[like expecting]</b> <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a> to set the tempo from midfield and knock in 10 goals a season.<br /><br />That would be tough. But as a team and from the wide areas and certainly from the striking areas, if players like <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> and <a href="ross-barkley.html">Ross Barkley</a> have those attributes. <a href="ruben-loftus-cheek.html">Ruben Loftus-Cheek</a> when he was in the team last year has those sorts of attributes.

It is certainly not the way we should be looking at it, ‘I wish we had a <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a>.’ No, this is 2019. We need to try and score goals and look at the problem ahead of us<br /><br /><b>[Lampard has gone for a different approach than his opposite number and has a clear penalty taker at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> The <a href="paolo-di-canio.html">Di Canio</a> situation, I think he had been injured, I had taken one and scored it, and he came back into the team and he was the man. Probably quite rightly he took the ball in the end there. I was probably trying to make a little mark and I got put in my place by <a href="paolo-di-canio.html">Di Canio</a>, which was fine. That was a little lesson there. And actually, it happened a few years later with Didier at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, and we had a penalty and me and Didier are like that, we are very close, and it was dealt with very quickly.<br /><br />I watched the game and I saw the comments around it on the television straight after, and I can see all sides of that story. It can happen. People feel competitive, feel confident in the moment, where you have a penalty taker and you also have a second pen taker if things happen in games. I think it is really important to do that, especially if you are really confident, and someone is your man. But that is not always the case. So, it is very easy to comment from the outside, where you have a couple of players that are vying for it and that are confident in games then you can have issues. The issues only arrive when the ball does not go into the net</p>

  <p><b>[Lampard puts faith in misfiring <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> forwards after <a href="michy-batshuayi.html">Batshuayi</a>’s goalscoring return]</b> Michy got the fitness work he needed out of the game. He scored two good goals, two very good finishes. I thought he worked hard and that’s exactly what the game was there to do for him. As I’ve said here and I’ve said on the training pitch, we need Michy, we need the competition upfront with the three strikers we have. I used to love practising my finishing in training, it’s what I felt made me lucky at the weekend, and gave me an edge in front of goal. What I have got is great attitude in the three strikers particularly, but others in the squad also always want to stay out, want to work harder. The reality is that moments come when things don’t quite go for you. <b>[If]</b> Tammy’s goal goes in off the post against United, <b>[it’s a]</b> different story for him, different story for the game. But you can’t get too down about that. I don’t think we need to go negative about it. It’s about positivity, working hard and the belief that it will come, and I believe it will come. We’re talking about quality players in terms of our attacking players, so it will come<br /><br />This is <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and you can’t disrespect any team to say, ‘it’s must-win’ or ‘we’ll turn up to win’ because every game is difficult. I was clear with the players: the performance <b>[against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>]</b> spoke for itself. The first half was fantastic. Normally that first half would be two or three-nil, and from then on very comfortable. We’ve shown some really good bits, but we’ve still got work to do. We’re not where we want to be, and it would be impossible to say that three games into the season. It’s not easy in pre-season with players coming back late to try and change everything in one go. You can’t. You just have to work hard and keep trying to deliver messages throughout. We’ll get better and the good times are good, but we also know there’s a lot to improve on. We’re not there yet<br /><br /><a href="n-golo-kante.html">Kante</a> has got an injury he has carried all week, so we’ll assess that over the next 24 hours over whether he is <b>[available]</b>. <a href="antonio-rudiger.html">Rudiger</a>’s not fit yet, hopefully for next week. That’s the only changes from where we were last week. Callum is training, looking bright and sharp but now we’re in the zone where it’s about protecting him, giving him conditioning with fitness, especially in the area of his injury. He has had quite a long time out. The international break comes at quite a good time for us with both of those and for <a href="reece-james.html">Reece James</a>. They’re all in a position where, I hope, two or three weeks of strong training puts them back in the frame for the squad</p>

Being called up for his country, that’s hopefully going to come pretty soon again. He can go absolutely to the top. He’s impressed me. He had another step on in pre-season. At Derby, he was great. But that’s one thing. Coming to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, with the competition he’s got in midfield and the expectation level that comes with it, is another thing. I keep going on about his character. For me, it’s such a big percentage of the package and he has all of that and he has the quality. Intelligent players who have that talent are really great to work with. I don’t want to heap expectation on him. But I will tell him that every day because I feel it, and when someone’s humble and hard-working like him, it doesn’t matter. You can tell them because it will never stop his drive or his hunger. He’s not a boy that wants the razzmatazz of it all, he just wants to be a top player for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and then England and I believe he can be. It certainly helps but he’s driven and he’s not going to get carried away with himself. It’s the way his family have brought him up. He is a pleasure to work with</p>

  <p><b>[Frank Lampard is backing <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Cesar Azpilicueta</a> to overcome a run of poor form early in the season]</b> Firstly, I played with <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Azpilicueta</a> and I know him very well and he is the first player to stand up. He has been an incredible player for a club that has won a lot and he has been central to winning a lot. He is not just a bystander. He has been right in the middle of it all and he will be more critical than anyone of his form and what it means. He will be the first one who wants to address it every minute of the day in training. I think he is a big player for us and a big personality. I see no problem. I remember in my career countless times playing with better players than I was that had little moments in their career that, for whatever reason, people want to talk about. The top ones come through it. <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Azpilicueta</a> is a top player and I don’t think there are any major issues. In the modern-day all eyes are on and if there is a bit of a mistake or a moment, people want to do that, and players have to put up with that. I have got no problem. <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Azpi</a> will comfortably put up with that<br /><br /><b>[Lampard has confirmed that <a href="n-golo-kante.html">N’Golo Kante</a> remains out injured, while <a href="emerson-palmieri.html">Emerson Palmieri</a> will miss out due to an injury sustained on international duty with Italy. <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a> and <a href="reece-james.html">Reece James</a> returned for the club’s Under-23 side on Friday night but Lampard says that rules him out of replacing <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Azpilicueta</a> at the <a href="wolves-fc.html">Molineux</a> Stadium]</b> Yes, it is too early for Reece. Tonight is more minutes and it won’t be 90 minutes, probably more around 45 minutes because of where he is at so there is a bit of a plan with him. Reece is also adaptable. So are certain other players. He played the run-in at Wigan in defensive midfield last year. He can play right centre-back, right-back. There are options<br /><br /><b>[Lampard isn’t expecting to add the forgotten former <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> loan star Marco van Ginkel to the squad anytime soon]</b> He’s long term. He has unfortunately had some complications with knee surgery. I wouldn’t want to put any time frame we will leave him to do his rehab which he is doing very diligently. His demeanour is as good as it could be. He is here working every hour of the day. He is positive even if inside I’m sure it is tough for him<br /><br /><b>[A tough week is ahead after his players have returned from international duty with <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> away followed by <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> at home]</b> If anyone’s jumping to conclusions it is because they’re looking at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and City, because they are the dominant teams who have got good results so far, particularly <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Other than that, I think it is too easy. We’re on the same points as <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. Other teams that might be less fancied than us are on higher points than us, so I think now is certainly too early to make long-term predictions. We have conceded more than we would want to. It is our job to put it right. We will focus on different elements of the game. Sometimes you can sit down and not worry about one part that is going really well, but of course, if things show themselves, you have to address them. We regularly have videos. I don’t like the defending vs attacking thing because I think some of the goals that we have conceded have been individual errors or we’ve given away possession and let them score. That means that it is your attacking that is not so good as your defending, so we always try and look at both sides</p>

So the moment he wants to come off that and think that goals will just drop at his feet will be a moment when maybe he will be rested, so it’s important he makes sure he stays on his game.

To score seven goals in three games and be top scorer and play with the quality he’s playing in his all-round game - the three different types of goals he scored are exactly what you want from Tammy: a messy one, a good header and then a fantastic feet and finish goal. He has to sustain it and he has to get even better. He has to be hungry, which I know he is. He can never rest on his laurels because there is more work to be done and that England squad is a few weeks away. He needs to keep playing at that level and he’ll have a great chance, I’d suggest.<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he had talked to Abraham amid reports Nigeria are keen to offer him an alternative route into international football]</b> No. No, that’s not my choice.

  <p><b>[Frank Lampard says that <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a>’s return is not far off]</b> I did watch him. I spoke with him this morning. He’s not far off. We have to be careful because it was a big injury and what we have done is actually got him back out on time but we have to make sure the strength is right in the area because that could lead to other injuries if we go too soon. The way he played on Friday, I think he’s not far away. He’s been training with us now for two or three weeks. We have got the Carabao Cup coming the midweek next and that will maybe be an opportunity to look at players who have been injured or different options. In between, if players, if Callum, shows this week how good he is in training I’ll have to consider him probably from now on.

Unfortunately for Mo, it didn’t work out here but it is great credit to him. He went to Italy and then came back and now he is a superstar. As for his path, it is hard to compare to what may have been. I had an overlap with him. The talent was obviously there. At the time, I think we had a lot of options in attacking areas.

But the player that he is now or that came back to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> I think you have to say huge credit is due.

They are competitive lads. I played with players that demanded balls to their feet and I shot and visa versa, I demanded a pass and they shot. I think that edginess about football and that professional competition, as long as it doesn’t overstep the mark which is the job of the manager and that only happens behind the scenes, but I like it. They both want to score goals. They are hungry. They are competitive. They want to be winners. When they play like that, that’s the answer. If they are not playing well enough or not performing and you see that going on then as a manager, you ask more questions but these boys are really driven. I like it. I remember being in the dressing room with <a href="jimmy-floyd-hasselbaink.html">Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink</a>. After I scored at <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>, he complained that I hadn’t passed to him in the game and he said I should have passed to him in the game and in a different moment from my goal.<br /><br />He said, ‘You scored one. There you go you just want to score again and not pass to me.’ This is from a man who shot 20 times a game. That’s it! That was Jimmy, that’s what football is about, it is different personalities. That’s what strikers should be and have to have an element of selfishness about them. I had it as a midfield player. I wanted to be good individually and to be part of a winning team. You can’t have the perfect ambience around at all times around the squad. It is good for players to test each other - if you didn’t, it would be a relaxed nature in the group. I don’t know Mane but I know <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>. He is a really good lad. He is just hungry and I think that’s one of the reasons because of his elevation we spoke about as a player<br /><br />I think it was a really good performance, yes.

The idea of having to be good because you want to raise your level because the other team is good is not something I love. I want us to be good every week. It was a test we had in Istanbul and it was something we did rise to. We will have to rise again because the difference with what City and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are doing now is they are hitting those heights in every game pretty much.

Myself and <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> would keep an eye on young players coming through. At Derby, it happened nicely for me because we needed a centre-back, we only had two last year, actual centre-backs at the start of the season.

Having known someone, and Jody had worked closely with him as well, so we knew his attributes and know where he could improve. The real credit of Fikayo is the way that he has approached it all. His mentality from when he came to Derby and to today has been brilliant. From beginning to end, that is why he is improving. I just trust in him. I trust in him as a player, the way that he trains every day, it’s the kind of thing I want to see daily and the way he plays. Of course he is a young player, like all young players there are moments where he can improve and that’s something he constantly needs to work on. I trust in him; hence, I wanted him as part of the squad. That wouldn’t have mattered who might have gone or not. My idea when I came here was to keep Fik part of the squad anyway because I trust him to come and play here. Where better a place to play than the club he has come through at?<br /><br /><b>[England manager <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> may be concerned that Nigeria will try to convince <a href="fikayo-tomori.html">Tomori</a> to switch national allegiances]</b> It’s his choice.

But he has played for the U21s and if he continues with the form he has and keeps improving then there would be potential for England if Gareth chooses to select him. It’s his call. I think he shouldn’t worry about it too much at the minute. Just worry about the way he is playing and the way he trains. It will be a nice problem for him if he is eligible for three, he can choose which one he wants</p>

The point was to keep doing the right things, to keep moving it quickly and believe it was going to come and it did.

  <p><b>[Tough love! How <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> &amp; Lampard are helping <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a> realise his world-class potential]</b> Now that a five-year contract is signed, this is where the hard work really starts for him. I made it clear I wanted him at the club because I believe in his talent. I think there is a lot more to come. And it’s only pure hard work that will get him there<br /><br /><b>[<a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Hudson-Odoi</a> was making his first appearance for the senior squad since suffering an Achilles injury in April and he marked the occasion with a goal in a 7-1 win]</b> Firstly he has signed up, so that is good, as that puts to bed everything else. But, in terms of his performance, I thought, ‘First half, not so sure’. The message to him and Christian <b>[<a href="christian-pulisic.html">Pulisic</a>]</b> was to attack the defensive line, run in behind and get into the box to take people on. It wasn’t happening; that message didn’t get across. It was reinforced pretty strongly at half-time and, in the second half, Callum managed to get into better positions. Callum’s talent means that he absolutely has to work hard, to run behind people, to get at people, to be inside, be outside and work off the ball - all those things. That’s where he needs to learn because if he wants to play every week, that is what he is going to have to do</p>

  <p><b>[Frank Lampard admits that <a href="fikayo-tomori.html">Fikayo Tomori</a> has been his pet project but he says that his consistency has helped keep him in the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> team after being on the fringes in pre-season]</b> He was quiet at Derby. He was quite quiet with me - he wasn’t quiet when they were all together. From a distance. He has definitely got personality. And that group last year, the group he was in at Derby, he became very popular in the dressing room and popular with the fans because of his performances.<br /><br />He was Player of the Year. The progression was huge but the main thing I saw in him was work ethic. He quietly goes about his business. He trains hard, everything you ask him to do he tries to do and more. Physically he is great - we know that. But he is one of those when you are doing sprinting or running or some heavy running early season, which we were doing, you could see every day he is nailed on. He does the job. When you want to do a particular training session, something quite simple but takes focus, he is focussed and ready to go. And I think that has really shown itself in his performances since he stepped into the team. I put trust in him early in the season - I think that was obvious with the way the pre-season went with the centre-backs. At the moment, he has really delivered and long may that continue.<br /><br />I think there is a lot more to come still. You don’t know until you put players in. Against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> at home was a game where I thought he deserved his opportunity for his training, how he trained. That is a great message to all the players: how you train will relate to whether you get picked. Those are the rules here. You have to train at a level. And he trained so well for a period of time he deserved it against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> and then he gave me a big problem because he played so well and he has continued to do that. Yes, he is a project in a way but a nice one because everything you want him to do, he stands up and delivers<br /><br /><b>[Lampard insisted though that he is just as happy to see young foreign players make it at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> as long as they carry the same love for the club that developed them]</b> Well, there are two things. One, I really like it, yes, an affiliation and the academy, and the fans love it. I do like that side of it. But the other 50 per cent is that I don’t care where they come from as long as they play and apply and do the right things, it doesn’t matter whether you’re an English 20-year-old or a French 20-year-old, etc. I think if the ethics are right and you deserve your place in the team, you’ll get your place in the team. But yes, it’s obviously a nice story because fans really do enjoy seeing the young English boys coming through and they all have an affiliation with the club. But then if you look below then slightly, you have Ian Maatsen who is a young Dutch boy, a really good young player. If he comes through I would feel exactly the same so it’s nice to see</p>

  <p><b>[Lampard urges calm about <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a>’s lack of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> appearances]</b> He’s level. I spoke to him two days before the Grimsby game and was very clear about the standards and we have to give him the fact that he’s moved country and moved leagues. He’s as young as all the young players we keep talking about. He’s just turned 21. So I think if anyone is getting too excited about this they should calm down because he’s started five games for us and what he needs to do is work, work daily, work to show within the group that he deserves to play.<br /><br />As they all do, as all the players do. That’s what the focus on everyone is. This is one of my difficult problems in this job. I have good players and everyone has a story. <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a> has a price tag. <a href="ross-barkley.html">Ross Barkley</a> is an international player. <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> is an international player, <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a> just signed a new contract, <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> wanted to buy him last summer.

All I have to demand of them is that they show me in training and show me that they are worthy of the place.<br /><br />We can all focus on <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Pulisic</a> from the other day but Callum’s the same and I have to speak in the real world when I speak to them and sometimes as a manager you want more. You have to be honest and the players have to react to that and Callum has now come on with two assists in the games that he’s come on and that’s what you want to keep pushing. I love the young players. I particularly love the young players because I want them to improve daily. At the same time, sometimes I have to make harsh decisions and say something that I see can help their game but might not sound that nice because I want them to be the best, all of them. That’s what I want them to be. That’s part of the process<br /><br /><b>[Lampard said of <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a>]</b> My relationship is really good with him. He’s a great professional, trains at a level every day, great in the dressing room and in the game, he passes on experience. But in terms of that, everybody keeps asking me about the players that aren’t playing but it’s a difficult one because some players can’t play whether they’re 32 or at the other end of the spectrum at 21. They have to keep working and be positive within the group because I’ve got no winners in this game, I want the club to win. So when I choose to select people or not it’s because I think it’s the best thing. I’m not blind to the fact when you’re not playing, it’s not nice.<br /><br />Everyone wants to play. I understand that and accept that. I was one of the worst. I hated not playing. I was terrible. So on this side of the fence I get it, I get it, but all I want to see is positivity, how they are daily in the place and I see that. I see that and that’s sometimes the thing people in the outside world doesn’t see - why is he not playing? This one or that one. I’ve got to make choices in training and I want the group to be positive and well spirited and getting results, and at the moment we are doing that and it has to continue, because like all good teams, we need a big squad in these modern days to try and be a successful team and it will need everyone pulling through the season in the same direction whether playing or not.<br /><br />To be fair to Oli, he’s been fantastic training and we’ll need him. Tammy has scored a lot of goals, scoring regularly, which is great for us. But Tammy needs to know that if his level drops you’ve got <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a> and (Michy) <a href="michy-batshuayi.html">Batshuayi</a> training well and trying to get into the first team.

I don’t like to mention other players but I think <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> is such a good role model for a young English player in roughly the same position to see the development and for me that is hard work behind the scenes that Raheem has brought into his game in all senses.

He has to get every ounce out of it and listen to me and listen to the staff.

I wouldn’t want the players to think that is some form of a double act in that sense. We can both have our moments and Joe Edwards and Chris Jones. We are a very tight-knit bunch and sometimes if you try to be the good cop as a manager consistently I’m not sure that’s the right tone. Sometimes a strong message comes out even if it is not nice to be heard for the group or a player it must come from the manager in my opinion so unfortunately, I have to be bad cop sometimes.<br /><br />I’ve had a couple of words occasionally but I’m not a manager that is full of rollockings as such. I like to have a message that is pretty clear over a period of time that I try and drive home and certainly if I ever felt there was a lack of effort in training or in-game then that would be the moment that I would go towards that but certainly the players are trying to take on messages in terms of when we are on the ball and stuff.<br /><br />That is not rollickings that is my job to keep enforcing it until we get it right. I think it depends on the player and the group and if there is a moment where you have to be very firm that might be seen or spoken about as a rollicking I think it should be given but you only do it if you want to get the right result from it so that’s what I mean. Regular rollickings become white noise and not a positive one but if you have found a moment where things were not right and you felt it was relating to the game, i come back to a lack of effort or application you should give that and see what result you get from it.</p>

  <p><b>[Frank Lampard has challenged <a href="mateo-kovacic.html">Mateo Kovacic</a> to end his goal drought]</b> The quality he has shown in big parts this season, and I think the natural progression is goals and we are working on that one. You might see a big smile if he scores, not just from me but from the group because we know he has the quality to score and that will be the next step. I think it’s commonplace for players coming from a foreign league to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> to have a period of settling in. And I think with <a href="mateo-kovacic.html">Kovacic</a> I thought there were some really good signs and positives from him last year.<br /><br />The fact he was changing in and out of the team is never easy, I get that. And now as a manager, I get that even more. I do think he feels at home now. Not that I knew how he was last year but his personality shines through in the group. He’s a very likeable character with a nice tough side to him, in terms of how I see him on the pitch and off the pitch. He’s a really good player. He’s now signed to the club, I get that that can make someone feel happy, and he’s been playing really well<br /><br /><b>[In the chaos of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s midweek 4-4 draw with <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> in the Champions League, <a href="kurt-zouma.html">Zouma</a> dribbled almost 60 yards before attempting a long-range strike that went over]</b> The bravery to step in with the ball. We like defenders to be able to step in but sometimes they don’t step in with too much pace it’s a worry with the traffic they go into. But he had the ability to dodge and double step over. I probably laughed because it’s not often you see a centre back doing that. Then he converted back to being a centre back with the finish. That made me laugh. In the bigger picture, it shows the confidence he is playing with.<br /><br />As happy as I am with that is as happy as I am with the way he has defended in the last period of games, him and Fikayo have formed a nice partnership. It’s great to have Andreas back now and Toni will be back because we need numbers in those positions. What Kurt has done, which is not easy, is to go out on loan where people then start to consider you something different to a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> player. But I never did. I told him very early in pre-season that I see him as part of my plans here. I believed in his qualities and tried to give him that confidence. He’s got better and better as the season has gone on. He’s a leader in the group. Strong physically to look at but also a quality player, so I’m delighted with how he’s played.<br /><br />I never had that one-on-one conversation with him. But going out on loan a couple of times could make you feel differently. I get coming back to your home club is maybe mentally a bit of a challenge but what I will say is he came back off a really good loan at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> last year and was very well spoken of. It was great for him to play regular games. You forget the serious, serious injury he had before that. He needed games. He felt confident in that team, as he should have done. Now he’s come back here. I’ve not had that real conversation with him on that front but maybe there was a touch of it earlier in the season but now he’s shown what he is worth to us here with the way he is playing</p>

  <p><b>[Lampard on how his pet Minnie and other superstitions impact <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s preparations]</b> Routines. Like walking the dog, or what time I leave, or the boots I wear in training, or little bits and bobs. It’s more routine than structure, which can be quite awkward. I walk the dog at certain times and on certain days. The day before training, I will walk her at a certain time, for a certain route. Nothing that exciting. I put the lead on. I take her out in the morning. I go out early before I leave, I take her down to the local coffee shop, get my takeaway coffee, walk around, pick up her shit, put it in the bin, walk her home then go to training. I walk the dog a lot and I find it quite good for clearing the head. I like to go to the gym as well - that’s another one of my superstitions. I have to spend the same amount of time on the bike - 50 minutes - or the amount that I run - things like that. I’m still sweating now. I’ve just been doing it.<br /><br />If I don’t do them, then I can feel like, ridiculously, as if it might have an effect on the result. Sometimes I do miss the dog walk for whatever reason. I’m also a relatively new dad, my daughter is a year and a bit, so sometimes I have to do other things etcetera. So it does not absolutely hold me down. But I don’t mind structure and I like walking the dog. So if it was painful, I would probably try and get rid of it, but it actually fits nicely. I like going to the gym, I like walking the dog, I like eating pasta as a pre-match meal, so I stick with certain things. I think we are all different, and I don’t completely rely on it. I joke a little bit, but I think it shows how much you want to do well and win sometimes, whether it has an effect or not. And I think if that’s in your mindset, that’s not the worst thing, albeit it might become a bit annoying sometimes if you stick to it<br /><br /><b>[Lampard earned his first manager of the month award for his perfect month in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, but coaches often lose their next game after winning the award prompting some to say it is cursed]</b> On the curse, I have heard of it. I know it and I am relatively superstitious. I was always as a player and I carry it into my management. So hopefully the players will go out and prove the curse wrong tomorrow because we want to carry on our momentum. I purely see it as a good month and it’s very early days. It will only resonate if it becomes a regular occurrence, or it means points and success for us as a club. That’s tough. I realise how tough it is. It was only three games in a month and we won all of them. I know the work that goes into that, I know the competition, so it resonates nicely but in the short term, I won’t get ahead of myself, even though it’s not been won here for a few years. It’s more just a signal of the competitive nature of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Probably. I don’t think I won one in the Championship last year, so yeah. I’m certainly not singing ‘I won it all’, because I was manager of the month!</p>

We started pretty well, if we get the early goal it feels a different game but, as the game went on, it became a bit broken, we were a bit slow with throw-ins, and re-taking free kicks, forward passes and I just felt if we increased the tempo the game was there to win.

  <p><b>[Lampard: Raw talent <a href="reece-james.html">Reece James</a> will become a big player for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> He’s got the abilities to go very, very far. It’s hard to cap that or not cap it, but what I see from him in training, I saw it in him at Wigan. Jody and Joe know him well from the youth teams here and speak highly of him of talents. I saw it last year and I’m seeing it now in training. When you see experienced players respect young players who come train with them and see the quality, it’s always a good sign. I’ve got huge belief that he can go as far as he wants to go in the game.<br /><br />I’ve seen so much improvement. His raw talent and ability was there to see today. This is just the start of the story. There is a lot more to add to that. He’s going to be a big, big player for this club. Right-back would be his favourite position. Whether right-back, or wing-back, or right of three centre backs, that would be his ideal position. At the moment as he’s coming into the team, you’ll see him there, but he does have that natural round game that he can handle playing centrally and in midfield, if need be.

I know his qualities from playing with him but when I looked at Willy over the last couple of years, he was in and out of the team. You’re not sure, from the outside, I want to see him happy. Willy is a happy, easy-going lad who loves his football and that was the first thing I said to him at the start of the season. I saw him being huge in the way I wanted to play. Naturally, on the ball, we all know his ability to go by, one v one, and shift people and cross or get shots away. But his off-the-ball work is an outstanding example for <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a>, for <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a>, for other young players who think the only part of the game is going by people, crossing or shooting<br /><br />He certainly has the Brazilian flair in terms of his touch and his feet but I know what you mean. His burst of pace away from people is somewhat Brazilian in some players but the selfless side of his game is always a starting point for me. As we worked as a staff here, it was about how good we could be off the ball. Then think about on the ball afterwards. For someone who is showing that example up the pitch, it reflects everywhere.

We spoke with the players and I gave the list to <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Azpilicueta</a> when we set out the fines. In fact, I was asking him if there were any areas you see because I wanted to know what happened last year, whether the players were happy, were they not. That came into the picture as well so it’s certainly a bit of a joint effort.<br /><br />Maybe the numbers were chosen by myself to a degree. I do think discipline is an important thing and I’m very happy to work with the players. I want to be successful. I expect them to look after each other on the pitch and when they train, so I expect them to respect each other in terms of turning up. If you talk about coming late to training, we arrive at 10 and we start training at 11.

People can have their own mind. But the players are certainly big in the setting up of that and I think it’s important to have discipline in the workplace. They were part of the process. I’m not here to be a dictator and make things difficult. We’re here to be successful as a football club and discipline’s part of it and I worked with them in putting it together.

I have got no problem with that.<br /><br />I think it was more a comment made in the emotions after the match. I think the reaction of me going to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, which was something I was concerned about after 13 years here. I wondered at 36 whether a year there was something I should take on because of what I feel about this club. And then my professional head, the challenge of it and the period I had where I wasn’t going to be playing before going to New York FC, all came together and made me take a decision which was quite tough at the time. But to see then the feeling I got from the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans on that day was an emotional thing for me and it hasn’t stopped from that day.<br /><br /><b>[Lampard says he pays no attention to the analysis of TV pundits]</b> When you work on the TV, in the media as a pundit, you have opinions to make about the way you see the game. Sometimes there are reasons for what you say. Sometimes it’s just your opinion on the game and I thought it was just someone else’s opinion. Sometimes you get too swayed by opinions of others, whoever they are, even though I respect Jose completely. My worry is <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, not really anybody else’s worry. It’s not his worry, particularly not now. But I’ve got no problem. And, as I say, if you were to look at the bigger games we’ve played, it could be quite loose to look at it and say: ‘Oh we haven’t won those games.’<br /><br />If you look at the performances against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, anyone who watched closely will see that we were possibly the better side in Istanbul and unlucky not to get at least a draw at home. And that’s <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> who are, as it stands, the best team in the country in terms of points, so I won’t look at it that closely. I look at where we are in the table. I look at where we can improve and I’ve got faith in the team as we go forward.<br /><br /><b>[Lampard went on to say that didn’t think his assistant Morris needed punishment after his ‘laughing emoji’ response to <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> on social media]</b> First of all, I don’t really do too much social media. I have one eye on it at times I think it is important to have your eye on it these days. I thought it was light-hearted. We’re all <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> boys and we care deeply about the team. Sometimes you listen to a lot of stuff and sometimes you have to take a lot of stuff on the chin. I think it was very small fry and not a problem for me. Yes, you have to be careful with social media but I know the work and care put in and where we want to get to, so I’m not concerned by small, one, two, three worded tweets</p>

I don’t want to hide that from the players and double bluff them - they are playing well and they should know that.

I’ve been really happy with a lot of our stuff this season, so maybe that means we’re slightly ahead of the curve.

I like to see them disappointed - it just shows the next question is the reaction we have.

I wouldn’t say that, but it’s a balance where I can put forward a recommendation and have an open conversation with the owner and hope we move forward in the right direction. I’m very open about that. My biggest thing here is how hard can we work on the training ground because I know we have a good squad, that’s my main concern. Of course, when it comes to recruitment, I want to have a big say in it and we are very open<br /><br />I haven’t banned the talk but I am not going to set out to engage in it. If players want to come and see me and talk then I will happily have a conversation with them individually but that hasn’t happened. I think the thing with the young players. I haven’t felt the need to have that conversation. I speak to them regularly. I can be, not hard on them, but I push them and drive them if I can in training because I think they need that but, I do think they feel the trust I have in them because with all of them they know I’m prepared to give them the opportunities and chances if they train well and they come in the team and play well, so I haven’t needed to have the conversation about who may come in. I think they should naturally feel a little bit of tension all the time so that’s not the worst thing. They also just need to work and believe in their own talents because their talent is there for all to see and we have to be patient with that because it may take different periods of time for them to fully blossom as players. <b>[There]</b> might be a period in and out of the team, have a run of the games and then not. I am prepared to stick with them through that because I really believe in them.<br /><br />If I start to look at where I can strengthen the squad, it’s certainly not going to be a slant on the young players or anything. I think we all here have seen this summer and what’s happened here since the summer that the idea of going into the academy and giving these boys a chance is a really good one because they have deserved it. They haven’t been getting that so much in the past so I do think maybe we have changed our minds a little bit on that one, Of course, we do need to stay competitive, that will never change but people have been very pleased to see that and I certainly am. I think that is the balance and in an ideal world, that’s what you have. We now from investment and time spent in the academy that was always the desire you want players to come through it helps you in terms of producing yourself and then at the same time whatever your club is striving you want to bring in players around that so that’s the clear balance we are looking for</p>

Whether I’ve been proven right or whatever, the best way to put that is now we have the reality, that if we’re not at our best, if we haven’t got enough to break teams down that are organised, if players with their individual quality and personality can’t do something to beat teams that are organised, then we need to find another way. That’s a test and that’s hard work needed for us</p>

  <p><b>[Lampard: <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s players need to take responsibility in front of goal]</b> I don’t think that’s a training ground thing. It is more an on-pitch thing because there is talent in that room that can break a low block with a certain pass, a moment. Firstly, you want to take that moment and take it on and not be safe.<br /><br />Secondly, you have to execute it. Today we didn’t do both enough. I think you can work towards it with how you coach, with how you speak to the players and how you trust in them but the final deal is what goes out on the pitch there today. So a lot of that is what we do out there. I don’t want to isolate their bravery because we have to be a collective and a group. On a day like today, you have to have players who can break that moment. The whole stadium felt it was a slightly flat day so you say, okay, the responsibility is on the players.<br /><br />Today, we spent a lot of time in their half, in the first half, particularly. It is in attacking areas of the pitch <b>[where we need that magic]</b>. We know we concede a lot and that’s probably the nature of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> in the modern-day. You even look at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> who are flying but they haven’t kept many clean sheets themselves at times. That’s maybe how it is slightly but we need to score more. That’s for sure. Going into this game, it was clear that we are creating far too many chances that we are not taking<br /><br />Yes, maybe. I think that a little bit of fatigue can be part of the picture and we will look at that behind the scenes. Probably more for training, a long week. We have had a spell now of game after game after game. Sometimes that feels good when you are winning consistently. Now we have had difficult results so it might be good for us to go over some things on the training pitch</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> boss Lampard: <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> taught me how to bond with young players]</b> I suppose when you say is there anything I take from Jose, maybe my answer could have been and should have been that when he first came to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, I had played under different managers. <a href="harry-redknapp.html">Harry Redknapp</a> was my uncle, so that relationship was there, but he was the first manager that day-to-day made me feel really close to him. We worked on the mental side without working on it; it was just this confidence that he gave me which forms a bond. He did form a bond with me. Working with the younger players that we have here now, it is my duty to try and form my bond with them. They are at the start of their journey and career. They need to look up to, not just myself, but the staff and know what it takes to get to where they want to be, so if I can form that bond with the players <b>[then it is good]</b>. I love all the young boys here; they are all really good players so I try to do that<br /><br />It is just a constant. It is a constant with how you are with them every day. How much you want to work with them on the training ground. How much you want to maybe sometimes delve into their personal lives, have a word about it and make sure that they are OK. I think all those things where they feel comfortable with the way they interact with you is huge. I think that’s a line you have to make sure you get right and I like to think I do. But, you would have to ask the players that. It is not like I am hanging about with them playing PlayStation and stuff! I do draw the line somewhere<br /><br />It made me feel great, it made me feel great. Moments like that, it becomes very easy as you get older to not jump back into the 24-year-old’s head and understand what things like that make them feel. It doesn’t have to be you are the best player in the world but it is positive talking in some ways about where they want to get to with an overlying edge about the way you work every day. When Jose said that to me, it wasn’t like I went and did step-overs all day. It was drive, drive, drive and to try to be that and win titles. It was a really well-put message, so yes, I would try to do that with players. His imprint on the squad and what he did to us in his time at the club us was huge, of course! He took a very talented team that came second the year before that was bursting as a club to win the title and he played a massive part in that. We won back-to-back titles in a fantastic way and, of course, as manager he takes huge credit</p>

I knew he had that talent before I got the job. If there was one thing I wanted from him at the start of the season it was a question of: ‘Can you score more goals because your talent says that you should do?’ That means sometimes running into space behind defenders, and getting the other side, and he is doing all those things. The last year or two I have looked at him from afar and wasn’t sure how much he was enjoying it, whether he felt happy in games. A bit of body language, in and out sometimes. My feeling at the start of the season was to tell him how much I feel about him and how I see him; get him fit, get him working off the ball because I know he can. And the rest in terms of what he does on the ball I can kind of let him do that, because he has this incredible ability to burst away from people</p>

When it <b>[the No. 9 shirt]</b> was mentioned, it made me think twice and go, ‘Oh, actually, what is the situation here?’ because he is a young boy.<br /><br />If you’re signing a 25-year-old who has scored multiple goals in a different league or in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> you might see it differently and it would be a really easy decision, but the question with a young boy is does he need that pressure? My opinion was yes.<br /><br />I saw him coming through the ranks here for such a long time from being a young boy and for me, it was like he must have always wanted to be <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s No.9. That was his aim at all times. I know he used to idolise <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a>. So he thought, ‘I want to be <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s mainline striker’ and the No.9 is generally that so I thought it was an opportunity for him to rise to that hopefully<br /><br /><b>[Lampard says he is ready to let <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Olivier Giroud</a> go and he thinks having Abraham and <a href="michy-batshuayi.html">Michy Batshuayi</a> is enough for a team that normally plays with just one striker]</b> We have some adaptable players in our team who could take up different roles so that would have to come into my thinking <b>[if a striker got injured]</b>. Again, that’s my job. I’m going into it now. I have to make those decisions as I go along. I also have to think about the makeup of the squad, the spirit of the squad and I also have a human level where I look at people and players, how they are, how they train and how the squad could be affected in lots of different ways.
<b>[about <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a>’s attitude]</b>, he is an absolute professional<br /><br />Oli has been great as well and I respect him for that and that slightly comes into my thinking as well.

He’s not silly. You know who your competitors are whether it is to get into our team or the England team. So those things you see the environment about yourself. What I love about Tammy is that it just won’t be <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>, he would do well but he should be taking markers from <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>’s game himself.

And he is certainly a player that gets slightly misjudged on age. I think he’s been around a long time and went on loan at a young age and did particularly well and people think that he’s probably older than he is. He’s still relatively young so that’s absolutely on his side</p>

He came to me a couple of weeks ago and he said to me that he’s just starting to feel good. It was a niggling injury and he’s just starting to feel released from it.<br /><br />Today was the performance we want out of Ross, it was so positive. You saw his quality on the ball. He can hit the right-foot ball, left-foot ball, take the ball well. He looked confident today. That’s part of Ross’ game that you could question from the outside: how confident is he when things go against him?<br /><br />We know exactly what Ross can do. He is an England player, he is playing for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and deservedly so. He has given me a lot of thinking to do with that performance today. I do have my issues in terms of my selection here but I have no winners in terms of who I like more or less. ‘He is a better bloke than that one’ - no. It’s what works for us. It’s what’s good out on the pitch.<br /><br />Ross was a selection where people might have thought: ‘Oh, Ross and <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> in midfield?’ - they both showed why they should be there today. It’s not easy for the midfielders. I’ve had to have little difficult conversations with pretty much all of them at some point this season.

Mind you, you can probably Google it. What I will say is there are two sides to it and I read Ross’s statements.<br /><br />The first side is you should always look at yourself and I always said that about myself when I got it wrong. So look at yourself and don’t mention about anything else because society and members of the public you can’t control. The second side, I agree with, there are too many smartphones but that’s the second part of the argument because we are all so aware that there are a lot of smartphones so we are aware we have to change your way of living.<br /><br />How much you trust the people you are around, your friends, all these things, unfortunately, or whatever, that’s the way the world has gone. I think you still come back to yourself and make sure you firstly act professionally and secondly be aware of those things because you can’t control the fact that the world has changed. I think we went to <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a> when I got asked about that, my biggest concern was not really the bag of chips it was more the fact that we were training the next day. That is exactly where I see it and Ross knows that and I am not one to tell my lads don’t have a bag of chips, don’t have a few beers after you win a game.<br /><br />Just make sure that when you think about the big scheme, you do it with the idea you have to train and perform at a level and as the game has moved forward and the speed and intensity of it even more so from my day, from eras gone by, the players have to be absolutely tip-top or this game will find you out.

But the reality of it is, when you get those opportunities, whether it’s ten minutes coming on to try and affect a game, or starts in whatever game they are, you need to try and absolutely make an impact.

We caused our own problems. It is a hard one. We work hard in front of goal and it is not coming off for us. It is going to define you. I feel like a broken record.

Of course, we want Michy firing and scoring goals like he did today and when he trains he needs to stay at that level because today we needed him.<br /><br />I said yesterday, he trains as I want him to train and that’s not easy when you are not playing as much as you want to do but you have to go the extra mile to show that you deserve to play.

His goal was slightly fortunate but I like that. That’s how goal scorers should score those kind of goals but I just want him to keep delivering when he is training and when the opportunities come. We are at that level of football which is quite demanding and everyone judges strikers on goals and I think Michy has that in him. So I want to see a bit more</p>

But if I’m looking at it with my business head on and looking around us in the table and I look at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> obviously signing a big, big player, a world-class player, in my opinion. The teams around us, <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> making fantastic signings, <a href="chris-wilder.html">Chris Wilder</a>’s job is incredible because he’s had years to work that group and now they’re adding where he sees fit.<br /><br /><a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have signed a few and they’re not far behind us. And not only have they signed a few, but a couple of players have left were obviously - not being too crude about it - the situation was they were towards the end of their contracts and maybe weren’t happy being at the club any more.<br /><br />Sometimes that’s as important as bringing players in. It’s changing the feeling of the group if players are not wanting to be there so that’s obviously smart business on that part. Now what remains to be seen will be seen and from my view - and this is not to talk down ourselves because we’re six points clear in fourth - now we become probably the underdogs and the outsiders to some point because the teams around us have strengthened. It’s a fact<br /><br />I don’t think there’s any specific point where a deal falls down. It could be early or towards the end but if we haven’t got anything done, that is all that really matters.

For the next four months because as we have seen in recent games, there have been times when little elements aren’t coming off for us. Finishing being the main one. And with young players, as much as I want to sit here and drive and drive them, we have to accept that sometimes there are players who are young, were playing football in the Championship last year, or youth football last year and coming into the first team is very tough for them.<br /><br />I know our fans will give us that trust and we certainly need it to keep pushing for that this season. The reality is I have an idea here as well of where I want to get to and I don’t think any knee-jerk reaction from myself or from the club would have been positive either.<br /><br />If you are not going to improve and it’s late like that, I don’t even want to listen to that. I want to work to a longer-term plan and have trust in that. Now if you look at the history of clubs, and this club, there are lots of players who moved in that last moment and it didn’t work out and maybe they are on loan, or maybe they are sat in the squad three years later and not playing. And that’s not what I want. I want everyone here to absolutely be able to put a shift in and be a positive for the squad. So yes, I wouldn’t want that knee-jerk reaction late signing, if it’s not better than what we have got, for sure<br /><br /><b>[<a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a>, <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a> and even 15-goal striker <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> have all had periods where they are primary targets of criticism this season. Lampard admits he has had to use them more than he would have liked due to not having the players he wants in all areas of the pitch]</b> Possibly there will be that situation. I’ve asked a lot already. At times I haven’t been able to rest in certain areas of the pitch. If I do rest people question why because some of the young have been the top performers. But I don’t want to make it just about the young. Everybody has to react. Whatever your situation at the club or thinking that’s football.<br /><br />Everyone is in a different situation individually. Everyone has to push and be on edge. It can’t be nicey nicey now for us until the end of the season. In every training session and in every game we play, we have to be absolutely on top of ourselves if we want that fourth place.<br /><br />I have to be the first person who remains positive, no matter what, and I have to be truthful when I speak out loud. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans are sitting listening and I respect them for that and they want the best. We know that recruitment is huge for a team that wants to be successful.<br /><br />Look no further than <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in recent years. But it’s a fact. People will get bored if I keep crying about that fact. I have to work. The players have to work. I think at the start of the season a lot of fans, a lot of pundits from the outside, nobody had us in their top four. Nobody.<br /><br />I think people were saying ‘maybe if you’re in the top eight we understand, top 10 maybe we understand’. Obviously not fighting relegation but we understand. I think now probably because there was a period where we were ahead of the curve expectations were ‘ooh we’re hanging on in fourth that’s not good, that result’s not good’ because expectations change. I get that. Expectations change. But the reality is that now that we’re in fourth but it’s going to be a real big fight. And we have to be up for that challenge. Young, middle, more experienced players. But the first person that’s up for that is me<br /><br /><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s frustrations in the transfer window are further compounded by losing their recent debutant from the academy Tariq Lamptey]</b> It’s Tariq Lamptey’s choice.

But, of course, we’ll be happy to have him back<br /><br />Yes, he was good. That’s not new, that’s been his recent form. He had a small injury and missed the game against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and Hull. But he’s a weapon for us. He can attack with his crossing but we need to get on the end of them more. And he’s also very solid defensively. When you think of his age, you can get excited about Reece. There is a lot more he can obviously do but I’m really pleased with how he’s developing at the minute<br /><br />There are all the sides of his game he can work on, although I’m not going to improve his crossing, I don’t think, because he’s a natural. But we can talk about his position, his link-up with the winger in front of him and the midfield players, and his defensive attributes because they are first and foremost. And making sure he is always in the right areas. And he is very open to that, as he should be. Like all the young players at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are, they are sponges, they want to learn. They want to listen. So you enjoy coaching them because they want to get better<br /><br />I will take a few days off. I’m not travelling anywhere far afield but it will be nice to spend some family time. This job is consuming and I’ve probably given my wife too much chat about football when we’ve been having dinner and stuff. Sometimes I get told that so I’ll try to refrain for a few days and then get back to work. I know it has been talked about a lot, particularly because of the <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> situation, but there are lot of people in a football club who work intensely and the players do a lot of travelling and so on, so I think we’re all for it.

Even if those goals and assists aren’t quite coming, he will fight his way through it, no problem.<br /><br />Individually you suffer periods of form and as a young player, you have to understand even more and be more sensitive to the fact that can affect confidence because they’ve been thrust into the team this year and it’s new and the eyes of the world are on them, and that’s a big deal.<br /><br />It’s a test for the younger players and I think with the physical nature of the league over the year it was always going to come, we would have little dips, and how they come out of it would be the making of them. It’s always the same. It’s how they train, it’s how they work, it’s the focus that they have which will bring them through. I believe in all fo them, whether they’re in dips or not.

  <p><b>[Lampard insists that youth isn’t a problem for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> I don’t think it’s inexperience. You can look at the youth in the squad and perhaps that’s an easy conclusion. Perhaps that’s part of it but it’s not easy to pinpoint. The clinical nature of not scoring, the sloppy nature of having a lapse which gives a team with one or two shots a goal, which has happened a couple of times at home. Is it experience, quality? There’s a lot of things to it.<br /><br />This period is what all <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs suffer. As young players you have to be even more aware that it can affect their confidence, because they’re new to the team and the eyes of the world are on them. It’s a big deal and a test for the younger players and I think with the physical nature of the league over the course of the season then there were always going to be little dips.<br /><br />The players will certainly come out of it better. It’s how they train, how they play.

Maybe not ideal timing but I don’t want to get too drawn into it because I am the manager of the team and don’t want to look too far <b>[ahead]</b>. Some of the headlines this week had a sense of frustration for me because we’re working day-to-day to finish this season and we’re not jumping ahead to the summer. Willy’s one is an ongoing situation. It’s not over. We’ll see<br /><br /><b>[Lampard says that he has a difficult task picking a centre-back from his options]</b> I have four centre-backs to choose from, so generally every week two of them are unhappy. And then people question you when you stick with a back two or back three. There is competition in that area. With Fiks, he always has to train at the top level, that goes for all of the young players because when you are out of the team, however much it hurts, you need to show a good attitude and train very well. At the moment he is and he has a long career ahead of him at this club, without a doubt. It’s been more about selection issues<br /><br /><b>[He believes that his young players have made a big impact on the squad]</b> Sometimes it’s been the young lads earlier this season who have stepped up and that was great. And sometimes they have had it difficult. So I don’t get too caught up in that conversation. Maturity will come for them, that’s why we have to give them some leeway this year. For Mason and Reece on Tuesday night it was a huge game for them in terms of their learning curve<br /><br />I didn’t play my first Champions League game until I think my mid-twenties and for me it was an uplift for me at that level, let alone at their age. Reece was playing at Wigan in the Championship and Mason was at Derby with myself. And now they are going up against Thiago and the flying machine Davies from <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, who is an incredible looking player - and <a href="serge-gnabry.html">Gnabry</a> as well. It was a huge test. Make no bones about it. It was a difficult night for them.<br /><br />It’s not just those players. <a href="mateo-kovacic.html">Kovacic</a> has been to the final with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Azpi</a> has been to the semi-final here. But if you go through the rest of the starting eleven, there are players who are either new to Champions League football - with Ross I think it was his first knock-out stage - or they are players who have got to the last 16.<br /><br />We have to be real, we have to be honest. We can’t pull the wool over our own eyes and think all of a sudden we have a divine right at this level to go up against <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> and beat them. There’s a reason why we are where we are at the moment. We have not challenged in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> for a couple of years. We have to fight and work as hard as we can on the training pitch and in games to close that gap. Come the summer, we want to move forward and make some decisions. But the gap is there. Tuesday showed that. But that should not dishearten us - now it’s how we finish the season.<br /><br />I think the landscape of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has changed. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have set incredible standards in the league, and also we had some outside influences with the ban and with circumstance, a huge player left the club. Those things are there. We are certainly on the same page here when I speak with the board and we have all our conversations, there is no doubt we know we are fighting for fourth place.<br /><br />It is a very dated phrase, when people say: ‘You’re <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, there’s no way you should be happy with fourth’. No, <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has changed. It is not like it was for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> players 15 or 20 years ago, or <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> players when we were first or second for a period in the mid-2000s. It’s not like that any more and that is the reality. We do want to climb and bridge the gap and I strongly believe we will. But I am very aware of what that is. The players need to be aware of it and we are as a club</p>

I remember them linking and raising their arms when they drew 0-0 with West Brom. Probably slightly ridiculed for it at the time but it is now symbolic of the journey of this team that is now an absolute machine, rolling everyone over until the last game. So, it’s a reference point in terms of when you see what a work in progress looks like. It can take time and behind a team that wins so many on the bounce is a lot of sweat and hard work from everyone involved, which is what I am trying to do here. There will be tough times, many tough times, when I’ll be questioned, <b>[the players will]</b> be questioned. We have to stay tough within that<br /><br />As part of their journey, they have signed some fantastic players at the right times, ones that feel pivotal. <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> and Alisson, the keeper - they have a great knack of signing the right player at the right time that suits the way they want to play and keep moving forward.

I’m under no illusions but what I do understand is that behind their story is a lot of hard work they have been prepared to do<br /><br />That will always be something that will not be in my control. And you have to look at the landscape changing. That is the debate, about where we are as a club now and what squad we have now to what we have had in previous years. We just have to work with what is in front of us and that is to try to win games. There’ll be many managers in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> this year that will be looking at their wins or points totals and it’s nowhere near where they were at different times because this league has proved very competitive - barring <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> of course and a bit of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>.

It’s not one I jump ahead to broach. I keep coming back to the same thing: it’s how well you train, and he is training well, and when you get the opportunity to play, how well you play. He must have a positive attitude and I think I’m a pretty fair man - I don’t know if all the players will say that! Maybe 11 will tomorrow and then another 11 next week! That’s the nature of my job. I only call it as I see it, as I see training and performances. So I hope all the players remain positive and, of course, he can play for his country. He’s shown that already. He’s been number one at times ahead of <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a>, who is a fantastic, world-class goalkeeper, so that hopefully isn’t a big issue at the moment.

Every game’s different, but you have to have a mindset within the group, on the pitch, because those things are not unexpected. We spoke at half-time, for instance, about what may happen, what they may do, and then you rely on the players on the pitch. So together they have to solve issues. It’s been a problem. It’s always collective. As a group, we can’t be happy with it. This group has young players and experienced players and you can’t be happy when you have moments when you concede like that. I don’t think it matters how young you are, it isn’t naivety, I think there is a concentration issue. We have to concentrate even more.<br /><br />Games change with goals - the atmosphere in the stadium, the feelings of the other team. Sometimes you need to dig in and concentrate that little bit more as a group. We’ve been tested with that a lot and we talk about it a lot, but the players have to find a solution on the pitch.<br /><br />At the other end of the scale, I think if we are clinical with our chances those moments aren’t there so much.

Because we are in the sport that we are in, I thought <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> said it pretty well afterwards, you are not supposed to, not allowed to as such, but when you talk about natural reactions, I understand it, particularly with a family member.<br /><br />I didn’t see anything go beyond slightly heated, which is good thing, so we will see how it is dealt with, but I think it should be understood that if <a href="eric-dier.html">Dier</a> saw his brother in a situation, then I understand his thought process. I think its what it was, I took some abuse over the years, I have seen teammates take abuse, I know some of my family members and friends that have been in earshot of abuse, so I don’t think it has changed.

  <p><b>[Lampard: <a href="ross-barkley.html">Barkley</a> wants more from his <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> career after having the wonderkid tag]</b> I have choices not just in Ross but in that area. All the players have been out at times. Ross probably had a longer time out and had an injury that was a niggly one that was around for the best part of six weeks. Some of that was around the early part of the season where Ross wasn’t getting in. He could look at himself and say he could be doing better, probably. But Ross has taken that on in the most positive way possible. He has worked hard, got his nose in the team and he does need confidence as a player. I believe that. So, to try and play him, give him minutes, is always going to help with confidence. If he plays like he did against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> recently, then he is going to be a big player for this club. I have been pleased with his recent performances and he needs to keep churning them out. I definitely know he has the intention to. I see it on the training pitch and how he holds himself every day in this period, so I am happy with Ross<br /><br /><b>[Lampard admits that it isn’t easy for players to deal with the hype]</b> I never had that <b>[wonderkid hype]</b>. You see certain players have had that harder pressure at 18 years old and that’s not easy for anybody. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is competitive and tough. It is very easy to make those early conclusions on players without knowing there’s a long path and everyone’s route is different. What Ross can say is that he has moved on from it and come to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> which is a big club. If he is playing games here at a big club then that’s a success. <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> is very confident of picking him for England and he has played a lot of minutes for them. I know he will want more and I get that. He might be wishing he made more minutes by now and made more impact here at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. Some of that is competition for places and some of that is injuries he has had at different times in his career and the reality is there is no point on looking back on any of that. He can look back when he is 35 or 40 or something. I think Ross has a lot to offer.<br /><br />I think players are different. Ross is different, Mason is different, <a href="ruben-loftus-cheek.html">Ruben Loftus-Cheek</a> is different. I get that <b>[he wants to be a goalscoring midfielder]</b>. I think what Ross will be searching for is minutes to play regularly to get the consistency to do what he was able to do the other night against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> because it is clearly within his powers. His shooting with his right foot and left foot is as good technically as I have seen on a training pitch. I knew that as a player. Also, his ability to go passed someone in advanced areas in midfield, his skill and ability to do that. So I think that’s well within his range so he couldn’t get too caught up in where he is at, where he is, what might have been other than to train every day which is what he is doing at the minute. When you see that, you see he is a really good player for us, so he can be that goal scoring midfielder. I don’t like to compare it for sure, but he can definitely be a good player for us. Not just a goalscoring midfielder, he can play, run and tackle. He can do a lot of things and he can do all that</p>

Then we’ve had inconsistencies recently. Who hasn’t, other than <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, in this league?

If you don’t move it quickly, firstly you don’t get the rhythm in our play and it breaks down from, and secondly if you give it away in those areas, it is dangerous.<br /><br />I was going to use a rude word there, but you need… confidence to do that. <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a> has it and Billy has it. One of the most pleasing things with Billy was he showed those balls in the first half, but when he stepped up and played higher up in the pitch second half, he instantly took it on board, arriving in the box and playing balls higher up the pitch. He showed he can do both, which is a great thing for me when I’m thinking about how the midfield looks at times.<br /><br /><b>[On whether he saw signs of maturity from his team after a tricky spell]</b> I don’t think we’re there yet. It would be easy for me to say it after today but I’d much rather say it in mid-May, when the last game is. To think we’re there and to think that we’ve got over the issues, even at home, would be too over-confident and think we are all right. We are improving in big degrees. We have to keep working. I see a bigger picture, an even longer run than that. I think we have a gap that is big to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in terms of points. At the minute, it feels like we’re working in the right direction, but we’ve got lots of work to do</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> boss Lampard warns players must not get coronavirus tests ahead of key workers]</b> The idea of the health and safety of the players is huge. The country has practiced social distancing so well and the fact we play this contact sport that we are so desperate to see for a form of escapism, if anything, so how are we not going to put the players at risk within that? The other issue is talking about the testing that we are going to be doing. We probably have 70 or 80 staff at Cobham, minimum, if we are going to restart training. If we’re going to test regularly, then that’s fine. But when when we’re looking around the world - and I don’t know the testing numbers for the NHS and careworkers, these people that are doing incredible roles over the last two months or so - I don’t think it would sit well, not just with me but with anybody, if we didn’t make sure the people that are getting tested are on that front line. That’s important for football to take its place. After that, we probably have the football issues, which would be neutral venues and out of contract players, of which we have a couple of major players, so there are many conversations and I think that’s very clear at the minute</p>

  <p><b>[Frank Lampard has described <a href="n-golo-kante.html">N’Golo Kante</a> as one of the best players in the world]</b> We had four or five of those <b>[injured players]</b> when we finished playing recently. <a href="n-golo-kante.html">N’Golo Kante</a> is obviously a great example because he’s played four or five incredible seasons in terms of his individual success and he’s been used quite rightly by his managers a lot. This season he’s played only about 40% of our games and even then it’s been difficult for him and I’ve really felt for him on an individual level. He’s been a huge miss for us.

I knew that before I became manager of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and know that now from working with him.

In terms of how we have worked in the last period, the players have all been conforming to government regulations. We have plans and we have tried to vary it week-by-week. It has been a long time now with the players in this situation. Some of them have been able to go to Cobham if they live close to our training ground and work there in probably a safer environment. Of course, on their own and they all get their own slots so they don’t see anybody else who has just gone. I think most clubs are doing something similar.

I didn’t want to bombard them so they were bored of me but I did want them to know that I’m here. As the talk of restarting came it was an important conversation that we had collectively.

I think you just have to accept that as part of it, and I try not to make that the focal point.

That’s how I felt as a player and I certainly respected the managers who were up front with me, even if they were giving me bad news sometimes<br /><br />I wouldn’t say players spoke about it much. I think players tend to be very much in the moment and I probably was like that to a degree as well. I wouldn’t have sat there and spoken too much with other players about it, and some of my former team-mates who have gone into management have surprised me. I’ve read that some others are surprised I’ve done it, because of how I was as a player.

We’ve had discussions about that with the players. It will be different for everyone. It may change the pace of the game, it might change the slight tone of it. We’ve seen that slightly in Germany and we need to be ready to adapt to that. All we can do really is get ourselves as fit as possible. That’s been a difficult task in the short term, to get fit when we’re used to longer pre-seasons. We have worked hard on that, and when it comes to match days we’ll have to make sure we’re very ready for the changes from the norm, and make sure it doesn’t affect our performance on the pitch<br /><br />With so much time off, and so much time to sit and scrutinise the table and your positions, for everyone, there is going to be so much spotlight on this.

We’re just trying to make that extension happen. The players have to be happy. We have to be happy. Hopefully, we can get there before the 23rd of June, next week, because that’s the day we have to get it done by. Anyone around us knows that.

I will never be one to come down too harshly, albeit we have had conversations, myself and Callum. The big conversations with Callum now is to make sure he learns his lesson from what happened. He broke lockdown and that wasn’t good enough. He has admitted that and we move on. The next thing is to train consistently at a really high level to work hard in training every day. He came back from lockdown and got injured early in this period so now he has to work hard to get fit again. As much as the pitfalls off the pitch I want to see how he can work on the training pitch and get into this team, and perform to levels we all believe he can. It doesn’t come easy.

He trained for a period with the small sessions, socially distanced type training, but he’s been training with us as a group for a while now.

As I say, that’s been sorted out in the short term. He’s training and he’s happy.<br /><br />I think we haven’t done any business in the last two windows. I’m pleased with the business we’ve done.

One thing I really realised coming into this job, I was here a long time as a player, but as manager people will consistently ask you about your relationship with the board and the owner et cetera. I hope that this shows how we’ve worked together, all of us, with how we work, with recruitment, scouting and all playing our roles, in trying to bring the right players and being joined up.

I know this year from within some of the obstacles or the things that we’re sometimes working against or with trying to do as well as we can. Of course, bringing in players that we feel are improvements, you have to go and then show that. So that will be up to the individuals themselves, and it will be my job as well. So if the pressure ramps up that will be fair enough. We do know that there is a big gap going upwards when you look at the performance of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and City in the last couple of years.<br /><br />So we need to really work to try and close that gap and we have to be ready to give the players that come in, the two we’re talking about, time for adaptation to the league. We hope it’s not that much, we really believe in their qualities, but we want to be working towards closing that gap above us.<br /><br />It is going to be tough and it is hard to make predictions on how many points. You want every point that’s on the table and that would get us to the position we want to be in but there’s a lot of tough games in that run-in. Any run-in would be tough in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> so it is just a battle and we will have to take the games as they come, remain focused on ourselves and not try and look around too much because if we can focus on ourselves and get the right results, then it can look after ourselves.

We are aware of that but we will try and do our best. In terms of next season, yes, a club like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and how we are, we want to be in the Champions League. The players will always want to be in the Champions League so it is something we want to try and do. If not, we have to be realistic because of the competition.

But what he has shown, particularly of late, is a real desire in training. He looks sharp, is always giving advice and lifts everybody with his body language. He is an infectious character and he can be one of our most important players until the end of the season<br /><br />We all know about <a href="willian.html">Willian</a>’s ability on the ball. But his off-the-ball work is an outstanding example for <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a>, <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a> and other young players who think the only part of the game is going by people, crossing or shooting. He certainly has that classic Brazilian flair in terms of his touch and his quick feet but the selfless side of the game is the ideal starting point for me when it comes to evaluating players and he does the hard graft brilliantly and with absolute humility. He’s been a joy to work with and is one of the experienced players who is helping the young boys.</p>

And when I say Mason, I mean Billy (Gilmour) and Reece (James) in the same breath because they show similar attitude<br /><br />There was no problem with Mason because it was a one-off game, I had to make a decision and it doesn’t affect my thinking for <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> or going forwards. Mason played 90 minutes in both the first two games after the restart, and was unfortunate not to score or have an assist. So he had two big performances in a week. And then with the <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> game Mason didn’t have a bad performance and my choices to change were more about the players I could bring into that performance as opposed to the ones that were on the pitch<br /><br />I could make a lot of changes in that game, so it was more about, ‘Can I bring some energy into the team? So I rely on Mason a lot, I did at Derby, I do at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, he brings so much to the team in his work ethic and the way he can start the press in midfield.

I also think the result of that is not concrete either - you will either have your best of games in that sort of circumstance but you can also become overly focused on that relationship and have a not so good game They are two very good players. But there is only one thing I will ask of Mason - and from my point of view that is obviously all I care about going into this one. He texts him tonight, he smiles at him in the tunnel or whatever it is, but if and when they go up against each other he has try to beat him in every individual battle that he possibly can.

The club are still in discussions with him. We want him to stay at the club, but I also appreciate this contract for him is a big deal because of his age and where he’s at. I’ve been there before myself, and I respect that. The way he’s playing at the minute, he’s shown his worth to the squad. It’s something I hope we can get to, whatever way with <a href="willian.html">Willian</a>, he’s been a great servant to the club, if we can get it I’ll be happy, but if not I’ll certainly wish him well because I’ve got a lot of time for him. It’s ongoing, in short.<br /><br /><b>[Asked if the club would target taller players in the next transfer window]</b> We looked at set-piece stats from last season when we came into the club. Last season, we were bottom of the league in defending set plays, in terms of other teams getting big chances against us. We were second bottom in attack. We looked at that, but that’s not just a reference to last season because we haven’t improved much this year. If you look at personnel, I really don’t like talking about my days of playing, but we didn’t really work on set-pieces at all. Certain managers more than others. There were probably a few reasons why; <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a>, <a href="gary-cahill.html">Gary Cahill</a>, <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a>, <a href="michael-ballack.html">Michael Ballack</a> and <a href="branislav-ivanovic.html">Branislav Ivanovic</a>. You stick it into an area and they defend it or score goals. I think similar with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, I remember a lot of talk about them on set pieces two seasons ago. They were zonal, conceded a lot. They sign <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> and he heads everything that comes into the box out.<br /><br />So there’s a huge relation to personnel, and if you don’t have a big size across the team, I think trying to compete and make it difficult for other teams to score is the main thing. I’m not trying to make excuses as we haven’t done that well enough on the pitch. That has to improve. When you look at who you might bring in, with the balance of the squad, in the modern day it’s certainly something to take into account when you’re looking at recruitment.</p>

I think it’s a dangerous game to comment on every pundit because you would probably have to have conversations with all of your players every week. That’s the nature of the beast and what we do. Yes, if I felt a player needed help or support in those situations, I would do, but I think we as players and myself are the biggest self-critics. We analyse games and go over them, talk with players individually or collectively. That’s my main focus, not so much what comes from outside<br /><br />It’s much easier to comment from afar, we do try to play football, we try and be progressive but we don’t do that at the idea of wanting to concede goals.<br /><br />Recovery runs are a huge part of football and the players must do them whether it’s the first or 90th minute. I don’t think it’s quite fair to just look at Marcos - in that isolated incident yes he can recover and we can recover better as a team, but that has to be something fundamental to the team<br /><br />You have to run backwards as much as you run fast forwards, and you have to have the desire to make difficult runs to help the team. I can’t complain about the team with that this year<br /><br />When you isolate one goal, that is so crucial because it wins the points, then fair enough, but I know with my players that generally we have a desire to press off the ball and when it goes beyond us, to recover and get there. It was a game where we slipped up, not just with that mistake but other mistakes, and we lost the game for it</p>

He had a special talent straight away, of being able to receive a ball, have great balance and go past players so well. He would draw a lot of players towards him to open up space for others - he was pretty unselfish in how he would make assists.<br /><br />Christian is possibly more direct, in terms of how he goes past players and runs off the ball - which I like. Eden would come and get the ball and take it past players a lot. With Christian, he has real ability to break a line and run forward, which is a really great trait in the modern game.<br /><br />In terms of the comparison, and why I stayed away from it a bit; Eden has been here and done it, to an incredible level. Christian has it in his hands to go and make a real impact over a period of time. The thing I’m so happy with now is that when we’re finding it hard to break teams down, he’s taking responsibility to change that by using his ability to turn quickly and go past people.

But as a young player it is always clear when you have these periods there is only one way out of it and that is work and repetition in training. I think that is where Tammy is at. I think the contract will hopefully look after itself between him and the club and he just needs to focus on giving us that Tammy that we had earlier in the season.

Of course economics will come into it, so we’ll cross that bridge when it comes<br /><br /><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> wary of ‘wounded’ <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a>]</b> Having good home form is good for confidence and we have to carry on with that. With <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a>, we absolutely have to treat them with utmost respect. Wounded animal, whatever you want to call it … they have quality players, they play very well. In a lot of games I’ve seen them in this season, they could probably consider themselves unfortunate not to have got results. We’ll certainly be expecting a very tough game</p>

  <p><b>[Frank Lampard: <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> boss backs young squad for <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> success]</b> I think it’s part of the situation we’re in and the process we’re in here at the minute with the lot of younger players we have and players that are probably playing their first year in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, let alone playing for Champions League spots and what have you, which is a lot of pressure, is them adapting to that. They need to be helped by the players that have been there and done that and won World Cups or won Premier Leagues like some of the players have in our squad. In certain times, experience is overrated, in my opinion. It’s good to have it within the group but sometimes it doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s the answer and that gives you success. Sometimes it’s a bit of innocence, a bit of youthfulness and a bit of real desire without the feelings of past campaigns and successes and failures that can be something really positive within<br /><br /><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> face <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a>, live on Sky Sports, on Tuesday evening, before finishing the season with matches against champions <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, and <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>]</b> There’s twists and turns every game. These three games are so important for all of us. I did expect <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> to be in the race. They can’t not be in the race with the quality of players they’ve had this season and the second half of the season with the incoming of Fernandes and his impact, and the way they’re playing they were always going to be in the race. <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> are a fantastic team as well, so I think the race remains on. <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> are there, <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> are pushing. It is what it is, it’s who performs over these three games, it’s so tight.<br /><br />In terms of defensively, there is a way that I want us to play and it’s not gung-ho, it’s not crazy. A lot of the goals are the balls that come into our box that maybe we don’t defend right at that moment and that’s something that has to improve and I feel I know the answers to it. Some of it is work and that’s something we will see and it’s part of the process we are in. I don’t like it, I hate conceding goals but we have to work harder on it. I don’t think any team in modern football are going to say ‘We’ve got that one defensive partnership’. You go back and talk about a John Terry-Ricardo Carvalho partnership, but in the modern day, I don’t think you will find too many clubs to name the two. It’s a difficult season and a demanding season, so I’m not saying I just want to pick two centre-backs because you need competition of probably four centre-backs within a squad and then you need them knocking on the door. You want to be able to say to players ‘You are not doing enough’ or the two that are playing keep deserving to play. I don’t think it’s about just a partnership. Can we be more settled if we improve? Yes, for sure. Will it be just two players who are going to be your centre backs? I don’t think that’s going to be the case.</p>

  <p><b>[Asked to assess the race to secure a Champions League spot]</b> We take our three points, we focus on ourselves, we can sit down and watch the other teams this week and focus on our FA Cup semi-final at the weekend <b>[against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b>, but there’s obviously still work to do. There’s a nervy feeling for understandable reasons, so I’m pleased. We went a bit slow for about 10 or 15 minutes in the second half. Then we began moving the ball again and there was a bit of personality in our game today, but we can improve<br /><br />As we’ve seen in the last 48 hours at this stage of the season, results are critical. We didn’t concede any chances of big note for them to score a goal and we created quite a few ourselves. Maybe we could’ve been a bit better with our quality, but it was professional. I want more, but that can wait. Where we’re at as a team, and the position we’re in the table, three points is everything tonight. I live the game, so I wanted a bit more quality during the first half. I believe the group has more quality than it showed in those early stages and we needed to move the ball quicker. We have to be more mobile which we did here in our last game against <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>, but if we really want to move on longer-term it has to be better, but I don’t want to be too critical as three points at this stage isn’t easy.<br /><br /><b>[Lampard said of the match-winner]</b> He’s always going to give you that desire for the team, and I know he had a fair few half chances but we have to use his attributes by getting the service in for him. It was a brilliant cross from Christian for his goal and he’s a big character for us, and he’s scoring important goals for us at the moment. Just before lockdown, he came in and was part of a couple of big results, and he’s due a lot of credit. He’s never given me a problem, he’s always trained brilliantly. When Tammy <b>[Abraham]</b> was playing well at the start of the season and staying regularly in the team, his professionalism was always good. In January, I told him I wanted him to stay and he was fantastic in how he handled that. The way he plays is important for us</p>

  <p><b>[Frank Lampard says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> do not have an unfair FA Cup advantage over <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> We have played Saturday, Tuesday this week, they played Monday, Thursday so we have both played two games this week as it stands. We’re in a period where we are playing very regularly and you have to work with the squad as it is but it isn’t about having an advantage or not. Sometimes it works in your favour to be playing regularly and ticking over so personally I don’t see it as an advantage.<br /><br />We have <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> ahead of us and then City or <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, so it is going to be tough. We’re in a semi-final, we know what is in front of us and at this point we are fighting on two fronts as well as the domestic front and a club like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> we always want to win trophies. We have done it very well in the modern era and we have another opportunity and it is up to the players to make the best of it on Sunday but we’re up against a very good team in good form</p>
