  <p>[There was friction between Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Lionel Messi during the former’s short stint at Camp Nou] Why it did not work for Ibra at Barca? Zlatan is a beast, a machine - but he was next to another, smaller machine. Ibrahimovic was too static, Messi needed more space. Zlatan took up too much of it. There was a bit of friction, I think.</p>

  <p>[Marcelo Bielsa has agreed to take charge of Ligue 1 outfit Lille as of July 1] Marcelo Bielsa is without a doubt one of the most respected and influential coaches in the work and to bring him to LOSC is an immense satisfaction and proof of the ambitions of the club. It’s no secret, [owner] Gerard Lopez and Marcelo Bielsa are close and have already talked about this opportunity. We have always thought Marcelo would be the best person, with his philosophy of football, his experience, his rigour and his professionalism, to build our project and lead Lille to future victories. Even if we are absolutely concentrated on the next games and the highly important fixtures to come before the end of the season with Franck Passi, it’s good news that we have announced today for the Lille of tomorrow.</p>

  <p>[<a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a> welcomed <a href="timothy-weah.html">Timothy Weah</a> and said they were delighted he’d chosen them over the other clubs that were circling the New York-born phenom] We are really pleased to have signed <a href="timothy-weah.html">Timothy Weah</a>. Many great clubs were courting him and Timothy chose our proposal and the LOSC project. We thank he and his family for his decision. He has impressive technical and mental qualities for his young age. He’s a very promising striker, very mature also, with a lot of experience already and an interesting track record. We feel that our project corresponds to his characteristics and his personality</p>

  <p>[Virgiliu Postolachi is another player to have secured a move elsewhere, with the 19-year-old forward linking up with <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a>. He has committed to a four-year contract, with <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a> director Marc Ingla telling the club’s official website] Virgiliu is a very interesting player that we had the opportunity to recruit. He is a No.9, a player who can get goals, but not only that. He is a hard worker, able to create space in the offensive zone. He has a special profile that usually requires a lot of mastery and experience. Our coaches will help him to grow. Because he is still young and has a good margin for improvement, that should allow him to gradually switch to our first team</p>

  <p>[<a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a> director general Marc Ingla called Yusuf Yazici as] a major player, already highly appreciated and well-known in his country despite his young age. He brings great technical qualities, an ability to create chances, a very good quality shot and pass with his remarkable left foot, which will come to enrich our team in the season ahead. We’re confident he will continue to progress in our team, and that he will quickly show his talent in <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> in the <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a> shirt and that he will be able to achieve a strong season</p>
