  <p><b>[Juventus, Atletico Madrid and Wolfsburg were all rejected by Lyanco as the 20-year-old felt he would develop further at Torino. His agent Frederico Moraes said]</b> All the teams that have been read in the papers are true. Juventus, Atletico Madrid and Wolfsburg were very interested, we spoke with all of them and visited their training centres. In the end his choice was to go to Turin. He will play right away when eligible, he has a coach who can help make him better, in a city of some level stature in football. He will certainly learn a lot, then the final decision is with the coach. I think these two months will help him a lot for next season. He is a physically strong player with good technique and good speed.</p>
