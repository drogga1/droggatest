  <p>[Who is JDT’s new signing Natxo Insa] Insa is a box-to-box midfielder and he was a regular starter in the Levante side that dominated the Second Division this season. There is not much we can say about his attributes and playing style as he has played most of his career in that category. He had a decent showing in his lone First Division season with Celta five years ago, but the team opted not to renew his contract and he went to the Turkish league, where he didn’t have much success. He is a bit of a nomad that never spents more than two seasons in the same team and he just left a goodbye message for Levante in which he siad he is leaving because he didn’t felt truly appreciated by the team.</p>

  <p>[Two league titles in four months give Natxo Insa the magical feeling] For me it’s magic. I did it in Spain and I did it here. It’s amazing. I have good luck this year. Of course very happy to win the Super League. To do it four times in a row is not easy. It’s time for us to celebrate and for us to be happy. Now we have a break, we have time for recovery and for family. After that we can come back more stronger.<br /><br />Yes, we are still not 100% happy because we always want win every game. We could have been better. Sometimes you win matches, sometimes you don’t. But it was important for us to win the league. When I shoot, I know I shoot very well. It is always good and a nice feeling to score</p>
