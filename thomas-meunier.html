  <p><b>[Man Utd flop Angel Di Maria still not back to his Madrid best]</b> The competition. Everyone knows that places are expensive, that from one week to the next you could be on the bench or on the field. If we want to have a chance to play games, we have to really work at training and in the games, to show we’re capable - and that’s what happened. Draxler is a very, very good player, and everyone understands that. Angel, quite simply, he doesn’t want to be a substitute. He’s been metamorphosed. He is just putting a little more in.</p>

  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain defender Thomas Meunier is confident that the Ligue 1 side are on track to become one of Europe’s biggest clubs]</b> If the club continues to grow like it has, guys won’t want to go to Barcelona but will instead want PSG.<br /><br /><b>[The 25-year-old was speaking in relation to his own performances]</b> I think that there’s still a chance for me to improve my level, especially with regards my consistency. But on the level of the team, there’s not much above PSG.<br /><br /><b>[One vital ingredient is required for them to win the Champions League, he believes]</b> Time. It can only be built around that. The club has been very impatient and says the Champions League is its priority. It’s ambitious and it has the means to attract the players to win the competition. I could bet €10,000 on who will win the league, but I’d not put a single euro on who will win the Champions League. There are too many criteria in the games and you play against teams who are so experienced.<br /><br />It’s not yet in the culture of the club to think like it’s a giant, for the moment. There is something that must be instilled in the club with regards its players, who must live for the club. It’s not something you get straight away, but is earned like at Real Madrid or Barca. This mentality is not yet integrated into PSG because there have been so many changes, even at managerial level. We need to find stability. If we manage to keep the same core, the same coach, it can happen easily. For me, it’s not our time yet. If the club could reach the last four, that would be good<br /><br />We are not at Barcelona, where players come from La Masia and know each other perfectly. sWhat he will bring is his experience and his mentality. He’s a warrior and can bring a little bit of anger. We missed a scoundrel in our team last season</p>

The club knows my position, I’ve told them and they know that I want to stay here as long as possible. It’s up to them whether they still want me or not!<br /><br />The loss against Rennes was a shame, but don’t spit in the soup - PSG have given everything this season. Four titles is a formidable achievement. And it’s not the first time the club have completed this type of achievement. We should not play down this achievement. I say ‘chapeau’ to the club</p>

  <p><b>[Thomas Meunier believes Belgium’s Group G rivals England are looking very strong]</b> Well, they’re very strong, with a strong defence. For example, Kyle Walker can make the difference. Harry Kane, Dele Alli are instinctive players. They have good individuals but, as a unit, I think we’ve got a well-oiled team and we’re getting better. We saw it during qualification, I can see it during training sessions, we’ve got a lot of desire, investment.<br /><br />The fact that most of our team play in the Premier League is an advantage because we know how they play. All the players who are in the Three Lions are known by my team-mates, or myself, even if I only watch them. We hold the cards to beat them. England have always had incredible teams, but they are in a reconstruction phase, in progression, whereas we have a more confirmed team in my opinion. We will meet them in the third game so, if we each have six points, which I hope, maybe the coach will make a turnover. We’ve got a chance to beat them. They have very good players, good individuals but, to me, we’re better</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin De Bruyne has been hailed as one of the top midfielders in the world]</b> Clearly, yes! He has a lot of assists. He’s the type of player who can change a game, we saw it in the Champions League for example. He’s improving all the time. I’ve known him since he was a Genk player, then he went to Germany and … he’s never dropped a notch. He’s consistent and, to me, he deserves this status as a big player in the Premier League.<br /><br />There’s nothing in our team that another one wouldn’t envy. We’ve got good individuals, mentality, physical assets, statistics, the collective. We have everything. We only miss two or three per cent to reach perfection but I think that the semi-finals stage is plausible. But, of course, if we meet Brazil in the quarter-finals and we lose 1-0 with 50% of possession, don’t blame us. If we get a normal scenario, we’ve got our chance to reach the semi-finals<br /><br />We play with three defenders whereas we used to play 4-3-3. The philosophy also, I rarely see someone as positive as him, he supports us a lot. He also points out failures, of course. He makes lots of analysis, lots of tactics, above all now to get ready for the World Cup. The communication has changed also, as they all speak in English, as he came with his Everton staff. I think it’s a good choice, he’s a young coach. It’s not the Spanish school as he always lived in England, but he loves football, possession, domination and that’s what this team need because all the players want to play, not to counter-attack</p>

  <p><b>[Belgium full-back Thomas Meunier believes it is time for Thierry Henry to make the transition into management]</b> He was a player and he has an advantage on the other coaches who didn’t get a professional career. Psychologically he knows what to do. He knows how to speak to the players. For me, maybe it is the moment for him to take the step forwards and engage himself in a club. I think he has the capacity to do it and hope he will as soon as possible.<br /><br />It would be just fantastic for Ligue 1. We know he’s highly competent. He brought something very nice, very positive to the national team. People like him, like Zidane, don’t need to force anything: people listen to them immediately. They have had a good career, and that works in their favour</p>

  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain full-back Thomas Meunier says he has never hid his dream of playing in the Premier League]</b> Yes, but not only there. It comes from everywhere. Even from China or the Middle East<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on his interest in a move to the Premier League]</b> I never hid it<br /><br />The discussions with management are hanging around a bit. I can understand because of the deadlines of the team that my personal case was put in the fridge, but since then nothing has happened, the message seems clear enough. It would annoy me a little if it ends like that, without having the opportunity to finish beautifully. It’s true, I had a rough season, but a title is still a title and I am very happy. You know, even if I only took part in four or five matches in 2019, my stats, offensive and defensive, are among the best in the PSG defence alongside Bernat’s. Last year, although I had played less than during my first season in France, I felt I had progressed. Here, it’s the same<br /><br />There are many talented young players here who probably do not have enough experience yet. In addition, when the coach joined early in the season, he called for reinforcements at certain positions and was not heard. Recent results have shown he was right. We paid the consequences of our injuries in the league as we did in the Champions League. If you look closely, all those who were injured are boys who took part in the World Cup. And in the first round, we played regularly with the same 14 or 15 players. The overload has had its effects</p>

But I have always thought that leaving in the middle of the year is a bad idea because I think that the clubs which do business in January are clubs that, for me, act in haste.
