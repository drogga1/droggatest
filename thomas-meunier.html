  <p><b>[Thomas Meunier still frustrated with Champions League elimination]</b> The match against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is just the biggest joke in football history. I could have put a million euros that we could not lose. Not to qualify, it was really catastrophic. Everyone is well aware of this. The Champions League is still the major problem. The communication was made about this internationalization, about winning this competition, to be part of the big ones like Real, Barça. It will take a long time for that, but PSG is a club that grows.<br /><br /><b>[He also opened up on his transfer situation]</b> There are many things happening at the club. Dani Alves, <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Gigi Buffon</a>, <a href="adrien-rabiot.html">Adrien Rabiot</a>, are at the end of the contract, and we are not bad at entering our last year. All these extras make nothing happen. The club knows my idea of ​​staying . I think that if we do not have a return, it is that it is also a solution that can arrange them<br /><br /><b>[Leaving on a free]</b> is something that could suit me. I do not think the club would do a lot of money on me, actually. I have a market value, but I’m a defender, I played one game in three, I’m going on 28 years old. It’s not like <a href="adrien-rabiot.html">Adrien Rabiot</a> worth €50 million. I told the leaders that I was ready to stay, that I would like it a lot. They did not tell me, ‘We absolutely want to sell you’. They know that at some point they will need me. If the club tells me: ‘Listen, we want to sell you, we need money, there is financial fair play’, and that I will not play next year, we will find a solution that will arrange the two camps, of course. There is no advanced contact. There have been phone calls since January with interested clubs. There are a dozen clubs, all of which are in the top five of their leagues</p>

  <p><b>[Thomas Meunier will consider becoming a free agent next year if Paris Saint-Germain rebuff the dozen clubs that have made contact since January.

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are also interested in Thomas Meunier, who admits he could leave the French capital this summer]</b> The press knows more than I do. There are great clubs, which is very interesting. As a player of PSG, you are always in the spotlight. We have the level to join many other clubs. We’ll see. I am looking forward to staying in Paris, but if I have to go to another club, I will leave</p>

  <p><b>[Thomas Meunier put the onus on Paris Saint-Germain to provide clarity on his future by confirming he wants to remain at the club]</b> The club knows my intentions. I want to stay in Paris. The executives know I am open to spending my fourth season here and to signing a new contract. It will be their decision - everything is in their hands.<br /><br />When I have free time on weekends, I always do things for kids. We often go to the Museum of Science and Industry. It’s great. During the week, the Coach likes to set the training at the end of the afternoon. So, when my children are at school, I enjoy free time with my wife. We go to the cinema a lot. The cinema is just beautiful in the mornings. There are only three people in there, it’s perfect. We also see a lot of exhibitions. I love the Pompidou Centre. Paris is just amazing</p>

  <p><b>[Thomas Meunier has sparked plenty of transfer talk of late, with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> said to be among his suitors, but the Belgian is not planning on leaving <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> any time soon]</b> It was an intense period, with a lot of interest and discussion. I could have left but it was not done because there was nothing that suited the club or myself. Nothing was 100 per cent for it to work. I have always said that I wanted to stay in Paris. I still have one year on my contract and I still hope an extension can be secured. The situation is a little more complicated because I am no longer the preferred choice in my position, but I remain professional. I feel good there and we will see what happens during the season<br /><br /><b>[Veteran Brazil international <a href="dani-alves.html">Dani Alves</a> has departed <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, freeing up a regular role at right-back]</b> I have already spoken with the coach. We are aware that this year will be complicated. But I have always thought that leaving in the middle of the year is a bad idea because I think that the clubs which do business in January are clubs that, for me, act in haste. I have the impression when transfers are done in January that they are not thought out but rather a question of necessity. So for me a transfer in January is a no, even if I spend the first few months on the bench<br /><br /><b>[Meunier added on a testing period]</b> It’s the life of a professional player. There are very positive times and others that are less so. This is the first time in my career that I’m dealing with a situation a little more complicated than the others</p>

  <p><b>[Thomas Meunier has refused to give <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> team-mate <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> grief despite the Brazilian trying to force his way out of the club in the summer]</b> Whistling is not the answer, I’m happy about what he brings. He did what he had to do during pre-season. He didn’t make waves and even he is convinced he can still play a role at the club. The supporters have the choice and can do what they want, but for me it isn’t necessary to give him a hard time</p>

But when he only gets one single goal or an assist, you tell yourself that he didn’t have a good match! In reality, what he does is sensational. It’s the same for Kylian <b>[<a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a>]</b> or Angel <b>[Di Maria]</b>, they are always decisive. We will always need them, we are lucky to have them on our team<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he still wanted to stay]</b> Nothing has changed. Still no news, the management are busy with other players. We will see after February 1, we will sit around the table<br /><br />They <b>[Lille]</b> were undefeated at home where they had better form than us. It was important to come and show that we are in a very positive frame of mind. We approached the game in a very professional manner. There was a bit of fatigue at the end of the match and we lost the ball too often. But it happens against a very good team with players who threaten a lot. It was not easy to contain them. So we will take the result, the job is done</p>

That’s our fault. We weren’t really sharp in the last 20 metres. I think you could see a little bit of fatigue. We played almost 15 games since the beginning of January and you saw it<br /><br /><b>[Yet Meunier still claimed <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> deserved a draw]</b> It was really difficult, really intense. The first half physically was really demanding. Maybe we deserved a draw, but <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> were really, really good. They played like the home team, like they are used to doing. Since the beginning of the season, they haven’t lost one game here at home. We saw today that it was difficult</p>
