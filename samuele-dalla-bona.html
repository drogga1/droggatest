  <p><b>[Samuele Dalla Bona has warned Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich that manager Antonio Conte will want more investment in the transfer market]</b> They need to spend money for him to be successful next season and I think Roman Abramovich must get money out. Otherwise they will find it too difficult to try to win the Champions League. Alex Sandro and Antonio Rudiger would be a great start to the transfer market. They are very strong but they will cost a lot of money. Sandro, in particular, played a great season with Juventus. They can both do it in England.<br /><br />I watch Chelsea all the time. I make sure I have time free, I enjoy watching Conte. I was happy when they hired him. I knew he was a top manager and I was sure that he could do something important in England because he won here in Italy three times in three years. I was sure he would be very good for Chelsea. When you win the first time, it can be harder to win it a second time. He was also a fantastic player, for sure. I was in Bologna and he was in Juventus, he was already a coach on the pitch that day as we lost 1-0 to them at Bologna. We went into tackles, hard but fair. He was a very difficult player to play against<br /><br />Gianfranco Zola, Marcel Desailly, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, I loved playing with these players. Maybe I made a mistake to go away but football is like this. I went to AC Milan but AC Milan was difficult and after everything on loan in Italy, I saw that the mentality is different, the football is different but now we will see what to do. Maybe if I stayed at Chelsea then maybe my career would be better.<br /><br />When I went to Italy, it declined. I have a big love for Chelsea still, I had a very nice time there. I then had a problem with my family at home which led to me retiring. My dad was dying while I had a contract with Napoli but I decided to get closer to him and I went to Mantova which was only two hours away from him. He then died and I had problems myself after my dad died as I had a very good relationship with him.<br /><br />After I played in Legia Pro <b>[the third division]</b> which was not the same as playing in Serie A, Premier League or even Serie B. It went like this, that’s life and that’s football. I hope to find a way back into football soon. People don’t always see it but when you are a footballer, you are also a human being. It should be okay to seek help, go to psychologists, therapists and things like this. Anything can happen in life, even when you are a footballer, for sure they should have more help with this.<br /><br />The footballers should also ask for more help, definitely. Sooner or later your career ends and you must find something to do after you finish or life gets difficult. It isn’t easy to find something new after playing for 20 years as a player. You miss the changing room, the jokes, you miss everything and then you start a new life but a new life is different to being a footballer</p>

  <p><b>[Marek Hamsik can be compared to Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard]</b> I liked to play with Hamsik, even then I saw that he was a very good player. He has a <b>[good]</b> left foot and right foot. He is a great runner, he’s not in the style of Pirlo but he’s technical too. A very good player. He was very young when I saw him. You could see he was a very good player but I didn’t know that he would become this good. He does deserve everything he has because he is very professional and a great footballer now.<br /><br />Yes, I am a little surprised he stayed. He had offers but he never wanted to change clubs. Napoli became a very big team with him. It was good for him to stay there, live there, buy a house there, raise his family there. Maybe like Totti, he could have had the chance to go away but he didn’t choose to do it. It is a respectable decision because he feels good there. He has a good contract and it has been good for him to stay.<br /><br />They love him a lot in Naples. He is a legend for Napoli. He is a big legend. He is like Steven Gerrard in Liverpool. He is parallel to Gerrard, he is a top player and a leader. I played against Gerrard and with Hamsik. They are both at the top of their profession.<br /><br /><b>[His wonder-goal against Treviso capped off an impressive campaign to help get the club promoted in 2007]</b> It was a very crazy city. I loved it at Napoli, the first year was good in Serie B. We got promoted and I scored six or seven goals and then I had a problem with the coach and it finished like this. Napoli is a beautiful place to have played football, it is like the opposite of what I experienced in London. Very different indeed but still a beautiful time that I remember fondly to this day</p>

  <p><b>[Andrea Pirlo will be remembered as one of the best ever]</b> He has everything: good feet, technique, and he is one of the best in the world in his prime. Maybe now at the end of the career it has been a little bit more difficult <b>[to play at the same level]</b>. But to play on for so long, he has proved he is the best in the world. Everyone respects him because he goes down as one of the best. History will remember him as one of the best for sure. He has achieved everything.<br /><br />I was feeling very good in Chelsea then I had this great offer at AC Milan. It wasn’t just that I wanted to come back to Italy, but AC Milan is a legendary club and they had a great team. Maybe that AC Milan was too strong for me, at that time though.<br /><br />Of course; they had Seedorf, Pirlo, Gattuso and it was very, very difficult to compete against them. I didn’t play much but it can always be a great experience to talk about. I played and trained with those guys and they are greats!<br /><br />So not everything went well for me and then I went on loan and played well after that, but in Italy I had more stress around the games and in training than in England</p>

  <p><b>[Former Chelsea and Napoli star Samuele Dalla Bona has questioned whether Maurizio Sarri will fit in as well at Chelsea as Antonio Conte]</b> <b>[Sarri]</b> played great football all of the time. <b>[Napoli]</b> had a good system but Juventus were able to play a worse style but still win every year. I think Sarri needs to make that last step to be a champion and a top coach. He is a great coach but he is not a world class-coach because he hasn’t won anything - that means he isn’t at the top. I like to see a good style of football but in the end, if you don’t win but play good football, it doesn’t mean a lot. Juventus don’t play good but win all the time. I knew when Conte was going to Chelsea. I was sure that Conte is a winner and, in fact, he has won two titles and proved it already: the league and FA Cup.<br /><br />If Sarri goes to Chelsea, he hasn’t won anything despite being a good manager. He needs to start winning something. I don’t know if he will do it in Chelsea. It is a difficult club to go to right now, even under Roman Abramovich. I think it is difficult for Italians to adapt because you don’t speak the language perfectly. For Sarri, at around 60 years old going to London, a change of environment, he speaks a little bit of English but I don’t know if it will be an easy move for him. I am not sure about him, I know he is a good manager but I don’t know if he is a good fit for Chelsea. Probably they will ask him to not smoke at Stamford Bridge or Cobham too! I had the good fortune of adapting well from Italy to London. I preferred London and English football actually, so it can be done. However, I am not as sure about Sarri at Chelsea. I was more sure about Conte coming to Chelsea because every year he wins something. He had shown the whole world he is a winner already, Sarri hasn’t.<br /><br />It has been a real shock because I didn’t expect that De Laurentiis could get Ancelotti.<br /><br />Sarri has been in Naples for three years doing very good work but football is strange. I think De Laurentiis knows that now is a time to try and win something so he took one of the top managers in the world. De Laurentiis is giving them a great story. He took them from Serie C and now they are always second in the league. For me, it has been great to be part of the story, to win Serie B and score a few goals and then football changes very quickly. I think De Laurentiis needs to be supported because he is trying his best to make the club into a winning team. It was unbelievable that they didn’t win the Scudetto. It is only because Juventus is an incredible team. I thought Napoli could win it but in the end it was unbelievable that Juventus won it again. Juve are also a special team. Napoli taking Ancelotti shows Serie A that they really are ready to win something</p>

  <p><b>[Dalla Bona, however, believed <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> was more likely to become a movie star than a manager when his playing career ended, but wishes his old team-mate well back in west London]</b> I am a bit surprised for <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> that he became a manager. I thought he was a superstar and could go into the movies or something! Now he decided to be a thinker and a manager. They lost to <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> but it was a great achievement with Derby.<br /><br />I remember he was a big player and a great person. I was only 17 and he was a few years older. He helped me a lot. We played together for a few years. I hope for him that he can go to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, and to go and do it as a manager is much more different to being a player.<br /><br />He has the fans behind him and, even if he struggles at first, he will be a legend at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I hope he can go to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. Maybe it is too early but I hope he can get the job because I would get behind him and get to his games! He was great as a player, professional and very funny.<br /><br />Under <a href="claudio-ranieri.html">Ranieri</a>, we played together a lot in midfield, he was box-to-box. Hopefully, he will become a great manager. I played with <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a>, too. He was a little crazy and funny, too. I have good memories of Jody as well. I think they are people who will be good for the fans. Although, just because you are a great player, it doesn’t mean you will be a good manager.<br /><br /><b>[Dalla Bona, who played for <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> like <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a>, believes that the 27-year-old is unpopular with fans at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> because he cannot match up to other midfielders from the Roman Abramovich era]</b> I think he is a good player who plays simple passes to make the team balanced and he stays always in his position. However, I think compared to other players <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> has had in that position like <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>, <a href="michael-ballack.html">Ballack</a> and <a href="michael-essien.html">Essien</a> <b>[…]</b> so many players, of course, maybe the fans can be disappointed about <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a>.<br /><br />He is a good player but probably not a top player. He makes good passes but not goals, and physically he is not so big, he never arrives in the box. For a midfielder, I expect something else. I think midfielders can master more than just the minimum of passing</p>

  <p><b>[Samuele Dalla Bona watched both <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a> and <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> closely at former club <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and he believes that the new Inter boss will come out on top as the duo prepare to do battle in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> next season]</b> In <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> had a decent season, it was neither good nor bad. I see <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> as a big team and they could have done better. I don’t know why <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> took <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>. Honestly, I am a little bit surprised about this.<br /><br />He won the Europa League but he had a good team in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I don’t really like his style of football. I think after February he changed a bit. I didn’t think he played his full Sarriball. When he played Sarriball, he lost 6-0 to Man City<br /><br />He had to change a little bit and they got some good results towards the end. He hasn’t won much and I don’t know if he is the best profile for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. To follow <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> won’t be easy. Five Scudetto, Coppa Italia, Supercopa. It isn’t an easy job for him.<br /><br />I am sure that <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> can beat <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>’s <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> to the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> title. Maybe not in the first year but he is a winner because he shows that he is a winner. He showed it at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He had a problem with <b>[Diego]</b> Costa and others but I really like him.<br /><br />When he came to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> I was sure he was going to win. Now when he goes to Inter, I am sure they will be a very very strong team. For sure, they won’t finish 20 points behind <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>.
