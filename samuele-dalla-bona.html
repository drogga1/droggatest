  <p><b>[Samuele Dalla Bona on Marek Hamsik]</b> I liked to play with <a href="marek-hamsik.html">Hamsik</a>, even then I saw that he was a very good player. He has a <b>[good]</b> left foot and right foot. He is a great runner, he’s not in the style of <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Pirlo</a> but he’s technical too. A very good player<br /><br />He was very young when I saw him. You could see he was a very good player but I didn’t know that he would become this good. He does deserve everything he has because he is very professional and a great footballer now<br /><br />Yes, I am a little surprised he stayed. He had offers but he never wanted to change clubs. <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> became a very big team with him. It was good for him to stay there, live there, buy a house there, raise his family there<br /><br />Maybe like <a href="francesco-totti.html">Francesco Totti</a>, he could have had the chance to go away but he didn’t choose to do it. It is a respectable decision because he feels good there. He has a good contract and it has been good for him to stay<br /><br />They love him a lot in Naples. He is a legend for <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>. He is a big legend. He is like <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. He is parallel to <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a>, he is a top player and a leader. I played against <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a> and with <a href="marek-hamsik.html">Hamsik</a>. They are both at the top of their profession<br /><br /><b>[He looks back fondly on his time in Naples as he played his part to get <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> back to where they belong]</b> It was a very crazy city. I loved it at <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, the first year was good in Serie B. We got promoted and I scored six or seven goals and then I had a problem with the coach and it finished like this<br /><br /><a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> is a beautiful place to have played football, it is like the opposite of what I experienced in London. Very different indeed but still a beautiful time that I remember fondly to this day</p>

  <p><b>[Dalla Bona, however, believed <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> was more likely to become a movie star than a manager when his playing career ended, but wishes his old team-mate well back in west London]</b> I am a bit surprised for <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> that he became a manager. I thought he was a superstar and could go into the movies or something! Now he decided to be a thinker and a manager. They lost to <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> but it was a great achievement with Derby.<br /><br />I remember he was a big player and a great person. I was only 17 and he was a few years older. He helped me a lot. We played together for a few years. I hope for him that he can go to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, and to go and do it as a manager is much more different to being a player.<br /><br />He has the fans behind him and, even if he struggles at first, he will be a legend at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I hope he can go to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. Maybe it is too early but I hope he can get the job because I would get behind him and get to his games! He was great as a player, professional and very funny.<br /><br />Under <a href="claudio-ranieri.html">Ranieri</a>, we played together a lot in midfield, he was box-to-box. Hopefully, he will become a great manager. I played with <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a>, too. He was a little crazy and funny, too. I have good memories of Jody as well. I think they are people who will be good for the fans. Although, just because you are a great player, it doesn’t mean you will be a good manager.<br /><br /><b>[Dalla Bona, who played for <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> like <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a>, believes that the 27-year-old is unpopular with fans at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> because he cannot match up to other midfielders from the Roman Abramovich era]</b> I think he is a good player who plays simple passes to make the team balanced and he stays always in his position. However, I think compared to other players <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> has had in that position like <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>, <a href="michael-ballack.html">Ballack</a> and <a href="michael-essien.html">Essien</a> <b>[…]</b> so many players, of course, maybe the fans can be disappointed about <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a>.<br /><br />He is a good player but probably not a top player. He makes good passes but not goals, and physically he is not so big, he never arrives in the box. For a midfielder, I expect something else. I think midfielders can master more than just the minimum of passing</p>

  <p><b>[Samuele Dalla Bona watched both <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a> and <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> closely at former club <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and he believes that the new Inter boss will come out on top as the duo prepare to do battle in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> next season]</b> In <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> had a decent season, it was neither good nor bad. I see <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> as a big team and they could have done better. I don’t know why <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> took <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>. Honestly, I am a little bit surprised about this.<br /><br />He won the Europa League but he had a good team in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I don’t really like his style of football. I think after February he changed a bit. I didn’t think he played his full Sarriball. When he played Sarriball, he lost 6-0 to Man City<br /><br />He had to change a little bit and they got some good results towards the end. He hasn’t won much and I don’t know if he is the best profile for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. To follow <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> won’t be easy. Five Scudetto, Coppa Italia, Supercopa. It isn’t an easy job for him.<br /><br />I am sure that <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> can beat <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>’s <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> to the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> title. Maybe not in the first year but he is a winner because he shows that he is a winner. He showed it at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He had a problem with <b>[Diego]</b> Costa and others but I really like him.<br /><br />When he came to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> I was sure he was going to win. Now when he goes to Inter, I am sure they will be a very very strong team. For sure, they won’t finish 20 points behind <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. I think he is a better manager than <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>.<br /><br />I think <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> would have gone back to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> but it may be that they didn’t want him for his character. After <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a>, I think it would be better to see <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> back and not Sarri<br /><br /><b>[Dalla Bona does not believe that <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> needs any instructions from his managers]</b> I think <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> can play alone without any advice from anybody. I went to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> Stadium many times, they played short passes with <a href="miralem-pjanic.html">Pjanic</a>. I am not sure if they will change for Sarri</p>
