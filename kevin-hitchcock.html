  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> Goalkeeper Kevin Hitchcock Appointed Coach At <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> United]</b> <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham United</a> can confirm that coach Ludek Miklosko has left the club with immediate effect. Kevin Hitchcock, who spent time on loan at the club back in March 1993, has been appointed as a goalkeeping coach until the end of the season. With respect to all parties involved, the club will be making no further comment until the terms of his departure are confirmed</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> goalkeeper Kevin Hitchcock has called on <a href="kepa-arrizabalaga.html">Kepa Arrizabalaga</a> to find a way of enjoying his football again]</b> <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have been lucky to have <a href="carlo-cudicini.html">Carlo Cudicini</a>, <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a> and <a href="thibaut-courtois.html">Thibaut Courtois</a> for years. They’re finding it a little bit difficult to replace these top-quality goalkeepers. The goalkeeper they’ve got at the moment is young and have a £71m price tag around his neck – he’s not having it easy. Every mistake you make is magnified into a big one. I would let him play and find a way to enjoy it. If you put the guy under so much pressure then it isn’t easy for him to be free – let him do what he’s good at and I think he will be okay. He’s still just 25. He’s young and he’s going to make mistakes. He just needs to only make mistakes that don’t cost <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> games. That’s the goal for any keeper<br /><br />It’s going to be tough to compete with the top two teams for Frank and <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a>, having had the <b>[transfer]</b> embargo. They need time to bring their own players in and compete with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. That’s what <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> deserves. I think they need two or three transfer windows, you can’t build a team in one. You need time to build and let people settle in. It all takes time and it’s hard to come into a new environment and hit the ground running. They’ve got people working behind the scenes who can help them bring in top players. I hope they get the guys in to compete with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and Liverpool</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-coach lauds Premier League-winning goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel]</b> I saw Kasper and Joe when they were up and coming. I knew they would be at the top of the tree at some stage in their career. Mark brought <a href="shay-given.html">Shay Given</a> in at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> but they were one and two.<br /><br />Joe then went to <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a>. Kasper wanted to play. He is one of the goalkeepers who just loves football and he could do amazing things on the training pitch. He would do overhead kicks like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and took free kicks like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>.<br /><br />He was incredible and a fantastic goalkeeper. His work ethic on the training ground was second to none. He is a leader like his dad. He learned a lot off his dad. He has just shown everybody what he is.<br /><br />Everyone says his dad did this, his dad did that. But he has proven he is an outstanding goalkeeper on the world stage. I’m really proud to say that I’ve worked with him and he is a really good lad<br /><br /><b>[Hitchcock’s first role as a goalkeeping coach was alongside <a href="gianluca-vialli.html">Gianluca Vialli</a> at <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>. He then worked with Hughes at <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn Rovers</a>, coaching the legendary United States international Brad Friedel]</b> I would say <a href="brad-friedel.html">Brad Friedel</a> is one of the best goalkeepers that <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has ever seen. That’s not just because I worked with him. I came here to work with Brad. It took a long time to get my visa sorted out<br /><br />By the time I got my visa ready and to come over on the flight, Brad had lost the job and it was all up in the air when I came over. Bruce came in a few days after I started. Then my first game was against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, who I played with for 10 years. That’s crazy!<br /><br /><a href="gianfranco-zola.html">Gianfranco Zola</a> was <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a>’s assistant and he is one of my best friends. Me and Bruce work well together and I really enjoy it. People ask me what he is like. He is the <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> of America. He is the main man<br /><br />We had a little bit of a slow start before the coronavirus outbreak. We lost the first game when we shouldn’t have lost. We only drew the second game when we should have won. We can have a good go this year. I think we’re going to be really good<br /><br />We have Carles Gil who is one of the best players I have ever seen on the ball. He is as small as <a href="gianfranco-zola.html">Zola</a> and won’t score the goals he did, but he creates so many chances. We are lucky to have him with us<br /><br />I can’t rate this guy high enough and he has been brilliant for us. In my opinion, he is the best player in the league. I think once the season does get started, we will hit the ground running. I see nothing but success for us, that’s how confident I am</p>
