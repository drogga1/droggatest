  <p><b>[Christian Ramirez proving himself on new level]</b> I’ve worked for this my whole life. I’ve had dreams of putting on an MLS jersey and playing in front of MLS crowds, and playing on ESPN or Fox Sports 1. I’ve always felt I could compete at this level, and I know I’m a case study for the NASL comparisons to MLS, and have taken that under my wing and used it as more motivation to continue to get better. I don’t want to let this opportunity slip and I think I go out there and I play with that chip on my shoulder each game that I’m out there.<br /><br /><b>[Ramirez said of his time at UCSB]</b> It was frustrating. I contemplated quitting and just going to Santa Barbara for school and riding out my scholarship. That’s how miserable I was. I thought it would turn around because I had seen so many guys not play for two years and then find their way onto the field. Once I realized that it wasn’t me doing something wrong, I just didn’t fit into the culture and the system being played there, I had to move on.<br /><br />I would come back in the summer time and play in the PDL and play with guys that were at UCLA and UNC and I’d be starting over most of them, and starting consistently on the PDL team. I knew what I could bring, but I just wasn’t given the opportunity <b>[at UCSB]</b>. I had to grow up and accept that things aren’t given to you, so I had to go a different route<br /><br />I was really close to going to Mexico. If things would have extended another couple of days it could have been a whole different thing because I had a couple of other offers on the table. I had always dreamed of playing abroad, and <b>[there was]</b> no better place that I could have transitioned to than down in Mexico. I grew up watching that league and I’ve seen players go down there and do well, and think the style there complemented my game well.<br /><br />After the NASL season last year I sold everything because in my mind there was only one way I could come back, and I had these other offers already there. You could say I had one foot out the door because I wanted to challenge myself in a different country and see how that would go, but at the same time I knew that if Minnesota could come with what I wanted, that I would really have to consider it because it became like a home to me<br /><br />He played forward his whole career and he knows the little nuances of the position to help you maximize that aspect of it. There’s been plenty of times where he’s walked me through certain scenarios 50 different times in a session so that I have that in my memory, and I’ve scored several goals this season based off those movements he’s discussed with me<br /><br />You could say I was a little upset <b>[about not making the U.S. Gold Cup preliminary roster]</b>, but I knew that I had to really impress to even put myself on the <b>[national team]</b> radar. Those are just short-term goals I set for myself. I wanted to have the season I’m having because I knew I had to score goals to even be in the conversation. I know the likes of Dom <b>[Dwyer]</b>, C.J. Sapong, <b>[Juan]</b> Agudelo have all been pushing. They’ve put up really good numbers the last couple of years. I was really happy for them because of the hard work they’ve put in, but at the same time as a competitor I want to put myself in that conversation</p>

  <p><b>[Family life and fatherhood are helping <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> stars cope with coronavirus quarantine]</b> It’s just trying to get through each day. We recharge our batteries every night and say. ‘Let’s try and think of one new thing to do with her tomorrow to keep her entertained’, and we go from there. We’ve done baking with her. We let her help make pancakes in the morning. We got her a slide on Amazon for 30 bucks that has been a lifesaver because she’ll just go up and down the slide and run around the living room. It feels like she’s outside in a way. We try and do one new thing every day to keep her entertained and active<br /><br />We try to find one little window to do a lap around the complex to get Zara some fresh air. Other than that, we try and play games and fast-track her on learning. Basically, all we can really do is spend time together<br /><br /><b>[His wife is due in July. His two-and-a-half-year-old, meanwhile, recently battled an illness]</b> It’s so sensitive. Since she was born, it feels like she gets sick every few months, whether it’s a fever or an ear infection or something like that. Just a few days ago, we had to take her to the doctor and only one of us got to go in because of the precautions and regulations. We experienced that fear of going in, because she got a fever, and trying to figure out what’s going on. Luckily, it was an ear infection and a throat, but it’s all pretty wild</p>
