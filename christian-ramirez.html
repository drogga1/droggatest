  <p><b>[Christian Ramirez proving himself on new level]</b> I’ve worked for this my whole life. I’ve had dreams of putting on an MLS jersey and playing in front of MLS crowds, and playing on ESPN or Fox Sports 1. I’ve always felt I could compete at this level, and I know I’m a case study for the NASL comparisons to MLS, and have taken that under my wing and used it as more motivation to continue to get better. I don’t want to let this opportunity slip and I think I go out there and I play with that chip on my shoulder each game that I’m out there.<br /><br /><b>[Ramirez said of his time at UCSB]</b> It was frustrating. I contemplated quitting and just going to Santa Barbara for school and riding out my scholarship. That’s how miserable I was. I thought it would turn around because I had seen so many guys not play for two years and then find their way onto the field. Once I realized that it wasn’t me doing something wrong, I just didn’t fit into the culture and the system being played there, I had to move on.<br /><br />I would come back in the summer time and play in the PDL and play with guys that were at UCLA and UNC and I’d be starting over most of them, and starting consistently on the PDL team. I knew what I could bring, but I just wasn’t given the opportunity <b>[at UCSB]</b>. I had to grow up and accept that things aren’t given to you, so I had to go a different route<br /><br />I was really close to going to Mexico. If things would have extended another couple of days it could have been a whole different thing because I had a couple of other offers on the table. I had always dreamed of playing abroad, and <b>[there was]</b> no better place that I could have transitioned to than down in Mexico. I grew up watching that league and I’ve seen players go down there and do well, and think the style there complemented my game well.<br /><br />After the NASL season last year I sold everything because in my mind there was only one way I could come back, and I had these other offers already there. You could say I had one foot out the door because I wanted to challenge myself in a different country and see how that would go, but at the same time I knew that if Minnesota could come with what I wanted, that I would really have to consider it because it became like a home to me<br /><br />He played forward his whole career and he knows the little nuances of the position to help you maximize that aspect of it. There’s been plenty of times where he’s walked me through certain scenarios 50 different times in a session so that I have that in my memory, and I’ve scored several goals this season based off those movements he’s discussed with me<br /><br />You could say I was a little upset <b>[about not making the U.S. Gold Cup preliminary roster]</b>, but I knew that I had to really impress to even put myself on the <b>[national team]</b> radar. Those are just short-term goals I set for myself. I wanted to have the season I’m having because I knew I had to score goals to even be in the conversation. I know the likes of Dom <b>[Dwyer]</b>, C.J. Sapong, <b>[Juan]</b> Agudelo have all been pushing. They’ve put up really good numbers the last couple of years. I was really happy for them because of the hard work they’ve put in, but at the same time as a competitor I want to put myself in that conversation</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Ramirez embraces ‘lower division player’ label as he looks to make most of USMNT call]</b> I still use it as something that motivates me whenever I hear that. I even heard it now when I got called in. Can he do it at this level? It’s something that’s challenging and motivating, and is something that’s happened throughout my career. I’ve learned to use it in the right ways and I hope to show that on the day I hopefully get to put on these colors and continue to silence those people. It’s okay, because without them I wouldn’t have that motivation<br /><br />Initially I was upset because my future wasn’t going to be in Minnesota anymore. It was frustrating not knowing what else I could have done to continue to show I should be a big piece of the club going forward. I’ve never been one to hold any grudges; the fans will know that, for me, playing for Minnesota was something I really cherished. I wanted to be a part of building that and showing the United States how special the club was, but that’s part of the business<br /><br />To be honest I was a little upset that the league is making me wait until September for that to happen. I’m excited to see that new stadium and see a bunch of old faces. It’s something that’s definitely circled on my calendar. I only keep those good memories of Minnesota in my mind. The people there, and the fans there really made me one of their own and they’ll be forever in my heart. That place is special<br /><br />I’ve gotten comfortable each day understanding what exactly he meant by that. I’ve really pushed myself to show him and the coaching staff that they are right, that I do fit that system they’re trying to play, and I can be a good piece going forward<br /><br />It’s been fun to show people I can continue to score goals no matter the level, and be an inspiration to other guys that have reached out to me that are on the same route, that are trying to prove themselves. That’s also been good to show that everybody has their own road to get to where they’re going<br /><br />I’m really proud of how I’ve gotten here, and the route I’ve taken. It’s a different route than most, but it goes to show everyone, including a young guy playing soccer in the USL, that anything’s possible. Just put your head down and work and the results can come your way. It’s awesome to see when guys are signing contracts in MLS from the USL and doing well because you see a little bit of yourself in them</p>

  <p><b>[Family life and fatherhood are helping <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> stars cope with coronavirus quarantine]</b> It’s just trying to get through each day. We recharge our batteries every night and say. ‘Let’s try and think of one new thing to do with her tomorrow to keep her entertained’, and we go from there. We’ve done baking with her. We let her help make pancakes in the morning. We got her a slide on Amazon for 30 bucks that has been a lifesaver because she’ll just go up and down the slide and run around the living room. It feels like she’s outside in a way. We try and do one new thing every day to keep her entertained and active<br /><br />We try to find one little window to do a lap around the complex to get Zara some fresh air. Other than that, we try and play games and fast-track her on learning. Basically, all we can really do is spend time together<br /><br /><b>[His wife is due in July. His two-and-a-half-year-old, meanwhile, recently battled an illness]</b> It’s so sensitive. Since she was born, it feels like she gets sick every few months, whether it’s a fever or an ear infection or something like that. Just a few days ago, we had to take her to the doctor and only one of us got to go in because of the precautions and regulations. We experienced that fear of going in, because she got a fever, and trying to figure out what’s going on. Luckily, it was an ear infection and a throat, but it’s all pretty wild</p>
