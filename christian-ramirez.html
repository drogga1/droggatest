  <p><b>[Family life and fatherhood are helping <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> stars cope with coronavirus quarantine]</b> It’s just trying to get through each day. We recharge our batteries every night and say. ‘Let’s try and think of one new thing to do with her tomorrow to keep her entertained’, and we go from there. We’ve done baking with her. We let her help make pancakes in the morning. We got her a slide on Amazon for 30 bucks that has been a lifesaver because she’ll just go up and down the slide and run around the living room. It feels like she’s outside in a way. We try and do one new thing every day to keep her entertained and active<br /><br />We try to find one little window to do a lap around the complex to get Zara some fresh air. Other than that, we try and play games and fast-track her on learning. Basically, all we can really do is spend time together<br /><br /><b>[His wife is due in July. His two-and-a-half-year-old, meanwhile, recently battled an illness]</b> It’s so sensitive. Since she was born, it feels like she gets sick every few months, whether it’s a fever or an ear infection or something like that. Just a few days ago, we had to take her to the doctor and only one of us got to go in because of the precautions and regulations. We experienced that fear of going in, because she got a fever, and trying to figure out what’s going on. Luckily, it was an ear infection and a throat, but it’s all pretty wild</p>
