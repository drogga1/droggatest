  <p><b>[Thailand’s Chanathip Songkrasin headed for J-League]</b> I really don’t know what lies ahead but I’ll give my all; I want to prove what I can do, and what Thai players are capable of. I have to admit that I still worry, but this is J’s dream, in the end I’m glad and proud for my son having overseas trials. I never expected something like this to come this fast. At first I just wanted him to serve our country as National Team player. To be famous and attract foreign clubs is unbelievable. I’ve always wanted him to play in another country but Japan is beyond me and my son’s expectation. The contract would perfectly fulfill my son’s dream</p>

  <p><b>[Chanathip Songkrasin gets warm reception at Shimizu S-Pulse]</b> To be honest, I’m abashed when they ask for my autograph and take pictures with me! It makes me feel very shy!<br /><br /><b>[Despite flying alone to Japan for the trials, Chanathip, who does not speak Japanese and is not fluent in English, stated that his only issue was the climate which he was not used to]</b> I’m okay with training, just have to adapt to this rather cold weather. I can contact my parents via phone just fine so I’m not lonely at all. Don’t worry, I’ll do my best</p>

  <p><b>[A successful spell with Shimizu has brought much attention on Chanathip Songkrasin, who received a warm reception from the Japanese fans and also played a full friendly fixture]</b> About the contract, if they offer one I would be over the moon as I feel I did some decent work here. But if it’s not, I won’t regret it also. Every single second I stayed here, I gave my all and this trip is a mind-opener which will be beneficial in my future career<br /><br /><b>[The attacking midfielder also stated that he has been impressed by the high standards of play in Japan, and that the friends he had made were hoping to see him return]</b> Japanese players have high professionalism, at both senior and youth level. Everyone is strictly on time and very disciplined. Their football basics are superb, even the goalkeepers. Many friends here in Shimizu ask me ‘J, will you play in J.League with us next season?’. I just said ‘I hope so’!</p>

  <p><b>[He had already attempted to earn a move to Japan in 2013 but a trial period at Shimizu S-Pulse did not result in an offer. In a 2015 interview in The Bangkok Post, Chanathip admitted that he had had to battle against the perception that someone of his size would be unable to make it as a professional footballer]</b> I was sometimes looked down on because people thought I was too short. I had to show them that I could play well. I occasionally felt discouraged, but I couldn’t give up. Football is the most valuable thing in my life. I’m most happy when I’m playing. I had to continually improve until my day came</p>

  <p><b>[Thailand playmaker Chanathip Songkrasin aims to help the War Elephants beat Vietnam in their opening 2022 World Cup qualifier on Thursday to avenge their recent loss to their Southeast Asian rivals]</b> There are winners and losers. Every time we lose, we will use it as a motivation. We will try to beat Vietnam. Vietnam’s strong point is their team work. They are hungry to beat Thailand. This is our home game and our football fans are expecting a lot from this match. So we want to win after we lost to them in the previous match. We must play for our fans<br /><br /><b>[It will be <a href="akira-nishino.html">Akira Nishino</a>’s first competitive match as coach of Thailand after the 64-year-old Japanese took the job in July]</b> For Japanese coaches, discipline is the most important thing. We must have discipline and concentration. I am happy to work with Nishino</p>
