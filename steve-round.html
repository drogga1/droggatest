  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> coach Steve Round says <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> remains an exceptional player]</b> They definitely miss him. He’s a top, top player. His form has been a bit erratic and he’s maybe not been as good as people thought he would be, but I still believe he’s a top player. I remember when I was at United, I was sent out to watch him when he was at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. I watched him play for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and I watched him play for France and I came back and said ‘that’s two of the best midfield performances I’ve seen from anybody for a long, long time’. I think he is an exceptional player. He’s just got to find his way within this club, within this group and really start to express himself and what he can do. Hopefully this layoff will give him the chance to come back and show what he’s capable of</p>
