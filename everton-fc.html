The charity’s work has come into increased focus during the coronavirus pandemic as a result of the Blue Family coordinated outreach campaign<br /><br />The Blue Family initiative has benefited thousands of vulnerable and isolated people and is continuing to provide key assistance and support to those in our community in greatest need. Beyond Blue Family - and as a pre-eminent charity in the world of football - the scale and impact of Everton in the Community’s works is significant<br /><br />Every £1 donated to the charity is proven to be worth almost 15 times that amount as a result of the positive impact the charity’s programmes and initiatives have on communities in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and beyond<br /><br />Season ticket members who may not have renewed for the 20/21 season when the remaining games for the 19/20 season are confirmed will be given the opportunity to request that their refund entitlement be used as a credit towards their renewal for next season</p>
