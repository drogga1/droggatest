  <p>[Valencia are set to seal an €18 million deal to sign Italy international Simone Zaza from Juventus] My son will play for Valencia. He’ll arrive tomorrow or Sunday</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Simone Zaza has revealed why his West Ham move failed to work out after a difficult spell with Slaven Bilic’s side] I didn’t feel great in so many ways: environment, culture, training, nutrition. I was not good physically. I had been through pre-season with Juventus so I was okay. When I got there [West Ham] I found a different method of training - you exercise less, sometimes the sessions last 40 minutes and almost immediately I didn’t feel good. I need to train more, for someone to kick my ass. The problem is that on Sunday other people went to a thousand per cent. Not me. I wanted to do things that come naturally when I’m playing well and I could not do them. And I became crazy.<br /><br />I’m not being a victim, I know that plying your trade as a footballer allows you to earn so much. I’m just trying to explain the causes of my failure. I knew I’d find some difficulties, but I did not think there could be so many. I do not blame anyone - 99 per cent of it’s my fault because I was not able to adapt. I was sure that I’d make it, but it was probably because I’m set in my ways. I’m attached to my habits, my things, my points of reference otherwise I’m lost and I can’t find myself</p>

  <p>[Simone Zaza insists he is happy at Valencia amid reports AC Milan are chasing the former West Ham striker] I hope it’s not my last game here. Others talk about my future, I don’t speak, but I’m good here, I get along with everyone and I want to be here, every time I’m happy, but we’ve won and we’ve enjoyed it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Antonio Zaza shared a similar sentiment with his son] He is very happy at Valencia and the only certainty is that he has a contract to 2021 and intends to respect it. His season has been positive, he scored 12 goals and gets on well with the fans. Let’s not forget he also really likes the city. I don’t know [Milan director Massimiliano] Mirabelli, nor can I say he contacted me to talk about Simone. At the moment, he is thinking only about Valencia, but if the club were to say he’s on the market, then that could change. For now, there’s nothing concrete. I only read about Milan and Lazio in the papers, but until calls come in, it’s premature to talk about potential options.</p>
