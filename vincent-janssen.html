  <p><b>[Vincent Janssen feels for Tottenham team-mate Harry Kane but is determined to shine in his injury-enforced absence]</b> First of all I feel bad for Harry Kane and the club because he’s a vital player for us. But I hope I can play more minutes now. I will not complain to the manager because we’re second in the league, in the semi-finals of the FA Cup and almost never lose a match. If we keep on winning I don’t have any reason to complain, but I have to keep working hard. I am very happy to be part of all this success. I just hope I can give positive energy to the squad. I support my team-mates wherever they need it and if someone else plays instead of me, I’m fully behind him. I just give everything during the training and hope for a chance.<br /><br />I don’t need any mental support or anything. If I get a chance to score, I still feel the same. A chance is a chance and I’m aware of my qualities. If I get a ball in my feet I will shoot it in. I will not think: ‘I haven’t scored for three months.’ I have enough confidence to stay focused</p>

  <p><b>[Vincent Janssen acknowledges that critics may joke at his Tottenham goal return but he has no intention of quitting the club]</b> There have been a lot of rumours about me leaving but I have not been at the club for a year yet. When I joined I signed a long contract and I am happy here. Of course I am disappointed with my number of goals but I am not a quitter. I like the club - my team-mates, the staff, the fans, the training, everything - and we are doing well, so why would I leave?<br /><br />I have not scored as many goals as I wanted to but I know I have improved as a player and I am a better player now than I was last season. I like it here, I really enjoy it. I think it’s been a good season for me. I know people will see my number of goals and maybe joke at that. But this is my first season in a new country at a new club and I have learnt so much. People think because I am from Holland and we all speak English there would not be any problems. But everything in England is still new to me. I don’t see my family or friends. The club have been brilliant with me and done everything possible to try to help me settle in. You learn always and I have learnt so much this season. I am always confident and I believe I will score more goals next season</p>

  <p><b>[Vincent Janssen quiet on Tottenham future but keeping options open]</b> I cannot say anything about that. I keep all options open. <b>[My future]</b> is a matter for after the holidays. I want the prospect of more playing time, but otherwise I’m now better keeping my mouth shut.<br /><br />I initially found it difficult with my role as a substitute, sometimes sat in the stands at Spurs, but I learned to deal with it. As a young player I had to compete with Harry Kane, the top scorer of the Premier League, arguably the toughest league in the world. And a striker performing remains in the team</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> flop Vincent Janssen can seize chance to rescue career in <a href="monterrey-fc.html">Monterrey</a>]</b> I think there’s a lot of quality in the league, very good players. From the first team to the last team in the league, there’s quality<br /><br />I think we can play together, but obviously if he plays I have to make sure I’m ready, if I play he has to make sure he’s ready. Hopefully it’s a fair competition, and we make each other stronger. If he needs us both to play, we’ll both play and make sure we’ll do well</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> striker Vincent Janssen says he felt under-appreciated during his three-year spell in north London]</b> It was not the period I was hoping for at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. As a 22-year-old boy from <a href="az-alkmaar.html">AZ</a> this was a great step, but I didn’t get the minutes there that I expected. Also, I did not reach my <b>[best]</b> level there. Ultimately you want to play again, be a footballer and be appreciated<br /><br />I’m having a good time in Mexico. I have had many wonderful experiences recently. Last December we became champions of Mexico. It was my first championship, and to become that in Mexico after five months was something special</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> striker and current <a href="monterrey-fc.html">Monterrey</a> forward Vincent Janssen says that he believes the standard of Liga MX is higher than that of the Eredivisie in his native Netherlands]</b> It was not the period I was hoping for at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. As a 22-year-old boy from <a href="az-alkmaar.html">AZ</a> <b>[Alkmaar]</b> it was a great step, but I didn’t get the minutes that I expected. Also, I did not reach my potential. Ultimately you want to play again, be a footballer and be appreciated<br /><br />The Mexican league is very good and the standard is high. It is better than the Eredivisie. That’s my opinion. Here there are a lot of international players that come from this part of the world and there are two that come from Europe, of which I am one. It is a completely different way of playing football and it certainly isn’t bad in terms of quality. If you look at our team, you’ll see national team players from Mexico, Colombia and Argentina. It is not always the football that we are used to from the Netherlands. There are a lot of physically strong players here, so there is physical play. The game goes up and down faster here, but there are spaces</p>
