  <p><b>[Steven Gerrard will be saluted for his contribution on and off the pitch by receiving the Freedom of the City of Liverpool]</b> The Freedom of Liverpool is a special honour and one which we award only to exceptional individuals. Steven has had a fantastic career and is widely regarded as one of the most successful midfielders of his generation. But it’s not just his sporting excellence which has made him the icon he is today. Whether you’re a Red or Blue, I’m sure everyone will agree he is a fantastic ambassador for the city and his charity work has made a huge difference to thousands of young people, particularly disadvantaged children in Liverpool. Steven is an inspirational figure for young and old alike and I’m delighted to be able to recommend to council that we make this award for everything he has given to our city.</p>
