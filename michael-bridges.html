  <p><b>[After forming a lifelong friendship at <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a>, Michael Bridges admits he thought <a href="harry-kewell.html">Harry Kewell</a> would be the last player to go into management]</b> Harry was probably one of the great players I’ve played with, but when he wasn’t involved in set plays or anything, he’d just switch off - he didn’t want to know what the coach was saying. When I was playing with him, he’d be the last player I’d think of going into coaching. Harry made a big decision to go into coaching which I was very surprised at. He’s left his family in Manchester, gone three hours down to Crawley and he’s worked his socks off. Every time Harry put his mind to something, whether it was playing golf or computer games or whatever competition it was between us, Harry wouldn’t stop until he won and once he won he wouldn’t take his foot off - he’d go hard again<br /><br />s<b>[While his move from Crawley to County has gotten off to a tough start, <a href="harry-kewell.html">Kewell</a> is yet to win across four games, Bridges has backed the move and believes <a href="harry-kewell.html">Kewell</a> can turn Notts around]</b> It’s a huge move, bigger club, far more potential than Crawley Town. Yes, they are bottom of the league, but they are a bigger club and closer to home for him. He did get sent off in his first game which I found very funny - that’s Harry. If your team is being beat 5-0 he’ll go mental. That’s what you need. If you could bottle up his mentality and sell it, you’d be a millionaire<br /><br /><b>[Bridges himself is making the move into management and has his eye on a future full-time position - possibly in the A-League]</b> I’ve just joined Luke Wilkshire down at Wollongong <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> as his assistant manager, so I’m going to help them out over the NPL season. I’ve already applied for a few jobs, put my hat in for a few and I’ve got a burning desire to be a coach. Once the kids are 14-15 I’ll be ready to go full-time and have a crack somewhere</p>
