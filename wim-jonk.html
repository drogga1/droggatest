<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On Matthijs de Ligt]</b> Matthijs is what I call a modern central defender. He is big and strong and is also a complete player, he is two-legged, has a good pass and can maintain the overview. He has a naturally good presence, a real winner-type with good focus. It’s up to him to continue developing himself so that he becomes a real leader who can transfer his positive attitude to his team-mates. The best thing is his body, that does not come from nowhere. But also, the maturity in his interviews, the critical look at himself. That he is Ajax’s captain at a young age is fantastic. Maybe he can become more consistent, even more in charge at the back, that’s what you’ve got the armband for. But when I was this age, I played with amateurs, so this guy is really going to be a big one.</p>
