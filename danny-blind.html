Jan has a limited fee released clause in his current deal, but that amount is well over €20m. There are some clubs in England that are willing to pay those kind of fees, but Jan is pretty picky when it comes to a potential new club. Maarten doesn’t have a limited fee release clause so we can ask whatever we want. Roma have told us that they are interested, but they haven’t been to Amsterdam yet to discuss a move</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Blind hits out at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> over Van Gaal sacking]</b> I’m closer to the situation than many other people and I can tell you that his departure came as a surprise. I feel for him. He doesn’t deserve this. I’ve worked with him for so many years. I played under him for years at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>, I was his captain, I was his assistant at the last World Cup. He’s a great coach. We all know that, as a manager, you will face the sack at some stage in your career. It happens to every manager. In this case I find it very disappointing. I know in which way this sacking was done and it’s not the way it should go</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and Netherlands manager Danny Blind believes <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> forward <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> is the ‘new <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> Ronaldo’ and described him as a super modern player]</b> <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> is the new <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> in world football. As an attacking player he is absolutely fantastic. I can go through all his qualities - and he is superb in every aspect. He can score with his left foot, right foot and with sensational headers. He can give brilliant assists, he is an incredible athlete, and I could go on even more. Mane is the super modern player. If you look at his skills, that is one great thing, but he is able to combine that with astonishing sprints right throughout the game. That requires so much power. You have to be incredibly strong both physically and mentally. Sadio has it all.<br /><br />I don’t compare Mane to <b>[Lionel]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. I think Sadio is much more like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> in his very best years.</p>
