Jan has a limited fee released clause in his current deal, but that amount is well over €20m. There are some clubs in England that are willing to pay those kind of fees, but Jan is pretty picky when it comes to a potential new club. Maarten doesn’t have a limited fee release clause so we can ask whatever we want. Roma have told us that they are interested, but they haven’t been to Amsterdam yet to discuss a move</p>

  <p><b>[Netherlands coach Danny Blind admits he is concerned by the Robin van Persie’s lack of game time at new club Fenerbahce]</b> For Van Persie and for us this is not the most ideal situation. You want your players to play. On Thursday he played an entire game against Celtic, but it’s not a good situation when one of your main players is not in the starting line-up weekly.<br /><br /><b>[The 54-year-old has also come under fire for picking five Ajax players in his recent squad]</b> I think that’s nonsense. It does not interest me what club they are at. I try to select the best players, I do not know any coach who does not. The choices can always challenge you, but there are not preference</p>

  <p><b>[Netherlands coach Danny Blind has voiced his frustration with his side’s ongoing physical problems]</b> It looks like nothing normal happens any more. This is getting extreme now. First there was Jasper Cillessen’s injury when we were warming up and then later on Tim got injured as well. It looks like a bad injury. We are missing about 15 players now. But I have seen players getting injured all over the globe in qualifiers.<br /><br />Van Dijk put in a fantastic performance at the back. And Tete did a fine job as well. They are in fine form and I never had any doubts about them. We were in control for 60 minutes, but forgot to add a third goal</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Blind has insisted that he will remain Netherlands coach]</b> I want to stay with Oranje. I don’t feel damaged myself. Above all else, we now need to analyse where it went wrong and then look ahead. I’m not here at the right time, but I’m doing my job. The disappointment is with the whole qualifying campaign, which has not gone well. You have to stay realistic. Everyone will realise that we have to change many things, but we are missing 12 to 15 players. You cannot expect a country like Netherlands to win easily. We have to go on..</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Blind believes Netherlands must improve defensively after a string of disappointing performances in recent months]</b> I get the feeling that we need some more defensive stability. We could use the 5-3-2 formation that we used at the World Cup, but playing with two holding midfielders is an option as well. The main thing is that we need a strong defensive core. I cannot say yet how we will play, though. We are not able to dominate our opponents at this stage. We will be using the same formation against Wales and Germany.<br /><br />We will only be playing friendlies for now, but we cannot approach them like there is nothing at stake. I want to see the team fight and show passion. It is all about qualifying for the 2018 World Cup now. I will give a number of new players a chance. I want to see a passionate team that wants to make amends for missing out on the Euros. We have lost a lot of goodwill. The people are very disappointed in us and we have to win them all over again</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Blind hits out at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> over Van Gaal sacking]</b> I’m closer to the situation than many other people and I can tell you that his departure came as a surprise. I feel for him. He doesn’t deserve this. I’ve worked with him for so many years. I played under him for years at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>, I was his captain, I was his assistant at the last World Cup. He’s a great coach. We all know that, as a manager, you will face the sack at some stage in your career. It happens to every manager. In this case I find it very disappointing. I know in which way this sacking was done and it’s not the way it should go</p>

  <p><b>[It took a long time for Blind to win everyone over. He was in and out of the squad for most of the 2011-12 season as he was appalling defensively, lacked strength and seemed uncomfortable on the ball]</b> I am convinced that the fans were fed by some media in those times. There was a character assassination committed almost weekly.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has six ‘chosen ones’ within his ranks]</b> They are David De Gea, Antonio Valencia, Nemanja Matic, Paul Pogba, who is currently injured, Romelu Lukaku and Henrikh Mkhitaryan. For Mourinho, that is the frame of his side. Valencia is also his captain. Around these six chosen ones, he keeps changing the players. Sometimes he makes a choice between Marcus Rashford or Anthony Martial. Sometimes it is <b>[Daley]</b> Blind or Ashley Young or, rarely, Matteo Darmian<br /><br />People talk about Lukaku, who gets a lot of goals. But you need a player who provides all the assists, who feeds the big goalscorer. He <b>[Mkhitaryan]</b> is so important for United. He keeps the tempo in the game, he is deadly with his one touch football near the box and he always has an eye for every situation in front of goal</p>

As an attacking player he is absolutely fantastic. I can go through all his qualities - and he is superb in every aspect. He can score with his left foot, right foot and with sensational headers. He can give brilliant assists, he is an incredible athlete, and I could go on even more. Mane is the super modern player. If you look at his skills, that is one great thing, but he is able to combine that with astonishing sprints right throughout the game. That requires so much power. You have to be incredibly strong both physically and mentally. Sadio has it all.<br /><br />I don’t compare Mane to <b>[Lionel]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. I think Sadio is much more like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> in his very best years.</p>
