  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s head of football Raul Sanllehi has admitted that potential targets for next season will be easier to secure with the lure of Champions League football]</b> We’re already in the market and we’re already talking with the people that can help us to cover those positions. It’s going well and the image that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> has in the football world is very strong. We need to go where we belong and that’s the Champions League. Many players really want us to be there also when we’re talking with them. Of course being in the Champions League is very helpful, because all players want to play in the ultimate competition.</p>

He has great experience and technical football knowledge and most importantly is a true <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> man. He understands the club and what we stand for to our millions of fans around the world. His arrival is the final and very important part of the jigsaw in our development of a new football infrastructure to take us forward. He will be working closely with <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> and the first-team coaches, and will play a relevant role leading our football vision and ensuring we have - and follow - a solid philosophy through all our football activities</p>

  <p><b>[Head of football Raul Sanllehi is expecting further movement before the window slams shut]</b> I cannot say a name because I wouldn’t be doing my job. If I say a name, I walk out the door tonight and he’s £10m more expensive. The transfer window is a moving target, I have been doing this for 16 years now and I know that some windows are harder than others. This is a particularly hard window. When I talk with other clubs, this is a common knowledge. There is a bit of stagnation in the market and you don’t see the number of signings you normally see just yet. I don’t know exactly how things will turn out, but I can assure you we are working every hour of every day. I think it’s a bit like school, where you evaluate your grade at the end of the school year and not in the middle.<br /><br />What is most important is to talk with the coach, about how he is feeling about the team, what system he wants to play. He knows more than anyone, more than me, about what he wants. We’re going to do our best and we will keep working, but I will not mention any names. <a href="edu.html">Edu</a> joined us recently and is doing great work, but he is not going to be responsible for this window, I want to make this very clear. His real job is going to start in September and he will start planning and working with scouts then. Having said that, he is helping us now, but it would be unfair to say this window is him</p>

When I decide he’s not in the squad it’s because another player deserves it more<br /><br /><b>[Responding to a question about <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>’s lack of playing time]</b> Unai has had many good players in other teams also, and he has always followed the same policy which is try not to make any distinctions, play the ones who work hard in training and reward the effort with playing time. There is nothing against Mesut on the contrary and I hope we get to see him much more in the next games because his qualities are without question, but he needs to contribute 24/7 and that’s what Unai expects from him. It’s not that he’s not working so well, but there are others who are deserving more playing time, but Unai can’t treat him differently than any other player.

  <p><b>[Raul Sanllehi, was involved in the selection process in both 2018 and 2019 and insists he has no regrets at overlooking <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> first time around]</b> I do not like to look to the past, I like to look to the future and at that time we made a decision with the information we had - it is not time to regret. We made a decision conscious of what we wanted at that time and we are now conscious and convinced of what we are doing now. We spent many hours talking with him. He made a perfect presentation about his analysis of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, and how he thought that he could readdress the situation and he convinced us completely. There is always risk but in a general way, not because of how many years he has been a coach or not a coach.<br /><br />I think he is a very experienced person, actually. He has an incredible experience of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, he knows it inside and out, he knows all the coaches, all the teams. He has been with arguably one of the best coaches in the world and he is not been having a passive role with him. On the contrary. He has been actively involved. I know that from him but I know that from many other sources. He had been a real part of that coaching team. We feel very confident with what we’ve heard to make a very clear decision for him. It was very clear</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">The Gunners</a> are putting their faith in young players as they look to return to the summit of English football under <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a>]</b> Identifying, recruiting and developing young players is a key part of our strategy. We have some great talent coming through our younger age groups and, like all top clubs, the challenge is to help them make the most of their abilities. We need to make sure the academy pathway continues to drive great talent into the first team<br /><br />We’ve got an ambitious goal. To get to one young player joining our first-team every two years. Youth has always been one of the bedrocks of this club and with this investment we’re future proofed for at least the next 10 years<br /><br />The transition from Under-23 to first team is massive. It’s a specifically English issue as we don’t have B teams playing at a high level, which our European competitors have. So, we need to make careful choices around who stays with the Under-23s, who trains with the first team and who goes on loan. The transition team will be responsible for managing development plans for each and every player to best optimise their potential</p>
