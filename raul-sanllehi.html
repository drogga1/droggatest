  <p><b>[Raul Sanllehi says the club will only look to add during the January transfer window if something special becomes available]</b> We are going to have that debate if that is the situation. Right now, we have not even started looking into that. Unless something special comes up, in principle, the winter window is not one that we are really interested in.<br /><br />We are always alert. We are always looking at the market and opportunities that could appear. Normally I am not a strong fan of the winter window. I think the winter window is for unexpected problems. That’s not a rule, it is a principle. We have a full team of professionals looking into the market, analysing the possibilities and the players. The head coach embraces the philosophy we have and the way we want to play. If we see an opportunity, there is a healthy debate<br /><br /><b>[Asked if a failure to put an extension in place is down to money issues]</b> I would like to avoid talking about individual cases. The one thing I can assure you is that any decision we take with any player is after a thorough debate, talking with all the professionals that we have put in place to make the best decisions. Nothing is decided overnight. All the decisions try to follow sporting and business rationale. In the end, our responsibility is the club. We are here to take Arsenal to the next level and all the decisions are taken for that goal</p>

  <p><b>[When asked if he saw a Super League in the future]</b> Not in the short term because we have an agreement with UEFA right now - but I don’t know what the future will bring because the future writes itself. I don’t envision, not in the short term or medium term, radical change. But what I can assure you is, we think the current situation is an optimal situation. We are very proud to be in the Premier League.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal’s head of football Raul Sanllehi admits that the club may be forced to buy a replacement for Danny Welbeck in January]</b> That is absolutely something unplanned. Yes, that makes you consider things. I am not saying that’s a green light to go to the market but we have good players in the house also that may get further opportunities, like Eddie Nketiah for example. We need to see. We are in November, so it’s a good time to start analysing what options we have in the market. We are not closing the door but it’s still not the preferred one. The plans were made in the summer. We are happy with how things are going. We are always going to strive to be the best team we can be. If there is a very good opportunity, we are definitely going to consider <b>[it]</b>, we will see. Danny Welbeck’s injury alters, in a way, the views.</p>

We have a full team of professionals looking into the market, analysing the possibilities and the players. The head coach embraces the philosophy we have and the way we want to play.

  <p><b>[Arsenal did not offer Aaron Ramsey new deal due to ‘salary balance’ concerns]</b> One of the key things for me - and I’ve seen that happening in other clubs - one of the key things is to keep the rationality in the salary balance of the team. Because of our circumstances, because of not renewing Aaron on time, we were in a situation in which Aaron had incredible offers building up on the salary. He was really keen on staying with us, he was ready to make the effort but at the end of the whole process we had to be responsible for ourselves and protect the interests of Arsenal. We realised we were going to cause an imbalance that would have been very harmful for the team’s sake in the medium and longer term.<br /><br />What I can tell you is that we have identified very clearly and unanimously with our head coach and technical people, we know what we want to prioritise and we’re very clear on what our priorities are. We’re already in the market and we’re already talking with the people that can help us to cover those positions and I feel quite strong. It’s going well and the image that Arsenal has in the football world is very strong. I do believe that we have a very good plan to cover those positions to be much stronger next year to deliver the success that we’re all hoping for. We are a reference in the football world, so when Arsenal knocks on the door of players it’s a different knock than other clubs. Of course, the fact that we have not been in the Champions League for two years and we are in question marks now for the next year, that’s not helpful. But again, the image of Arsenal is strong enough to help us build a case about all the model we are bringing up, the new era that we are bringing up. It’s very exciting<br /><br />That role is really crucial in the whole model. We are hoping to be able to get that covered very soon … we are only missing that piece. Surely we are going to be able to cover for him in the short term but when we are talking mid-term and long term we really need that position</p>

It’s going well and the image that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> has in the football world is very strong. We need to go where we belong and that’s the Champions League.

  <p><b>[Head of football Raul Sanllehi is expecting further movement before the window slams shut]</b> I cannot say a name because I wouldn’t be doing my job. If I say a name, I walk out the door tonight and he’s £10m more expensive. The transfer window is a moving target, I have been doing this for 16 years now and I know that some windows are harder than others. This is a particularly hard window. When I talk with other clubs, this is a common knowledge. There is a bit of stagnation in the market and you don’t see the number of signings you normally see just yet. I don’t know exactly how things will turn out, but I can assure you we are working every hour of every day. I think it’s a bit like school, where you evaluate your grade at the end of the school year and not in the middle.<br /><br />What is most important is to talk with the coach, about how he is feeling about the team, what system he wants to play. He knows more than anyone, more than me, about what he wants. We’re going to do our best and we will keep working, but I will not mention any names. <a href="edu.html">Edu</a> joined us recently and is doing great work, but he is not going to be responsible for this window, I want to make this very clear. His real job is going to start in September and he will start planning and working with scouts then. Having said that, he is helping us now, but it would be unfair to say this window is him</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">The Gunners</a> are putting their faith in young players as they look to return to the summit of English football under <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a>]</b> Identifying, recruiting and developing young players is a key part of our strategy. We have some great talent coming through our younger age groups and, like all top clubs, the challenge is to help them make the most of their abilities. We need to make sure the academy pathway continues to drive great talent into the first team<br /><br />We’ve got an ambitious goal. To get to one young player joining our first-team every two years. Youth has always been one of the bedrocks of this club and with this investment we’re future proofed for at least the next 10 years<br /><br />The transition from Under-23 to first team is massive. It’s a specifically English issue as we don’t have B teams playing at a high level, which our European competitors have. So, we need to make careful choices around who stays with the Under-23s, who trains with the first team and who goes on loan. The transition team will be responsible for managing development plans for each and every player to best optimise their potential</p>
