  <p><b>[Gary Lineker believes Tottenham could be in danger of ‘driving away a seriously top coach’ unless they back Mauricio Pochettino in the transfer market]</b> I think Pochettino has been putting pressure on the board with his comments in the media. I saw him a few months back and you could tell then that he was keen to bring in a few players because they have hardly signed anyone in the last couple of years. Despite that, they are not far short of being a really, really top side and it must be very frustrating for him. There comes a point where Tottenham could drive away a seriously top coach and they have to be careful to make sure that doesn’t happen, but there are other factors in play here.<br /><br />We don’t know the financial position of the club right now after the move to the new stadium and that might be affecting their spending power in the transfer market. Running a football club is not easy and even though fans and managers want new signings all the time, you don’t really know what is going on behind the scenes. There is no doubt that Tottenham are short in a couple of positions to go on from where they are now and win the big trophies, but they have done well to hang on to their best players in recent years and we wait to see what happens with players coming and going up to the deadline on Thursday. We have to wait until the end of the window and if they were to sell a player like Christian Eriksen and not buy a suitable replacement, then you could say they have let Pochettino down. However, that hasn’t happened yet<br /><br />You look at Tottenham and if they were to lose a player like Eriksen and didn’t replace him, then Pochettino would be irritated, there is no question about that, but we don’t know what that would mean for his future. However, there is no point speculating on something that might happen when we have only for until Thursday afternoon to wait to find out whether they will happen. There are a lot of ifs and buts in the stories linking Erikson with Manchester United and I tend to ignore these rumours until they actually happen. I know from my contacts within the game how transfers work and clubs will have lists of players of who they want in different positions. They will work down that list until they get the one they want.<br /><br />So while Eriksen might be on that transfer list for Manchester United, the chances are they might not get him and there is no point in speculating on whether moving to United would be a step up for Eriksen as it will probably never happen. If this moves goes through, then you can give a verdict and discuss what it all means, but there is a 95 per cent chance it will never happen, so there is probably no point in us speculating on what it would mean if this move transpires by Thursday</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Lineker has rejected suggestions that Manchester United lack the pulling power they once possessed]</b> It is just silly to say Manchester United are not what they once were and there is no question that they are still a great football club. Football is cyclical. No one wins the league year after year forever more and that’s a good thing because we all want to see new winners and new stories, but United are still a huge draw for any player and we saw that this week with Harry Maguire going there from Leicester. Liverpool is a great football club, but they haven’t won an English league title for 30 years, so do we say they are not the force they once were because of that? They are European champions, they are a fantastic club and they have a great team at the moment, so football is not black and white. My old club Tottenham have not won one of the big trophies for a long time, but they are still a great club and just because we have seen United going through a period of transition after Alex Ferguson’s retirement and have made a few mistakes with recruitment doesn’t mean to say you are no longer a great football club<br /><br /><b>[Lineker suggests Solskjaer needs to be given time to reshape the club’s image despite pre-season pessimism from some of the club’s supporters]</b> They have shifted their policy slightly to young, British players and that is probably the right route to go after some difficult years signings star names. I can see United closing the gap this season. They are obviously not going to be up there with Manchester City and Liverpool challenging for the title, but it all about getting closer to those top two. They are a work in progress and let’s see where we are in a few months. This is Solskjaer’s first full season in the job, they have made some good defensive signings and they just need a few things to click into place and they could surprise a few people this season</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Lineker says Harry Maguire is overpriced but the market is mad. When asked if the United new boy’s asking price can be considered a bargain or baffling]</b> Both. Of course, he’s overpriced because the market is mad. First thing you think is ‘oh, £80 million, that’s a lot for a centre-half’ and it is, it’s a mad amount of money. We’ve <b>[Leicester]</b> lost a really good player so what’s important now is how that money is spent on replacements. It could be really beneficial, but for supporters, they’re losing another good player just as they start to think we’re doing well. Manchester United needed a ball-playing central defender and <b>[Ole Gunnar]</b> Solskjaer wanted Maguire. He’s a terrific player so the board backed him. Some Manchester United fans will say ‘oh we’ve overpaid’, but it doesn’t make any difference to them. It’s just a number, isn’t it? The club will still make loads of money. Liverpool fans said it about Van Dijk, but nobody’s saying it now. Van Dijk’s gone on to be brilliant<br /><br /><b>[Callum Hudson-Odoi and Jadon Sancho are two of the most highly-rated talents available to Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate. Asked who he considers to be the brighter prospect]</b> They’re both terrific. What Sancho has done in Germany has been great for him and I think we’re at a time when we’ve <b>[England]</b> got lots of terrific, exciting young players. I’d also put Phil Foden alongside these two. Euro 2020 might be a bit early for us, but we’ll be very competitive in Qatar <b>[at the 2022 World Cup]</b>. If I had to choose one? At the moment I’d go for Sancho because he’s fit and Hudson-Odoi has had that <b>[Achilles]</b> injury</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Lineker says Lionel Messi is a ridiculous talent]</b> I love them both, but if you say on Twitter, ‘that’s an unbelievably great goal from the wonderful Cristiano Ronaldo’ you’ll get Messi fans on your case and if you say something brilliant about Messi, which I do a lot because he’s ridiculous, you’ll get Ronaldo fans on your case. You can love them both and admire them both which I do, but they’re very different. Ronaldo’s an athlete. He’s driven, he’s got the absolute best out of his game. He’s the best header of the ball I’ve ever seen and the best goalscorer I’ve ever seen. But Messi is also as good a goalscorer as there’s ever been and he’s as good a passer as you’ll ever see and as good a dribbler as you’ll ever see. When I watch Ronaldo I admire him, when I watch Messi he gives me joy and for me, that’s the difference</p>

I never thought I’d see a better player than Diego. <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> was unbelievable. I was so much in awe of him, as was everybody in those days<br /><br /><a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> does everything that <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> could do and more. His goalscoring ratio is near enough a goal a game, whereas Diego’s is about one in two, which is still very good in those days. It’s a little bit easier now. But also, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is the best dribbler I’ve ever seen and he’s as good of a passer as I’ve ever seen. Diego was great at both of those things, but when you take into account the longevity that <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s done it for. Around 15 years at the same level. Remarkable</p>

  <p><b>[Lineker to suggest <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup should consider a major change]</b> Bit controversial, but I’d get rid of replays in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup. 90 minutes only, no extra time, penalties if a draw. It’s a thing from a bygone age. Would give smaller teams a greater chance of going through. We’re the only country that has them. Just a thought<br /><br /><b>[Lineker on Brandon Williams]</b> The more I watch Brandon Williams, the more I like what I see.

  <p><b>[Gary Lineker says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> academy product <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> will develop into the best player of the current Reds crop]</b> Trent <b>[Alexander-Arnold]</b> came through the academy and he’s going to be the best of the lot. They’ve got lots of special players, particularly up front with the big three. But Trent is very special. He’s one of those players I watch every game and see three or four things from him that I go: ‘Oh my God’. Like the Champions League semi-final against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> with that quick corner. What a remarkable thing for a kid to do - to have that gall and bravery against some of the world’s best players. That could’ve ended up looking stupid but he’s smart. I interviewed him a year ago at his home. He was very shy and you can be kidded by a soft scouse accent but this kid’s really intelligent<br /><br /><b>[Lineker pinpointed <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s ability to transform new signings into world-class players as one of the key reasons behind the club’s resurgence]</b> When they bought Salah everybody thought: ‘Hmmm … should be all right. Mane looked a good player at Southampton. But did we think he was this good? Henderson was there and everyone goes: ‘Nah. He’s nothing special.’ Everybody had a go at him. Now people are realising this kid’s a bloody good football player and a real leader. We all knew Van Djik was good but he came from Celtic and Southampton. <a href="gini-wijnaldum.html">Wijnaldum</a> came from <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. <a href="andy-robertson.html">Andy Robertson</a> didn’t cost much from Hull</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Lineker says <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> shouldn’t be criticised for being honest]</b> It’s understandable. He’s a top-class player, he’s one of the great strikers in world football and there’s bound to be a degree of frustration with the recent progress at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>. It’s not easy. We’ve seen it with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> that when you build a new ground it can slow down your development and that’s possibly happening with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. He’s just being very honest, isn’t he? He’s saying that if they don’t go on to win things … because every player wants to win things in their career. I didn’t win too much myself. But it would be unthinkable for a player of <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>’s stature if he didn’t win anything in his entire career. You can’t criticise him too much for having that view. He’s been at the club for a long time and he’s been brilliant. And he might well stay there, they might possibly develop, but you’d say they’re four or five players short of certainly challenging for the title</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Lineker says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> vs <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> debate is not even close]</b> People get very tribal in all sorts of ways in life, and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> versus <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is one of them. Often the choice seems to come down to whether you support <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> or whoever, which is fine - I understand that. I am a huge fan of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> too, but if you’re talking about the best player ever, there shouldn’t even be a debate that it is <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. That’s just my opinion, but it’s not even close for me.<br /><br />essi has obviously played in some great teams during his time there but, whoever has been alongside him, his amazing numbers have carried on exactly the same. He has proved the doubters wrong, time and time again. Even for the past couple of seasons, when the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> team has not been anything like as strong as it was in the past, his contribution has not dipped. In fact, they have been a real mess without him. It’s rare for any player to stay with one club now, in the way <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, let alone someone who moved there from a different country like he did when he left Argentina for Spain, aged 13. But, if he had left for any reason, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> would have been accused of being disloyal. He cannot win, basically. And why would he want to move anyway? He started with one of the greatest clubs in world football. Leave <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> and you only move sideways at best. You are never going to move up</p>

It’s filmed, I’ve seen it but unless you know <b>[what was happening]</b> you wouldn’t know. I was not very well; I was poorly at half-time but I carried on. The ball went down the left-hand side. I did try to tackle someone, I stretched and then I relaxed myself<br /><br />I was very fortunate it rained that night and I could do something about it. It was messy, it just came out, it happened. How much detail do you want? It’s true; it was the opening game of the 1990 World Cup against the Republic of Ireland. You can see me rubbing the ground like a dog; it was the most horrendous experience of my life, but I tell you I never found so much space in a game than I did that night after that happened</p>
