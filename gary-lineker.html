I would say we have halved the gap that was there a couple of years back, and with the money in the English game we should get even closer in the next couple of years. You have to remember that Real Madrid and Barcelona have a magical appeal to players all over the world and can generally sign who they want, but they have had Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi at their peak for the last few years, which has been a deciding factor in so many big games. The two of them are now getting towards the back end of their careers, and when they go, which sadly for all of us they will, it is going to be impossible to replace them.

  <p><b>[Gary Lineker has ruled out England sparking a surprise and winning the 2018 World Cup]</b> I personally would lean a bit toward the younger players, the ones that have had a bit of success in tournaments. Just to give them the experience. Perhaps sell it to the English public as a learning curve for our boys. Let’s not get over expectant, we’re not going to win it or anything. We are going to see how it will go. It will be a great chance for these young players, mixed with a bit of experience obviously. We are on the cusp of being a very, very good international side. It’s probably, realistically a bit too soon. If we got to the quarter-final, that would be a great achievement with what we’ve got. But looking behind it, looking in four years’ time, then we are going to be super competitive. I think this is a great opportunity to bring in the likes of <b>[Ruben]</b> Loftus-Cheek, <b>[Trent]</b> Alexander-Arnold, terrific young players who have performed really well this season. And just give them a go. What do England have to lose?<br /><br />We are lacking world-class players, that is what you really need to be successful at a World Cup. We have been through a period of time where we did not produce enough world-class players. We had Rooney, who was probably the only world-class player of his generation. Now we’re starting to get there again, with Harry Kane and young players like Raheem Sterling and Dele Alli. Players like that doing really well, Kyle Walker doing brilliantly at Manchester City. We are starting to get one or two players who could become world class. But ultimately, to be successful, we need more and you can see that happening because we have got so many great young kids coming through. But it’s probably a couple of years too soon</p>

He’s got the same power, the same explosivity, same speed, same brilliant, and everything’s done at an incredible tempo that gives the impression that it is all so easy. He seems unaffected by pressure.<br /><br /><b>[Lineker was asked to compare Mbappe with Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen]</b> Both were able to do incredible things, in particular Michael Owen in the quarter-final of the 1998 World Cup against Argentina <b>[when he scored a memorable solo goal]</b>, but they were human</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Lineker believes N’Golo Kante has been the outstanding player of the World Cup]</b> For me, until now, N’Golo has been the best player at the World Cup. He’s not really the type of guy we speak about or try to push forward as a star. With Kante, France play with 12 men. He counts as two midfielders on his own. He’s everywhere. His quality of pass is excellent and he can break the lines. He’s able to push the ball forwards. Honestly, it’s a huge advantage to have Kante in the team. He’s one of the keys to France and is one of the reasons they’re a big favourite for the final<br /><br />I’m a big fan. In his position, he’s the best player I’ve ever seen. He has an incredibly reading of the game. He intercepts balls that are impossible. He runs everywhere. He’s a real thief. The way he takes the ball from the feet of his opponents, without them appearing to notice, is incredible. And then he uses the ball quickly and well. He’s not only essential for the balance of the team, but he helps his team-mates. Would Pogba be the same without N’Golo beside him? Would the central defenders, Samuel Umtiti and Raphael Varane would not have the same assurance if N’Golo was not in front of them?<br /><br />I always ask myself why Didier Deschamps denied himself Kante in the final of Euro 2016. I think that what he did that day was his biggest error as a manager, which all the respect I have for that great coach. With Kante, France would not have lost that final</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Lineker has admitted he fears for Harry Kane’s long-term fitness]</b> It is always a worry when you get a recurring injury and there is clearly a little weakness in there. No player wants to have an injury that keeps cropping up, but ankles are not as bad as having a recurring calf problem or a hamstring issue, as they can be hard to overcome. You can roll your ankle and get away with it to an extent, but the more you do it, the more you worry the weakness will become a problem. The sequence of events on that Sunday afternoon when Kane injured himself could not have been worse for Tottenham. They played well against United and should have won the game, but ended up losing and then Kane did his ankle in the final seconds, so it was just a terrible day overall. They have picked up some positive results in the Premier League over the last few weeks though and are in a strong position despite losing some key players at the wrong moment. Maybe Kane can come back for the second leg of the Champions League tie against Borussia Dortmund and having had this injury before, Harry will know when he is ready to play again. The pressure will be there for him to come back because Tottenham need him for the Dortmund tie.<br /><br />You can see a club like Real Madrid making a move for Kane at some stage, but it is a question of timing whether he wants to be part of Tottenham going into the new stadium. I hope he stays and I hope the manager Pochettino stays too because we know he is in demand. I remember when Kane came through at Tottenham and had a good run, everyone said he was a one season wonder, it will never last. What he has done in the last few years is prove he is the real deal. He reminds me so much of Alan Shearer. He has that same drive, that desire to score goals. He wants to take all the penalties, the free-kicks, any opportunity to score a goal, Kane wants to be there and all the best goal scorers have that. He loves scoring goals. I had that that same desire when I was playing, so I totally understand what drives him, but I would say he is a little closer to Shearer in playing style that he was to me. What is Kane’s value in the current transfer market? Given his age, his record, the fact that he was top scorer at the World Cup last summer….name your price and add some more to that</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Lineker believes victory against Bayern Munich could light the burners on Liverpool’s bid to win their first English league title since 1990]</b> The idea that Liverpool’s hopes of winning the Premier League title race will be helped if they are not distracted by Champions League matches is nonsense. I’m a big believer that confidence is a huge factor in any sport and the best way for a footballer to feel confident is by winning big games. So defeat against Bayern Munich would not help Liverpool at all and, in fact, I think it would have the opposite effect. It would be another big setback after a couple of minor slip-ups in the last month, it would add more doubts and that’s what you don’t want. If they go out and bash Bayern Munich in the manner they did to other teams in the Champions League last season, confidence starts to come back and what has essentially been a small blip for Liverpool with two Premier League draws, it will restore confidence and reinvigorate them. Everyone gets a bit carried away at this stage of a season when one of the top teams loses some momentum, but it’s very rare that you will steamroller through a season and win everything in sight without a slip-up or two along the way. They have had a few injuries that have undermined them to an extent and this is a little test for them, but imagine they go out and blow Bayern Munich away in the first leg of the Champions League tie at Anfield, in a manner they did with Roma last season. A win like that would reignite Liverpool and that’s why I think it’s crazy to suggest they should focus on the Premier League and would be better off out of the Champions League.<br /><br />The big issue in play here is the pressure Liverpool are under compared to Manchester City, but that is self-inflicted in many ways. We keep hearing they haven’t won the title in 29 years and their fans are clearly desperate to end that run, but the manager and the players have to block all that out and focus on the job in hand. I had a conversation with Alan Shearer a few weeks back on pressure in a title race and he quickly reminded me that I never knew what it felt like to deal with pressure in a title race as I never won one! After that, we spoke about how Liverpool’s players will be feeling and we both agreed that they have to block out the talk of how historic it could be for them to win the Premier League and focus on what they need to do. In my experience, players don’t tend to think about hype or what has been said in the media, they just go out and play. That is certainly the way I was, but there have been signs of edginess and nervousness from the crowd can sometimes be put onto the players. The tension was there to see when Harry Maguire scored an equaliser for Leicester a couple of weeks back and the Liverpool players could feel it subconsciously on the pitch. They want to win the Premier League so badly and that might just affect the players. I still feel Liverpool are in a great position to have a wonderful end to this season and they should enjoy the Champions League matches against Bayern. It will be a break from the relentless title talk and will give them a chance to focus on something else and have a break</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Lineker believes <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> could be in danger of ‘driving away a seriously top coach’ unless they back <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> in the transfer market]</b> I think <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> has been putting pressure on the board with his comments in the media. I saw him a few months back and you could tell then that he was keen to bring in a few players because they have hardly signed anyone in the last couple of years. Despite that, they are not far short of being a really, really top side and it must be very frustrating for him. There comes a point where <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> could drive away a seriously top coach and they have to be careful to make sure that doesn’t happen, but there are other factors in play here.<br /><br />We don’t know the financial position of the club right now after the move to the new stadium and that might be affecting their spending power in the transfer market. Running a football club is not easy and even though fans and managers want new signings all the time, you don’t really know what is going on behind the scenes. There is no doubt that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are short in a couple of positions to go on from where they are now and win the big trophies, but they have done well to hang on to their best players in recent years and we wait to see what happens with players coming and going up to the deadline on Thursday. We have to wait until the end of the window and if they were to sell a player like <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> and not buy a suitable replacement, then you could say they have let <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> down. However, that hasn’t happened yet<br /><br />You look at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and if they were to lose a player like Eriksen and didn’t replace him, then <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> would be irritated, there is no question about that, but we don’t know what that would mean for his future. However, there is no point speculating on something that might happen when we have only for until Thursday afternoon to wait to find out whether they will happen. There are a lot of ifs and buts in the stories linking Erikson with <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and I tend to ignore these rumours until they actually happen. I know from my contacts within the game how transfers work and clubs will have lists of players of who they want in different positions. They will work down that list until they get the one they want.<br /><br />So while Eriksen might be on that transfer list for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, the chances are they might not get him and there is no point in speculating on whether moving to United would be a step up for Eriksen as it will probably never happen. If this moves goes through, then you can give a verdict and discuss what it all means, but there is a 95 per cent chance it will never happen, so there is probably no point in us speculating on what it would mean if this move transpires by Thursday</p>

Often the choice seems to come down to whether you support <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> or whoever, which is fine - I understand that. I am a huge fan of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> too, but if you’re talking about the best player ever, there shouldn’t even be a debate that it is <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. That’s just my opinion, but it’s not even close for me.<br /><br />essi has obviously played in some great teams during his time there but, whoever has been alongside him, his amazing numbers have carried on exactly the same. He has proved the doubters wrong, time and time again. Even for the past couple of seasons, when the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> team has not been anything like as strong as it was in the past, his contribution has not dipped. In fact, they have been a real mess without him. It’s rare for any player to stay with one club now, in the way <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, let alone someone who moved there from a different country like he did when he left Argentina for Spain, aged 13. But, if he had left for any reason, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> would have been accused of being disloyal. He cannot win, basically. And why would he want to move anyway? He started with one of the greatest clubs in world football. Leave <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> and you only move sideways at best. You are never going to move up</p>

  <p><b>[Why did Gary Lineker ‘sh*t’ on the pitch at World Cup 1990?]</b> I’ve never admitted to it, but it’s true. It was a World Cup game. It’s filmed, I’ve seen it but unless you know <b>[what was happening]</b> you wouldn’t know. I was not very well; I was poorly at half-time but I carried on. The ball went down the left-hand side. I did try to tackle someone, I stretched and then I relaxed myself<br /><br />I was very fortunate it rained that night and I could do something about it. It was messy, it just came out, it happened. How much detail do you want? It’s true; it was the opening game of the 1990 World Cup against the Republic of Ireland. You can see me rubbing the ground like a dog; it was the most horrendous experience of my life, but I tell you I never found so much space in a game than I did that night after that happened</p>
