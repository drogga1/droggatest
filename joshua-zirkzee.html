  <p><b>[Bayern sensation Zirkzee reveals he came close to following in <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>’s footsteps at Everton]</b> <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> was a serious option for me. <a href="ronald-koeman.html">Ronald Koeman</a> was coach, <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> left for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> that summer and I got the feeling from <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> that there was a good chance I could really become something there. They even offered me a contract whilst I was on trial<br /><br /><b>[Everton’s loss has been Bayern’s gain, with Zirkzee having moved quickly through the youth system at the Allianz Arena]</b> After I first trained with Bayern, I knew that’s who I wanted to join. I told myself, let me do three sessions - then I’ll decide if I’m good enough. They told me I have the quality, but also that they wanted to work on my conditioning, among other things. They’ve been true to their word. I want to become the main striker at Bayern - that’s always been my objective</p>

  <p><b>[Zirkzee is in a group of four with <a href="alphonso-davies.html">Alphonso Davies</a>, <a href="david-alaba.html">David Alaba</a> and <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a>, and he reveals how <a href="hansi-flick.html">Hans-Dieter Flick</a>’s side makes the most of their time at Sabener Strasse]</b> We train in separate groups of four, maximum five people. Group 1 must be at the club by 10 am and start when group two has to change. We are now also using the changing rooms of the second team, so actually you always change alone. Every day, we actually follow a course in which everything is included. Technique, condition, finishing, everything is discussed</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern’s Joshua Zirkzee turns back on Super Eagles]</b> Oranje is a dream and as a young footballer I think it makes sense to dream about it<br /><br /><b>[He is hoping to cap his maiden campaign in the first-team with silverware]</b> Certainly, that is the first step. But we also really want to win the Champions League, the whole club longs for that. Even though we first have to see how it will all end. We all hope that we can go again soon, to start</p>
