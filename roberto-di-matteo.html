  <p><b>[Manager Roberto Di Matteo hails the inspiring Stiliyan Petrov, who returned to <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> after being diagnosed with acute leukaemia in 2012]</b> I think he’s an example of bravery and willingness to everybody that is here. The fact that he has come to pre-season, he has not missed one minute, then you can see how hard he is working in training. The story he has gone through, the past, so it’s a remarkable journey for him and I told him the other day I think he’s an example for all of us</p>

  <p><b>[Roberto Di Matteo says <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> is a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> manager of the future]</b> If you can sign JT, you get him. He’s a guy who makes things easier for the manager. He, too, will be there as a manager in the future. As a player he was writing down some of the sessions and he’s now gained so much experience from the managers he’s worked under<br /><br /><b>[Di Matteo added on the former midfielder]</b> Frank will become a great manager. He is a very balanced guy - sensible, smart and incredibly hard-working. I think it’s the right appointment for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> because it brings everybody together.<br /><br /><b>[The ex-Italy international said]</b> I have learned from my time in management that I am quite intense. I’d like to enjoy the job a bit more than I did in the beginning, and make it enjoyable for my players. I’m an attack-minded manager. Look back at MK Dons and West Brom. We were the second-highest scorers in the league on both occasions. Because I won the Champions League with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, people focus on the semi-final against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and the final against <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>. But two high-profile games certainly doesn’t define a team or manager.<br /><br />Look against <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, we won 4-1 (in the second leg of a last 16 tie en route to lifting the European Cup) and had to attack the whole game, which we did very well. The season after, there was plenty of free-flowing football, too. And at Villa, you were starting to see some really good signs from the team. At Schalke, we scared the life out of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> by winning 4-3 at the Bernabeu. <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> even told me this after the game, but the first leg defeat (2-0) killed us and we narrowly missed out on qualifying for the quarter-finals. For me, there’s no better feeling than winning a game of football that you’re involved in. I love it. It’s my life. And there’s another chapter waiting for me now</p>

  <p><b>[Timo Werner is on his way to Chelsea]</b> When I was at Schalke, he was at Stuttgart and he was just coming on to the scene. During the second part of the season, before I left, I was planning with my sporting director. I was saying I wanted to sign this guy, he’s good. He was young, quick, technically good. I said ‘can we not sign this boy Timo’. We didn’t in the end and then I resigned and so on. Then I went to Villa. Stuttgart, the season after, they got relegated, and so I enquired again to sign him, but then Leipzig signed him on<br /><br />I’m a big fan of his and he’s developed really, really well as well. He’s a goal scorer, he scores goals, so he can guarantee a certain amount of goals for the team, which is very good, and he’s very pacey as well, he’s fast</p>
