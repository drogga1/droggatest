  <p>[Abby Dahlkemper does not believe that the size of the goal and pitch should be made smaller for the women’s game. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> manager <a href="emma-hayes.html">Emma Hayes</a> sparked discussion with a recent column in The Times saying that the dimensions should be altered for women’s football] I think they absolutely should be the way that they are. Personally I agree with everything that Crystal said. You see these breakout players like the Chilean goalkeeper and that’s the quality and level that women’s soccer has imposed and I feel that’s incredible</p>

  <p>[Were it not for two poor challenges in the box from Spain defenders, they may have secured one of the greatest upsets in World Cup history. Instead, they will have to rue a major missed opportunity in a 2-1 defeat to the U.S] We were tested. That was a really good team that we played against and that was a gritty performance by us</p>
