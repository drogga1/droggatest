  <p><b>[A former team-mate of <a href="erling-haland.html">Erling Haaland</a> has described the dramatic transformation the <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> star underwent as a youngster at Molde]</b> With <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a>, when he played in Norway with me, he didn’t score for a week in training before a game. We were laughing at him! And when I heard he was starting the game I was thinking, ‘No way … how can we play with this guy!?’ And after 50 minutes he’d scored four goals. And after that, things just skyrocketed. But I think he learned an important lesson that, when tough times come, just work harder. And they <b>[the young players]</b> have a chance to learn that now.<br /><br />When he came to the club, he was a small guy … he was not so good to be honest with you. I was just thinking ‘Yeah, maybe he can play in Norway … ‘. And then he got sick and injured, and we didn’t see him for a long time, and he came back big as fuck … he was so big! He was a different animal! He was killing everybody in training … we just started laughing and I was like, ‘Who is this guy?’ And then it just skyrocketed from there. I’m just laughing when I see him on the telly and he’s banging in goals in the Champions League. I’m just laughing. And when he bullies defenders, I’m just laughing because I’ve been there!</p>

  <p><b>[Molde defender Ruben Gabrielsen says <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> is a magician in big games]</b> For me he was fantastic. I learned a lot of great things about football and about life. He’s a fantastic human. He knows humans, he knows how to talk to you, he knows what you need, so I learned so much from him, and I’m forever grateful. He’s really, really clever. He thinks football 24/7. He likes to experiment, and when it comes to big games it’s like, the plan is in his head and when he gives you the plan, everything that he said will happen is going to happen. English football in Norway is huge, and I see what they write, but I know how he is and what he’s thinking. Like you say, the big games he’s played with United now, it’s all good results, so I think maybe when it’s not a big game, sometimes he can do better - but in big games, he’s a magician</p>
