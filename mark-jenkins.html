  <p><b>[West Bromwich Albion have sacked head coach Darren Moore, despite sitting fourth in the Championship table]</b> This has been an enormously difficult decision for a club which will always hold Darren in such high regard. He took over at a very difficult time last season and reunited the club, a contribution that will never be forgotten. But we have made it clear from the outset that everything this season was geared to making as swift a return to the Premier League as possible. Unfortunately Darren has not been able to engineer the consistency of form and results to convince the board that this objective would be met. After discussions with our owners, the difficult decision to make a change was taken. Darren’s dedication over the last 12 months is not underestimated and there will always be a welcome for him at The Hawthorns. But we have to place the club’s best interests at the forefront of our thinking and we must do everything we can to try to deliver the promotion we have targeted</p>

  <p><b>[West Brom chief executive Mark Jenkins giving up 100 per cent of salary during coronavirus lockdown]</b> At the moment, the club is financially stable and remains so for the foreseeable future. But everybody is fully aware these are very uncertain times in which we simply cannot forecast what the future holds. Until we regain a level of certainty, we cannot be sure if planned income will actually be received or if we will be forced to utilise cash the club already holds to refund existing commitments. With that in mind, I think it is only correct that for the duration of this lockdown I take a 100 per cent cut in my salary and other members of the senior management team have also offered to take significant reductions in their remuneration. Like many other clubs, we have considered using a furlough approach with non-playing staff who are now unable to work owing to the lockdown and we have made plans for this eventuality.<br /><br />At present we have not been required to sanction this action, but if the lockdown continues and football remains ‘on-hold’ then this decision may have to be changed. What we will pledge is to ensure none of the staff affected suffer a reduction in pay; the club will make up the 20 per cent shortfall not covered by the government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.<br /><br />I should perhaps add at this point that nothing underlines the spirit of our staff, or the commitment they have for Albion, than to tell you that several have volunteered to take pay cuts in order to help the club navigate a way through these difficulties. It says everything about the core values which run through our staff for which I and all the senior management team are both mindful and appreciative</p>
