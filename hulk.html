  <p><b>[Shanghai SIPG’s Brazilian star Hulk has denied punching Guizhou Zhicheng’s assistant coach during a heated Chinese Super League clash on Saturday]</b> Unfortunately <b>[Guizhou Zhicheng]</b> are trying to abuse my image. The coach of the opposing team is accusing me of aggression. Where did he see it? I didn’t behave violently in any way! I have a clear conscience. God knows it. I just want to do what I love most which is to play football! I’m very happy in China. I like and respect all of the Chinese people.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool sensation Mohamed Salah has won the admiration of Hulk]</b> I particularly like the style of Mohamed Salah’s game. He’s that kind of quick, skillful southpaw that goes inside. I played against him in the Europa League when he was in Basel. He is a very good player. He has grown a lot in recent years. He has been standing out in a very difficult competition, which is the Premier League. For those who understand football and like it, he is a player who has grown a lot and is very important for Egypt. And he’s worthy of the season he’s making in England.<br /><br /><b>[On Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> They are two stars. Two phenomena. The numbers speak for themselves in recent years. They have dominated. They deserve it all. Messi, everyone knows the quality he has. He’s a genius. A pure talent. He’s a magician in the field. He does things no one can expect. He is a guy who deserves respect for the history he has been building, that he has already built in football and that he is still going to build. He is a player who deserves respect. Cristiano Ronaldo for me, is an example as a professional. As a football player, I know how difficult it is. It’s not easy. He went in search of everything and conquered. He is a complete player, but he worked hard for it. He keeps improving every year. Each season growing even more. So he’s a guy who deserves respect from everyone. For what he did in football and for what he has won and also for what he will win yet. The difference between the two that I speak of is in the sense of which one you would choose. I would choose both. Messi is pure magic. It’s his own thing. From someone who was blessed and who was already born with the gift. Cristiano Ronaldo is that complete player. A machine that was programmed for <b>[football]</b>. I tip my hat to the great professional that he is. He longed for this, sought it and managed to get there. He’s a guy who deserves respect for all this</p>
