  <p><b>[Former Fenerbahce official Hasan Cetinkaya says that <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> admitted would have liked to join Fenerbahce during his time at <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a>]</b> <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> is an old friend of mine, I’ve known him since I was 15-16. Then he was playing at <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a>. He had a great sympathy for Fenerbahce. He had a word for me: ‘Hasan, I will play at Fenerbahce someday’. We don’t know when. He was 16 at the time when he was playing for <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a> and I watched them play against <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. Even at that age he showed what he can do. There was <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a>, Gervinho and Sow during the time that we spoke. We just got Sow from there<br /><br /><b>[Cetinkaya does admit that given <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>’s transformation into one of the world’s finest talents, landing him could prove a tough challenge]</b> Eden has changed into a different dimension. He got offers from the most important clubs in Europe. He was one of the greatest talented star candidates in Europe. He would have liked to come to Fenerbahce at that time <b>[in <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a>]</b>. Let’s see if one day he wears the uniform of Fenerbahce.</p>

  <p><b>[Telling of the first meeting with <a href="marc-overmars.html">Overmars</a> and CEO <a href="edwin-van-der-sar.html">Edwin van der Sar</a>, Cetinkaya recalls telling them]</b> We should not sell <a href="frenkie-de-jong.html">Frenkie de Jong</a> for €50m. We will sell him for €100m. We will not only set the record for a Dutch club, we will make the biggest sale ever for a Dutch player. And suddenly there was an absolutely fantastic atmosphere in the room. Then it became a tug of war, where <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> did just about everything to get Frenkie. But <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> had always been his first choice, their football is in his DNA. There was tremendous pressure on <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s sporting management to get the deal done, and they really wanted to guard themselves<br /><br /><b>[As <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> got hold of one of world football’s biggest stars, beating some of Europe’s richest clubs in the process, the relief among the club’s hierarchy was clear]</b> I’ve never been to anything like it. Those in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s sporting leadership were so relieved that the then sports manager <a href="pep-segura.html">Pep Segura</a> began to cry as soon as the papers were written. When I saw it, I also got emotional and shed a tear, and it is damn rare that I cry. There was a hug, there was champagne and then I, Ali Durson <b>[a fellow agent]</b>, Frenkie and his whole family went up to a really nice restaurant in the mountains that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> had paid for. We drank Spain’s best wine, ate a fantastic piece of meat and everyone just laughed and were overjoyed. They sang their Dutch songs, I tried to join in as best I could. Totally fantastic</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="victor-lindelof.html">Victor Lindelof</a>’s agent says <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> tried to sign the defender from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> after <a href="matthijs-de-ligt.html">Matthijs de Ligt</a> rejected them to join <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>]</b> <a href="victor-lindelof.html">Lindelof</a> was perhaps <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>’s best player last season, and there was a lot of interest from clubs that are even better <b>[than United]</b> at the moment. When <a href="matthijs-de-ligt.html">Matthijs de Ligt</a> chose <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, Victor was pronounced <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s first choice. His way of playing, his DNA, is very close to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s way of playing. He is one of the world’s best centre-backs with the ball at his feet, and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> wanted him. That’s how it was. I can talk about that now. They contacted <a href="edward-woodward.html">Ed Woodward</a> on numerous occasions with concrete offers. I had a meeting with their transfer manager, Matt Judge, to try to make a transition. But they just said: ‘There is no chance. Victor is one of our best players’. It ended up being a new agreement instead, even though Victor actually had three years left. Usually, they do not make extensions with players who have so long left on the contract, but when there was an interest at this level they had no other option<br /><br /><b>[Cetinkaya says <a href="victor-lindelof.html">Lindelof</a> has come a long way since the day they met in a Lisbon restaurant while the Sweden international was still in the <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> youth system]</b> The day he signed the new contract was one of the finest moments I’ve had. I’ve been with him from the day he was an academy player in <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a>, and I met him and Maja <b>[Nilsson, <a href="victor-lindelof.html">Lindelof</a>’s wife]</b> at a very sunny little restaurant in Lisbon.<br /><br />Back then he was a kid with a little potty salary that he barely managed, and Maja was a girl who had left her job and all her childhood friends just because she believed in love. Two young people with big dreams, but with the same uncertainty.<br /><br />Victor wanted to become a world-class player, but worked with an agent who wanted to take him home to Allsvenskan. There was a clear agreement between Malmo and <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> - only missing the player’s signature - but then I came in after flying five hours from Istanbul and declared that he would ditch both the agreement and his agent.</p>
