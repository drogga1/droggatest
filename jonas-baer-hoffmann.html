  <p><b>[FIFPro slams Belarus league for playing on amid coronavirus crisis]</b> We’re appealing for it to be taken with the same cautionary measures that have been taken in the rest of football. It is frankly not comprehendible how this could be going on. Why those standards there would be looking so much different from just across the border, I don’t think anybody can explain. So everything in common sense tells you that they need to apply the same standards and we will be lobbying to that effect. Yes, there are players who are reaching out who are concerned</p>

  <p><b>[Jonas Baer-Hoffmann, the general secretary of FIFPRO, says decisions will have to be made on an individual basis to prevent players putting themselves at increased risk of injury]</b> We are quite convinced that we will need to find solutions which may have to happen on a club-by-club basis for how these players still get their rest. Of course, the greatest challenge is for players who represent their countries because for all the others there are the international breaks, and the clubs hopefully will apply some common sense and give the rest of the squad some time away. For the national team players it’s very difficult, it may come down to quite an individualised approach. We need to address that country by country and most of our unions are engaged in those conversations with their respective leagues regarding how that can be managed.<br /><br /><b>[Critics of the rule say it grants an unfair advantage to the clubs with greater squad depth]</b> If you’ve got a deeper squad you’ll be able to utilise it, that’s true. But I think in this context we have to be taking the health precautions first, and I would argue there are far more severe elements in football that contribute to competitive imbalance that we have to tackle first. Is there a consequence? Yes, that’s quite likely, but we would say in this particular situation that we’re in right now, health simply comes first</p>
