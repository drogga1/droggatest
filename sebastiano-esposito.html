  <p><b>[Inter forward Sebastiano Esposito hailed the perfect partnership of <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> and <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a> as he played out an entertaining 2-2 draw with <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>’s Rafael Leao in their virtual Milan derby]</b> Lautaro and <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> are the perfect partnership. The numbers show it - they showed it on PES too. I got the most out of them having watched them up close and personal. I thank them for scoring the goals, but they could’ve done even better</p>
