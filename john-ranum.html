<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On Andreas Christensen]</b> Yes, it was a very sad day <b>[when Christensen left]</b> because we hoped that he would stay here and play in our first team after maybe one more year and prove that he was good enough to play adult football. So that was what we hoped, but if you look back now then it has been a good decision for him <b>[to leave]</b>. The plan Chelsea made for him was fantastic. They made a plan for his education going forward and it was very very good. It is a fantastic academy at Chelsea, if you can’t develop there then you can’t develop anywhere, I don’t think. They have everything there. I hope he gets his chance, now he is back.<br /><br />He is technically fantastic. As a person he is very calm and he has very good vision. He has always been very, very clever at reading the game. Sometimes when he started to play central defender, some people said that he won’t be physically strong enough to play it at the highest level. Then we said, ‘Yes he will because he doesn’t need the physical strength and he will put that on later in his career’. He is so clever to read the game that strength is not necessary. We can see at Gladbach that he is reading the game very well and when he needs to go physical, one against one, he now has the strength also</p>

  <p><b>[On Andreas Christensen]</b> I think he is one of the best central defenders at his age, that’s for sure. I think he still has to take some steps to go really far. I think he has the potential to play for the best clubs in Europe, for sure. I think his next step, I would say that if he is going to go back to Chelsea he needs around 30 to 40 matches. After playing in the Bundesliga, one of the most important things for him is to play in the starting XI most of the time. That’s what’s important, I think</p>
