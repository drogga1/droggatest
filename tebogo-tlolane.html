  <p><b>[Starting to come into his own with a string of fine performances when the Absa Premiership season was paused due to the virus outbreak in the country]</b> I chat with the other players and we talk about how much we miss Friday nights. I’m just trying to do as much as I can. Keeping fit, trying to train in my backyard, doing a few sprints. Just trying to do some things to keep me going. It’s just about trying to maintain some of the fitness and a bit of shape. Even if it’s not enough, it’s better than just sitting around. We were in a very good spell as a team. The momentum was good. It’s something you can’t describe <b>[the lockdown]</b><br /><br /><b>[Tlolane admits the break has taken a mental toll on players, as well as their physical conditioning]</b> I find myself kicking the ball every day, just imagining myself training or playing. It feels like a lot of emptiness. But it’s things which you can’t control. Hopefully it can get sorted out soon. The only way we will be able to deal with this virus is to follow the instructions of the government. There’s protocol in place and we must follow it to try and get things back to normal. The more we are naive to a situation, the more it will spread. It’s about finding that place in your heart where you understand that more lives could be harmed when one person goes out. It’s very important to take the government advice. It’s important to understand that this is out of our control</p>

  <p><b>[Maritzburg United utility player Tebogo Tlolane has admitted he hasn’t imagined what his life would look like without football]</b> Obviously, I have not imagined life without football, but if there was a career, I would have taken accounting. I really liked a lot to be an accountant. The second one would have been logistics. Those two gave us a huge boost and much confidence. The one I scored in against Stellenbosch at home, and the away game against Kaizer Chiefs<br /><br /><b>[Tlolane has been keeping himself busy during lockdown by training, watching movies and communicating with his teammates on social media platforms]</b> We keep in touch almost every day <b>[with teammates and coach]</b>, just to check up how each other is doing. We also have some good calls together. I spend most of my time watching movies and series. I love Money Heist and the How to Get Away With Murder series. Movies are Bird Box, Fist Fight and Secret Obsession. I am most in contact with Keagan Buchanan, Thabiso Kutumela and Miguel Timm. We communicate via WhatsApp and Instagram</p>
