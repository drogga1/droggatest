  <p><b>[on David Beckham]</b> He’s been an incredible servant and ambassador to English football. I wouldn’t put him up there with the greatest English players of all time - there have been more talented footballers - but in terms of he’s brought to the English game, both on and off the pitch, he’s been absolutely superb. He kept himself in great shape and to be still playing at the age of 38 is a testament to that. He has been a superb professional</p>

  <p><b>[on David Beckham]</b> I was in the England squad when he made his debut against Moldova in 1996 and while his work-rate is phenomenal, I can safely say he’s the best at set-pieces that I’ve seen by a mile. In that 6-3 game, he scored a superb free-kick bent into the top corner even though we had a man on the post. I just thought, ‘Oh my God’</p>

  <p><b>[on Alan Shearer]</b> He was incredible and with 260, he is so many goals ahead of everyone else in <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> history it’s ridiculous. He went from strength to strength after leaving Southampton, you’ve only got to look at the stats - breaking Jackie Milburn’s 200-goal <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> record in double-quick time. It will be nice to tell the kids, ‘You know what, I played with him and when I did, I scored twice as many as he did’</p>

  <p><b>[on Alan Shearer]</b> If you’d have said to me that he’d go on to be <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s leading goalscorer by 87 goals, I’d have probably said no. But if you said to me ‘Will he be a very good professional footballer? Will he make a good career out of the game?’ 110 percent. What you could see from him was a mental toughness you didn’t see in a lot of players that age <b>[18]</b>. To have scored a hat-trick on his debut against probably the best back four he could have gone up against <b>[Arsenal]</b> was just incredible, and he went from strength to strength</p>

  <p><b>[Le Tissier backs Danny Ings to have huge impact at Southampton]</b> The most important thing as a forward at a new club is to get early goals. He’s got a couple so far so it’s a really good start and long may it continue. He is such a quality footballer and he’s really given the whole club a big lift. I think that’s what was needed as the club has struggled for goals a bit over the last few seasons.<br /><br />He’ll raise the standard of the players around him as well. I’m sure he would have picked up some good things at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I know he was injured a lot, but he’s still had a decent amount of time out on the training ground and if you can’t learn from training alongside the players they had at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> then there’s no point being in footballs</p>

  <p><b>[Matt Le Tissier on moving from Southampton to London big clubs]</b> I played the game the way I wanted to play it, and had I gone on to a bigger club, I probably wouldn’t have been able to do that. I knew I probably wouldn’t win any honours, but when you’re at a club that size, staying in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> for 16 years gave me as much pleasure as winning a medal if I’d gone somewhere else<br /><br /><b>[Many, less-gifted may wonder from where the thought for such outrageous pieces of skill arise. Le Tissier has his own answer]</b> You have to be willing to try something a little bit different and you don’t want to have the fear of failure. I think a lot of people tend not to try things because they think it will look foolish if it doesn’t come off, whereas I was a little bit the other way around. I didn’t have any great embarrassment if it didn’t come off</p>

  <p><b>[Matt Le Tissier says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> manager <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>’s decision to share penalty duties this season has been labelled as schoolboy stuff]</b> It does cause confusion if you have two nominated penalty-takers and you just go, ‘Well, let’s see who fancies it on the day’. That’s not professional, it’s amateurish, schoolboy stuff and that comes down to the manager. In that situation, the manager needs to be stronger and just go, ‘Right, you’re the best at penalties, you’re my penalty-taker, if you’re not on the pitch then he can take them, but up until that point, you take them’. We had a penalty competition in training to decide who was going to be taking penalties in matches and I won that. I was 20 when I became penalty-taker and there was never any question when I was on the pitch, it was my right and that was my job<br /><br /><b>[Knowing a thing or two about spot-kicks, Le Tissier believes United should give sole responsibility for penalties to Rashford]</b> I was never overly keen on <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>’s run-up because it used to take so long, it became a bit of theatre and he wasn’t taking it seriously. It was all about trying to promote himself as being the big showman and the big ‘Here I am’ without concentrating on the job in hand. The way <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> takes penalties is actually far better and if I was the manager he would be the designated penalty-taker</p>

It was only afterwards that I was stopped by a journalist in the car park and asked about it. I didn’t have a clue up until that point, which is pretty ridiculous given it wasn’t like it was a subtle change!</p>

  <p><b>[David Luiz: Soccer Saturday panel debate <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> contract extension]</b> I was surprised and I don’t think I was alone in that. It’s difficult looking from the outside because you don’t know what he’s like every day, in and around the training ground with the young lads at the club. If he is really good with those lads and he’s making a positive impact at the training ground, we only get to see what happens on the pitch with him<br /><br />He’s had his troubled times, he’s had a couple of red cards this season and he’s not been particularly great, but if they feel there’s a benefit to him being around the football club then that’s a decision they have to take and who are we to criticise it<br /><br />If finances are tight, you have to be really on the ball at spotting talent early on that you could nick away from somebody for £10 or £12m who is then going to turn into that £30m-£40m defender. That’s where <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are at right now</p>

  <p><b>[Oriol Romeu caught <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a> on the ankle, but referee Chris Kavanagh did not penalise the midfielder, who also escaped punishment upon VAR review]</b> I don’t think it was a red. It always looks bad in slow motion and the force with which he goes into him probably saved him. I don’t think it was a deliberate attempt and I don’t think the force was enough to warrant a red card. I think it was accidental and had there been more force to it, it could’ve been similar to other red cards we’ve seen this season, but I feel it was the right decision<br /><br /><b>[Le Tissier has been impressed with the attitude shown since the restart with the side not in any danger of being relegated while not in contention for a Europa League place]</b> It’s professional pride, but it’s also what the manager instils in them, wants from them and demands from them. I go back to the win over <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> a week ago, and the commitment they showed in their defending was like a team that were sat third from bottom in the table. The professionalism of the players has been an absolute credit to the manager and the football club. When you look at what we’ve been capable of in the past few weeks - we’ve just played <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> at home, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> away, <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> away. Unbeaten with five points, you look at that and think if you take that form into next season, what can we realistically achieve? From what I’ve seen, I’d expect a top-half finish from this group</p>
