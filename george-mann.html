  <p><b>[George Mann, a 16-year-old from a small English town, on the eye-opening story behind his setting up of the non-profit charity Boots4frica]</b> My mum signed me up to go and help build a church in a small community in Uganda. I must admit I was quite sceptical at first. There was always quite a crowd watching us <b>[build the church]</b>, and we arranged to play a game of football at the local school. When we got there it seemed like the whole community had turned up to watch, but what struck me was how happy they were. <b>[The locals]</b> had hand-cut the pitch - they’d used these huge knives, which I think they use to cut rice. It was a mixture of grass, mud and dust, but some of the grass was taller than the players - suddenly you’d see three people go after the ball and just disappear! But they didn’t care - they were just so happy to be playing. My dad used to coach a football team, and we’d taken over some kit for them. When we gave it to them, their eyes lit up, they were ecstatic. But before kick-off I noticed that only one of their players had boots. But when I looked closer, I noticed that he actually only had one boot, so I asked him where the other one was. He pointed to his friend on the bench and said, ‘We have very little, but what we do have, we share’. We have so much yet we complain about such trivial things; these people have absolutely nothing yet they are always smiling and have such values. I realised at that point that I had to do something.</p>
