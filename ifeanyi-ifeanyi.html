<blockquote>
  <p>[Following their comeback victory against Nasarawa United, Ifeanyi Ifeanyi says sticking to the ‘plans’ helped Akwa United] Nasarawa United really surprised us but we were helped greatly by the fact that we stuck to our plans and we were never afraid at any time in the match. They scored the opening goal but we reacted almost immediately and this made us settle down going into the second half.<br /><br />After the break, we were able to adjust our playing pattern and tried to hit them on the counter immediately the second half started and this made us to have our foothold on the game. They came out thereafter but we have shut all doors by which they could get an equalizer.</p>
