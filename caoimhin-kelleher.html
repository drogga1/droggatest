  <p><b>[Who is Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher? The Irish wonderkid eager to make waves at Anfield]</b> I’ve been doing the same things but getting better every day. Training at Melwood, you improve much more. Alisson and Simon and Kamil are here and we train to the highest level every day</p>

  <p><b>[Caoimhin Kelleher says he is trying to learn as much as he can from team-mate <a href="alisson-becker.html">Alisson Becker</a> and thinks he has improved as a player during his time working alongside the Brazilian]</b> It’s been very good for me. To be honest in the last year, I think I’ve improved quite a good bit in that part of the game and a lot has been down to him, just watching him and seeing what he does in certain situations in games. Speaking to him as well, he’ll speak to me on what stuff I can improve on, so it’s been a huge help<br /><br /><b>[Kelleher, though, is not bitter about missing out on a chance]</b> I don’t think you can look at it like that. Maybe if I hadn’t got injured, Alisson might not have got injured. I don’t really think about that, to be honest, there’s no point dwelling on stuff like that<br /><br /><b>[Despite that disappointment, Kelleher says he is enjoying life at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> and is full of praise for manager Jurgen Klopp]</b> <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s probably one of the best managers in the world, so it can only be a good thing being with him every day. He’s very good at man-management – you can see that in the way that all the players get along with him and even the players who aren’t playing or not in squads. He makes everyone feel a part of it, makes everyone feel like they’re making a difference to the team. He’s very good</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher says he was told to try to be the hero before pulling off the penalty save that won his side a place in the Carabao Cup quarter finals]</b> As soon as the final whistle went, all the focus was on trying to save in the shootout. Some of the lads and the coaches said to me, ‘You’ve nothing to lose, just try to be the hero.’ And luckily I did it in the end. It was a bit of a whirlwind. I’m obviously happy but it’s just hard to sum it up at the moment. It has all gone by quite quickly. It’s just unreal, to be honest<br /><br /><b>[Twice <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> found themselves two goals down, but they fought back to equalise deep into stoppage time]</b> <b>[The fighting spirit]</b> goes right through the whole squad. We have a never-say-die attitude and we showed that once again, coming from behind on a few occasions. <a href="divock-origi.html">Divock Origi</a> scored an unreal goal to keep us in it. It just goes right through the whole squad that we’ll never give up<br /><br />It was unbelievable tonight. Once you hear <b>[the fans]</b> singing ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ and you’re actually playing, it’s quite surreal. It’s just an unreal feeling. It’s class</p>
