  <p><b>[Sassuolo sporting director Giovanni Carnevali says <a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a> are on course to sign Stefano Sensi]</b> We have not done anything yet but we are dealing with them, there are good opportunities to define the agreement. We will see each other next week but I think we are on the right path. Inter proved to be much more concrete. We are doing the last evaluations but I think the other teams are behind. I think we will define it as soon as possible.<br /><br /><b>[Former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> boss <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> is at the start of an overhaul for his <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a> tenure and Carnevali identified him as a potentially key figure in Sensi’s development]</b> Stefano Sensi has been on an important growth path for years but I think <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> will perfect it even more</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="inter-milan.html">Intermilan</a> have announced the signing of Stefano Sensi from Sassuolo on loan with the option of a permanent deal]</b> In all honesty, we sold Sensi to Inter in order to finance the construction of the Mapei Center.</p>

  <p><b>[Sassuolo president’s Giovanni Carnevali had said that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> were set to trigger the clause in the loan deal that brought <a href="kevin-prince-boateng.html">Kevin-Prince Boateng</a> to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> in January allowing a permanent transfer for €8m]</b> I have never said we weren’t expecting him anymore, this interview was done before June 30 <b>[when the loan deal expired]</b> and we still didn’t know about <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s intentions. I just said we still didn’t know if <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> wanted him, if they wanted to give him on loan to another Spanish club or if he was going to be back with us, the point is the interview was published after the 30th. Right now we already know Boateng is back to Sassuolo and together we will see what he wants to do.<br /><br />I think <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> will buy Kevin Prince-Boateng, then he will be loaned to another <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> club</p>

  <p><b>[Sassuolo chairman Giovanni Carnevali is under pressure to sell Boga but is determined to hold onto his star despite mounting interest]</b> Boga has grown a lot, we must give credit to <b>[Sassuolo coach Roberto]</b> De Zerbi who made him grow. He is requested by various clubs but we intend to keep him, we do not want to sell him because we will continue in the project that <b>[owner]</b> Dr Squinzi had in mind. He <b>[Boga]</b> will be a Neroverde also next year</p>
