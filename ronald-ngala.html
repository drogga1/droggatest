  <p><b>[Gor Mahia have completed the signing of goalkeeper Peter Odhiambo from Mathare United on a three year deal]</b> Odhiambo is our player now, he signed a three year contract and we are happy to have acquired his services. He is good, and ready to learn and his addition will definitely improve goalkeeping department. We have closed that chapter in goalkeeping and now we are focusing on other areas as we build for next season.</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Odhiambo completed a three year contract move from Mathare United to Gor Mahia]</b> He is young and ready to learn, he is a talent and we are happy to have secured his services. We do believe he will develop into a finer goalkeeper for us as well as the country. As a club, we brought him in because of his qualities, and it will not be a surprise if he becomes our first choice in the near future.</p>

  <p><b>[Gor Mahia goalkeeper Jerim Onyango has finally retired from active football]</b> For Jerim <b>[Onyango]</b> its clear that he will not be part of the playing unit, we are looking at a role to give him…the role has to be flexible as he will be busy with his campaigns. We are looking at him being the team’s U-18 coach.</p>
