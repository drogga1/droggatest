  <p><b>[The TV market had already collapsed after rights holder Kirch ran into financial difficulties and, in need of money, <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> were forced to sell players. Poor financial management and increasing debt saw the club descend into crisis]</b> We were all deeply worried. As players, we could only do whatever was in our hands and take care of the sporting side. It was important the players stayed, and also took a pay cut. I waived around 20 percent of my salary in the year of the crisis. At that time, all of us players became one unit. That’s how we survived, that’s one of the reasons the club is still here<br /><br /><b>[coach <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Thomas Tuchel</a> was sacked after disagreements with the management and rising star Dembele forced his way to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> by going on strike. During the 2017-18 season, <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> had two coaches, crashed out of Champions League with just two points from six games, and nearly fell at the Champions League hurdle. They got over it, but with scars]</b> We bought of a lot of quality. But with it we lost a bit of identification with the club. We must also look at the mentality of players we sign.<br /><br /><b>[Weidenfeller is set to retire from professional football after <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>’s match at LAFC this Tuesday]</b> There will never be another club, we will always be Borussen … They’ve been there for me for 16 years. It just means the world to me to say goodbye to them. They supported us through thick and thin. I thanked them for their support. The stadium, but most of all the Sudtribune.<br /><br />Those fans have not only literally been behind me in the stadium, but I also know quite a few of them personally, and I can sense the emotions they have for this club. It’s so important to be able to relate to them. There are fences in the stadium. But you can cross them, you can take them down in your mind. I had to go up there and get right into the throng</p>
