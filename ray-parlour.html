  <p><b>[Ray Parlour has challenge Mesut Ozil become more like Arsenal icon Dennis Bergkamp]</b> If Mesut is going to play a part in getting Arsenal back in the top four, then the club should keep him. But he has got to work hard. I played with Dennis Bergkamp and he very rarely had a poor game - you always knew what you would get out of him - and that is what Mesut needs to do, too. The best players are consistent and I want to see that from Mesut. He is a quality player but he goes in and out of games, and it could be argued that he goes missing in the big matches. That is when you need your top men to perform. He should have that in his locker. He has won the World Cup and starred for massive clubs. He just needs to show that desire to play for his team-mates and show more energy.<br /><br /><b>[Parlour added on the challenges facing the Gunners as they prepare for a third successive season without Champions League football]</b> The investment is going to be very important for Arsenal if they want to get back into the top four. Mesut is the one who is on big wages that they might need to free up. It is a massive decision for the club. But players hold all the power these days and not every player wants to leave. If they are on a good contract it is very hard to get a player out and that could be hard for Arsenal if they want to move Mesut on. Arsenal will do the best for Arsenal Football Club, but Ozil has got two years on his contract and if he doesn’t want to go anywhere the club will have to pay him for those two years. That will be the key as to whether he stays or goes</p>

  <p><b>[Ray Parlour says <a href="lucas-torreira.html">Lucas Torreira</a>’s admission of finding life in England difficult has presented Arsenal with another dilemma]</b> The players have got all the power these days, I must admit. I think that sometimes the family doesn’t settle, but we’ll have to see with that situation. He’s a good little player, but he felt the pace towards the end of the season and dropped off a little bit. He had a really good start to his Arsenal career and looked a really lively character, which we’ve been lacking. But again, as a manager and club, you’ll sit down and find out why he’s not enjoying it. Sometimes if they want to go and leave there’s not a lot you can do about it. You want them to stay, but if they’re not happy the performances on the pitch won’t be as good as they should be.</p>

  <p><b>[Ray Parlour says Arsenal need to gamble in the summer transfer market and spend beyond their budget]</b> They are a long way behind Liverpool and Manchester City. Maybe they have to spend a bit more money. You see what Liverpool did - they needed a centre-back and in comes Virgil van Dijk. Nobody mentions how much he cost now. The same with Alisson in goal. It’s all about investment. As much as I hate to say that money is everything, but it’s always gone that way. Sometimes you have to go beyond your budget, absolutely. If you can attract a player and you know he is very keen to go, sometimes you have to push the boat out a little bit further and take the gamble.</p>

  <p><b>[Ray Parlour says Madness if Arsenal sell <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> to Man Utd]</b> It would be madness to let him go, but players have got all the power these days. <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> and <b>[Alexandre]</b> Lacazette have been absolutely brilliant this season. It looks like they’ve got a really good relationship up front, you can see how they celebrate goals. I’d be amazed by that <b>[if he signed for United]</b>, I really would. That would shock me. That wouldn’t be good from an Arsenal supporters’ point of view - we all remember when Robin van Persie left to United and they ended up winning the league the following season.<br /><br />When I go to pre-season, I’m really hoping <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> is on that plane. Goalscorers are so important. Good ones are hard to find and he’s really proven he is a top class goalscorer. You want to be adding to your squad, not trying to get rid of a few players!</p>

  <p><b>[Ray Parlour says Newcastle could prove to be a stepping stone for Patrick Vieira]</b> I’m surprised by the news. I always tipped him to be the Arsenal manager one day. I’d love to see him back at Arsenal, but this could be the stepping stone, who knows. He was a fantastic player, a really intelligent guy. He knew exactly what he brought to the table every game and he never let you down, he could handle the pressure. Not all great players become great managers, but I could always see him going down that road. To take over from Tony Adams as Arsenal skipper, that was a big loss for us because Tony was a big, big player at centre-half, but Patrick did a wonderful job. He was skipper for about eight years and everyone looked up to him.</p>

Reportedly £100m, which is a lot of money. It’s a lot of money to splash out on one player. You might look at other positions needing strengthening as well. Depending on the budget, we’ll have to wait and see. He’s certainly a very good player, real quality.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Arsenal midfielder Ray Parlour has called on the team’s younger players to seize the opportunity presented to them as the Gunners continue their pre-season]</b> It’s so important for these young players to get an opportunity. The older of the younger generation, Reiss Nelson, Joe Willock, will get that opportunity to get into the first team. Saka, who played on the left-wing has been very good. These guys have to put the effort in this pre-season, improve and try and show the manager that we can rely on you to go forward. I came through the ranks. Everybody needs that opportunity to show that you can be as good as you show in the pre-season<br /><br /><b>[Parlour admitted that he believes further reinforcements are needed]</b> I was disappointed with the last season, but you have to move on and be optimistic this season. I’m sure they’re working very hard behind the scenes to get transfers done. I don’t know what sort of positions they want to improve. Probably centre-half, full-back has been mentioned, a winger. Hopefully, when it comes to the end of the window, we’ll have a few more players in. This is a very important time for the team, pre-season. <b>[Emery]</b> would have been as disappointed as anybody last season with the run-in, losing a few games and couldn’t come fourth place. Obviously, the Europa League final, losing that game, you can’t look back. You have to look forward. Hopefully, they can progress and get better next season</p>

  <p><b>[Former Arsenal star Ray Parlour is hoping that Unai Emery’s current Gunners squad will be able to reach the level of Premier League rivals Manchester City and Liverpool]</b> It’s very hard to compare. It really is. It’s different eras. We were very good in our era and obviously Manchester City and Liverpool are very good in this current era. People ask me all the time: ‘Would you beat Man City?’ Who knows? We had a very strong team, a powerful team, but Man City have been a different class. Liverpool showed how good they are. To finish on 97 points, lose one game and not win a title is amazing really. You can’t compare. They’re both excellent teams to watch. I’m just hoping Arsenal can get to that stage again with this current squad</p>

  <p><b>[Ray Parlour believes Arsenal are nowhere near good enough to challenge Manchester City and Liverpool at the top of the Premier League]</b> I heard a few shows yesterday saying we can challenge for the league, but they’re a million miles away from Man City and Liverpool at the moment, if I’m honest. How many Arsenal players would get into the Liverpool team?<br /><br />The most important thing is getting back into the Champions League. Maybe they could push a bit higher, but if they get fourth place this season I’d be delighted. But they are so far behind Manchester City and Liverpool at the moment. They’ve started well with a good away win at Newcastle and they got the job done at the weekend against Burnley, but really, they are two games they were expected to win, so I’m not getting carried away<br /><br /><b>[Arsenal signed several players this summer, including Nicolas Pepe, Kieran Tierney, Dani Ceballos, and David Luiz who could all be considered improvements on to their first team]</b> A lot of fans gave their season tickets back this summer. There were no signings and if you want to get in that top four you need to get players in to give them a chance of competing. At one stage it looked like Arsenal weren’t going to get anybody, it was a bit worrying. In the end it was a decent transfer window for Arsenal and a lot of fans are excited about going into the new season.</p>

I would have taken a draw. I mean, I had <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to win the game - could have gone third. But, they’re still fifth and they’ve still got lots to play for. As I said before at the start of the season; if they come fourth, it’s a great season. Champions League football is the most important thing for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> now going forward. If they come fifth or sixth this year it has been a failure again. Because they went into the transfer market and I think everyone was quite excited about the signings. So I think it is going to be interesting to see what happens going forward<br /><br />No, it’s not better (than when <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> was in charge), but it is a real opportunity. After we started really well during the start of the season, people were going ‘Oh we can challenge for the title’ and I said no chance! I said that on here - no chance whatsoever. If they come fourth in the league, it’s been a very good season. They’re fifth at the moment and still have every chance of coming fourth so it was a poor result the other day. But the other teams are struggling as well around them that might give them an opportunity to get fourth place, which would be a great season for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>.</p>

At the moment he’s the one who could score you a goal though, he’s an instinct player, brilliant player for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> he’s been. The goal record he’s got is unbelievable, but you can’t keep unhappy players.

He does make a mistake, and we’ve seen that this season, but I think he’s done well. I think, if you’re really struggling in midfield, you could play Luiz as a holding midfielder. He can play there because he’s got that range of passing and he’s very good on the ball, he is technically very good.

  <p><b>[Ray Parlour on how <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Dennis Bergkamp</a> winding up <a href="martin-keown.html">Martin Keown</a> led to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> signing flop Igors Stepanovs]</b> Arsene was so clever at identifying great players to come in, but there were one or two gambles that didn’t quite come off.<br /><br />In the summer of 2000 a player turned up on trial at our pre-season tour. He was a tall centre-half. Now, <a href="martin-keown.html">Martin Keown</a> was always worried about people coming in to steal his position. If we had a centre-half on trial, Martin would say he was useless. This big guy from Latvia, Igors Stepanovs, turned up. He was a unit, but seriously, he was not up to standard.<br /><br /><b>[He actually had one of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s best-ever win ratios. Anyway, on with the story!]</b> A few of us were on the bench watching as he played in this trial game. Stepanovs is out there and every single pass he made, the boys started applauding, just because we knew Martin would be getting a bit steamed up by it. <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Dennis Bergkamp</a> was sitting behind Arsene and kept doling out these compliments about this defender - ‘Great header! Unbelievable tackle!’. Igors kicked this one ball 20 yards away from where it was meant to go but it still went to one of our players so we all stood up clapping.<br /><br />Martin’s muttering: ‘He’s not that good.’ He started to point out where he missed a tackle or a header.<br /><br />That night we went for dinner and laughed about it as we were only trying to wind Martin up. We all knew Igors was nowhere near the standards set by <a href="tony-adams.html">Tony Adams</a>, Martin and Bouldy.<br /><br />But Martin is such an easy target because he bites. Once someone bites it’s too tempting. Dennis seldom missed a trick because Martin would kick him every day in training. He always came out with a blinder to explain it to Dennis: ‘I’m just getting you ready for what you are going to face in the match.’<br /><br />Martin was a great player, a great character, a great winner. I think we all cared so deeply. When we got back to the training ground at London Colney a week later we had a surprise though. Igors was sitting there.<br /><br />I said: ‘What are you doing here?’ ‘They signed me,’ he said. ‘Four-year contract.’<br /><br />Arsene didn’t know we were just trying to tease Martin. He just kept listening to us heaping praise on this player. And if <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Dennis Bergkamp</a> stands up and says: ‘What a player’, Arsene would be entitled to take a bit of notice. I suppose it looked like a bargain at around £1m.<br /><br />No disrespect to anyone from the lower leagues but Igors was a yard behind us on the pitch, it was like taking my brother to training.<br /><br />The next thing we know we’ve got the biggest injury crisis we’ve ever had at centre-half. And the only fit centre-half we’ve got is Igors and who are we playing at the weekend? Man United at Old Trafford.<br /><br />Going into the game our back four looked a bit dicey really. Oleg Luzhny, Gilles Grimandi, Igors and <a href="ashley-cole.html">Ashley Cole</a>, who had to go off at half-time.<br /><br /><a href="dwight-yorke.html">Dwight Yorke</a> ran us ragged. Seriously, it was humiliating. They scored the first goal and we managed to equalise. We thought: ‘OK, we’ll take that’. And then all of a sudden the goals started pouring in and we were 5-1 down by half-time<br /><br />There is a massive walk to the tunnel at Old Trafford and you could see Arsene was fuming. He hardly every swore or shouted but he did that day. I remember doing the long walk to the tunnel alongside <a href="dwight-yorke.html">Dwight Yorke</a> and he asked: ‘Where the hell did you get that centre-half from?’ ‘Look,’ I said. ‘It’s a long story … ‘. We sat down in the dressing room and it could’ve been 9-1 as <a href="david-seaman.html">David Seaman</a> actually had a blinder in goal.<br /><br />Arsene started letting off and he’s not a swearer, it just doesn’t suit him, and I’m really desperate to laugh. I’m making no eye contact and I could see Pat Rice in my peripheral vision sending me a look that said: ‘Don’t laugh. Whatever you do. Do. Not. Laugh<br /><br />Arsene was going mad. And that was the only time, in the eight years I played under him, he went crazy at half-time. He was always focused on being calm, recovering and keeping concentrated on what we needed to do. We lost 6-1 and poor Igors barely played again</p>

You see Werner go for £55m, but people forget he’s got his wages on top of that. If he’s on £200,000 a week, that’s another £10m a year so you have to weigh the whole situation up<br /><br />And you never know whether who you buy in to replace him is going to hit the ground running and if they can handle <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. So in an ideal world, he signs a new three or four-year contract. But <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> might be thinking I’ve got three or four years left at the top level, I want to play Champions League football now and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> can’t guarantee him that at the moment. And players usually get their own way in this era I’m afraid. If a player wants to go, he usually leaves. But I’m hoping they come to an agreement and he stays</p>
