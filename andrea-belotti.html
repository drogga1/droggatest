  <p><b>[Andrea Belotti will only leave Torino if his €100m release clause is met]</b> I have to continue like this, I cannot let it go to my head. I always have to work, I hope to play a good 2017 to conquer my dreams. The Premier League? I do not think about it, I just think of Torino and doing well here, then we will see.</p>

  <p><b>[Torino forward Andrea Belotti has admitted he does not think he is worth the €100 million asking price his club have set for him]</b> I honestly do not feel that I am worth so much. In football, however, the figures have increased dramatically, and the values of the players have gone through the roof.<br /><br />It ‘s hard duel with striker Edin Dzeko and Mauro Icardi, they both can score two or three goals per game. We need to stay focused and take every opportunity because nobody gives away anything</p>

  <p><b>[On his valuation]</b> I never stopped to think about the weight of that €100m tag, because I always thought I should prove my worth on the pitch and those performances would ultimately set my value. In today’s world you hear about excessive transfer fees. Clubs pay €70m-€80m or even €100m for a single player.</p>

  <p><b>[Andrea Belotti has warned any clubs that may be interested in signing him that he’ll only leave Torino if he’s a guaranteed starter]</b> Many people tell me that I should leave Turin and go to a great team. But I’ll only leave Il Toro and go to a big team if there is the possibility to be a starter, I do not want to be on the bench. Now I feel good after having overcome two injuries that have affected my season, there are still lots of games and I want to help Torino.<br /><br />We want to prove that we are still a great team, but it takes time and hard work. We are trying to start now. <b>[interim manager Luigi]</b> Di Biagio has been with us for a week<br /><br /><b>[On Gian Piero Ventura]</b> I do not speak with him anymore. The match against Sweden has hurt us</p>

  <p><b>[Handed a start in Italy’s most recent Euro 2020 qualifier against Liechtenstein, the <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a> attacker bagged a double in a 5-0 win to stake his claim for more starts up front for <a href="roberto-mancini.html">Roberto Mancini</a>’s side]</b> Liechtenstein brings me luck, especially playing here, as I got a brace here last time too. You can see there’s an Italy side with more conviction, more desire to do what the coach says and follow the very clear ideas we considered from the start to be wise. You can see we’re doing some wonderful things on the field, especially compared to the ugliness of two years ago</p>
