  <p><b>[Man City lining up new long-term deal for Bernardo Silva]</b> The final stages are concluding for a lot of new contracts with positive news expected soon. We are convinced he is the heir to his midfield namesake <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a>. He’s probably been our best player this season. He has stepped comfortably into the huge void left by Kevin De Bruyne, who has struggled with injury. Bernardo absolutely loves being at City and all the people connected with it, this is one big happy family for him. He has seen some of the other guys pledging their futures and is ready to do the same. Playing for Pep is a dream for him.</p>

  <p><b>[CAS confirms <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> appeal against <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s Champions League bans]</b> The appeal is directed against the decision of the Adjudicatory Chamber of the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) dated 14 February 2020 in which <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> was deemed to have contravened <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play Regulations and sanctioned with exclusion from the next two seasons of <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> club competitions for which the club would qualify and ordered to pay a fine of EUR 30 million.<br /><br />Generally speaking, CAS appeal arbitration procedures involve an exchange of written submissions between the parties while a Panel of CAS arbitrators is being convened. Once the Panel has been formally constituted it issues procedural directions, including, inter alia, with respect to the holding of a hearing. Following the hearing, the Panel deliberates and then issues its decision in the form of an Arbitral Award.<br /><br />It is not possible to indicate at this time when a final award in this matter will be issued</p>
