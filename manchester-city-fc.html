  <p><b>[Kompany set to miss Gladbach clash]</b> Fabian Delph returned to training ahead of City’s trip to Monchengladbach, but Vincent Kompany looks set to miss out. The Man City skipper was forced off against Crystal Palace on Saturday after suffering from blurred vision and won’t be risked in Germany.<br /><br />Delph hasn’t featured for the first team since the end of August when he was an unused sub against West Ham. He required surgery on a troublesome groin problem and his return will give Pep Guardiola another midfield option.</p>

  <p><b>[FA announced it had charged Manchester City with a violation of its anti-doping regulations]</b> The failure of Manchester City to update their information may seem like a simple administrative mistake, but the FA are likely to take this matter seriously. While there has been no suggestion that Manchester City or any of the players have tried to conceal the taking of illicit substances, the whereabout programme underpins the FA’s anti-doping efforts. Any breach of these regulations, regardless of how minor it may appear, undermines the effectiveness of the regime, and the FA have acted swiftly to counter this.<br /><br />The FA has wide-ranging powers when it comes to punishment, from a reprimand or fine all the way up to a points deduction or even expulsion from the organisation itself. Given that this is the first time that Manchester City have been charged with this type of offence, as well as the administrative nature of the misconduct, a fine appears the most likely punishment.</p>

  <p><b>[Man City fan group hits out at ticket price rise just weeks after Guardiola’s atmosphere plea]</b> Before the takeover, if our ground was a 47,000 sell out then every seat would be taken on a match day. You wonder if the fans dropping away are being replaced by people who just want the status of having a season ticket and they are simply picking and choosing which games to attend.<br /><br />We have Pep asking people in the club what they can do about the atmosphere. But our message is you can’t have it both ways. You either make it all about the money, or you try to ensure we have a partisan atmosphere at home games. That could mean the difference between finishing fourth and first and the club make even more through prize money than they ever would from stealth rises<br /><br />The price freeze for the £299 tickets applies to a handful of seats, so that’s a PR stunt because so few people actually benefit from it. If they can freeze some prices surely they can freeze all. Stealth rises are still rises and we know there will be many fans who decide it’s one rise too many and will jack it in. Of course there are some fans who feel the rises are acceptable and others will renew even though they have told us they feel a price freeze would have been fair.<br /><br />Every year it goes more and more corporate at our place. The rising prices cannot be justified given the TV deals and the silly amount of money that is now in the game at the top level. The benefits of that are not being passed down to the fans</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City have been fined £300,000 and banned from signing academy players for two years after being found guilty of tapping up two young footballers]</b> The Premier League has sanctioned Manchester City FC for breaches of its Youth Development Rules. The breaches concern approaches to two separate Academy players whilst they were each registered with another club.<br /><br />Following an investigation, the Premier League found evidence that the club’s conduct prior to applying to register the players contravened League rules. This included evidence of contact between the club and members of each academy player’s family while those academy players were still registered with their previous clubs<br /><br />Manchester City will pay a fine of £300,000 and will be prohibited from registering any academy players in the under-10 to under-18 age range who have been registered with a Premier League or EFL club in the preceding 18 months. This ban will last for two years. The period of this ban from 30 June 2018 onwards will be suspended for three years to be activated in the event of any similar breach by the club<br /><br />In each case, the academy player was conditionally registered with Manchester City while the Premier League’s investigation was ongoing. As a result of the club’s breaches, the players’ registrations will be terminated on a specified date, with no compensation rights retained by the club, and the club will not be permitted to re-register them as academy players. In addition, Manchester City has offered to pay compensation to each player’s previous club, and maintain educational provision for each player until the completion of his GCSEs</p>

Dark maroon was present on the shirt worn by the 1956 FA Cup winning team, while it is also included on the detailing of this year’s home kit, as a nod to the design worn by the league title winning side of 1967/68. There’s also room for the colour synonymous with Manchester City, with a sky-blue trim on the shirt and socks. If the design pays reference to the past, then Nike’s Aeroswift technology most certainly gives the kit a truly modern feel.<br /><br />As the most advanced apparel innovation to date, the Aeroswift kit has engineered knit zones on the shirt, which enhance fit when playing. The sides of the kit feature a black stripe with blue underlay that runs the length of the shirt and blue shorts, expanding when in motion to maximise ventilation. Finally, the City blue-trimmed socks incorporate NikeGrip technology for the ultimate foot-to-boot connection</p>

  <p><b>[Man City fire back at UEFA over Financial Fair Play case]</b> Manchester City Football Club is disappointed, but regrettably not surprised, by the sudden announcement of the referral to be made by the CFCB IC Chief Investigator Yves Leterme. The leaks to media over the last week are indicative of the process that has been overseen by Mr. Leterme. Manchester City is entirely confident of a positive outcome when the matter is considered by an independent judicial body.<br /><br />The accusation of financial irregularities remains entirely false and the CFCB IC referral ignores a comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence provided by Manchester City FC to the Chamber. The decision contains mistakes, misinterpretations and confusions fundamentally borne out of a basic lack of due process and there remain significant unresolved matters raised by Manchester City FC as part of what the Club has found to be a wholly unsatisfactory, curtailed, and hostile process.</p>

Once the Panel has been formally constituted it issues procedural directions, including, inter alia, with respect to the holding of a hearing. Following the hearing, the Panel deliberates and then issues its decision in the form of an Arbitral Award.<br /><br />It is not possible to indicate at this time when a final award in this matter will be issued</p>
