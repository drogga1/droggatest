This is one of the reasons why <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are struggling at the moment. He was a difference-maker for them. Yes, they have Kane and Son, but <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> with his free-kicks, maybe you saw his assist against Switzerland - he is on the sideline, looks one way but sees <a href="yussuf-poulsen.html">Poulsen</a> on the other side and plays a perfect no-look pass. He has incredible quality. And <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> can use this quality any time</p>

  <p><b>[Steffen Freund comments <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a>’s impressive efforts so far]</b> He already looks like the new wonder boy <b>[of the club]</b>. If he only plays for a few minutes <b>[per match]</b> and continues to cause such a sensation, then he’ll break the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> when he gets around to starting</p>

  <p><b>[Steffen Freund suggests <a href="kai-havertz.html">Kai Havertz</a> should remain with Bayer Leverkusen for another 12 months]</b> I know it’s a lot about money, but I would advise him to stay at Bayer Leverkusen for another season. Bayer Leverkusen is under no pressure because it is a long-term contract. I also know that <a href="rudi-voller.html">Rudi Voller</a> recommends that to him. But then comes the pressure with consultants, large clubs that can also win titles, which is relatively rare with Leverkusen. Then it is just too good at some point <b>[to stay at]</b> Leverkusen. But why not another year?</p>

  <p><b>[Steffen Freund warns <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> clubs risk collapse unless football resumes]</b> Overall the German football <b>[league]</b> - the <a href="dfl.html">DFL</a> - is the best at the moment so far in Europe. Because we are ready to start on May 9 if the politicians <b>[approve]</b>. Of course, the Germans are ready and they would like to see the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> again<br /><br />Of course, with the coronavirus you have a few problems and one problem is of course to test most of the players before and after the games. But if you don’t start in the next two or three months, a lot of the teams from the first and second <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> are bankrupt and then we have not enough teams to play the next season. So overall I’m really positive. If it’s not May 9, Germany will start I think at the latest at the end of May, the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> of course with ‘ghost games’ and without supporters<br /><br />If, for example, one team, or five or six players, pick up the virus, that is I think the biggest question they have to answer. What happens then? Because I think normally the whole team has to go in quarantine and you can’t play and you can’t finish the league. if you play and then you pick up the coronavirus - if, for example, <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> <b>[have]</b> five players <b>[with coronavirus]</b>, then what are you doing then? I understand the situation in Spain and Italy is even worse and people are dying, no question. But if in three months you have 10 teams in the first and second league in Spain bankrupt - in England the same, in Italy the same, in Germany the same - then it’s difficult to start a new season anyway</p>

  <p><b>[Steffen Freund says <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> isn’t <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> or <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> &amp; should stay put]</b> <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> is not like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> or <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, that will take one or two years more. For <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a>, it is only at the start for him, there could be a way in maybe three or four years for him to be top class in Europe. I am not sure if <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> and <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> can catch <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> or <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. They have for years now been the best two players playing at the highest level every season. <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> now has only had nine games in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, and <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> is in his second season at the highest level. If he can do it again, then maybe the top teams will be in for him. It takes a little bit of time to play against the best teams of the highest level. They have already had a few ups and downs, he played well against <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> at home, but he didn’t create any chances in Paris. So overall we don’t give them time. As a former player and coach, I would love to see <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> and <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> play for another season in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. Can you imagine if they perform and develop even more next season, then <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> can win the league</p>

  <p><b>[Steffen Freund says <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> ‘ready to play for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or Man Utd’ but warns he risks being another Jovic]</b> Jadon is ready to play for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or Man United, no question, because his stats are unbelievable. That shows that he can take the next step. In the <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> side with <b>[Erling]</b> <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a>, <b>[Julian]</b> <a href="julian-brandt.html">Brandt</a> improving, with <a href="emre-can.html">Emre Can</a> signing, with changing to a back three that suits <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a>. It would be good for him to play for <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> now and next year so that he will have more match time. He’s only 20, so why not play for <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>? We’re not talking about Freiburg or Paderborn, we’re talking about <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>, one of the top 20 clubs in Europe. Remember <a href="luka-jovic.html">Jovic</a>, who moved to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> from Eintracht Frankfurt, he’s not playing. If you have an offer from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> you think, ‘I have to go’. No, you don’t have to go because the salaries in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> are on a good level, too, not as much as <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> or <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, though. But you can earn good money and improve and not make too much of a big step at once. So for Jadon to move to Man United with that pressure, they are struggling to qualify for the Champions League, so maybe it’s better to stay another year in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>.<br /><br />If the offer comes in and the people from <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> think it’s right then they will sell him. With the coronavirus, if something goes wrong in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and we can’t see football until the end the year, then it’s not the right moment to talk about players, they cost so much money. I think the price will drop anyway. All the clubs in Germany are losing a lot of money. It’s not the same without money from tickets and sponsors and so it’ll be difficult to keep your best players</p>
