  <p><b>[Gilberto’s job is to use his skill set to put Panathinaikos back in the big time again]</b> It is a real challenge being a sports director. It’s the first time I’m in this job and you have to understand how everything works very quickly. I came to the club at the end of last season and didn’t know much about the previous campaign and gave the best support I could to find the right players and balance in the team. There are a lot of challenges in the club and you have to slowly overcome them but I’m enjoying it so far.<br /><br /><b>[He admits he briefly spoke to <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> and his former sidekick <a href="david-dein.html">David Dein</a> after taking up the role, seeking words of wisdom from the ex-Arsenal vice-chairman]</b> We spoke about some things and I spoke many times with <a href="david-dein.html">David Dein</a>. We’re very close friends and I hope he will come to see one of our games soon. I spoke to other friends I have in the job and then you start to bring some new ideas to the club from what I’ve experienced as a player - and things I’ve missed as a player and to fill up this gap inside the club<br /><br /><b>[Gilberto says the sporting director role brings about its own unique challenges, and while he hasn’t ruled out becoming a coach or returning to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">the Gunners</a> in the future, he says his experiences as a player have helped him settle into his new job]</b> At the moment I didn’t have the feeling to be a coach. If you want to be a coach you must have this feeling and must live for it. You have to understand that sporting director is a full time job and the pressure is totally different and in some places being a coach is not easy - many coaches have been sacked very easily all over the world. At some point I will do my badges but that’s because I want to understand better what is behind the face of the coach, what he has to learn to become a successful one. You never know <b>[about returning to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b>. Everyone knows <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is the club from the deepest point of my heart that I have a great love and appreciation for. The most important part now is not to focus on that and focus on doing my job in the right way, to help them achieve their goals. If the team achieve their goals it means that everyone has done a good job<br /><br />Everyday when I wake up I think what can I improve at the club, what can I do to improve myself and what can I do to give the club better service? This is my own challenge everyday. Sometimes it is a lonely job. Sometimes you don’t have anyone to share your frustrations with. Sometimes you don’t have people thinking the same way as you but you have to encourage people to work as you want according to their abilities and try to help them improve for the club<br /><br />I believe <b>[being a footballer]</b> can help a lot, especially when you approach a player, because I was on the other side before. You understand the mentality of the player not to be too shy and too hard - to find a good way of approaching them. Even though they are young players, old player, big players - everyone is a human being and behind the footballer there is a human being<br /><br /><b>[Working alongside <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>, who recently marked 20 years as <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> manager, was evidently a career highlight for Gilberto and the manner in which he speaks and conveys his ideas bares similarities to that of the Frenchman]</b> He was really important because when I arrived at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> I came as a man. I was 25 at the time and the good thing for him was that he didn’t have so much to work with me. It was my first club in Europe and <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is not so easy for any foreign player. It’s maybe a bit harder for a Brazilian player because we came from good weather, nice life and different coaching and you have to adapt to the way of playing which is difficult<br /><br />The hardest thing for me was the communication as I could not speak English at the time. I had to work hard to learn the language and it was one of the gifts of playing in England, apart from football, of course. I would not have been satisfied when I left England if I had not mastered English even though I had success in football<br /><br />It was important when he told me the way he wanted me to play. In Brazil we got the ball, played at the side and the back - it wasn’t aggressive going forwards. He spoke to me about it and I understood very well and this is the reason why I played regularly<br /><br />Coquelin had very good moments last year. I heard comparisons to me which I’m happy about because it means people understood my role and the job I was doing. Maybe they didn’t understand at first because at the beginning they expected a Brazilian player to score the goals!<br /><br />I think the hardest thing for some of those young players who came after me was that they didn’t have anyone older than them to learn things from, as I had with <a href="ray-parlour.html">Ray Parlour</a>, <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a> and Edu<br /><br />They were there before me and worked with the coach for a long time. It was important to have those guys in front of me to see how they approach the game and learn from them. For some of the young players after me when things started changing, renovating the team, it was quite hard. Maybe the ones who took their opportunity were <a href="cesc-fabregas.html">Cesc Fabregas</a> and <a href="mathieu-flamini.html">Mathieu Flamini</a> because myself and Patrick left, then they started to play with each other<br /><br />This <b>[2007-08]</b> was the season where I took a different role in the team because I had the captain’s armband as <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry</a> was injured. Everything worked well for me because I not only did my job as a defensive midfielder but I could help going forwards, scoring goals<br /><br />The hardest thing was the season after when I was dropped to the bench which was my last season for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. It was hard for me because I was making headlines as a defensive midfielder and delivering upfront without losing focus on my main role and after I came back late from the Copa America it was hard for me to watch the games from the bench<br /><br />It was not easy for me to understand, I spoke to Arsene about it and it was disappointing for me. It was hard when I saw that it would not change and I made my mind to leave which was really hard for me. I had an opportunity to move to England but it would have been hard to play against Arsenal<br /><br /><b>[Gilberto’s backstory is a fascinating one. He grew up in a poor family and took jobs at a young age which included working on a coffee plantation and as an upholsterer]</b> There are many people like me who had the same kind of upbringing. I grew up in a very small village and I would never myself have an opportunity at a football club, a trial or whatever. When I got my chance I wanted to do the best I could. I had frustrations at the beginning, then I went back to work again to help my family<br /><br />I believe that what I had to do before football was important for me. It’s easy to get lost when you achieve your goals in football. I never lost the plot because I understood how the hard the life can be outside of football. For somebody who wants to succeed in football he has to understand that the footballers life is not so easy if you want to achieve great things. You have to work hard instead of complaining all time. To work hard, to be responsible and transfer it to football - for me it worked pretty well.<br /><br />I worked in a construction company which was hard work. I’ve worked since I was 11 because I wanted to have my own money and didn’t want to ask my father. Not because I was obliged to do it. At 11 years old I worked on a farm on a coffee plantation for a week. This was the first job I got paid for a week. When I was 12 I worked as an upholsterer, then a construction company, then I had a period at my first club. After five months I come back to work at sweet factory to help my family. I always understood my responsibility during each moment and it was a great lesson that I keep with me through life.</p>

  <p><b>[Gilberto Silva said <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> star <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> has a lot of room to grow after being handed the Brazil captaincy]</b> I believe they want to protect <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> more because of the criticism he received at the World Cup. And also to remind him that he has a greater responsibility towards the team, for what he represents and in the football world. The captaincy is for him to understand responsibility as something positive, as a personal growth. It’s important to keep his focus and to put the criticism aside. He still has a lot to do in terms of growing.</p>

The players have to give their answer on the pitch, and as long as they do they’ll look to be stronger game-by-game. They’ve started positively. Of course, the first two games were quite hard because they played <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and City, who are two contenders for the title. But you also must observe that this was the beginning of the new manager there <b>[at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b>. You must give Emery the time to find the right players, the balance, the shape of the team, and start from there.<br /><br />Since then the players have been understanding the way he wants them to play. The last game was nice (Arsenal beat <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> 3-1), one of the goals they built up from the back and it was amazing - this is how everyone who loves <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> wants them to play, and I hope they keep the shape. We’ll have to wait. Obviously, the best season for any big club is winning the title at the end, but they must understand that’s not going to be easy. I’m sure they know - they’ve played a few games but still have a lot more before the end of the season</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> Invincible Gilberto Silva tells <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> ‘we are still there as No.1’ as Reds’ unbeaten]</b> <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> came very close to the unbeaten record we hold with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I have always said that one day it may happen and the way they have been playing, I was expecting them to do it. For most people, it was unexpected that they would lose at <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> but we are still there as No. 1, and this is a very special achievement.<br /><br />I was only talking about <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s Invincibles season last week over lunch with <a href="jens-lehmann.html">Jens Lehmann</a>, our goalkeeper, and <a href="david-dein.html">David Dein</a>, who was vice-chairman. It is impossible not to talk about it. Every conversation I have with team-mates from that time is special.<br /><br />Jens and I spoke about the training sessions, the approach of everyone, when someone was maybe not in the right mood for training we pushed each other. Jens talked to everyone. If someone was not 100 per cent, he would ask why not and ask for more. He was never afraid to say things but in a positive way.<br /><br />Compared to some games, our training sessions were even harder. Everyone trained to their limit, nobody at 80 or 90 per cent. Sometimes <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>, our manager, had to calm us down. I had the feeling many times in the tunnel, the way some opponents looked at us, I knew straight away that we were going to win this game<br /><br />We won the league with four games to go.

Arsene said that we could become a special team, not only winners but a team everyone would know went unbeaten.<br /><br />I left <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> more than ten years ago. We won this in 2004. It’s such a long time and after the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> game, ‘Arsenal the Invincibles’ came into people’s minds.

It’s hard to say it’s about leadership because from what I understand they do have some guys who are leaders. But it is hard to see exactly how this leadership works out. It’s very hard to see the situation <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are in and you can say that about the last few years. But I hope they can find a way to get back to the glory days. It’s going to be very hard work for everyone at the club - the board, the staff and the players - and they all must work together if they are to change the situation.</p>
