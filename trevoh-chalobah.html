<a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield Town</a> are among the Championship clubs keen on signing Trevoh Chalobah and they want to secure him on a permanent deal from Chelsea.</p>

<p>: 2019 07 25
New Chelsea manager <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> is facing a dilemma over the number of non-homegrown players in his squad as the new season closes in at Stamford Bridge. UEFA rules state clubs in the Champions League may register no more than 17 foreign players in their squads for the competition, with a further eight spots available for homegrown players. <a href="kenneth-omeruo.html">Kenneth Omeruo</a>, Baba Rahman, Michael Hector and Trevoh Chalobah, meanwhile, are expected to leave either permanently or on loan before the end of the transfer window</p>

  <p><b>[Trevoh Chalobah says If you’re good enough, then you’re old enough at Chelsea]</b> I’ve been really happy for them. I keep in contact with them almost every day as well - Reece, Mason, Fikayo, Tammy, all of them. I’m just happy for them because it shows the hard work they’ve put in and going out on loan for a few years has paid off. They’ve done so well and it just shows that it doesn’t matter about your age because if you’re good enough, then you’re old enough. That’s what Frank has brought, giving the young players confidence for them to go out there and show people that they are capable of doing what they can do now, and you can see that in their performances. All it needed was patience. There’s a lot of good players that have come through that maybe didn’t get those opportunities but these boys now have taken their chance and worked hard. It all comes from growing up in the academy really - they’ve produced a lot of good players, the coaches and facilities have helped us, going on loan has helped us and now it makes me happy to see them so involved. If I do well myself, then hopefully next season I can join those boys I’ve grown up with as well<br /><br /><b>[Chalobah junior is hoping to become a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> regular himself one day]</b> Playing in midfield last season was a new position for me but now I’ve settled well in that position. Of course, I’m still learning as well and I still need to develop more and get better. I’ve been playing in the number eight role as well as the number six so it’s been good to learn both positions</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea youngster Trevoh Chalobah is hoping he can be the next young player to make a big impact on <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>’s thoughts with regards the first team]</b> For me, I wouldn’t see it as pressure but just confidence and hope to see the guys you have played with most of your life doing well. As long as you believe in yourself then you will feel it’s possible. I think those boys have shown that going on loan is beneficial for the players. To go out and get game time and experience, that’s the main thing. Those boys have come in and done well and proved people wrong that they are good enough. It just shows that the loan system does work and if you do well then you can have the achievements they have had. I speak to them almost every day, so it’s really good. I have been watching most of their games, seen them scoring and I’m happy for them.<br /><br /><b>[He was awarded a new contract with the club last summer]</b> It was good to get a new deal and get rewarded for what I had done well last year. This year is the same, really, just focusing on <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a>, doing my best for the team and then just seeing what happens next season</p>
