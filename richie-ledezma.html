  <p><b>[Richie Ledezma, himself, meanwhile, has acknowledged the move to Eindhoven was a bit of a culture shock]</b> The club have helped me find a home and they help me with my nutrition, my food, how I eat. Because I was a little chubby when I got here, I guess. They all called me fatty and stuff, so I was like … cool … you know? It is really different from the US. The quantity of food you eat… I think it is a cultural thing, no more McDonalds!</p>

  <p><b>[Richie Ledezma has seen an option in his contract triggered by Dutch side <a href="psv.html">PSV</a>]</b> It’s a good feeling. It’s obviously a good sign because they trust me, they believe in me. I just have to keep working to make things happen over there. I’ve been playing with Jong consistently, starting, so it’s been good getting pro games in. I went to Qatar with the first team and it was a good experience. It got my confidence up so much higher. When I take chances in the game, it’s a different feeling now<br /><br />I’ve been saying this since day one in 2018: the first team. I want my <b>[first team]</b> debut and to play consistently for them. If I can’t do that, I’ll play for Jong, help them out and give everything. I feel like I’m really close, training with them, I’m okay with that, but I’m just waiting for my chance and to take it. I’m ready for anything<br /><br />I feel like my chances are coming and I’m taking those chances. I just have to keep working and I feel really good about myself right now. As a person, so much is coming. I’m talking to people now, even outside of the field, and on the field especially. Everyone is so nice around me and I feel like I’ve gotten out of my shell already. It’s fun so far</p>
