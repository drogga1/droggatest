  <p><b>[Javier Lago on <a href="thiago-alcantara.html">Thiago Alcantara</a>’s misfortune]</b> I think <a href="thiago-alcantara.html">Thiago Alcantara</a> has always thought of himself as a pivote, a <b>[Sergio]</b> <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Busquets</a>, always wanting to be on the ball 200 times a game instead of 80, constantly prompting, constantly offering. The great misfortune for him is that <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Sergio Busquets</a> was always in his way at Barca<br /><br /><b>[The security of having a player positioned behind him, such as Alonso, Martinez or - on occasion under <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> - <a href="philipp-lahm.html">Philipp Lahm</a>, means he can attempt to provide his team with a solution without the fear of the consequences of it not coming off]</b> That’s his best position I’d say. It means that rather than him having to systematically make the right decision and not only making it but also getting it right, he can take those risks knowing there will be someone behind him to cover if it doesn’t come off<br /><br /><b>[Thiago <a href="thiago-alcantara.html">Alcantara</a> had completed more passes in his opponents’ final third than any other <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> player in 2016/17]</b> He has that class to unpick locks further up the pitch. I have always thought he has dramatically more goals in him. He could have been double the transfer value and had double the appreciation if he had been a number 10</p>

  <p><b>[Thomas Partey: Is <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> midfielder on the verge of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> move?]</b> Nobody knows how much clubs are going to lose financially in the current climate. Atleti will have received a tremendous amount of money from a quite brilliant Champions League campaign but that has been curtailed. They would have expected to be playing in a Champions League semi-final match, and they’d have been paid more money by <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>. I believe they’re close to €70m ahead financially because of their participation and success in the Champions League this season due to the new funding structure which is so extraordinary. But their debt probably does mean a few clubs are going to be more fortunate going to Atleti and asking about some of their players than they would have been in other situations<br /><br /><b>[<a href="thomas-partey.html">Partey</a> played in a deeper role to allow Llorente the freedom to join the attack, but Hunter believes his natural defensive qualities would soften the blow if Atletico were to sell their chief destroyer]</b> From Atleti’s side, although <a href="thomas-partey.html">Partey</a> has been for a long time a significantly important player, there is some degree of manoeuvrability because Marcos Llorente could come in. <a href="thomas-partey.html">Partey</a> is much happier sitting in an area, controlling the flow of games, blocking and building attacks again<br /><br />Llorente is not an identical footballer - he’s much more athletic and more prone to interceding in situations and he obviously scored crucial goals at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. He is a player who stood out for Alaves on loan from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and genuinely looked a top-class footballer there<br /><br />When he went back to Real, I don’t think anyone is sure why, in football terms, he and <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> didn’t hit it off. Now, he’s at Atleti going into his second season there and he is someone like <a href="thomas-partey.html">Partey</a> who’s really learned from working under Diego Simeone<br /><br /><a href="thomas-partey.html">Partey</a>’s development under <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a> has been huge, and with Llorente there, Atletico need to consider whether they can afford to let their Ghanaian international go and gain financially from a deal to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. Without Llorente at the club, losing <a href="thomas-partey.html">Partey</a> would be significantly more testing for Atleti than it is right now<br /><br /><a href="thomas-partey.html">Partey</a> speaks decent English, so that wouldn’t be an obstacle from him were he to go to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. He’s still at an age where the pace and the physicality of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> wouldn’t be beyond him. He’s not the quickest, but he’s an athlete that keeps going<br /><br />I don’t imagine for a second that he grew up idolising <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a>, but because of the amount of English football that’s shown in Ghana, and because of the role that <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> played as a midfielder in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, I’m sure <a href="thomas-partey.html">Partey</a> will feel he would be working for a coach who would be able to educate him still further in the arts of organising the centre of midfield<br /><br /><b>[Hunter believes there will be a ‘downsizing of overall outlay’, <a href="thomas-partey.html">Partey</a>’s reported £45m release clause makes him good value for money]</b> Certainly, the transfer market will be determined by the impact the global shutdown has had and teams will have to tailor their expenditure in a different way given that for a long period they will have had less revenue<br /><br />Clubs will be sensitive to the fact there’s been a really grave impact on all our populations, but I think that football will continue respectfully. The difference in what clubs are going to want to spend on players will be governed by their own internal book-keeping, and I think there will be a downsizing of overall outlay<br /><br />A lot of clubs won’t be able to buy at margins that they previously thought were acceptable, just because they won’t have the capacity that they expected to have. <a href="thomas-partey.html">Partey</a> still represents very good value given his buyout clause, something which is very normal in Spain. It’s too low and Atletico were in discussions about extending his contract and increasing his buyout before the lockdown.<br /><br />This would have been beneficial for him and for the club and detrimental for a club like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. He’s an extremely valuable and popular player for Atleti, having also played at centre-back and right-back under Simeone<br /><br />In one game earlier this season, <a href="thomas-partey.html">Partey</a> was used as a second striker when <a href="diego-simeone.html">Cholo</a> <b>[<a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a>]</b> was looking for a goal - a goal he would then help produce. He’s a footballer who primarily plays in a similar position as <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> and <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a> did, but he has flexibility that adds to his value when it comes to weighing up what should be spent on him<br /><br />Right now, Atletico need the stability of a cash injection, and I think that would be more attractive on balance, but the current team’s primary flaw at the moment is a lack of goals. It’s something that has actually dogged them for some time: they’ve scored 43 goals in 33 league games - just over a goal a game<br /><br />They still defend well, perhaps not quite as miserly as they used to, but <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> have scored nearly double Atleti’s goals (74) while <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> (60) have got 17 more, so these are really significant numbers if you want to be challenging to win trophies and to be in the top four of La Liga<br /><br />Atleti are currently outside of the top four only by a point, but to not get into the Champions League next season would be very debilitating for the club financially. There is a need for goals, and whether <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Lacazette</a> has all the requisites and specifically has the right age profile is questionable<br /><br />If you look at the majority of strikers they’ve purchased in their recent history, they tend to be in their very early 20s and they pick well. <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Lacazette</a> has got the talent and the pace, there’s no question about that, but whether he’s what Atleti need right now with his salary, I’d be a little unsure</p>
