  <p><b>[A-League to introduce Asian import rule]</b> FFA has determined to move to a 4-plus-1 structure for the 2018-19 season but will prudently review the implementation to consider all relevant factors and impacts at the end of the 17-18 season. The 4-plus-1 structure will strengthen the A-League by further integrating Australian football into the Asian community and still ensuring the development of talented Australian players.</p>

  <p><b>[FFA’s preferred deadline for expansion since discussions over growing to 12 teams became a strategic priority in October, interested parties such as South Melbourne and FC Tasmania have declared they would be ready for next season]</b> We recently advised the clubs that we must explore a new model for the Hyundai A-League/Westfield W-League. We agree that we need to protect the value of the existing licences in which the current owners have invested. We want to expand the leagues but this has to happen as part of a new structure. That’s why we are now working with the clubs to determine the future structure of the leagues and the criteria for expansion.<br /><br />We will examine these issues in detail and expect this work will take months rather than weeks. We know that those consortia that have expressed an interest in joining the league would want to be part of something that is financially sustainable and attractive as a sound investment<br /><br />The decisions we make around the future of the Hyundai A-League/Westfield W-League will have an impact on every aspect of football in Australia. That’s why we want to work with the clubs and other stakeholders on changes that benefit the whole game</p>

  <p><b>[David Gallop declared A-League expansion was a strategic priority]</b> There is a great momentum and excitement around the game at the moment and it is important that we work together to ensure the game’s operating model evolves and takes advantage of the opportunities ahead of it. The recent FIFA/AFC visit has seen an in principle agreement to make some <b>[governance]</b> changes and FFA is committed to work collaboratively with all the game’s stakeholders to reach a model that meets the game’s future needs.</p>

  <p><b>[FFA working to move rugby match to protect Allianz Stadium pitch]</b> I’ll be at a meeting at the stadium in the morning. And I will certainly take the opportunity, as I have done over the last couple of months, to impress on <b>[the SCG Trust]</b> they do all that they can to make sure the pitch is of a standard, which is right for our game. They know it’s important to us. We’ve said it a lot of times to them and we’re sure they’ll do their best. They’ve <b>[the Waratahs]</b> got broadcast and scheduling commitments and the need to have adequate breaks between games, all the things that impact it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Football Federation Australia has dismissed the A-League clubs’ suggestion that they are keeping over 50 per cent of competition-produced revenue as totally incorrect]</b> The suggestion by the clubs that FFA will return less than 50 per cent of the revenue generated by the clubs in the coming year is totally incorrect. The reality is that FFA spending on the A-League in 2017-18 closely matches revenue generated by the league when cash distributions and league operating costs such as team travel, player insurance and match officials - which are paid for centrally - are taken into account.<br /><br />If the A-League was a stand-alone entity all of these costs would still need to be met. For this reason, the distribution communicated is affordable, without placing undue pressure on other areas of the game.<br /><br /><b>[But with funding required for grassroots football and various national teams, Gallop insisted FFA cannot provide more to the clubs]</b> It was hardly surprising that the owners of the clubs want more money and we are providing them with more money after reducing FFA’s own costs significantly. But the FFA Board also has a responsibility to the 1.1 million participants in community football and our national teams program. The only way we can provide the clubs with more money is to cut more funding to the grassroots and junior and senior national teams and we do not believe that is in the interests of football in this country</p>

  <p><b>[NSW Waratahs have rejected Football Federation Australia’s request they move their Super Rugby game away from Allianz Stadium on Saturday to protect the pitch for the A-League grand final]</b> We appreciate the efforts of Venues NSW, the Minister and the Waratahs to explore the option of moving Saturday night’s rugby match. These things are always more complicated than perhaps first envisaged. The fact is our grand final deserves a world-class surface and the traffic on Allianz Stadium makes this a challenge.<br /><br />The standard of the pitch last Saturday night had a noticeably detrimental effect on the play and we implore the <b>[SCG]</b> Trust to work hard on minimising the impact of the rugby match to ensure the A-League grand final is played on a surface that befits the occasion.</p>

  <p><b>[Football in Australia gets new TV deal]</b> This is a win for football fans and an opportunity for us to showcase our game on a commercial network with a recent history of successfully covering major sport.<br /><br />We will take the biggest matches of the Hyundai A League - such as the Saturday night derbies - into every household in Australia live for the first time. It is part of the overall broadcast deal with FOX SPORTS and means that we will be working with them to drive interest and subscriptions to their ‘all games live’ coverage of the Hyundai A-League. It is terrific to have a new and enthusiastic partner in Network Ten to promote the game</p>

  <p><b>[David Gallop met with Graham Arnold in June about Socceroos coaching job]</b> We’re categorically behind Ange - we support his desire to see the Socceroos perform well, to win, to play a style of football that’s exciting and we certainly want to see that in these four games. Ange knows what he needs to do to win and we’re not there to tell him what sort of tactics to play.<br /><br />They’re big games, <b>[Postecoglou]</b> is an experienced guy, he’s had success with this team and we’re confident that’ll he see us through to Russia. We know it’s tough, we look around the world and there are big football nations that still not <b>[at the World Cup]</b> - we’re part of that now and we just have to make sure we do well in these four games.</p>

  <p><b>[Ange Postecoglou quits as coach of the Socceroos despite World Cup qualification]</b> I’m disappointed and still a bit puzzled but still supportive that you reach a point where you know you need to do something new. Ange’s record speaks for itself. It’s important that we get the right person to fill the big shoes. One thing I do know that the standards that Ange set … will now always be there and that’s a huge part of the legacy that Ange leaves for the boys and the staff.<br /><br />With a guaranteed place in the World Cup, I am sure we will attract a strong field of candidates. There’s enormous advantages to have an Australian in this position … but it doesn’t necessarily guarantee that we will be able to appoint an Australian. So we will take our time and make sure we get the right person for the job</p>
