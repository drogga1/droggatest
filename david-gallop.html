  <p><b>[David Gallop said there are plans for the team to play a farewell match in Australia leading up the World Cup]</b> We do have some options for a farewell game in Australia. But we are in no way locked into anything.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ffa.html">Football Federation Australia</a> CEO David Gallop was full of praise for Arnold’s approach to his new job and the personnel he’s surrounding himself with]</b> Since Graham officially started as the Socceroos head coach he has built a strong coaching staff around him<br /><br />We welcome his initiative to take on the under 23’s and we believe these changes also enhance our ability to build future generations of successful national teams, which aligns closely with <a href="ffa.html">FFA</a>’s strategy. He has taken a keen interest in understanding the entire <a href="ffa.html">FFA</a> landscape over the past few weeks, meeting with stakeholders across the country, including our Hyundai A-League clubs<br /><br />We are looking forward to this new phase for our national teams and our game. We are finalising plans for internationals in the lead up to the AFC Asian Cup to give the Socceroos the best chance to win the championship again</p>

  <p><b>[FFA CEO David Gallop made it clear that Milicic’s familiarity with the national team set-ups was a strong factor]</b> There was no shortage of exceptional Australian and international applicants interested in this elite role. Ante’s intimate involvement with our national teams Unit over the past five years ensured that he will commence the position with a clear understanding of the systems in place, and with sound relationships with key technical, backroom, and administrative staff already forged</p>

  <p><b>[Australian striker <a href="sam-kerr.html">Sam Kerr</a> has reportedly been offered a $1 million deal to join English Super League side <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> She’s important to Australian football and the women’s game. We will definitely sit down with her after the World Cup and discuss where she sees herself next. Her spot at Perth Glory and in the W-League is a tremendous thing for the club, the competition and the sport. We appreciate that playing for a big club overseas would be wonderful for her, too.</p>

  <p><b>[Equal pay for women: Australia’s national teams strike historic agreement]</b> The Caltex Socceroos have made a choice to adjust a fixed level of payment to share in a combined revenue pool with the Westfield Matildas. This closes the pay gap that has existed between them and the Westﬁeld Matildas. It’s an important decision that deserves to be acknowledged</p>
