  <p><b>[Palace star Martin Kelly ready for Anfield return]</b> It’s always nice to go back home. And especially with the new stand. It’s always a nice fixture in terms of the stadium.<br /><br />We all get excited playing the big teams. You go to the best stadiums and it’s exciting. But we will take it as another Premier League game and will go with the game plan that has been set by the manager and the staff. We know that we’ve got great ability in our squad and we can hurt any team in the league. We’ve shown that by getting a result against Manchester City, the draws with Arsenal and Manchester United this season, so all we can do is stick to our game plan and see what happens.<br /><br />I don’t think they will be thinking about that. They are professional athletes and all you think about is the next game and your next opponent - you don’t try to think too far ahead. I can see the title race going right down to the wire. Liverpool are in the driving seat at the minute, but Manchester City, with the way they play, will be right there. It’ll be exciting for every Premier League fan.<br /><br />I think it’s vital for the club and the fans to see home-grown players come through. With Trent, it seems that he has everything in his grasp to become a world-class player. Watching him play, he’s got all the attributes. He’s still young so he probably needs the experience wrapped around him like I did. Having Jamie Carragher helped me, and Trent has the likes of Virgil van Dijk around him, so if he keeps his feet on the ground, he can go a long way<br /><br />Playing alongside Aaron, you forget how young he is. He’s a player that only broke into the first team last season but playing with him, it’s like he’s played 10 seasons. He plays with experience, he’s always in the right position, he knows when to go forward and when to stay. He’s coming on leaps and bounds. He must be made up with the progression he’s making, and a player of Aaron’s ability he’ll probably want to start adding more assists to his game. He helps the team massively defensively, and you can leave him more or less one-on-one with any attacker knowing that he is going to do his job. He’s a great player to have on the team</p>
