  <p><b>[on <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>]</b> He can’t kick with his left foot, he can’t head, he can’t tackle, and he doesn’t score many goals. Apart from that, he’s alright</p>

  <p><b>[George Best on <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a>]</b> To be honest I think England have lost their best player. Certainly he’s the most consistent and naturally gifted player we’ve had for a long, long time</p>

  <p><b>[Quote on <a href="bobby-charlton.html">Sir Bobby Charlton</a>]</b> What a pleasure to play alongside. I don’t think I’ve even seen anybody who could beat players as easily as him, myself included. I often used my pace, but Bobby made it look effortless. And once he got within 30 yards of goal, he was lethal with either foot. Because he played a lot on the left, many people assume he was a natural left-footer, but I don’t think he was. He was just so good with both feet</p>

  <p><b>[Quote on <a href="ruud-gullit.html">Ruud Gullit</a>]</b> <a href="ruud-gullit.html">Ruud Gullit</a> is a great player by any standards. He has all the skills. He’s not afraid to do things with the ball. And he looks as if he’s enjoying every second of it. By my reckoning that’s what makes him an even better player than <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>. Both have the key quality you will find in all the best players: balance. You just can’t knock them off the ball. It was the same with <a href="pele.html">Pele</a>, <a href="franz-beckenbauer.html">Beckenbauer</a> and Cruyff</p>

  <p><b>[Fondly remembered as one of the greatest players the game has ever seen]</b> I was born with a great gift and sometimes with that comes a destructive streak. Just as I wanted to outdo everyone when I played, I had to outdo everyone when we were out on the town</p>
