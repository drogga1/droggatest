  <p><b>[PSG have completed the €37 million signing of Thilo Kehrer on a five-year contract from Schalke]</b> It is with much joy and ambition that I have signed for Paris Saint-Germain. Everyone in Europe knows how strong and exciting the Paris Saint-Germain project is and I couldn’t think of a better club for me to continue my progression and reach my objectives. I am going to meet some extraordinary team-mates and work with a coach that has done a great job in Germany in recent years. Everyone is going to be important in helping me and I in turn hope to help the team with my qualities. I also can’t wait to play at the Parc des Princes, a legendary stadium in European football</p>

  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain’s Germany international Thilo Kehrer has spoken in glowing terms about Kylian Mbappe and Neymar]</b> Of course, I have got to know <b>[Mbappe]</b> quite differently as a team-mate. As a player, he has outstanding ability, but at the same time he is a very down to earth, funny guy in direct contact. Neymar is a sociable and nice person. The way he carries himself privately is quite different to how he may come across in the media. In the dressing room, we have a very good mood, which has made it really easy for me so far. I grew up speaking French thanks to my family, so I did not have any adjustment problems. I was very well integrated into the team, the people and the city. It worked very well, I feel well in Paris.<br /><br />We certainly have the opportunity <b>[to win]</b>. But it is also certain that it will be very, very difficult. There are just an unbelievable number of really strong teams here. From the knockout stage onwards, a lot of details will decide who wins the title</p>

  <p><b>[Thilo Kehrer said of the victory over sixth-division side ESA Linas-Montlhery on Sunday]</b> We did our job and we are happy with the result. We had to respect this opponent, it was clear. We should not underestimate this team and take it seriously. Respect is the most important. We all play the same game. Personally, it was important for me to find the rhythm and to find good habits on the pitch</p>
