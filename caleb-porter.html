  <p><b>[Portland Timbers coach Caleb Porter describing the feeling of what it is like to win the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup]</b> Guys that were here, they have now tasted what’s possible at the end of this long <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> road, and there’s no greater motivation to do it again. Not many people feel that. It’s like a drug, you want it again - or ice cream</p>

We look forward to having him back and seeing even more progress and impact this season.</p>

  <p><b>[Portland Timbers announced a pair of moves Monday, signing free-agent fullback Chance Myers and re-signing defender/midfielder Amobi Okugo]</b> One of our main goals this offseason was to increase competition and add more cover in every position. Chance Myers will be a good fit in our system and provides attacking and defending balance to the right back position. Chance is also another piece that will raise the level and compete for his minutes, and with this signing we feel our roster is in a good spot in that role.<br /><br />Amobi will continue to give us experience and depth in two positions and when called upon like last year, we know he has the ability to step in and get the job done</p>

  <p><b>[The Portland Timbers have signed Argentine winger Sebastian Blanco as a designated player]</b> An attacking player that will increase our production from wide positions was a top priority this offseason, and we’re very pleased to sign a difference-maker like Sebastian Blanco. He is a technical, two-footed player that will bring quality service and final passing, and he has produced goals playing either wing. His work rate on both sides of the ball was also very important. We project Blanco to play on the right side, but he is also effective on the left or at the No. 10, which gives us tactical flexibility if need be.</p>

  <p><b>[Portland Timbers hope key additions take them back to the top]</b> If we had a healthy squad last season, we would have been in the playoffs - it’s that simple. But we weren’t healthy. The problem is we had to rely on our depth and our depth didn’t get the job done.<br /><br />We had a few holes where guys couldn’t allow us to keep the ball like we wanted to keep the ball. We ended up being more of a reactionary, low-block counterattacking team. You have to be adaptable and do that at times but we did it far too much<br /><br />We had a really clear plan this offseason of what we wanted to do, and it starts with adding three starters: a winger, a true No. 6 and a center back. That was the first priority. The second priority was rebuilding our depth. The first signing we made was Guzman because we felt like getting that No. 6 sorted meant we could get <b>[Diego]</b> Chara back in his best position, which is to play as a box-to-box midfielder, a No. 8. <b>[We]</b> could get <b>[Darlington]</b> Nagbe back in his best position, where he’s scored the most goals and that’s left wing. And that protects - with two holding mids now - <b>[Diego]</b> Valeri where he can do what he does best, which is play as a No. 10 with a lot of freedom. We also knew that meant we needed a right winger. That led to us scouring the world to try and find the perfect fit, and we feel like we’ve got that in Blanco<br /><br />Our depth is stronger and now we can keep a consistent playing style. We can rotate the squad and not get any drop off and that’s why we really felt that rebuilding our bench was just as important as adding three starters<br /><br />When you look at the roster now versus last year’s roster, it’s way stronger and that gives me a really good feeling</p>

  <p><b>[Sizing up the top candidates for the USMNT head coach position]</b> If you’re going American, Peter Vermes, for me, he is the guy that deserves the shot. I believe that. That guy deserves to carry the torch of our national team. Peter Vermes, in my opinion, based on what he’s done in our league, he’s proven it as an American coach. If you don’t go with Peter Vermes, I think, based on what I’ve proven, I’m in the mix with another two or three guys who deserve consideration and I’d be open to talking.</p>

  <p><b>[New era set to begin in Columbus for saved Crew and ambitious Caleb Porter]</b> Every team I coach I think has the opportunity to be title contenders. And if I don’t believe that, I shouldn’t be coaching.<br /><br /><b>[But it was the #SaveTheCrew movement that sealed the deal]</b> One of the biggest factors in me wanting the job was seeing the passion of the supporters and seeing them fight for the club. That’s obviously the type of club I want to be a part of - where there’s a real pride. I felt compelled to not just jump in to save it but take it to the next step and there’s a lot of exciting things ahead<br /><br />I think this group is good enough to put another trophy in that trophy case. So that’s how I can hopefully help push this group over the edge and cement their legacy as a very prominent era in the Crew’s rich history</p>

  <p><b>[Crew hoping transition from Berhalter to leads to championship result]</b> The club has been a stable club. Gregg Berhalter and others have done a nice job in creating that stability. Obviously that’s a positive for me to come into club that’s stable - that’s the best case scenario, versus to coming into a club that’s unstable. So I come in humble and well aware that there’s a tradition and good foundation in place, there’s a playing style that’s put in place. But I’m hungry to help the club achieve more<br /><br />When you look at my teams in Portland, we always got production out of the No. 9, 10, 7 and 11. Then you get a few out of the midfielders and you get a few out of the outside backs and a few out of the center backs from set pieces. But you look at last year, Gyasi scored the lion’s share. I don’t expect that to change - he’s a very good striker. In my system, the No. 9 is typically scoring the lion’s share of the goals but Pipa <b>[Higuain]</b> - he’s capable of scoring. He’s a very good player and is going to get a lot of assists. I think he’s one of the best final passers I’ve ever coached. So can we utilize that with our movement, with our third man running with the wingers, with our ability to combine central and attack in that channel more? You need to put not just one player in positions to score but multiple players in positions where they can score. We attack in different ways, we maybe at times counterattack in different ways and maybe at times press and trap and create turnovers higher up the pitch. So there will be some little tweaks there<br /><br />There are no luxury guys. There are no guys who take plays off. We have 11 guys who have bought into the team concept and that makes it really enjoyable because we can execute a style of play that will be exciting, entertaining and hard working. And that’s the type of team I prefer to manage</p>
