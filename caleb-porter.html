  <p><b>[Portland Timbers announced a pair of moves Monday, signing free-agent fullback Chance Myers and re-signing defender/midfielder Amobi Okugo]</b> One of our main goals this offseason was to increase competition and add more cover in every position. Chance Myers will be a good fit in our system and provides attacking and defending balance to the right back position. Chance is also another piece that will raise the level and compete for his minutes, and with this signing we feel our roster is in a good spot in that role.<br /><br />Amobi will continue to give us experience and depth in two positions and when called upon like last year, we know he has the ability to step in and get the job done</p>

  <p><b>[The Portland Timbers have signed Argentine winger Sebastian Blanco as a designated player]</b> An attacking player that will increase our production from wide positions was a top priority this offseason, and we’re very pleased to sign a difference-maker like Sebastian Blanco. He is a technical, two-footed player that will bring quality service and final passing, and he has produced goals playing either wing. His work rate on both sides of the ball was also very important. We project Blanco to play on the right side, but he is also effective on the left or at the No. 10, which gives us tactical flexibility if need be.</p>

  <p><b>[Portland Timbers hope key additions take them back to the top]</b> If we had a healthy squad last season, we would have been in the playoffs - it’s that simple. But we weren’t healthy. The problem is we had to rely on our depth and our depth didn’t get the job done.<br /><br />We had a few holes where guys couldn’t allow us to keep the ball like we wanted to keep the ball. We ended up being more of a reactionary, low-block counterattacking team. You have to be adaptable and do that at times but we did it far too much<br /><br />We had a really clear plan this offseason of what we wanted to do, and it starts with adding three starters: a winger, a true No. 6 and a center back. That was the first priority. The second priority was rebuilding our depth. The first signing we made was Guzman because we felt like getting that No. 6 sorted meant we could get <b>[Diego]</b> Chara back in his best position, which is to play as a box-to-box midfielder, a No. 8. <b>[We]</b> could get <b>[Darlington]</b> Nagbe back in his best position, where he’s scored the most goals and that’s left wing. And that protects - with two holding mids now - <b>[Diego]</b> Valeri where he can do what he does best, which is play as a No. 10 with a lot of freedom. We also knew that meant we needed a right winger. That led to us scouring the world to try and find the perfect fit, and we feel like we’ve got that in Blanco<br /><br />Our depth is stronger and now we can keep a consistent playing style. We can rotate the squad and not get any drop off and that’s why we really felt that rebuilding our bench was just as important as adding three starters<br /><br />When you look at the roster now versus last year’s roster, it’s way stronger and that gives me a really good feeling</p>

  <p><b>[Portland Timbers attack dominant in Houston Dynamo dismatling]</b> I think it shows the heart that they have, the hunger they have, the fight that they have. Obviously there are certain guys that always fight, because it’s just in their DNA, but you need fight out of guys like <b>[Sebastian]</b> Blanco and guys like Darlington <b>[Nagbe]</b> and <b>[Diego]</b> Valeri. I was really proud of the entire team, but I was proud of the second half with those three guys in particular because it’s not always natural for those guys to want to fight and dig and grind and battle. I thought the whole team did that, but we got it out of everybody, and that’s the main reason we were on the ball so much, because we kept winning it back with our pressure. I thought we just played with a real edge, a real ruthlessness that I’ve been wanting to see, and we showed that.</p>

  <p><b>[Timbers-Sporting Kansas City rivalry has had some added spice]</b> I think it’s going to be a really difficult, tight game. We’ve had some really good battles with them over the years. They’re a good team. They’re mentally strong, they’re well organized. They’ve got good players, they’ve got a good coach<br /><br />They’re, historically speaking, good on the road. They come on the road, they grind. It’s defense-first for sure. They wait for you to make mistakes. Counters, set pieces, you look at that reflected in their results on the road this year in the 0-0 draws that they’ve had</p>

  <p><b>[Sporting Kansas City successfully contained the Portland Timbers attack in Saturday’s 1-0 win]</b> What I will say though was it was the perfect ref for how they played today, the perfect ref. With a different day with a different ref, it’s a lot different game with the fouls that are called and all that. But that’s a part of every game as well. The officials. The conditions.<br /><br />We’ve got to find ways to wins games when things aren’t going our way. Part of that is putting the game on our terms. Part of that is finding a way to win, no matter what. Part of that is managing the emotions of what’s happening in the game and keeping your composure</p>

  <p><b>[Caleb Porter turned to his bench and Darren Mattocks and Dairon Asprilla stepped in to help the Timbers beat Vancouver]</b> It makes a real statement to the squad that we have. I like to build my squads with a lot of depth. I thought in 2015, when we won it, one of the main reasons was because we had depth. You need it in this league and it was tested this game.</p>

  <p><b>[Marco Farfan tuning out the chatter after Portland Timbers breakout]</b> He’s still walking down the halls in high school. If you don’t have a level head, then he’d probably be struggling with some of those dynamics. But he’s just got a really calm demeanor, he’s got a quiet intensity about him, he’s extremely hungry and he’s not in awe.<br /><br /><b>[Porter understands Farfan is still learning the nuances of playing left back]</b> He’s going to play, and he’s going to make some mistakes<br /><br />He’s extremely athletic - I would say deceptively athletic. He’s stronger than his age, he’s got pace and he’s going to continue to grow in that regard. … He’s also technical, and that’s important to an outside back in our system. We want these guys to get forward and join the attack and provide width and help us keep the ball<br /><br />We can’t keep sitting him on the bench and not play him. We’ll make sure he’s always getting games. Some of those games will be with us, some of those games will be with T2, and eventually he’ll take over the starting job</p>

  <p><b>[Sebastian Blanco, David Guzman prove Portland Timbers potent without injured Diego Valeri]</b> We’ve been pretty fierce with our attack this year and we showed that again today, especially with one of our top players Diego Valeri being out. I thought our team as a whole played really well. It was a difficult game against a difficult opponent. It’s tough to get points here. Not many teams come here and get points, and for us to get a point was very good. With a little bit of better luck, maybe we get three.</p>

  <p><b>[Andrea Pirlo endures rough night as Timbers succeed in neutralizing the Italian star]</b> <b>[Valeri]</b> took away Pirlo, which was the job we gave him to do. I would think it was a very quiet game for Pirlo.<br /><br />Pirlo’s a great player. In their system he works, but also if you can’t get him on the ball and into a rhythm then they’re not going to get going quite as well</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Valeri’s winning goal in Portland’s 1-0 victory over NYCFC]</b> He’s been in the league five years and he’s produced every single year, but this is his best year in his MLS career. He’s always been considered a top player, but what he’s doing for our team, and what he’s doing in terms of production, we can’t lose sight of how hard he’s working. We’re trying to be a team that presses from the front and you can’t do that unless your 10 .<br /><br />Not only did he score, but he took away one of their best players in the buildup defensively, and that’s what makes him so valuable. He’s not a luxury guy that just walks around. He’s a guy that will work both sides of the ball. He’s a guy that can score. In our system, he’s the one who makes us go</p>

  <p><b>[Timbers vs. Whitecaps]</b> The way I see it, the playoffs start this Sunday. That’s the way we’re going to approach it. Obviously if we win the game, we shave off a game in the playoffs. We’re at home, playing a very good team in Vancouver, a team at the top of the <b>[West standings]</b>, obviously that’s where we want to be.<br /><br /><b>[Porter said of the Whitecaps]</b> They’ve always been an organized team defensively, with a good goalkeeper and very good center backs in <b>[Kendall]</b> Waston and <b>[Tim]</b> Parker. As a team they’re organized and tough to break down. I think the difference this year is they’re more dynamic and I would say creative in the attack. That’s been the difference for them this year. They score more goals, they’ve been a bit better going forward. Still don’t look to carry games too much, but I think they’re more effective with the ball, in creating chances, whether that’s in transition or when they do have a bit of the ball<br /><br /><b>[The Timbers also have good memories of their last meeting with the Whitecaps]</b> I thought that was a turning point for us. We went there with only 16 players, and two T2 guys we called up. We had, I think maybe four or five starters in the lineup and we pulled off a very good result. I thought that did turn our season a little bit, and brought a spirit to our team and we’ve been on a good run ever since.</p>

  <p><b>[Sizing up the top candidates for the USMNT head coach position]</b> If you’re going American, Peter Vermes, for me, he is the guy that deserves the shot. I believe that. That guy deserves to carry the torch of our national team. Peter Vermes, in my opinion, based on what he’s done in our league, he’s proven it as an American coach. If you don’t go with Peter Vermes, I think, based on what I’ve proven, I’m in the mix with another two or three guys who deserve consideration and I’d be open to talking.</p>

  <p><b>[New era set to begin in Columbus for saved Crew and ambitious Caleb Porter]</b> Every team I coach I think has the opportunity to be title contenders. And if I don’t believe that, I shouldn’t be coaching.<br /><br /><b>[But it was the #SaveTheCrew movement that sealed the deal]</b> One of the biggest factors in me wanting the job was seeing the passion of the supporters and seeing them fight for the club. That’s obviously the type of club I want to be a part of - where there’s a real pride. I felt compelled to not just jump in to save it but take it to the next step and there’s a lot of exciting things ahead<br /><br />I think this group is good enough to put another trophy in that trophy case. So that’s how I can hopefully help push this group over the edge and cement their legacy as a very prominent era in the Crew’s rich history</p>

  <p><b>[Crew hoping transition from Berhalter to leads to championship result]</b> The club has been a stable club. Gregg Berhalter and others have done a nice job in creating that stability. Obviously that’s a positive for me to come into club that’s stable - that’s the best case scenario, versus to coming into a club that’s unstable. So I come in humble and well aware that there’s a tradition and good foundation in place, there’s a playing style that’s put in place. But I’m hungry to help the club achieve more<br /><br />When you look at my teams in Portland, we always got production out of the No. 9, 10, 7 and 11. Then you get a few out of the midfielders and you get a few out of the outside backs and a few out of the center backs from set pieces. But you look at last year, Gyasi scored the lion’s share. I don’t expect that to change - he’s a very good striker. In my system, the No. 9 is typically scoring the lion’s share of the goals but Pipa <b>[Higuain]</b> - he’s capable of scoring. He’s a very good player and is going to get a lot of assists. I think he’s one of the best final passers I’ve ever coached. So can we utilize that with our movement, with our third man running with the wingers, with our ability to combine central and attack in that channel more? You need to put not just one player in positions to score but multiple players in positions where they can score. We attack in different ways, we maybe at times counterattack in different ways and maybe at times press and trap and create turnovers higher up the pitch. So there will be some little tweaks there<br /><br />There are no luxury guys. There are no guys who take plays off. We have 11 guys who have bought into the team concept and that makes it really enjoyable because we can execute a style of play that will be exciting, entertaining and hard working. And that’s the type of team I prefer to manage</p>
