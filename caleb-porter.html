  <p><b>[Portland Timbers coach Caleb Porter describing the feeling of what it is like to win the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup]</b> Guys that were here, they have now tasted what’s possible at the end of this long <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> road, and there’s no greater motivation to do it again. Not many people feel that. It’s like a drug, you want it again - or ice cream</p>

  <p><b>[Portland Timbers have re-signed winger Jack Barmby and added three players from the organization’s USL reserve team]</b> Overall, we felt Jack had a positive first season with our club, especially considering his age and potential upside. We look forward to having him back and seeing even more progress and impact this season.</p>

  <p><b>[Sizing up the top candidates for the USMNT head coach position]</b> If you’re going American, Peter Vermes, for me, he is the guy that deserves the shot. I believe that. That guy deserves to carry the torch of our national team. Peter Vermes, in my opinion, based on what he’s done in our league, he’s proven it as an American coach. If you don’t go with Peter Vermes, I think, based on what I’ve proven, I’m in the mix with another two or three guys who deserve consideration and I’d be open to talking.</p>

  <p><b>[New era set to begin in Columbus for saved Crew and ambitious Caleb Porter]</b> Every team I coach I think has the opportunity to be title contenders. And if I don’t believe that, I shouldn’t be coaching.<br /><br /><b>[But it was the #SaveTheCrew movement that sealed the deal]</b> One of the biggest factors in me wanting the job was seeing the passion of the supporters and seeing them fight for the club. That’s obviously the type of club I want to be a part of - where there’s a real pride. I felt compelled to not just jump in to save it but take it to the next step and there’s a lot of exciting things ahead<br /><br />I think this group is good enough to put another trophy in that trophy case. So that’s how I can hopefully help push this group over the edge and cement their legacy as a very prominent era in the Crew’s rich history</p>

  <p><b>[Crew hoping transition from Berhalter to leads to championship result]</b> The club has been a stable club. Gregg Berhalter and others have done a nice job in creating that stability. Obviously that’s a positive for me to come into club that’s stable - that’s the best case scenario, versus to coming into a club that’s unstable. So I come in humble and well aware that there’s a tradition and good foundation in place, there’s a playing style that’s put in place. But I’m hungry to help the club achieve more<br /><br />When you look at my teams in Portland, we always got production out of the No. 9, 10, 7 and 11. Then you get a few out of the midfielders and you get a few out of the outside backs and a few out of the center backs from set pieces. But you look at last year, Gyasi scored the lion’s share. I don’t expect that to change - he’s a very good striker. In my system, the No. 9 is typically scoring the lion’s share of the goals but Pipa <b>[Higuain]</b> - he’s capable of scoring. He’s a very good player and is going to get a lot of assists. I think he’s one of the best final passers I’ve ever coached. So can we utilize that with our movement, with our third man running with the wingers, with our ability to combine central and attack in that channel more? You need to put not just one player in positions to score but multiple players in positions where they can score. We attack in different ways, we maybe at times counterattack in different ways and maybe at times press and trap and create turnovers higher up the pitch. So there will be some little tweaks there<br /><br />There are no luxury guys. There are no guys who take plays off. We have 11 guys who have bought into the team concept and that makes it really enjoyable because we can execute a style of play that will be exciting, entertaining and hard working. And that’s the type of team I prefer to manage</p>
