  <p><b>[However, his father believes he will be better off in the Italian capital than he would have been at Old Trafford]</b> A jump to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> would have been difficult. I think United would have been too big a jump. Roma is an important club, but the pressures are lower.<br /><br />I’m very satisfied with what he is doing. He doesn’t speak much, but he is someone who knows how to listen and is motivated, I would have liked to stay in <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> for another year, but he chose for himself. I think Roma is a good solution.<br /><br />Roma must not win by force and it is a club that is used to good football. It is the ideal place for Justin right now. Then, who doesn’t dream of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>? But Italian football is catching up and Justin can take advantage of it.</p>

  <p>He <b>[Rossi]</b> too has been very important to me. When I came here, he was on vacation. Yet he immediately sent a message to welcome me. That motivated me. He is a phenomenon, on and off the field. It is an honour to be allowed to play with him. He can also speak English well, so I talk to him a lot</p>

  <p>My house is almost ready and everything is going as planned. Everyone knew that the start in Rome would be difficult because they expect so much. At <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> I was freer on the field, while here I have to play more centrally. I feel more and more comfortable, though.</p>

  <p><b>[Kluivert says he would have liked to beat <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> with Ajax]</b> When they beat <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> away, that is wonderful to see. Sometimes I really think I would have liked to be there, but I don’t regret my choice at all. But sometimes you think: ‘I could have been there’. I think it’s wonderful for <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>, really beautiful.<br /><br />I am now a better player than I was at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. I feel that, I know that. I learned a lot, also off the field. More than I could have learned at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. But maybe I could have learned other things at Ajax<br /><br />It’s been going very well for the last couple of weeks. I have learned a lot from the new coach already and I’m happy that I’m getting minutes. We play in a 4-4-2, but in our system I come into my strength so it’s really good. <br /><br />I look forward to playing much more. The new coach thinks I’m a good player and wants to use my speed. I must keep going for him all the time. That suits me well and I love it. If you let me do my own thing, it usually works out fine.<br /><br /><b>[Being left ouf of the team]</b> was difficult, of course. But you know that if you go to a top club. You don’t immediately start every game, that is normal and I expected it. Now that I am going to play more it just feels good. I am very happy with that. I do my best every day and hopefully I’ll be there one day</p>

  <p><b>[Kluivert expresses admiration towards <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> superstar]</b> For what he is on and off the pitch, my idol is <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. I’ve admired him since I was a child and I still follow him, but I don’t have a photo with him<br /><br /><b>[The winger added on his dream debut for Roma and having to adjust his playing style after arriving in Italy]</b> I like to dribble and overcome four or five players, but it’s not that easy anymore. I don’t always succeed, but this is my idea to be successful. In the first match against <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a>, my debut with Roma that I will never forget, I served an assist to <b>[Edin]</b> <a href="edin-dzeko.html">Dzeko</a>, which was a dream. It was wonderful to be immediately decisive at a new club.<br /><br />When I arrived in Rome I was terrible in the defensive phase and in Italy, if you don’t play for the others you don’t go on the field. I focused a lot on this, I had a lot of problems in that phase. You have to prove that you are up to it when you have the ball and when you don’t have it. Dad scored in the Champions League final and he won it, I want them to take the same picture when I win it. With which shirt? I hope I will wear the Roma shirt, but I can’t read the future. It’s all to be written</p>

  <p><b>[Justin Kluivert has expressed his hope that <a href="chris-smalling.html">Chris Smalling</a> and <a href="henrikh-mkhitaryan.html">Henrikh Mkhitaryan</a> will extend their stay at Roma beyond the end of the season]</b> They fit very well into the team. Look at how Chris immediately made the difference. That is unbelievable. That is really a plus for the team. He is a defensive force, a warrior. Mkhitaryan has also proven his worth. He scores, gives assists, is important to the team. He passes on his experience to the team and certainly to me. I look up to him as a player who has been through a lot. He has had a good career and played for many clubs. I can certainly learn from that. We talk a lot anyway because he plays in the same position. He has a lot of experience, so of course he occasionally gives tips or emphasizes what I do well. I listen to that because he has already experienced it. I certainly hope they want to stay and they get the chance to stay. They are an added value to the team. They are top players<br /><br /><b>[Kluivert went on to discuss the topic of racism in football]</b> Racism is the worst thing going on in the world. It doesn’t belong in this age. It should be over, but unfortunately, it is not over yet. When you see how many people are protesting, it is just nice to see. We all need to make the world a better place. Together. No black or white, but together as one. That’s why I like the fact that so many people pay attention to it. Racism no longer belongs here</p>
