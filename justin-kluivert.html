  <p><b>[Justin Kluivert is flattered by talk of Lionel Messi wanting him at Barcelona]</b> I’m not in contact with Messi, so I don’t know if it’s true. Only he knows if that happened, but it’s nice to hear. My two main goals are winning the Eredivisie title with Ajax and then making my debut for the Netherlands, and of course to keep improving. I want to improve on everything. I’m still young. I give everything in training and I also make a point of trying to improve even the things that already going well.<br /><br />He said it was nice to see me again after such a long time, because he had known me when I was a baby. And he said it was nice to see that I was doing well</p>

  <p><b>[Justin Kluivert sees Cristiano Ronaldo as a great role model for his devotion and work outside of football]</b> I definitely have a few <b>[role models]</b>. My father is one of them, but Cristiano Ronaldo is another, also because of what he’s doing off the pitch. He doesn’t just think about himself, but also about others. He does a lot for charities and is really dedicated to his life as a footballer. That’s something I can learn from and I want to be doing myself as well. I’m Team Messi. He is the best player in the world, but Ronaldo is a role model for me. I’m sure Messi <b>[works hard]</b> as well, but I like the way Ronaldo manages to deliver the message across social media. He is an example to follow because of the way he lives for the game. That’s just great<br /><br />That’s definitely my goal, I can tell you that. That’s what I want and nothing less. I will have to work hard to get there, but I am only 18 and still have plenty of room for improvement. I will definitely work hard for it and that is my goal. There’s more to come from me<br /><br /><b>[On Neymar]</b> That is obviously great to hear, but Neymar is world class. It’s my goal to become as good as he is and I train hard to get there on a daily basis. Of course, you go through difficult spells as well, but I’m still only 18. I eventually hope to become as good as Neymar, though. Like myself, he is not overly tall or strong, but he is very fast and agile. I can see some of that in myself, yeah. And he’s got that frivolous style of play, I have that myself as well. So yeah, I can understand the comparisons<br /><br />Not at all to be honest. I was still playing in the B2 <b>[Under 16]</b> or B1 <b>[U17]</b> just two years ago. Things have gone incredibly fast since. I went from the C1 <b>[U14]</b> to the B2 at the time and that was not a great time for me because some of the others went to the B1 straight away. But it’s part of the game. I turned a corner there and things have just taken off since. It’s hard to say what happened there. It also says a thing or two about your personality. Do you give up and start hanging out with your friends, going to parties and all that or do you bounce back and show that you are the best? I have always been someone who is able to move on and I was never really into partying anyway. I think that has paid off</p>

  <p><b>[Justin Kluivert could be set for a move away from Ajax during the summer transfer window]</b> Ajax wants me to extend my contract so that they can ask for more <b>[when they sell]</b>. What do they really want? My plan was to stay, but a lot has happened lately. The fans think that it’s only about money, while everyone knows I had it good. I was not waiting for money at all. Football is important. I want to develop myself. I was more or less told that I had to sign up. Otherwise I had to leave. Then you start thinking. I spoke briefly with <b>[technical director]</b> Marc Overmars. I feel pressured. The most important thing for Ajax is that I extend my contract. Then it’s not about football, but about money.<br /><br />I want to be the best in the world. Look what’s happening around me, with other players who want to leave or are leaving. It will soon be difficult to get through the preliminary round of the Champions League, and competitions at the highest level are important. Ajax change coach too easily. They don’t really get a chance. You can notice that our coach <b>[Ten Hag]</b> is not really comfortable. You also saw that with Marcel Keizer before him. That’s what the boys feel. You can see how coaches behave, how they express themselves, even in the press. It feels unstable. We are not really a team. There are different opinions. About everything. One time you play one way, then another coach comes and you play another way. That’s difficult. We never really knew what we wanted this season.</p>

  <p><b>[Justin Kluivert has criticised Ajax for discussing his future with Tottenham behind his back]</b> I heard that at the last minute. That says nothing about Ajax, but about the people in the club. Somewhere they were laughing. You see how the football world works. If you get higher up, it looks like a game. They do what they want. I’m getting that feeling again now: they do what they want. I had two years contract and thought, ‘Do it.’ My idea was to stay. But then it turns out different. As a youth player, you see none of that. As a boy, everything is still fun. You have a nice game on Saturday. As soon as you get higher up, it is often about everything but football, it’s all about peripheral issues.</p>

  <p><b>[Justin Kluivert has joined Roma from Ajax in a deal worth an initial €17.25 million]</b> I’m feeling great. I’m at an unbelievable club and I can’t wait to start. I think Roma is a great club for me - I think they can build me into a bigger, stronger player and I can do some nice things here.</p>

  <p><b>[However, his father believes he will be better off in the Italian capital than he would have been at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>]</b> A jump to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> would have been difficult. I think United would have been too big a jump. Roma is an important club, but the pressures are lower.<br /><br />I’m very satisfied with what he is doing. He doesn’t speak much, but he is someone who knows how to listen and is motivated, I would have liked to stay in <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> for another year, but he chose for himself. I think Roma is a good solution.<br /><br />Roma must not win by force and it is a club that is used to good football. It is the ideal place for Justin right now. Then, who doesn’t dream of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>? But Italian football is catching up and Justin can take advantage of it.</p>

  <p>He <b>[Rossi]</b> too has been very important to me. When I came here, he was on vacation. Yet he immediately sent a message to welcome me. That motivated me. He is a phenomenon, on and off the field. It is an honour to be allowed to play with him. He can also speak English well, so I talk to him a lot</p>

  <p>My house is almost ready and everything is going as planned. Everyone knew that the start in Rome would be difficult because they expect so much. At <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> I was freer on the field, while here I have to play more centrally. I feel more and more comfortable, though.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="patrick-kluivert.html">Kluivert</a> says he would have liked to beat <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> with <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>]</b> When they beat <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> away, that is wonderful to see. Sometimes I really think I would have liked to be there, but I don’t regret my choice at all. But sometimes you think: ‘I could have been there’. I think it’s wonderful for <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>, really beautiful.<br /><br />I am now a better player than I was at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. I feel that, I know that. I learned a lot, also off the field. More than I could have learned at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. But maybe I could have learned other things at Ajax<br /><br />It’s been going very well for the last couple of weeks. I have learned a lot from the new coach already and I’m happy that I’m getting minutes. We play in a 4-4-2, but in our system I come into my strength so it’s really good.<br /><br />I look forward to playing much more. The new coach thinks I’m a good player and wants to use my speed. I must keep going for him all the time. That suits me well and I love it. If you let me do my own thing, it usually works out fine.<br /><br /><b>[Being left ouf of the team]</b> was difficult, of course. But you know that if you go to a top club. You don’t immediately start every game, that is normal and I expected it. Now that I am going to play more it just feels good. I am very happy with that. I do my best every day and hopefully I’ll be there one day</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="patrick-kluivert.html">Kluivert</a> expresses admiration towards <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> superstar]</b> For what he is on and off the pitch, my idol is <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. I’ve admired him since I was a child and I still follow him, but I don’t have a photo with him<br /><br /><b>[The winger added on his dream debut for Roma and having to adjust his playing style after arriving in Italy]</b> I like to dribble and overcome four or five players, but it’s not that easy anymore. I don’t always succeed, but this is my idea to be successful. In the first match against <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a>, my debut with Roma that I will never forget, I served an assist to <b>[Edin]</b> <a href="edin-dzeko.html">Dzeko</a>, which was a dream. It was wonderful to be immediately decisive at a new club.<br /><br />When I arrived in Rome I was terrible in the defensive phase and in Italy, if you don’t play for the others you don’t go on the field. I focused a lot on this, I had a lot of problems in that phase. You have to prove that you are up to it when you have the ball and when you don’t have it. Dad scored in the Champions League final and he won it, I want them to take the same picture when I win it. With which shirt? I hope I will wear the Roma shirt, but I can’t read the future. It’s all to be written</p>

Look at how Chris immediately made the difference. That is unbelievable. That is really a plus for the team. He is a defensive force, a warrior. Mkhitaryan has also proven his worth. He scores, gives assists, is important to the team. He passes on his experience to the team and certainly to me. I look up to him as a player who has been through a lot. He has had a good career and played for many clubs. I can certainly learn from that. We talk a lot anyway because he plays in the same position. He has a lot of experience, so of course he occasionally gives tips or emphasizes what I do well. I listen to that because he has already experienced it. I certainly hope they want to stay and they get the chance to stay. They are an added value to the team. They are top players<br /><br /><b>[Kluivert went on to discuss the topic of racism in football]</b> Racism is the worst thing going on in the world. It doesn’t belong in this age. It should be over, but unfortunately, it is not over yet. When you see how many people are protesting, it is just nice to see. We all need to make the world a better place. Together. No black or white, but together as one. That’s why I like the fact that so many people pay attention to it. Racism no longer belongs here</p>
