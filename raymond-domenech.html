You people <b>[media]</b> are talking of this after seeing it from 80 yards. The referee gave the goal, but I couldn’t see anything from where I was. I didn’t see the replay. But I am disappointed for the Irish team, their public and fans. I regret that Ireland haven’t qualified for the World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[French Coach Raymond Domenech admitted he was hopeful the 33-year-old ex-skipper Vieira would convince him worthy of a place]</b> We have been following Pat for a while, hoping he could make it to the World Cup. It’s a difficult moment. We tried, he did too. It’s tough but there comes a time when you need to make a decision<br /><br /><b>[Domenech had reassuring words for <a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a>, who has endured a frustrating first year at the Bernabeu]</b> Karim has talent and he will come back. He’s had a difficult season with Real and we needed players who were fresh and hungry</p>

  <p><b>[Domenech compared Mario Balotelli to Manchester United great Eric Cantona]</b> The recipe, in this specific case, is the response Alex Ferguson gave to the question: ‘How did you manage Cantona when he could no longer play in France?’. ‘It’s simple. Nothing’. I managed the others and left him in peace to do what he wanted. They did not take offence because they were convinced it would help the team improve faster. And you saw the results. So Mario, do as you like, what you want, when you want.</p>

  <p><b>[On Lionel Messi]</b> The worst Barcelona player in this game, it was <b>[Messi]</b>. He was in the centre of the pitch, like when he does not want to run. His bad games, he’s always doing that, he’s coming down, he believes he organises, he wants to do everything. I think he’s at the end, but he gave so much, he was so magical. He was on and off, he was missing. Neymar was breathtaking because he fought, he believed. Until the end, he was attacking. Him and Suarez, but Suarez is different, he should wear boxing gloves.<br /><br />It is not easy to see that gradually he is losing his gifts. He insists on taking free-kicks even though Neymar takes them better, all so that he can continue to be the demigod he has been. He is more calculated now. He has lost that spontaneity and strength in his dribbling</p>

  <p><b>[Former France national team manager Raymond Domenech has backed Monaco teenage sensation Kylian Mbappe for a place at next summer’s World Cup]</b> He has talent, it is undeniable. He has real potential and I bet he will be in Russia.<br /><br />A young man who has never been called and everyone says he has to be there - he starts to believe it, but it is the coach who decides. If he <b>[Deschamps]</b> says ‘do not worry, I’ll take you later’, the pressure effect that Didier can put on him would no longer have any use</p>

  <p><b>[Raymond Domenech thinks N’Golo Kante is France’s best player]</b> You can see there are two French national teams. There’s one when he is playing and one where he’s not. You don’t see him in the game but if you look out for him, then you notice all the work he does for the other players. He’s the symbol. He makes the others better. If I go to a huge club then the first player I sign is him. I think Didier Deschamps knows what happens with and without Kante, he will build his team around him. The same for Chelsea, the same for Leicester City. He is the player who makes the team better. He is always smiling, you never get any problems from him as a coach. He is extraordinary. If I was in a club then Kante is the first player that I’d sign.<br /><br /><b>[France have qualified for the 2018 World Cup in Russia]</b> I think for the World Cup, we have three main contenders. Spain, Germany and Brazil. After that we have four or five. Argentina, France, Italy, Belgium and maybe a few more who can get into the semi-final. You don’t want Spain, Germany or Brazil early on. France is just behind these three big countries. We are a very young country but the main problem for France is that we have no <b>[Michel]</b> Platinis or <b>[Zinedine]</b> Zidanes. We can be a good team but a big player can win you the World Cup. We have no player like Zidane or Platini. They’re very good players but they are not able to be the team’s superstar.</p>

  <p><b>[Raymond Domenech left a legacy of bizarre decisions while in charge of France, but none more so than when he opted to leave Robert Pires out of a squad in 2008 because of his star sign]</b> all parameters have to be considered and I have added one by saying there is astrology involved. When I have got a Leo in defence, I’ve always got my gun ready. I know he’s going to want to show off at one moment or another and cost us.</p>

  <p><b>[Raymond Domenech expects Zinedine Zidane to remain in charge of Real Madrid for a long time]</b> Look at Sir Alex Ferguson he had problems. He may have been one or two matches from being sacked, he was at the bottom of his time at Manchester United but we saw what he did after. Even the biggest coaches have problems, sometimes you have difficulties and then you have to build again. You can’t win in Europe in every season, champions of Spain every season. It is difficult to live with but he has to live with it.<br /><br />I think it will be different for Zidane <b>[than other Real Madrid coaches]</b>. He has been a great player at Madrid, he won twice in the Champions League. He won the league ahead of Barcelona. He has a long time for the fans to forget. The players will be first to be sacked, Zidane only after that. Manchester United and Arsenal have shown patience with coaches can mean success. Money makes people think that they can have the best team in Europe overnight, no, they need time. I don’t think mentalities are going to change though.<br /><br />Media now, one bad result and they say the coaches are the problem. Two bad results is a problem and after three bad results they want a new one, that’s a big problem.<br /><br />I don’t know, if I am ready to go back into management but when I am here at Stamford Bridge, I see this stadium. I feel something beautiful. It is a good job to be a coach in these conditions but I am the president of the association of French coaches and I love to help these coaches.<br /><br />I try to explain to people that French coaches deserve a better reputation. We see all the good young French players are playing in the other countries in Europe at big clubs. We say that they are not just good players, they have had good coaches before.<br /><br />I try to explain to European clubs and football agents that you can take French coaches, they are good coaches. We have many great coaches but I think Gourvennec in Bordeaux is one of the best young coaches and I would recommend him to clubs in England</p>

  <p><b>[Former France manager Raymond Domenech has revealed the excessive means he would use to stop PSG forward Neymar]</b> It’s a personal thing, each player has his own way to do it. For me, against Neymar, I would stick to him, show him who I am, bite him, make his life difficult. But would it be sufficient to stop such an armada?<br /><br /><b>[Domenech does not believe Strasbourg have any chance to win the match]</b> No, categorically not. It would be utopian. But it can shape the team for the future. To develop the collective defensive mindset they will need in its fight for survival. A victory against Caen would have allowed them to approach the match with more confidence. At the end of the day, it will be important not to give away too much because goal difference can count in the end. This is just my opinion. I have no advice to give Thierry Laurey who is a very good coach</p>

  <p><b>[Raymond Domenech believes Neymar has moved to Paris Saint-Germain to become the best player in the world]</b> I saw his first game versus Guingamp. It was fantastic. Everything was perfect and he does the right thing at every moment. He can change the game, he can change Paris Saint-Germain.<br /><br />They are a club that has never reached the final of the Champions League. Now they have him, they can reach the final if they don’t face Manchester City in the early rounds. They look like a force, too. He can be one of the best in Europe, for sure. This team is for him and will help him win the Ballon d’Or.<br /><br />They have the possibility now to win the Champions League now with Neymar and Mbappe signed, but there are no guarantees. No clubs are sure to win that competition just by buying players. Manchester City bought lots of good players and can win it. Chelsea, Juventus, Real Madrid and Barcelona can. Lots of them can win the Champions League.<br /><br />The rules were made by French football. Financial Fair Play, we did it first in France and then it transfered to Europe because lots of clubs have big debts. Even clubs like Real Madrid, English clubs have this. These debts were then paid by people like <b>[Chelsea owner Roman]</b> Abramovich. If you have the money to pay then you ask: ‘Why can’t I spend it?’<br /><br />In the beginning, it was Manchester United, then it was Chelsea with Abramovich. These clubs aren’t the problem as they could afford it. Other clubs are the problem; they don’t have the money and they use debt to compete. Paris has no problem to pay. However, I think that it will stop because of Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid, some Italian teams - not so much the English sides - but they are now saying we can’t compete with this Neymar fee. They will look to make rules to stop it growing further.<br /><br />Paris has come and set the standard. These other clubs won’t want, say, Russian clubs to come in or other clubs coming to compete. They want to maintain their standing in the game, so they can keep winning titles</p>
