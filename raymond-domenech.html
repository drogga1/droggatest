  <p><b>[Thierry Henry admits to handball that defeated Ireland in World Cup play-off]</b> I didn’t see the hand. You people <b>[media]</b> are talking of this after seeing it from 80 yards. The referee gave the goal, but I couldn’t see anything from where I was. I didn’t see the replay. But I am disappointed for the Irish team, their public and fans. I regret that Ireland haven’t qualified for the World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[French Coach Raymond Domenech admitted he was hopeful the 33-year-old ex-skipper Vieira would convince him worthy of a place]</b> We have been following Pat for a while, hoping he could make it to the World Cup. It’s a difficult moment. We tried, he did too. It’s tough but there comes a time when you need to make a decision<br /><br /><b>[Domenech had reassuring words for <a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a>, who has endured a frustrating first year at the Bernabeu]</b> Karim has talent and he will come back. He’s had a difficult season with Real and we needed players who were fresh and hungry</p>
