  <p><b>[<a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> admits to handball that defeated Ireland in World Cup play-off]</b> I didn’t see the hand. You people <b>[media]</b> are talking of this after seeing it from 80 yards. The referee gave the goal, but I couldn’t see anything from where I was. I didn’t see the replay. But I am disappointed for the Irish team, their public and fans. I regret that Ireland haven’t qualified for the World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[French Coach Raymond Domenech admitted he was hopeful the 33-year-old ex-skipper Vieira would convince him worthy of a place]</b> We have been following Pat for a while, hoping he could make it to the World Cup. It’s a difficult moment. We tried, he did too. It’s tough but there comes a time when you need to make a decision<br /><br /><b>[Domenech had reassuring words for <a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a>, who has endured a frustrating first year at the Bernabeu]</b> Karim has talent and he will come back. He’s had a difficult season with Real and we needed players who were fresh and hungry</p>

  <p><b>[Domenech compared Mario Balotelli to Manchester United great Eric Cantona]</b> The recipe, in this specific case, is the response Alex Ferguson gave to the question: ‘How did you manage Cantona when he could no longer play in France?’. ‘It’s simple. Nothing’. I managed the others and left him in peace to do what he wanted. They did not take offence because they were convinced it would help the team improve faster. And you saw the results. So Mario, do as you like, what you want, when you want.</p>

  <p><b>[On Lionel Messi]</b> The worst Barcelona player in this game, it was <b>[Messi]</b>. He was in the centre of the pitch, like when he does not want to run. His bad games, he’s always doing that, he’s coming down, he believes he organises, he wants to do everything. I think he’s at the end, but he gave so much, he was so magical. He was on and off, he was missing. Neymar was breathtaking because he fought, he believed. Until the end, he was attacking. Him and Suarez, but Suarez is different, he should wear boxing gloves.<br /><br />It is not easy to see that gradually he is losing his gifts. He insists on taking free-kicks even though Neymar takes them better, all so that he can continue to be the demigod he has been. He is more calculated now. He has lost that spontaneity and strength in his dribbling</p>

  <p><b>[Former France national team manager Raymond Domenech has backed Monaco teenage sensation Kylian Mbappe for a place at next summer’s World Cup]</b> He has talent, it is undeniable. He has real potential and I bet he will be in Russia.<br /><br />A young man who has never been called and everyone says he has to be there - he starts to believe it, but it is the coach who decides. If he <b>[Deschamps]</b> says ‘do not worry, I’ll take you later’, the pressure effect that Didier can put on him would no longer have any use</p>
