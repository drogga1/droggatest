  <p><b>[Arsenal Ladies and England legend Kelly Smith has announced her retirement from football at the age of 38]</b> I was privileged to have the honour of coaching Kelly. She will be remembered as one of the greatest players to have played the game. The creativity and excitement she brought to the pitch will stay as treasured memories for every supporter who had the pleasure to watch her play. Combining that with her insatiable work ethic and will to win made Kelly a dream to play with and nightmare to play against. Off the field, she is a humble and honest person who graced every changing room she was a part of. The many thousands of young people who took up the game after being inspired by Kelly will never forget the inspiration and joy she brought just from watching her play.</p>

  <p><b>[England women’s manager Mark Sampson on recalling his first game in charge of the Three Lionesses]</b> It was just a really special day. My family and friends were in the crowd and I realised, ‘This is really happening, you’re the England coach.’ You can enjoy that five minutes before kick-off, but then you also realise: ‘Oof, I’d better start winning some matches!’</p>

  <p><b>[England women’s manager Mark Sampson talks about the legacy of Kelly Smith leaves following her retirement announcement]</b> She will be remembered as one of the greatest players to have played the game. The many thousands of young people who took up the game after being inspired by Kelly will never forget the inspiration and joy she brought just from watching her play. It will absolutely be a loss to the game on the field. I hope she will now go on to enjoy a wonderful career off the field</p>

  <p><b>[Stevenage have defended former England Women’s team manager Mark Sampson from allegations of racism]</b> Like every professional club, no matter where the complaint comes from, we follow strict procedures, which were followed to the letter. The claimant was offered the chance to make a formal complaint but declined this opportunity, instead choosing to call <a href="fa.html">the FA</a>. Nevertheless, CEO Alex Tunbridge acted immediately to interview and take statements from two individuals the claimant said were witnesses, as well as others that were present in the same meeting, but not mentioned by the claimant.<br /><br />In each case the witnesses did not support the allegations. Given that overwhelming outcome and the circumstances of the allegation, the club concluded there was no case to answer. Both <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> and the Daily Mail were informed of that outcome yesterday. What I find surprising is that the Daily Mail still decided to run a story and <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> decided to acknowledge its existence, when both had been told the evidence did not support the allegation made. Perhaps now that <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> have the evidence, they will make it clear there is no case to answer. Guilt by association - especially when the person is well known - is a common weapon to use against folks in the public eye and when we find it has no foundation, we should be equally clear in making that known</p>
