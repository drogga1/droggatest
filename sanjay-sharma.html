  <p><b>[The comparative increase in recorded cases at professional level is partly down to the rise in expectation and intensity at the top end of sports]</b> The death rate of athletes at the moment is around one in every 50,000. I have noticed throughout the last 17 years that there have been slightly more deaths than there used to be and I think part of that is down to the fact that the pressure these athletes are under to perform is enormous. I have noticed throughout the last 17 years that there have been slightly more deaths than there used to be and I think part of that is down to the fact that the pressure these athletes are under to perform is enormous<br /><br /><b>[Dietary supplements and similar drugs were said to be among the potential causes of ALS, and Professor Sharma agrees that this may also play a part in present day cases]</b> Death rates in athletes are generally low so it is difficult to be sure that something like performance enhancing diets or food supplements may be responsible. In general, athletes who die usually die of conditions they already had but didn’t know about because 80 per cent of these conditions are silent<br /><br />We’re finding increasingly that when athletes die, nothing is found in their post-mortem, suggesting that maybe in some cases performance-enhancing diets or supplements are maybe responsible but we can only say maybe, we cannot say definitively because there’s no proof<br /><br />When an athlete dies we perform toxicology screenings but they only test for illicit drugs such as amphetamines, cocaine and any other drug which could have poisoned an athlete, not specifically any supplements you may find in things like Red Bull, which, as you can imagine, if someone drinks about six cans of Red Bull before they go out to play a game, that theoretically could lead to a cardiac-driven disturbance, but because deaths in athletes are so low, we can only speculate about this because there’s no proof<br /><br /><b>[But if many conditions are silent, how can detection be better applied in countries like England?]</b> I’m not saying we should mandate ECGs or make them compulsory, but I think we should make the practice available to anyone who competes at a high level to have these tests done and, unfortunately, that’s not the case in most athletes in the UK,<br /><br />The vast majority don’t get any tests because they’re usually limited to the creme de la creme of athletes. I’m sure that if we were to make it available to more athletes we would pick things up. I can tell you that from my own experience as the cardiologist for the largest cardiology charity organisation, Cardiac Risk in the Young, we pick up a serious fault in one in every 300 athletes we test with the ECGs</p>
