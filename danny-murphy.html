But to be fair to the referee and his assistant, they were spot on. You’ll see it now better, we’ve had the replay to look at, but when you see the little bit of contact, look at the delay, there and he goes. I still think that’s cheating and that’s a dive and a yellow card. I think the referee deserves credit for that.</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham need to be considering a new contract for Christian Eriksen]</b> Tottenham’s Christian Eriksen is starting to move into the top bracket of playmakers. His numbers are very consistent and he is capable of the spectacular, as we saw with his brilliant long-range, dipping goal at Chelsea last weekend as Spurs recorded a first win at Stamford Bridge for 28 years. Eriksen is calm on the ball and seems to make the right decisions. It is vital that Spurs are able to hang on to him in the long term, which I am confident they will be able to do. As good as Eriksen is, who would pay the sort of fee that chairman Daniel Levy is likely to ask for? It is worth noting, though, that he has only two years left on his contract so the sooner Spurs agree a new one, the better with the summer transfer window and World Cup on the horizon.</p>

I mean, I’ve had it loads of times where your arm gets trapped, they link and they keep of you because you’re getting away from them or vice versa. Look, Ramos is a clever guy and he is a wonderful footballer, you can tell that by everything he has won. But he is cynical, he is what you want a centre half to be in many respects.<br /><br /><b>[Murphy of the opinion that Karius may have played his last game for the club]</b> I actually feel sorry for him. I really do. Nobody goes into a game wanting to make mistakes. Unfortunately I don’t think he’ll play in a Liverpool shirt again. It’s impossible for him. I think <b>[with]</b> the magnitude of the mistakes and the enormity of the game, the supporters will struggle with him being in goal for them and the continual ribbing he will get week in, week out, wherever he goes - that’s going to be huge pressure for him. I just can’t see him playing <b>[for Liverpool]</b> again. That’s not being dramatic, that’s a reality of the situation</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool close to matching Man Utd &amp; City depth with Fabinho &amp; Fekir deals]</b> I like the fact they’re getting their business done early. I always felt at clubs when players were coming in late it was detrimental because then you’ve got other players going, ‘hold on, is that me out of the door?’ Get your business done early. I still think the keeper thing needs addressing and I think it will be, and maybe another centre-back. But in terms of attacking areas, I think they’re alright. Strength in depth is a question mark maybe, in terms of when you look at the benches of United and City. If you look at United’s front six it’s incredible really. But I’m pleased. They’re close.<br /><br />It’s hard to judge right now depending what the others do. Who’s to say United won’t go again? But Liverpool getting stuff done early is really beneficial in terms of prepping and getting them in and working on combinations. Also the way Klopp plays, it’s quite intense and specific and they’re going to have to get on board with that because if you come in late July or late August, you’re going to take a little… you know, <b>[Alex]</b> Oxlade-Chamberlain took a while, they had to get him up to speed. The left-back <b>[Andy]</b> Robertson the same, he didn’t play for a while because he had to <b>[adjust]</b>. Klopp gets his players and he thinks, ‘They are not ready for what I want them to do.’ Whereas if he gets them now, it gives him a head start</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool have invested £177 million in Alisson, Naby Keita, Fabinho and Xherdan Shaqiri]</b> Fabinho, Keita, Alisson are all good players and they give Liverpool strength in depth and competition for places, which does increase performance, but would any of those players get in City’s team? <b>[Mohamed]</b> Salah and <b>[Virgil]</b> Van Dijk would get in City’s team. Other than that, probably no others <b>[would get in]</b>. You can’t base your transfer policy on buying better players than City have. It is nearly impossible. You can’t buy a better player than <b>[Kevin]</b> De Bruyne in midfield, so you have to compete in a different way. What I like that Klopp has done is he has signed quality where he has needed it - the middle of the park they were lacking - there is great competition for places and he did it early. Shaqiri is a good one as well. That is not bad business the money they have spent there. He had a good World Cup and he will create competition for places. Liverpool have done really well and will bridge the gap with City.<br /><br />I think the gap is too big to breach so quickly for some of the other teams chasing, like Liverpool and <b>[Manchester]</b> United. For me, I think City will be champions again. They are an exquisite team now. Their confidence, their ability to rotate players and their ability to win even when not playing brilliantly is there for all to see. That game against Chelsea - although it’s only a Community Shield - just reiterates the competition they have for places. They won that game without three of their best players. For me, my top four would be City, then Liverpool, United and Tottenham</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham should have pushed harder to sign Anthony Martial]</b> I think Tottenham should have invested in the summer to improve their squad and create competition for places. If Tottenham are serious about competing with Manchester City for the Premier League then they need to sign new players. Tottenham should have looked to sign a <b>[Wilfried]</b> Zaha or a Martial, that calibre of player who has got pace and the ability to beat defenders. However, there’s now an opportunity for Lucas Moura to fulfil his potential and become the player he’s long been tipped to become. The important thing for Tottenham was keeping the likes of <b>[Harry]</b> Kane, <b>[Dele]</b> Alli, <b>[Christian]</b> Eriksen and <b>[Toby]</b> Alderweireld at the club and they achieved that.<br /><br />It’s very difficult for Tottenham to improve on what they already have. To improve on the players they have, it would cost a lot of money and they’d also be competing against rival clubs who can afford to pay a lot more. Chelsea have just splashed out on Jorginho, but he wouldn’t get in Tottenham’s team ahead of <b>[Mousa]</b> Dembele. Liverpool have spent the money on Fabinho, but I’m not convinced he’s better than Dembele either. It’s near impossible to find world-class players who aren’t on the radar of the other big teams but who would be happy to sit on the bench to improve the squad at Tottenham. I don’t think Tottenham get enough credit for the signings that they do make. Davinson Sanchez was an incredible buy and he will only get better. He was one of the best defenders at the World Cup this summer. Manchester United are having problems at central defender and they will be kicking themselves they signed <b>[Victor]</b> Lindelof while Tottenham got Sanchez last summer. I think he would be in ahead of <b>[Dejan]</b> Lovren at Liverpool as well. Tottenham got him and they haven’t got the credit for it</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool are upstaging arch-rivals Manchester United at the moment]</b> At the moment Klopp is everything that Mourinho isn’t. Liverpool supporters love his honesty and his enthusiasm. He’s ingratiated himself into the club, he’s made himself part of it, which is exactly what Mourinho hasn’t done. Mourinho has been a more successful manager and that’s ultimately what counts. But one of the most worrying things about Mourinho is the body language and the lack of fight. It’s very unlike any other Manchester United team, any Mourinho team to be honest. And I don’t see how he is going to be able to turn it around that quickly, not unless there’s a drastic change in his mentality. I don’t see that happening.<br /><br />This is a good time for us. The club have given themselves a really good opportunity by strengthening the squad and creating competition for places. I’m not sure they’ll beat City; if I’m honest, I think the gap is too big to bridge in one summer - but they’ll be challengers at the very least</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Murphy believes Daniel Sturridge is the best second-choice striker in the Premier League]</b> The biggest bonus for Klopp is Daniel Sturridge. I said in the summer he could save Liverpool money in the transfer market and he’s shown what an impact he can make if he’s patient. Roberto Firmino is Liverpool’s first-choice striker but Sturridge must be the best second-choice in the Premier League.<br /><br />To me, Salah looked sharp <b>[against Chelsea]</b> and I don’t think it’ll be long before he’s back to last season’s form. The game can be about fine margins and from what I saw Salah is getting in the right places, doing the right things. That final little bit is missing but if he continues to play as he’s doing, the golden touch will return</p>

  <p><b>[Daniel Sturridge is the best second striker in the Premier League]</b> If Daniel Sturridge is fit, he’s a good as there is in the Premier League. He’s a natural finisher, he scores all types of goals and what he’s got that most other forwards haven’t is total self-belief. He’s so capable. He’s a match-winner and a sensational player. For me, he’s the best second striker in the Premier League by a mile. Gabriel Jesus has dipped a bit and you could argue Marcus Rashford maybe, but he’s not as naturally gifted a goalscorer as Sturridge in the box. If Liverpool can keep Sturridge fit and keep him happy, by giving him plenty of minutes off the bench and get him starting in certain games in the league and cups, he could be the difference. He’ll get 20 goals this season if he gets the games. He’s got 67 goals in 140 games for Liverpool - there are not many strikers with a better strike rate, and he’s not first choice! You shouldn’t really be sitting on the bench anywhere with that strike rate. But if they keep using him in the way they are, with how fit and hungry he looks, Liverpool are going to be there or thereabouts. He could well be the difference for Liverpool <b>[in the title race]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool now boast the special back four required to have them challenging for major honours over the next five years]</b> They look very comfortable defending now. That back five is now looking like a really balanced unit. With their age and with a really good keeper, for the next five years this could be the reason why Liverpool compete on all fronts competitively. The back four have coped with an Arsenal side full of confidence, pace, energy, momentum, <b>[Pierre-Emerick]</b> Aubameyang, <b>[Alexandre]</b> Lacazette. This looks a special back four.<br /><br />Trent Alexander-Arnold, he’s young, he’s learning. Against the best players he sometimes has a problem. But his passing, his crossing and his calmness going forwards is brilliant. Gomez for me, I saw at full-back and I wasn’t convinced but he’s physically perfect. Van Dijk has got to be one of the best in the world, he’s absolutely awesome in every part of his game. And Robertson, he can play going forward, energy, tenacity but he can defend as well and he wants to defend.</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Eriksen would jump at the chance to leave Tottenham for Barcelona or Real Madrid]</b> I think Eriksen could well be looking to move on from Tottenham to join the likes of Real Madrid or Barcelona, I think he is a player that could have his head turned and would jump at the chance to go. The problem for him is that I’m not sure he would get the playing time at a top European club. He’s a creative player who has performed very well for the last couple of years, but I don’t see him getting in at Barcelona ahead of the likes of <b>[Philippe]</b> Coutinho.<br /><br />I hope Tottenham are able to keep Vertonghen and Alderweireld. They’re both top-drawer players who are potentially the best central defensive partnership in the Premier League. Neither player has won a bunch of trophies in their career and this would probably be their last big contract in their career. They could be looking to move on to either win silverware or set themselves up financially. It would be a big statement of intent if Tottenham were able to sign Vertonghen and Alderweireld to new deals<br /><br />Lloris is a tremendous goalkeeper and I’m not worried by his start to the season. He’s made a few costly mistakes, but every player goes through stages like this during their career. I think he’s had too much unfair criticism this season. He’s just won the World Cup and there’s no doubting his ability as either a goalkeeper or a captain. Lloris is a priority for Tottenham to keep happy as long as possible<br /><br />I think Frenkie De Jong would be a good signing for Tottenham and he would definitely bring a new dimension to the squad. I think good recruitment creates a manager’s success and bad recruitment gets the manager a sack. Pochettino’s recruitment has been fantastic and I would trust him to improve the side. De Jong might be similar to Lucas Moura in the sense it could take him a while to become familiar with the Premier League, but now he’s a near guaranteed starter making a big difference in the big games</p>

  <p><b>[Adrien Rabiot is a quality footballer]</b> Rabiot is a quality footballer who is technically very good and I wouldn’t be surprised if we see him in a Liverpool shirt next season. It’s potentially the one area that Liverpool are missing since <b>[Philippe]</b> Coutinho went to Barcelona and he is a very attractive proposition on a free transfer. Klopp might feel he offers something different to what we can offer in midfield at the moment so it certainly wouldn’t be a bad addition. The question marks would be whether he is athletic and tenacious enough to fit Klopp’s style of play at Liverpool. He is more of a <b>[Adam]</b> Lallana mould player who has quick feet and is creative on the ball, but he has had limited opportunities as a result. It remains to be seen if Rabiot would be a starter at Liverpool unless they changed to a Plan B.<br /><br />I think Liverpool will look to sell Lallana and Sturridge this summer. It’s difficult because you need a competitive squad that offers a Plan B and they’re quality players, but they’ve been severely hampered by injuries and I just can’t see them getting enough games. They will need replacing though and that is the balancing act of keeping a big squad happy when only 11 players can get on the pitch. I don’t think <b>[Jordan]</b> Henderson falls into that category though, who has also had his share of injury problems. I think Henderson is somebody who’s very reliable, very disciplined, very athletic and very good at leading others. He’s very good at pressing and the tenacious part of the game where he gets around and breaks up play. Henderson won’t be worrying about his place</p>

  <p><b>[Coutinho would never be welcomed back]</b> Coutinho would never be welcomed back at Liverpool. It hasn’t worked out for him at Barcelona, but he made his bed by declaring how much he wanted to leave and now he has to sleep in it. I think even if Liverpool thought it was something they wanted, the fans would make it perfectly clear it wasn’t acceptable and would force them to pull the plug. The fans didn’t necessarily begrudge him his move to Barcelona, but he left himself no way to come back<br /><br />I don’t see Salah being remotely tempted to leave Liverpool and the Premier League. I’ve seen reports that Juventus are interested, but that’s not going to happen. The Premier League is far more competitive and stimulating than Serie A and Liverpool are more capable of winning the Champions League than Juventus. Salah is a player who will always now be linked with Europe’s biggest teams, but he is happy at Liverpool and the fans love him. He’s playing the best football of his career at Liverpool. I don’t think it would ever be a Coutinho style situation, where he always wanted to play for Barcelona and forced through a move</p>

I think it is always best to have one and they don’t have one that you can hang your hat on at the moment in that role. But Liverpool are one point behind City now after finishing 19 points behind them last season. So they are competing with them and nobody gave them a shout of the title at this stage of the season.</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah has ‘previous’ when it comes to going to ground]</b> I think it was a pen. The defender has got to hold his hands up and say he was too tight and was grabbing him to too long. If you take away Salah’s previous, I don’t think there are too many strikers on the planet who wouldn’t have ended up on the floor with the amount of contact that was made. Grabbing a forward continually for that amount of time is always going to end up in a penalty. The problem is with Salah’s previous. The fact is he does go down too easily at times, and he’s not on his own by the way. If I’m honest, I don’t think he had to go down, but if he hasn’t, he would never have got a penalty. He was being grabbed so much that inevitably you’re going to go over. It was silly from the defender, who had a good game until then and Cardiff put in a spirited display. But it didn’t really affect the game</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool are better equipped to deal with Lionel Messi than Manchester United]</b> I don’t want to tempt fate but I think Liverpool are better equipped to deal with Lionel Messi than Manchester United were at the Nou Camp. They have to be concerned about Barcelona’s wizard, of course, but not obsessively so. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if Jurgen Klopp spends as much time working out how to deal with the runs from Jordi Alba at left-back. If Alba and Philippe Coutinho are allowed to go two-against-one with <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> isolated, that does spell danger for Liverpool.<br /><br />Stopping Messi isn’t simple but if you’re looking for a midfield three to do the job, Jordan Henderson, Fabinho and Gino Wijnaldum would be near the top of the list. All of them are what I’d call proper midfielders in that they have natural defensive instincts. They sniff out potential trouble ahead of time; which player needs marking, what space needs condensing.<br /><br />Paul Pogba has his qualities but I feel he’s more reactive than proactive defensively. Messi scored twice when United were beaten 3-0 in Spain and though both of his goals could be put down to individual errors, Barcelona were given space to penetrate in the final third that Liverpool won’t allow. Even if Klopp can’t name his favoured three, he has other options in Naby Keita and James Milner, who have the athleticism and positional sense to deal with threats.<br /><br />Even with someone of Messi’s genius, the biggest element for a midfield trying to protect their goal is the distances between you. Instead of concentrating on the ability of one opponent, ensure you aren’t too spread out when Barcelona have the ball. That’s why I believe Liverpool should play their normal game. They have an excellent defensive record for a reason and Virgil van Dijk will be constantly chatting to his team-mates, telling them if Messi is coming as a live threat</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Murphy considers deploying <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> as a midfielder]</b> Trent is becoming a real threat. His crossing is so consistently good, it’s such a weapon. He is consistently putting the ball in ridiculously dangerous areas. At the moment with our <b>[England’s]</b> lack of creativity in the middle of the park, I think we have to get this lad in the team constantly. I’m not saying we should be relying on a 20-year-old, but when he’s fit, when he’s flying and he’s confident, he has to play. We did so well in the World Cup as <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> stuck at the three at the back, but now he’s changed to a four and he’s probably got his reasons. But if you play a four with England, what you’re doing is restricting Trent a little bit. So then how do you get the best out of him? I think it’s a bit further up and giving him that freedom</p>

Would we be talking about him more and putting him on a higher pedestal if he played for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or Man United?<br /><br />I think he’s been part of the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> evolution where a lot of people have linked that to money. You are going to be a striker who scores goals if you are in a team who has all the best players, that flippant view. It doesn’t matter what team you are in or how good the players are, scoring goals is an art form. I think we have taken him for granted. Can we put him in the same breath as the likes of Henry or <a href="alan-shearer.html">Shearer</a>?<br /><br />Henry and <a href="alan-shearer.html">Shearer</a>, probably two of the best examples, the two greatest strikers we’ve seen in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, I think, they had the ability to lift the team on their own. They were the talisman for their teams. They grabbed games by the scruff of the neck when no one else in the team was. I know Henry became embroiled in a wonderful <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> team but he was still their main man. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> without Henry were never as good. Do opposing fans think <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> is up there with the likes of those? Or am I right that we don’t give him the credit he’s deserved?<br /><br />There’s always a bit of jealously where a club buys success, if you like, spends millions and millions on players to make them better. You are always going to get fans who have a degree of jealously around that. That’s part of life. Therefore is there a consequence of that for players who are bought and are brilliant.<br /><br />Has <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> been in amongst a group of wonderful players and team rather than making that team wonderful? Henry was the complete player in every respect and the best I’ve ever seen in terms of strikers because he could get goals from anywhere but he could also drop deep and kill you with his dribbles, skills and power. That’s no belittling <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> or <a href="alan-shearer.html">Shearer</a> but for me, he’s the best</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Murphy says <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> has become the complete midfielder]</b> It has not always been plain sailing for Henderson at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, and I think he suffered at first from being compared to <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> - which was unfair. That was an easy thing to say when he signed aged 20 in 2011, because he was a young England midfielder, but he was not like <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a>, because no-one is. It was always going to be impossible for him to live up to that. As a player he is the best he can be, but he will never be able to do the things that <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a> did. Playing alongside <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a> at first was not very helpful because when you are around one of the best midfielders there has ever been, you are never going to look as good as him. It is only since <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a> left in 2015, and the team started evolving under <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, that people have been able to see Henderson’s own qualities. At 29, he has grown into a complete midfielder, and is a fantastic example of someone making the absolute maximum out of their ability<br /><br />He used to get criticised for making too many sideways passes but it was not about direction, it is called playing safe. A lot of midfielders do that when they are trying to establish themselves in a team, or keep their place, because giving the ball away is the worst thing they can do. Henderson does not have to worry about his place anymore, because he plays such a vital role in this <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> side - well, not just one actually.<br /><br />One of the biggest compliments you could pay him is that he nailed down the holding midfielder position and became pivotal there for a while. Then, with <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a>’s emergence, he adapted back to being more of a box-to-box player.<br /><br />While the Brazilian has been injured in the past few weeks, he has gone back to his old position and it has not affected <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> at all. His versatility is really important for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> but he does not just fill a gap - he brings something to every position he plays. He fits perfectly into this <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team and the way they play, and it is the same with England. If he is fit, he will start every game at Euro 2020, because it is not just <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> who appreciates him.<br /><br />Whatever Henderson’s numbers are, ultimately he captained the champions of Europe last season and is leading a team that are breaking all sorts of records this time around. I think that says more about him than any statistic ever could</p>

Protect your players, I understand that; you’ve got a big squad, you’ve got good youngsters, rotate the team - no problem. But I think he should be there. He should be at the game. I don’t think there’s any reason for him not to be there<br /><br />Wherever he’s flying to, whatever holiday he’s got with or without the players, whether they’re going away together or he’s given the players time off, he is the manager. He’s not running round the pitch every three days, he’s just walking about the training pitch and in the dugout. As the manager, the impact of being there for those younger lads who play on the day is massive.<br /><br />I’m telling you it would make a difference to their performance. I know as a young player, when the first-team manager comes to watch you, even at a training session, the tempo goes from seven to ten. A part of his thinking may be that he doesn’t want to overshadow Critchely and what he’s doing with those young players … but I don’t think it would. So wherever <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is, this is at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> so he can get to the game.<br /><br />I completely understood the Club World Cup; it was nearly impossible for him to be at both games in 24 hours, but this is a bit different. I’ve not got a problem with what team they put out, but I think he should be there and I think it would help the players if he’s there. And I’ve got a feeling he will be there.

The final piece in the jigsaw is a world-class centre-forward. We know it and they know it. It is why they tried to sign <a href="erling-haland.html">Erling Haaland</a> in January. If <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> is available, even for a record price, United would be mad not to look a gift horse in the mouth<br /><br />They are the richest club in England. If there is ever a time to use that financial power, it would be to prise the best striker in the country away from <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. If United have the money, they should spend it on <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a>. He can turn them from a team with potential, into genuine challengers</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> star Danny Murphy says he regrets leaving the club before they won the Champions League under <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafael Benitez</a>]</b> I feel very blessed. I feel lucky to have played for the team I supported and loved growing up. It’s all I ever wanted to do. To win trophies playing for the team you love as well is very surreal. It’s probably only when you look back now in hindsight that you realise the enormity of it. The only thing for me of course is that the year I left they won the Champions League. Maybe I could have stayed and fought a bit harder under Rafa. It was a difficult decision for me at the time because I was so used to playing and I loved playing. He made it clear to me more than once that that wasn’t going to be the case, so I had a difficult choice to make in a short period. People say they have no regrets. Well, I do, I regret not staying, but life is what it is. It was a wonderful seven years for me and being part of that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> family is still very special to me</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Murphy says <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> is the biggest miss for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s midfield when he is not available]</b> I appreciate them all, to be honest, in terms of their ability to fit in. Very rarely do you watch <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> play and think, ‘Oh, they’re weaker today. Jordan is probably the one biggest miss when he doesn’t play, partly because of his leadership as well. I’m a big fan of <a href="gini-wijnaldum.html">Wijnaldum</a>. He’s very good on the ball and in tight positions. Very, very often he is one of those players who wriggles out of a little tight situation and gets <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> on the front foot. The one thing more about that midfield I say when I talk about it is every single one of them - I call them ‘proper midfielders’ - does all the bits needed. They still go forward and press and try to get in the box. Ox is probably one of the best at it when he plays more often. But they all do their defensive work - they all track runners, they all fill space, they all spot danger. And I don’t think that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> system would work if one of the three didn’t have the discipline to do that. They all know the job<br /><br />I think the team has evolved from when <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> first started. It has got a bit more wisdom in it, in terms of when to take your foot off the gas from pressing, when to see out a game, when to drop off sometimes. They are much more tactically aware. Yes, they are a high-press team with great energy and the fitness levels are unbelievable, and <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s coaching staff and sports science team deserve great credit for that. But when people talk about <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> this season not hitting the heights of maybe last season or the one before in terms of sometimes steamrollering teams and loads of free-flowing football, it’s because they’re managing games better. It’s because they don’t necessarily, when they go a goal up away from home or two up, go all-out, 100 per cent press, hell for leather. I think the biggest thing with the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> side at the moment is the hunger and the discipline</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Murphy says <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a>’s great but won’t win Ballon d’Or]</b> I think <a href="cafu.html">Cafu</a> could’ve praised him without talking about the Ballon d’Or. The Ballon d’Or is generally for the goalscorers and the superstars isn’t it? But he is a wonderful, wonderful talent <b>[…]</b> He won’t win the Ballon d’Or. I think even in a midfield position it’s difficult. Can he score goals from midfield and bend in free-kicks and open defences with his passing? Yes. But will that ever be enough to be enough to win a Ballon d’Or? <b>[Luka]</b> <a href="luka-modric.html">Modric</a> won one, didn’t he? Yeah, it’s possible, you never say never, but I don’t think so. There’s that much talent around at the moment, defensively you think a centre-half like <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> would probably be one of the few who has the capability. But he’s on a different level because he’s an out-and-out defender</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Murphy says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will need to dip into the transfer market for additional firepower when the transfer window re-opens]</b> I do think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> could do with some additional firepower, especially as next season there will be the Africa Cup of Nations. That’s going to mean that both <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> and Mane are going to be missing for a chunk, a big chunk of the games. I would be amazed if when the window does open, or when the season ends, that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> don’t sign someone in attacking areas. But you also have to remember that for two years they got to the Champions League final and got 97 points last season and are going to win it this year, so who are we to argue with how he’s <b>[<a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>]</b> balanced his squad<br /><br />I think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will inevitably win the title. The fact that everybody wants it done so quickly, or the desire of everyone associated with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> wanting to get it done quickly is obvious because it’s been 30 years. It’s going to happen. You’d think they will beat Palace on Wednesday and it makes the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> away game <b>[on July 2]</b> really interesting because Pep and those <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> players are not going to want <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> winning it there</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Murphy says <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> has become a mix of <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> and Kevin De Bruyne]</b> Not known anyone with his quality from wide areas since <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>. It’s like having Kevin De Bruyne at right-back. Could play there for the next 10 years but he’s good enough to also switch into midfield. A local lad, he has the chilled personality to cope with the extra pressure.<br /><br />The best <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> teams have always included at least one Scot.

He’s been <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s match-winner on so many occasions, deceptively strong and good in the air besides his obvious pace and shooting ability - but he is great going the other way too.
