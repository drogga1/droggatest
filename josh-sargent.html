  <p><b>[Josh Sargent told that helping the Stars and Stripes stay deep into the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> U-20 World Cup remains his focus, despite four goals to his name at Korea Republic 2017]</b> Obviously it’s a great feeling, but I’m not here to focus on myself, I’m here to help the team win games. Everyone put their heart on the line and gave everything they had and you can see that in the result. It was a great win</p>

  <p><b>[USA youth international Josh Sargent has agreed to sign with Werder Bremen upon turning 18 in February]</b> My full concentration is first and foremost on the World Cup and the time I have left in Missouri. But I am really looking forward to next year and the new challenge in Bremen. Werder made a huge effort with me and they have always shown in the past that they give young players like myself an ideal introduction to professional football. That meant that my decision to continue my career in Bremen was not a hard one to make.</p>

  <p><b>[After U20 World Cup success, USA striker Josh Sargent eyes U17 World Cup golden boot]</b> It’s a very good feeling. It was a great start for the team to be able to win 3-0. It was a good feeling also to get the first goal. I am very excited to see how the rest of the tournament pans out.<br /><br />I still think its very challenging if its U17 or U20 <b>[levels]</b> because it’s still the World Cup with the best teams in the world. So it’s still hard for me. It would actually be a very big plus to get the golden boot but right now I’m just trying to focus on winning games for the team<br /><br />India has been a very good host country. Everybody has got used to the place. There’s good food, lots of love. It’s been fun. I think our team’s done pretty well to get used to the weather <b>[in India]</b> but the fans <b>[Indians]</b> presented a pretty big challenge for us. We’re thankful to have pulled through <b>[in the end]</b> in the opening game. They <b>[India]</b> were very hard working, they presented a lot of challenges for us. I think the game could have gone either way but in the end, we are lucky to have won<br /><br />He <b>[Tim Weah]</b> is a very good teammate. I love playing with him and he is a very unselfish player and I love that about him. But I think if he gets a chance to score a goal he will definitely take it. I met him first in a couple of U14 national team camps a very long time ago. He was in an age group below me. I think it has helped him a lot, all the U13 work. He is a very hard worker<br /><br />There were a lot of teams interested in me after the U20 World Cup. I thought Werder Bremen is just a very good fit for me and I felt at home. So I decided to sign for them. I need to get into the first team and then go from there</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT youngsters Tim Weah and Josh Sargent shake off nerves to score in friendly romp over Bolivia]</b> I was very nervous, to be honest. It was my first professional game ever. It was a pretty big deal to me and I was proud to net one.<br /><br />Obviously everybody wants to be the star, the big talent or whatever. I try not to pay attention to it really. People can say whatever they want, but, at the end of the day, I’m going to just put my head down and work hard</p>

  <p><b>[Josh Sargent and young USMNT looking to ‘make America proud’]</b> I mean we’re all coming in here in the same position. We’re all young kids hungry for a chance and to prove that we can compete with this guys. We want to prove we deserve a spot on this team. We’re all hungry to play as hard as we can to make America proud.<br /><br />We go into the games with a clear head. If you go into the games with a lot on your mind, it’s never healthy for your game and for your personal growth whenever you want to try new ideas. We don’t know what the situation is with the coaching staff, or how the future is going to look, but we’ll go with the flow and take what’s thrown at us. We don’t know if the coach is going to be here after. If he is, then everyone is comfortable with him. If not, we’ll have to adjust and see where the next coach takes us. Right now, we’re just thinking about these games coming up next against France<br /><br /><b>[The match against a France squad]</b> It’s going to be a really tough challenge for us. We’re going to come out like it’s any other game and compete as hard as we can</p>

  <p><b>[United States forward Josh Sargent admitted he was disappointed after being left off the roster for the Concacaf Gold Cup this summer]</b> It was disappointing at first not to be at the Gold Cup. I could have learned a lot there and needed a while to get my ahead around not being called up. Now I see the positives. I am able to take full part in Werder’s pre-season preparations. Obviously the starting line-up is my goal<br /><br /><b>[But after making his debut last December, and finishing the 2018-19 season with two goals in 10 league appearances, the teen is hoping there’ll be more of the same over the coming months]</b> I’m happy with how things have been going and with my goal (against Cologne). We’ve been working hard on things in training, and I’m possibly in the form of my life! It’s only been a journey in Germany so far for me. Hopefully it can continue. I want to help us at least qualify for the Europa League</p>

  <p><b>[Josh Sargent is hoping improved tactical understanding and a stronger body can lead to a breakthrough campaign with Werder Bremen this season]</b> I’m now more familiar with how the coach wants to play. The coach has sometimes told me after a good finish that you cannot teach it. I think I have a nose for goal in the box. Scoring goals is my favorite pastime, it happens instinctively. That’s why playing as a center forward suits me best, but I play wherever the coach wants me to. The main thing is that I have more playing time. I hope to make my breakthrough soon. If it happens in the new season, it would be great<br /><br /><b>[He credits the club’s fitness team in helping him become stronger, but not hinder him going forward]</b> I feel really good right now, especially compared to my first year at Werder. I’ve learned a lot in this time, also about my body. I worked hard with Werder’s fitness coaches. It was about becoming stronger and stronger - but not too much; after all, I still want to be able to walk! I am very happy here at Werder at the moment. Now it’s about getting more playing time. I’ll do anything for it because that’s my goal for the new season: more goals and more games<br /><br /><b>[Milot Rashica, Johannes Eggestein, Martin Harnik, <a href="claudio-pizarro.html">Claudio Pizarro</a>, Niclas Fullkrug and Luc Ihorst are all in the mix for playing time up front and Sargent knows that he could face an uphill battle to see the field]</b> There are again a lot of players in the squad for the same positions, I do not know if my chances have increased. I can only influence what I give and do. I work as hard as I can to convince the coach to let me play more often<br /><br /><b>[And Sargent is grateful for the help the 40-year-old Peru international <a href="claudio-pizarro.html">Claudio Pizarro</a> has provided him during his time]</b> Claudio is a great help on and off the pitch. He’s great at communicating with the whole team. On the pitch, he helps me with tips on many little things. Passing, movement… he is also very important in terms of mentality</p>

  <p><b>[Josh Sargent believes that the U.S. men’s national team is destined for big things in the future]</b> It’s very cool; we’re all young and we have so much promise. It’s kind of a dream situation. You know, we can all grow up and develop together and see where it goes<br /><br />I talk to Gio a lot. We see each other after games, we’ve played each other twice. And he’s a cool guy. We’re good friends already. We’re all talking to each other. And I think we all know how good we could potentially be.<br /><br />Younger U.S. players are now pushing themselves to come over to Europe and to try to really challenge themselves and put themselves in an environment where they feel like they’re gonna get better and better each day. So I think when players are doing that and able to take the risk, it’s going to grow them as not only a person but as a player</p>
