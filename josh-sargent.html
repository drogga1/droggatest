  <p><b>[Josh Sargent told that helping the Stars and Stripes stay deep into the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> U-20 World Cup remains his focus, despite four goals to his name at Korea Republic 2017]</b> Obviously it’s a great feeling, but I’m not here to focus on myself, I’m here to help the team win games. Everyone put their heart on the line and gave everything they had and you can see that in the result. It was a great win</p>

  <p><b>[United States forward Josh Sargent admitted he was disappointed after being left off the roster for the Concacaf Gold Cup this summer]</b> It was disappointing at first not to be at the Gold Cup. I could have learned a lot there and needed a while to get my ahead around not being called up. Now I see the positives. I am able to take full part in Werder’s pre-season preparations. Obviously the starting line-up is my goal<br /><br /><b>[But after making his debut last December, and finishing the 2018-19 season with two goals in 10 league appearances, the teen is hoping there’ll be more of the same over the coming months]</b> I’m happy with how things have been going and with my goal (against Cologne). We’ve been working hard on things in training, and I’m possibly in the form of my life! It’s only been a journey in Germany so far for me. Hopefully it can continue. I want to help us at least qualify for the Europa League</p>

  <p><b>[Josh Sargent is hoping improved tactical understanding and a stronger body can lead to a breakthrough campaign with Werder Bremen this season]</b> I’m now more familiar with how the coach wants to play. The coach has sometimes told me after a good finish that you cannot teach it. I think I have a nose for goal in the box. Scoring goals is my favorite pastime, it happens instinctively. That’s why playing as a center forward suits me best, but I play wherever the coach wants me to. The main thing is that I have more playing time. I hope to make my breakthrough soon. If it happens in the new season, it would be great<br /><br /><b>[He credits the club’s fitness team in helping him become stronger, but not hinder him going forward]</b> I feel really good right now, especially compared to my first year at Werder. I’ve learned a lot in this time, also about my body. I worked hard with Werder’s fitness coaches. It was about becoming stronger and stronger - but not too much; after all, I still want to be able to walk! I am very happy here at Werder at the moment. Now it’s about getting more playing time. I’ll do anything for it because that’s my goal for the new season: more goals and more games<br /><br /><b>[Milot Rashica, Johannes Eggestein, Martin Harnik, Claudio Pizarro, Niclas Fullkrug and Luc Ihorst are all in the mix for playing time up front and Sargent knows that he could face an uphill battle to see the field]</b> There are again a lot of players in the squad for the same positions, I do not know if my chances have increased. I can only influence what I give and do. I work as hard as I can to convince the coach to let me play more often<br /><br /><b>[And Sargent is grateful for the help the 40-year-old Peru international Claudio Pizarro has provided him during his time]</b> Claudio is a great help on and off the pitch. He’s great at communicating with the whole team. On the pitch, he helps me with tips on many little things. Passing, movement… he is also very important in terms of mentality</p>

  <p><b>[Josh Sargent believes that the U.S. men’s national team is destined for big things in the future]</b> It’s very cool; we’re all young and we have so much promise. It’s kind of a dream situation. You know, we can all grow up and develop together and see where it goes<br /><br />I talk to Gio a lot. We see each other after games, we’ve played each other twice. And he’s a cool guy. We’re good friends already. We’re all talking to each other. And I think we all know how good we could potentially be.<br /><br />Younger U.S. players are now pushing themselves to come over to Europe and to try to really challenge themselves and put themselves in an environment where they feel like they’re gonna get better and better each day. So I think when players are doing that and able to take the risk, it’s going to grow them as not only a person but as a player</p>
