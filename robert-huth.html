  <p><b>[Harry Maguire will be happy not to have signed for Manchester United]</b> Looking back, he’ll be happy not to have signed for Man United with all the turmoil that’s gone on. I think he’s got another year or two at Leicester, another 100 games for them, and he can really establish himself as one of the top guys in the league. Then the sky’s the limit for him if he wants to go to Man United, Man City, Chelsea.<br /><br />That’s sport. I’ve done it when I’ve moved around to different clubs. It is what it is. We always get on. We have the same goal, to try to get as many points for the team as we can. Maguire’s brilliant. He really stepped in from day one. Straight away, you felt he was one of the Leicester players. He’s performed brilliantly from the start to now. It’s almost gone the reverse <b>[with centre-backs]</b>, you need to be a good ball player before you can defend, but Harry’s got both sides of that game. He can step in or pass and break a line, but ultimately, when the ball goes into his box, he’s the guy to clear it and do the defensive part of it</p>

  <p><b>[Football fans all over the world will be tuning in as Barcelona and Real Madrid meet for the first Clasico of the season next week]</b> I don’t even watch Barca v Madrid any more. It’s shit - 20 guys surrounding the referee, some holding their face. El Clasico? Off.<br /><br />What I can’t get is how, afterwards, you can face people. As a man. I find the whole problem embarrassing. Diving, I can understand. There’s no difference between diving and me grabbing someone. You’re bending the rules but pretending to be hurt - it just goes against any sport. The weakness of it all pisses me off. I can’t think of another sport where it’s acceptable. You listen to it, to Gary Neville and all the others <b>[saying]</b>: ‘He had the right to go down.’ No. There is no right to go down. We spent the past 15, 16 years with nutrition, gym work, making footballers the strongest they can be. Are you telling me a <b>[small touch]</b> is enough to make one go down?</p>

  <p><b>[Former Leicester City defender Robert Huth believes Chelsea midfielder N’Golo Kante is the most influential player in world football]</b> He’s the best player I played with. Of course in skill Hazard is better, gets people off their feet. Ronaldo, Messi… I get all that, I really do. But in terms of impact on a game it’s Kante. I get annoyed. ‘Oh he just wins the ball back’. Which he does. But watch him. He reads three passes ahead. He’ll run 15 yards, then have a burst of acceleration to take the ball off somebody’s feet in a position where he has 30 yards of pitch to drive into. His brain works completely different to other footballers.<br /><br />Our longest conversation was, ‘Good morning’. When I first met him I thought he was rude.<br /><br />In the canteen at Leicester I say hello and he just goes ‘Mmm.’ But you learn he’s not being rude, he’s being quiet, embarrassed how good he is. You can see it now when he scores a goal - he’s embarrassed. It’s no coincidence we won the league, then Chelsea won it, then France won the World Cup. He’ll change any team, he is that good and that smart a footballer</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho has been labeled an ‘amazing’ manager]</b> You’d heard him, you’d seen him win the Champions League, so you thought, ‘He knows what he’s doing’ but then he just stepped in, he owned the room, he got players on board straight away. For two years that team was amazing. His attention to detail and preparation . . . I’d never seen anything like that. We got notepads before games with statistics: how many times the right-back passes to the centre-back. There were preparation sheets about the opposition. Weaknesses, strengths, set-pieces. In training, every exercise was timed. There were ball boys. I completely bought into whatever Mourinho said. If he said, ‘Play left wing,’ you’d say, ‘Give me the shirt’.<br /><br /><b>[Huth also hailed N’Golo Kante]</b> He’s the best player I played with. Of course in skill Hazard is better, gets people off their feet. Ronaldo, Messi… I get all that, I really do. But in terms of impact on a game it’s Kante. I get annoyed. ‘Oh he just wins the ball back’. Which he does. But watch him. He reads three passes ahead.

  <p><b>[Robert Huth has defended Leicester City’s decision to sack Claude Puel]</b> I personally found Claude Puel really hard work. We’ve obviously had managers before who had a really energetic and positive vibe, getting you up for games and when he came in, it was pretty much the opposite. We had a group that played high energy football for 90 minutes and he pretty much changed it. It was almost working against the players in the sense that, you know ‘you guys played like that for three years but I’m going to do it this way’ and that didn’t quite work.<br /><br />If things aren’t going well you need someone to point that out and be brutally honest with the players. Quite frankly, I don’t believe he was the guy to do that because if you let the players underperform as they have, you’re setting them up for failure. It was mainly down to his assistants, the staff that were there before, they set the tone and tried to get the players up for games. He didn’t really do it when I was there, it was always up to the backroom staff</p>

  <p><b>[N’Golo Kante is being wasted at Chelsea]</b> I tend to agree with most people that he has been playing in another position. We all know what he can do when he plays in his position. In my view, he’s the best player in that position. It makes no sense for him to be playing on the right.<br /><br /><b>[On Danny Drinkwater]</b> I’m sure he’s disappointed he hasn’t played but that’s the nature when you go to a big club. A new manager came in and he’s played with Kante. Then another new manager comes in and it’s always difficult because sometimes the new manager doesn’t like the way he plays or wants to bring in his own players. I think that has been the case for Danny. I think it’ll be a number of things. I’m sure he wants to go out and play but when you’ve got such high value on you it’s difficult for other clubs to take over. I’m sure if at the end of this season if things don’t improve, he’ll be looking to go somewhere else</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Maguire was been warned that leaving Leicester for Manchester United would be live or die]</b> If you’re Leicester and you’re getting that money offered, it’s a tough one to say no to. I’d like to see him at Leicester, but Manchester United is difficult to turn down - both financially and with the potential to win stuff. With <b>[Brendan Rodgers]</b>, for the next couple of years, I think the club is only going to go one way. Winning the title is not on the cards, but I’d say to him play another 100 games for Leicester. Become a proper, proper centre-back with games under your belt and everyone knows you’re the big dog in town. When you then move to a big club, it becomes a lot easier<br /><br />If he does move to a bigger club - a top six or top four club - then ultimately it’s a live or die moment. Mistakes don’t really happen at the top teams. You do have mistakes, obviously, but they’re very limited. You look at Virgil van Dijk and he’s a monster of a player who just doesn’t make mistakes. Look at the guys from Tottenham. 36 out of 38 games they perform, they’re like an 8 each week. They don’t give goals away. At Leicester, you can give a few goals away and it won’t be as scrutinised as at a top team. That’s my argument. If he goes to Man Utd - or any other top team - and makes a mistake then it gets highlighted quicker. That can then hinder your performance and willingness to learn from mistakes. At Leicester they’re going to go: ‘OK let’s learn from it’. Just get another 60 or 100 games for Leicester where you can iron out a couple of positional things or stuff that could potentially go wrong. Iron it out completely. Then, when you’re 28, you’ve got four or five years to play at a top, top club</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea have been told they would be crazy to sanction the £100 million ($131m) sale of Eden Hazard]</b> There is no better challenge than at Real Madrid. But if you were Chelsea you would be crazy to sell Eden Hazard now with the transfer ban over your head. What’s the point in selling him for £100m if you can’t buy anyone? On the pitch, you are losing your main player</p>
