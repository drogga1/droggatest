<blockquote>
  <p><b>[JS Suresnes coach Pierre Ville stood by Kante while he searched for a professional club]</b> We talk, but less since he’s at Chelsea, because he’s surrounded by people. But he has called me, yes, for advice. He listens very much to what can be said about his game. But today there is nothing more to say to him as he is at the highest level. I know that as soon as he has the time, he will come back to Suresnes. He left only five to six years ago and he came back just before Euro 2016 to see his buddies.<br /><br />It is because of his size that he is also strong. At home, he was really tiny, <b>[so]</b> he developed his intelligence and his physical abilities. When you play like that from 10 to 18 years old, you are stronger. His size is an enormous strength. He has always played in the midfield with us, because he has the qualities to play at this position, but he was very discreet in the game. He always played for his team, without doing more. That’s why he can go even higher. He does not think that he is better than before, he just thought of getting up to the next level and that is what he has done by moving to Chelsea</p>
