  <p><b>[Fabian Johnson signs contract extension with Borussia Monchengladbach]</b> It’s wonderful to be able to carry on playing for this great club. After joining Gladbach from Hoffenheim three years ago, one of my goals was to further develop myself and another was to play on the European stage - I have achieved both of them here. I’m very much looking forward to continuing along this path together with Borussia</p>

  <p><b>[The 29-year-old has been quoted as saying he was considering retiring from international duty after the 2018 World Cup]</b> I still really enjoy playing for my country, but there is an agreement with head coach <a href="bruce-arena.html">Bruce Arena</a> that I will only play in the more important matches.</p>
