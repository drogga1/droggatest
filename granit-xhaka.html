  <p><b>[Xhaka launches Arsenal defence after Milan victory]</b> A lot of people spoke about us from the outside, but nobody knows what is inside the team. We showed togetherness today, we showed spirit and a lot of character. Everyone knows that we lost the last four games and that was difficult for us. It was important to be together and to show the people on the outside that we are a team. We showed a good game today.<br /><br />At the start it was a little bit difficult for us, but after that we made it our game and we scored. I think 2-0 here in Milan is a good result for the first leg. Now we want to finish the second leg and to win as well again at home</p>

We know as players if we have good results then nobody speaks about the boss but that is football, that is life, we must accept it going forward<br /><br />Everybody knows his quality, how players he has brought from nothing.

  <p><b>[Granit Xhaka - The story of a proud Albanian whose father was once a political prisoner]</b> As his son, the story is something that touches me very deeply - it is really, really in my heart. To describe my dad properly, you have to appreciate the full depth of it. It’s so tragic. I sometimes ask him: ‘Tell it to me again’, but I still don’t think he has revealed all of it. There have always been silent moments where I’ve felt he has swallowed something and not spilled out the truth. Maybe it was just too much and he wanted to spare his kids all the grief. He was a proud Kosovarian and he thought they had a right to exist. He was standing up for their rights and they were basic democratic rights - necessities, such as being able to vote. It was not only him. There were other people arrested, including his uncle, who had been jailed a number of years earlier. He got 15 years. It was strictly political. My dad was asking: ‘Why aren’t we democrats here? We deserve to be democrats. We deserve to be heard.</p>

Without doubt, I think I’ve taken another step forward. It’s the best I’ve felt at Arsenal since I came to the club and the coach has had an enormous influence. He prepares us all and we have a plan. We know how to do it with the ball and without the ball. We know how and when to stand where.</p>

  <p><b>[Granit Xhaka has insisted Arsenal’s priority this season is to finish in the top four rather than win the Europa League]</b> After Arsene Wenger left a lot of things changed in this club. We are happy with the coach, we improve a lot, we work a lot. It’s a big step if we come back to the Champions League. We want it as well. It’s not easy, we know that, but we keep working. Two times in two years we didn’t play Champions League. A club like Arsenal have to play in the Champions League and we have to show that always on the pitch. We work a lot, changed our identity, you can see that week after week. It’s important that we are there, not so far from the Champions League. Last games we want to take the points and to finish in the top four. If you win Europa League you go straight away to Champions League. But I think Premier League is our first priority to go the Champions League.<br /><br />If you take <b>[a penalty]</b> on 90 minutes, a penalty in the derby you have big balls. Not all players would take this one. We are happy he took the penalty. At this moment you have to leave one player alone because you have a lot to think. He was of course not happy. But we are a team, everyone we lose and we win together. He was unlucky today but he helped us in a few games a lot. So it’s not something big because he doesn’t score</p>

  <p><b>[Granit Xhaka admits Arsenal do not deserve to be talking about top-four finishes in the Premier League]</b> It is not the right moment to think about the top four. We had three big chances. It started with Crystal Palace, then Wednesday against Wolves and finished <b>[against Leicester]</b>. If you don’t take from two away games and one at home three points, you can’t speak about the top four<br /><br />It is difficult to explain why we don’t play like at home and why we don’t take the points. I said this last week. It is a different game away and at home. You can’t play like at home. You have to win the duels, run more than the opponents because the fans are in front of them. All the teams in the Premier League can play football and they can fight. If you don’t take the fight against them it looks like <b>[Sunday]</b>.<br /><br />We fight. It’s not that we don’t fight because if we didn’t fight we wouldn’t go to play. It is difficult to explain. Whenever you lose it is always difficult to find the right words</p>

  <p><b>[Granit Xhaka believes Unai Emery’s past success in the Europa League will count for little]</b> If you have a coach like this you can take a lot of experience from him. But the past is the past and I don’t think it’s so important. We spoke before the game <b>[first leg]</b> about his experience but in the end we had to show it on the pitch<br /><br />It was good to win 3-1, we wanted a clean sheet but we didn’t start well. We showed the big character in this team once more to come back and win against a big team. We had not the best experience last year <b>[in the semi-final]</b>. We played very well here against Atletico but didn’t win. Away games are always difficult against teams like this but 3-1 is a good result and we hope we can score one there, then after we’re in the final<br /><br />If you see the results from the last week in the Premier League of course we are not happy but we still have a chance. Everything isn’t in our hands, what is in our hands is the Europa League. We want to finish our season back in the Champions League</p>

  <p><b>[Xhaka worried away form might ‘kill’ Arsenal as it did last year]</b> It’s so frustrating. Our home form is so good. If we’d won any of the last three league games <b>[losses to Crystal Palace at home, Wolves and Leicester City away]</b> we’d be in the top four. The same thing killed us last year. I just hope it won’t kill us this time. We have to look forward<br /><br />It’s difficult to explain why we don’t take the same points away. We approach every game the same. It could be our mentality. Maybe we have to do things differently. All the teams in the Premier League play football, they can fight and they can run. Against Leicester last week we didn’t show those characteristics. We didn’t have the team spirit we showed, for example, against Valencia<br /><br />To win it again would be a great platform for the boss after only nine months at the club. He has a lot of experience in the Europa League and he can give this to us. But it’s really about is showing it on the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Xhaka out to make Arsenal history]</b> It’s a long time, 25 years. Now we are in the final we want the trophy for the club, for the fans and for us players as well. Every piece of history is nice. If you can be in the history of this amazing club it’s something to make you proud. But first you have to win.<br /><br />Every trophy, every title is important. It’s important if you take the title here and you go to the Champions League. We wanted to be in the Champions League from the Premier League <b>[top four]</b>. But this is the past, we have to look forward now. All the players want a trophy. For a lot of the players it is the first time in a final, but we also have a lot of experience in this team so we hope we are ready for the final<br /><br /><b>[On <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> and Lacazette]</b> They are so important for the team. On the pitch and off the pitch. They work a lot for the team without the ball, they showed that in the last few months and we are very proud to have them in the team. We started not so well <b>[on Thursday night]</b>, but we showed a good mentality. We were compact in defence and scored our goals. There are four <b>[English]</b> teams in the two finals, you can see how strong the league is with four teams in the finals. We can be proud</p>

  <p><b>[Granit Xhaka has stated the club simply cannot afford to miss out on Champions League football for a third season in a row]</b> We have to be in the Champions League. We didn’t play there for two years and we have to be there next season. All the players, the fans, the club - we want to play against the best teams, and the best teams are in the Champions League. We speak about the season - what was good, what was bad, what can happen if we win the Europa League. We had a good season but lost our way a little bit in the last five games. But if you’re in the Europa League final and can take a trophy, get into the Champions League … we’ll take that.<br /><br /><b>[It is a record Xhaka hopes will stand <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in good stead]</b> We don’t speak about it to each other but he (Emery) speaks with us about his own experience and how he won the trophy three times. He would be the first coach if he wins a fourth, so it’s nice if you are alone at the top. If you’re three times in the final in the Europa League you have a lot of experience, you know how you’re feeling, and how the pressure is. Anything else stays within our group. He takes away the pressure, but if you are in a final there is always pressure. The finals show how strong the league is. It is the strongest league in the world, better than Spain. I’ve never played in Spain, but I’ve played in Germany, I’ve played here and I can only say in my experience that it is strong enough, the English league. I don’t speak about the past. I have to speak about the final, we can’t change nothing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, it’s over. What we can change is winning the Europa League and being back in the Champions League</p>

  <p><b>[Granit Xhaka is very proud to have been named <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> captain, despite some questioning that appointment and his role in <a href="arsenal-fc.html">the Gunners</a> side]</b> I’m very proud. It’s made me very happy because when I came here, I had a lot of experience before with the Switzerland national team and I was the captain in Germany as well. When I came here, there were a lot of great players, good personalities, and it was a big step for me to be the captain here as well. Now I’m the official captain here and it makes me very proud to be the captain of this great club<br /><br /><b>[When asked about how his promotion to a prominent position came to pass]</b> The coach asked us to write five names, who we wanted to be the captains. Everything was discreet, so there were no names. You only wrote the five captains. In the end, I think the team, the players and of course the boss, decided who would be the first captain out of the five.<br /><br />Of course it’s important that the other players believe in me and see how I work, how much I work. I’m a guy who wants to take all the players in one boat. We win together, we lose together, we win trophies together or we lose finals together, like in Baku. It’s important that all the players - not only the players who play but the other players as well - are invited into our group to be happy, to speak with us if there are any problems. This is the role of a captain, to be strong and to be in front of the team. I think I’m a guy like this who can be in front of the team during the good times and the bad times</p>

  <p><b>[Granit Xhaka has promised to stay at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and win back respect after being stripped of the captaincy following an ugly altercation with fans]</b> You can be sure that I’ll keep fighting and putting myself out there in every training session. I feel that last week has been dealt with and I’m ready. I’m doing very well again, I’ve trained well this week and am looking forward to my next assignments<br /><br />When my shirt number lit up on the fourth official’s panel and our own fans broke into gleeful jubilation, that hit me very hard and really upset me. It was very hurtful and frustrating. I can’t understand a reaction like that even now, especially the vehemence of it and the extreme hostility directed against me. As far back as I can remember, fans have always been part of my sport. And right from the start I’ve had a lot of respect for the fans’ enthusiasm and the hardships they endure to support us players.<br /><br />Their criticism, when it’s fair, makes you grow as an athlete. And the power and energy that they contribute to the game makes every athlete love football even more. I feel like I’m part of a big football family. But at a time you are already experiencing a lot of hostility and your own football family insults you, it hurts a lot. I don’t mean to say that I can’t take criticism. If the team and I don’t play well, we have to listen and work on it. But insulting and swearing at your own captain will cause upset and a bad atmosphere for the team you are actually supposed to be supporting. That makes no sense to me and weakens the team’s spirit</p>
