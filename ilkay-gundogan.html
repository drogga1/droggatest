  <p><b>[Ilkay Gundogan speaks about the arduous ten-month journey of recovering from a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee]</b> The worst thing for me is seeing the other players. I see them on the training field, when they are in the locker room, when they go up to the meeting before training. I see how they work in the gym, and I am not able to do the same. You know that you are not able to be a full part of the group. That is the most difficult thing: to feel that you are useless, not worth as much as before, not worth as much as the others. To go to that point, and then do the same the next day, and the next day again, and again and again. That is bad for the brain. Rehab is always up and down for the mind and for the body. And there have been points where my mind has said: ‘O.K. I have to go now’</p>

  <p><b>[Ilkay Gundogan believes VAR is taking the emotion out of the game]</b> VAR is changing football not only for the players but also for the spectators and everyone who loves the game. Unfortunately it takes away the main reason why we all love football, and that’s the emotion<br /><br />I’m not a big fan even though we can’t deny that it helps the referee. But the big problem is that even when an incident has been referred to VAR, there is still not a clear judgement. After the games we are still discussing whether it was a goal, a penalty or offside. And I can’t see this changing even with VAR. That is why I don’t think it makes sense, but some people who run the game have decided it is going to help the referee and it’s something we’re just going to have to accept because we can’t change right now. I’m sure it is going to help us in the future but it is also creating a lot of problems and I’m not sure how we can solve it</p>

We could not put that on the pitch today, that is the fact and it hurts. I always feel we can score, especially with the power up front but <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> were very defensive in the last 10, 15 minutes and it was difficult to put in crosses and the spaces were tiny. It was very difficult to play. When you are not able to score the first goal, maybe we get nervous and don’t 100% feel the confidence is there and we have to be patient. The challenge now is to learn from that<br /><br />When you are in front and top of the table, it feels great to look at it. Now it is tougher to look at it, there is quite a gap already and none of us are watching the table now.

  <p><b>[Man City overhauled a seven-point deficit to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> last term, but Gundogan says it is frustrating that they again need other teams to do them favours in the title race and so early in the campaign]</b> We had the same, or a similar situation last year but at a much later stage. It’s quite early in the season and there are still a lot of points to play for, but if we want to speak about <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title, we have to hope <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will drop points. That’s a fact we can’t be happy with and we aren’t obviously. But there is nothing else to do but make it better in the next game, which is our target<br /><br /><b>[Gundogan says they cannot worry about their rivals’ performances and must concentrate on getting their own game right on the pitch]</b> It’s not that easy to take these things and see your biggest rival win all the time, with things that you can’t control. It was no different last year, when they also won a lot of games, as we did. This time we are the side that have struggled quite a bit more and they have continued better. That’s a fact we want to change. Watching their games and situation doesn’t really help us to be honest - we need to fix our situation and drop as few points as possible. We have definitely dropped too many points in the early part of the season. If that’s the case in the next few weeks the gap will be even bigger, so we have to win as much as possible<br /><br /><b>[City were without several key players including Kevin De Bruyne, <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Aymeric Laporte</a>, <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a>, <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a> and <a href="benjamin-mendy.html">Benjamin Mendy</a> for the defeat against <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>, but Gundogan said they cannot use injuries as an excuse]</b> It’s never easy to miss all these players because they all bring a quality which is needed in our team. But in the past we have shown we can resolve these problems, which shows we have enough quality in the squad to get away with it. I hope every player will be back as soon as possible but injuries are part of the game so we have to deal with them, as does every other team. We have to play better, the 11 on the pitch, and do much better than we did on Sunday</p>

At half-time, the manager wanted us all to step forward. We created some chances in the first half but it was obvious there was something missing.

Just now it’s about consistency but he has shown in the last 12 to 18 months that he is able to be that consistent. If he can continue like that, he can be on the top<br /><br /><b>[And Gundogan agreed that <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> is setting an incredibly high standard]</b> He made a big step forward - not really in training, because he was always hard-working and one of the best in training sessions. But the way he is on matchday, with his mentality and his aggression - both with and without the ball. He’s crucial for us, you need this type of player, a game-changing player, and he is probably the one player who can change everything for us. We want to help him to keep going like that, scoring and scoring. At the moment there are no limits for him and it’s up to us to help him achieve all of his targets and try to get out the very best possible <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> in the next few months<br /><br /><b>[Gundogan says <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> need to focus on their own performances rather than concentrating on putting pressure on <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s side]</b> That shouldn’t be our business.

If <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> win, people will talk about how nine points is too many. If we win, people will say it’s the start of the same charge we made last season when we overturned a big points difference to win the title. The truth is that it is far too early to tell. We have six months left to play in the most competitive league in the world and it just isn’t possible to predict every result between now and the end of the season - just as people wouldn’t have predicted every result so far. Only one point separated us last season and so it would be wrong to suggest that the result won’t be important but it doesn’t become more important than when we face <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> or <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> later in the month just because the spotlight is on this game<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are currently top of the league, but our fans know that we fight to the end, every game, every season; some of the club’s greatest moments have come about this way, and so Sunday will be important, but nothing is decided in November.

We know the quality we have in the squad - we can change nearly every player and still the quality is top. It’s about every single player putting in a performance on the field</p>

Italy is on the up - it has become very tempting again and I hope the stadiums fill up again too. But if I were to say the sporting challenge might not be that high anymore, then things like the U.S. are definitely an alternative, also because of the life there and the other opportunities you have<br /><br />I don’t see any reason to say that I am still at a top level and want to leave <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>.

  <p><b>[Gundogan joined <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> for the <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> experience and has thoroughly enjoyed it]</b> If everything is new to you, it is more difficult to understand him. Not only on a football level, but also on a personal level. You hear about plenty of players who love him. There are also those who have had trouble with him. I prefer to get my own picture of people and Pep was the main reason that I moved to City. I am very happy with how things have gone, both personally and in a sporting sense<br /><br />At our first meeting we talked a lot about football. But he also really likes to talk about private issues. He always asks in one-on-one discussions about how the family is doing and how things are going, it is important to him. When <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a>’s son had health problems two years ago, it affected him, he suffered a lot. As a coach, he demands a lot from his players. But it has to be like that as a world-class coach. It was similar under <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. That’s an important quality for a coach<br /><br />We trust ourselves to play to our strengths against every opponent. We also talk about the positive things of the opponent rather than the negative things. Of course there are the lists and PowerPoint presentations for every player and a few negative points. But Pep does not mention them in the speech, it is more about the overall tactics. The motto is not to underestimate any opponent</p>

  <p><b>[Ilkay Gundogan: If <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> don’t win the Champions League there will always be something missing]</b> I don’t believe it’s going to be my only final - of course. I hope so too. I don’t actually have much time, that’s why I try to push my team-mates as much as possible. But yeah, I’m confident that we have all the opportunities to get to a Champions League final<br /><br />The Champions League is maybe the most prestigious competition in the game and if you don’t win it, as much as we are a great team, you feel like there’s always something missing. Obviously, we try to do our best but it’s not something that you can talk about and then it comes. It’s something you have to try to achieve<br /><br />It’s so difficult to explain it - I think we need a big game that we win. And to get through thinking ‘this was so hard today’, where we need to struggle as well. We have to overcome difficulties, something like that is needed. That’s why I think you learn from games like away in Atalanta - having one man down and <a href="kyle-walker.html">Kyle Walker</a> as a goalkeeper - or at home against Shakhtar and you struggle and it’s not a great performance and you just draw. These kind of games are also important. You cannot just win every single game by three, four or five goals and then when you come into the last 16 playing a good team, 1-0 down, expect to turn it around easily. It’s not always like that. I think struggles are part of our profession. And it’s always about overcoming these kind of moments<br /><br />It’s important in sport and life, if you do something with confidence you always do it better. That’s the same in football and everything else. It’s harder <b>[in bigger games]</b>. But I think it’s also something you can build up during a game. Having successful moments in a game, like scoring or whatever, always gives you that lift. But it can be the opposite sometimes - things go wrong, it’s totally normal, you fail and your confidence decreases. So it’s a weird thing with confidence. I would say it’s not always something you can really explain and especially not something you can just automatically switch on</p>

They tried to press very high for 10 minutes afterwards. But we started the game really well, got into the last third, but the perception of the last pass was just missing. We had a lot of corners as well, so the chance was there to create more but unfortunately we didn’t so this is something on which we have to improve.<br /><br />Also there was frustration about the free-kick before the goal - it was not at all a foul. I just touched the ball and he goes on the floor, shouting.<br /><br />I don’t even know if the referee saw it or just had a feeling that it was a foul. That was very disappointing for me, to be honest because I was straight involved in the action and conceding the goal straight afterwards hurt very much.<br /><br />We tried hard after conceding the first one but it just wasn’t enough. It hurts a lot. Not really the result but that we didn’t play our best game, especially creating in the last third. Missing Kevin <b>[De Bruyne]</b> is crucial in these kind of games. Unfortunately we were not able to find the last pass to create the chance and score the goal - one was a tiny bit offside. That’s why we are disappointed at losing there, but it’s a fact now and we can’t change it so we have to keep going.<br /><br /><b>[Gundogan is not looking to point any fingers of blame]</b> It’s normal. At the end, you are a human being. Even though we are at the top level, we all make mistakes. We play the game, and mistakes are part of the game.

That’s why we play football, that’s why we’re a team. He will deal with that situation very well. He’s angry, disappointed and frustrated, but it’s always about how you get out if it. He has all of our support and I’m sure he will do much better in the next games<br /><br />I feel like this game is always big, one of the biggest derbies in the world. That’s why we wanted to perform and play well. But we still have some very important games, big games. We play <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> now, and <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a>, and then obviously a vital game against Madrid at home and then another crucial game in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup.
