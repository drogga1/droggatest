It has not been discussed yet, but I don’t think we are going to aim to get the point we need and play a tactical game that way.

  <p><b>[Ilkay Gundogan feels anything still possible for Man City]</b> Eight points behind Chelsea seems difficult to catch up, but in England everything is possible. The entire season feels like a rollercoaster ride. We started very well, almost record-breaking. Then followed a low. In the past games, we have grown again, although we have not always played well.<br /><br />Before the season had really started for me, it was already over again. That was terribly disappointing. I know I have to work really hard on my comeback. Intensive work and pain are part of everyday life</p>

  <p><b>[Ilkay Gundogan plays down importance of Guardiola ‘five-second rule’ at Man City]</b> It depends on the situation and also on the opponent. If we are quite defensive and we lose the ball, we just try to get back into our positions and try to defend. That’s something you have to do from time to time. But if we are more in front and all our players are higher up the pitch, we push and try to win the ball back as soon as possible. It’s much better to win the ball in these areas rather than in your own half because it makes it easier to score a goal and if we have the opportunity to win the ball back up here <b>[high up]</b> we try to use it.<br /><br />We always want to be in the position with three <b>[defenders]</b>, two <b>[players in central areas]</b> and then the two attacking midfielders because that makes the game easier for us. We have short ways of passing between all these players and the most important thing is about creating space for these two guys <b>[attacking midfielders Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva]</b> so they can turn and pass to these guys <b>[wingers Leroy Sane, Raheem Sterling]</b> and these guys - in an ideal situation - pass back to Sergio Aguero to score</p>

  <p><b>[Ilkay Gundogan has admitted he may never return to his previous level as a player after his injury troubles]</b> There are doubts if I will be again at the level I had before so, of course that is the case. Because of these ups and downs, more of the downs, it is sometimes frustrating.<br /><br />The doubts are at this point even bigger. But I had no other choice. I am a football player. This is what I do. This is what I have done all my life. This is my job. For me, there was no other choice than to try again.<br /><br />If I said I am the same player as I was a year ago, I would be lying. I mean, through the injury, you don’t feel the same. You don’t feel as though you are the most powerful guy in the world - not that I ever did. I had two injuries on my knee and I know what to do to prepare myself for the games and to warm my knee up and be generally fit.<br /><br />I will do everything to be as fit as possible. That could be it for all the injuries! I think I am done now! I am ready to continue playing, to keep fit. To enjoy playing.<br /><br />It was a long wait - and tough as well. That is why it feels so special to return. I was sad just to watch in front of the TV or in the stands. I am used to playing every three or four days. If an injury takes it away then it is always disappointing and it feels weird.<br /><br />To be honest, you don’t feel as part of the group anymore. You are not travelling with the team anymore. You do everything on your own or with the physio. So of course, that is the worst feeling you can have as a football player. So, that is also the reason it was that hard over the months.<br /><br />The worst time was of course the day of the injury or when I knew what exactly happened. When I knew there would be six, seven, eight, nine months out. That was the worst feeling.<br /><br />The day after the surgery was not so good either. But then, at one point, you start to do it again. You start to do your rehabilitation. You recover. You have ups and downs, days you feel better, days you feel very bad. I think that is normal. It is not just me.<br /><br />I did not have doubts whether I would play anymore. The ACL is a common injury so you have surgery, the doctors know what they are doing. But of course it is long and it is my second knee injury</p>

  <p><b>[Ilkay Gundogan speaks about the arduous ten-month journey of recovering from a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee]</b> The worst thing for me is seeing the other players. I see them on the training field, when they are in the locker room, when they go up to the meeting before training. I see how they work in the gym, and I am not able to do the same. You know that you are not able to be a full part of the group. That is the most difficult thing: to feel that you are useless, not worth as much as before, not worth as much as the others. To go to that point, and then do the same the next day, and the next day again, and again and again. That is bad for the brain. Rehab is always up and down for the mind and for the body. And there have been points where my mind has said: ‘O.K. I have to go now’</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan believes that the club are playing a special brand of football]</b> The way we play, the way we dominate opponents, it feels special and feels like it could be a very special season. The domination is like Bayern, yes, but it’s a different kind of game. The way we build up, with the quick short passes, feels a bit different from Bayern for me, or Real Madrid. Maybe the most similar team would be Barcelona at their best with Pep.<br /><br />I wouldn’t say we are at their best yet but they were one of the best because of the way they dominated teams - and we are doing so now. I’m not sure if we are there yet. We still need to prove that in every game, every competition. We need to prove that with trophies</p>

  <p><b>[Ilkay Gundogan believes Pep Guardiola has made Manchester City ‘great fun to watch]</b> Maybe Pep has the biggest share of our good run. He finds solutions for every opponent and every single situation and cares about every detail. This makes everything a lot easier for us. The way we play stands out on its own: very attractive, very quick, many opportunities, many goals. Right now, it’s great fun to watch us play.<br /><br />We are way more dangerous in front of the goal now. Our strikers make a goal from almost every opportunity. In combination with our good passing game and dominant football, it is easier for us to dominate the opponents. At some point in the game, the opponent has to react and then we receive even bigger open spaces, we can use<br /><br />Maybe the international break is coming at the right moment, because the recent games have been a bit closer than those in the beginning of the season - but the opponents have been tougher too. Now we must hope that all the players keep fit while playing for their countries and then everything starts from the beginning. In November, December and January the season finally really starts, there are lots of games in this time. Then we must prove that we don’t rest on our good start, that we have an extremely good squad and play in an unequalled way. This is our aim and should also be our demand. There are some teams which are able to stop us - but first of all ourselves. It is maybe going too good for us at the moment<br /><br /><b>[His compatriot Leroy Sane is one of many players to have impressed this season]</b> He manages to make the right decisions in specific situations more and more often. This makes him extremely dangerous. He is one of the most talented young players I know on earth. He integrated himself very well and brings an easy-going attitude to the team, on and off the pitch<br /><br /><b>[Following months out with a knee injury, Gundogan has been playing his part in City’s excellent form]</b> I feel good, the knee is okay, and I am happy about every minute I can play</p>

The elite footballers of one country meet at the national team and it’s an honour for me to be among them. I haven’t earned as many caps as I should have. Because of this, it is maybe even more special for me to be back in the team.<br /><br />The DFB gave me an extremely good feeling in the past years. They made sure that I still feel important although I have been ruled out for some months from time to time. I feel the trust and want to pay back for it now<br /><br />I expect that I will play. If I am needed, I must be ready. I have no fear. It would be the completely wrong thing to go into games with fear. I feel modesty and gratitude for being allowed to be back on the pitch. I am just enjoying it</p>

  <p><b>[Man City star Gundogan wants more players to speak their mind]</b> I didn’t read the whole interview <b>[with Mertesacker]</b> but his statements are not bad. Quite the contrary, it’s great that he can handle it so openly. Many probably cannot<br /><br />I wish that sometimes there is a little more honesty and that you can discuss things openly. There should not be taboo subjects. I have no problem with answering questions honestly or even looking outside the box and answering private questions. It’s bad if you disguise yourself, I honestly cannot see it anymore when you’re after the game, always asked the same questions and give pre-programmed answers. I do not know if there is a solution for that. I don’t know if you can, want or should change it. But sometimes I just wish for a little more. I don’t know if that must necessarily be other topics, but somehow these interviews seem not posed but pre-programmed and predictable. I cannot imagine anyone sitting at home looking at this being able to extract something new from it. At least I am not, and I’ve already seen such interviews many times and I’ve already given such interviews. I think both sides <b>[footballers and media]</b> have to change<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on what can be done to bring about those changes]</b> I don’t know, probably ask different questions? No idea. You ask us the questions, and we have to react to them. And sometimes we are so focused we already have an answer in mind, which probably somebody of the media department told us before. That’s why I don’t want to know the questions before, when I give interviews whether TV or print. I don’t want to prepare myself for what I will answer. I think it would make me feel even unsure if you come to me before an interview and say: ‘Ilkay, here are the 10 questions, read that’. Then you do not have the possibility to be spontaneous. Spontaneity is mostly honest. But then <b>[if you see the questions before]</b> you do not have the possibility of being 100 per cent honest and say what you think anymore. So most of the time it’s controlled by the head and that’s a pity, because I think that quite a lot of footballers have more to offer. Some don’t want <b>[to talk openly about things]</b>, you have to respect that, too. But I can imagine that many are open for it. And the people at home would not complain about it, too, I think - quite the contrary</p>

  <p><b>[Ilkay Gundogan has expressed his regret over Mesut Ozil’s retirement from the Germany national team]</b> Was the affair racially motivated? You’re telling me! Is it not racism when a German politician writes on Facebook: ‘The German national football team: 25 Germans and two goat fuckers?’. That’s something you have to call racism. Nevertheless, that does not mean that all people in Germany are racists - not at all. Almost all my life I have had good experiences in Germany. I want to say that very clearly here. But there are people who have politically used the resulting photo for themselves. And in this context, the line to racism was partially crossed<br /><br />Of course there were some jokes here and there about certain Instagram postings. But that is quite normal, that you get up here and there a bit in a positive way. But that was just always meant to be fun and definitely had nothing to do with racism! At the 2014 World Cup, it was ‘Die Mannschaft’ everywhere with 23 very best buddies and now, after a disappointing 2018 World Cup, there is talk of fractured groupings, though they were largely the same players and characters. This is now exaggerated from the outside!<br /><br />In sporting terms, I think Mesut’s resignation is a pity. He did a lot for German football. It’s a loss for the team. Mesut has also done a lot for me personally. He was one of the reasons why I wanted to play for Germany. He has paved the way for me. So I would have wished that he would get a better, deserved goodbye. However, one has to say that it was Mesut’s decision to go that way - with all the consequences. I would have done it differently - because I’m different from the personality. At the time I wanted to comment on the topic immediately and not let it sit on me. That’s why my idea was to seek an exchange with our Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier</p>

United just dropped points against Wolves, like we did, so I think Wolves will cause a lot of problems. But it’s up to us in the end. We are trying to play like we did today because when we are ready like this our chances of winning games and titles are the highest. So that’s what we try to achieve every game.<br /><br /><b>[Following that shock 2-1 loss to Lyon in Europe]</b> The beginning wasn’t easy because we knew Cardiff are a very physical team and we knew they were going to play a lot of long balls, so it was about winning the second balls and being aggressive. When we play like we did here it’s very difficult for opponents to beat us. We missed it in the first-half against Lyon, we were not aggressive enough. We weren’t winning the duels and that’s why we conceded two easy goals. Today was different, that’s why we scored five and didn’t concede</p>

We have a system and the team-mates on the pitch are so close to you, you get involved in so much positive and good things. It’s quite difficult and tough and with Pep pushing you, it’s difficult to have a bad game. You can have bad passes or a bad challenges, but to have a bad game a lot has to happen to have these kind of games<br /><br />The Champions League is, in terms of club football, the most prestigious one. And if you don’t win it you will never be named one of the greatest teams, no chance. So that’s what you have to achieve, otherwise you will be centurions in England and I’m sure one day another team will come, I’m not sure how long it will take but some other team will come and also get 100 points in a Premier League season. sIt will not make the last season worse, it will still be special and a lot of positive and nice memories in our minds. But when you ask me how to be remembered as one of the greatest teams I think it’s a fact to win the Champions League</p>

  <p><b>[Ilkay Gundogan considers Manchester City to have ridiculous quality up front]</b> I think the games we lost in December opened our eyes a little bit you know. We were not efficient enough anymore and made some mistakes so we conceded goals too easily. After these games we knew we had to improve, especially defensively, because the quality we have up front is ridiculous and we know we can always score. I think in the title race it’s crucial to be defensively as solid as possible. With the quality we have in the team, it feels like every player can replace the other one and the quality does not drop. There’s huge potential in that team and we have to show it on the pitch.<br /><br />These home games with Arsenal and Chelsea are very important. We are going out to win these games, but you can’t deny both have a lot of quality and it’s very important to be good defensively against these teams and not concede - and then I believe we can win both games with our quality</p>

  <p><b>[Ilkay Gundogan considers Mesut Ozil to be elegant]</b> Both are game changers. Kevin is a little bit more aggressive in his style and, at Mesut’s best, both are on a similar level. I think people always criticise Mesut because they think his attitude on the pitch is not a good one, that he doesn’t care that much. But I think people just struggle to accept that you can have the more emotional kind of players, the more aggressive ones and you have players like him, you know, that need maybe this calmness for their game. It looks a bit more elegant and slow, but believe me it’s so difficult to defend against these kind of players. They make everything look so easy and I think sometimes you forget to appreciate these kind of things. Obviously we always watch games and, even me, we always think we know better. But on the pitch it’s always a different story. A player like him, with his huge talent, I don’t think it just surprises just me, but a lot of people, that he doesn’t play regularly<br /><br />Of course I have sympathy for him. Also, because I know the more regularly you play, the easier it is because you have the rhythm and just keep going and you don’t think about certain things too much. My experience from the last couple of years at City is that you get your game time and then the next few games there’s always someone coming in with similar quality, ridiculous quality, and our manager in these kind of cases has a very tough job. He always has to choose who to pick and try to divide game time throughout the whole squad. That’s a very tough thing to do. In a team like Manchester City, Arsenal, and other big clubs, it’s quite difficult just to have the same 11 players starting every week From my own experience, the more you play, back-to-back games, the better you feel, with more self confidence and rhythm<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on his future]</b> I’m happy where I am right now. I enjoy my football, I don’t think in a sporting way there is any other place to be right now. But I still have 18 months to go. I’m 28 now, not the youngest anymore, but I don’t think there is any pressure, not for the club, not for me to rush it.</p>

  <p><b>[Ilkay Gündoğan has told his Manchester City team-mates to leave their egos at the door]</b> We have such a good squad, I try to bring myself to the best situation. I try to do my best. If I don’t play I try to support my team-mates. That’s what every player should do. Sometimes we have to put our egos in the second, third, fourth row because we have that huge quality in the squad and nobody can expect to play every single game, all the minutes. We need everyone<br /><br />I can’t see into their minds. I don’t believe it’s an advantage that we won last year because the way we won, it’s completely different. This time it is a completely new situation. We are still second. We have to try to put pressure on them, but I try to see it that we need to put pressure on ourselves because the way we played at Newcastle was not the way we want to play - it was not our type of football. That is more disappointing than watching Liverpool winning games. It’s up to us to be able to say at the end of the season in the last few weeks we did everything to achieve what we want<br /><br /><b>[Asked about similarities between Guardiola and Klopp]</b> They are different in terms of playing style and their characters, but both of them are great people, great human beings that I really like. Klopp didn’t win as much as Pep won - that’s why it was quite surprising when he was able to win two titles in a row with Dortmund in Germany. I just joined them for the second one. When you have to run in the season you don’t think about much things, you go out and play. When you have no concerns in your mind you are able to win a lot of times. That’s how I felt when we were able to win at Dortmund that title. We had an advantage of just playing Saturday, Saturday, Saturday and the week off in between. He is in a similar situation now with Liverpool - just the Premier League and then the Champions League on top. Maybe it’s going to be an advantage for them, I don’t know. It’s nothing we can change right now. They have to play their games and we have to play ours</p>

  <p><b>[Gundogan ready to run down Man City contract]</b> It’s become the norm that a player who has another year on his contract period has a decision between separation or extension. I’m a little old-fashioned. It’s possible that I will go to the last year of my contract and then extend. Maybe the next one will be my last big contract, so such a decision must be well considered. We have already had one or two talks. I do not feel there is pressure on the subject. In sporting terms, I’m very satisfied with City - there are less attractive jobs in Europe! In this regard, there is nothing to prevent an extension. But nothing is decided yet.<br /><br />It’s hard to judge if I’m the best Gundogan ever. I also had very good periods at Dortmund. In the meantime, however, I also realise that I have to pay close attention to my body. I need to sleep well - at least seven hours - and eat well</p>

  <p><b>[Gundogan names ‘incredible’ Mario Gotze as most memorable team-mate]</b> There was a guy I found incredible in training. A player I thought ‘What is he doing? Is he only 18 or 19?’ That player was Mario Gotze. He did things in training that made me think ‘Wow. If he doesn’t make it all the way to the top then I don’t know!’ That was overwhelming for me. I’ve tried to defend against him many times, but you just don’t get the ball. Whether the ball is in the air or at his feet, you can’t separate him from it. He always makes the right decisions, whether he’s dribbling or picking out a pass.<br /><br />I liked to watch Kaka very, very much. The way he played with tremendous pace with the ball at his feet, he just left opponents behind. Watching him was a feast for the eyes. Then, of course, there was Xavi and Andres Iniesta; small, agile and inseparable - they always made the right decisions and played great passes. Iniesta makes the game look easy, but it’s not. On the contrary, it’s very difficult. I don’t think people appreciate it enough when they watch him on TV. He played brutal passes and was always flawless - it felt like he was floating. For simplicity, there is no better player than Iniesta<br /><br /><b>[Gundogan often plays alongside another Spaniard in David Silva]</b> You learn more about football in general when you watch players like David. He’s extremely good in tight spaces, at decision-making and playing the right passes. If you have a midfielder like him who can play passes like he does… I don’t want to be a defender! It doesn’t matter if you’re marking him or cutting his passing lanes, both are extremely difficult. Nevertheless, one should always be careful when looking to others for inspiration. You shouldn’t want to imitate people if it doesn’t fit with your own style</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City may not have a Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> For me, the Champions League is the greatest thing, to win it is the ­greatest thing that can happen to you as a ­footballer. Maybe that’s because I’ve already lost a final when I was at Dortmund. Our team now is so much better than the team we had at Dortmund at that time. It felt realistic at that time to achieve it but everyone knows how difficult it is to reach the final and then win it. It’s so tough. But if you want to be the best, then, in my opinion, you have to win the Champions League. Not just the best team but the best club and that’s just what history showed us if you think about the Barcelonas, Real Madrids. If you win the Champions League and they talk about you then they use the word ‘best’. If you want to become the best in Europe you have to win the Champions League, that is a fact. We don’t have one special player who can change ­everything like Messi or ­Ronaldo, but it’s hard to name another team in Europe with so many great players in their squad. The ­potential is definitely there.<br /><br />The only thing we can do is put pressure on, it’s what we want to do. There’s 10 games left <b>[in the league]</b>, but there will be some kind of ­failure - a game where we lose points, ­either Liverpool or us - so we want to lose as few as possible. We want to win the title back-to-back which history shows is such a difficult thing. It’s difficult to win something, but to do it back-to-back is ­incredibly hard. This season feels exactly like that. It’s not because we’re playing worse than last year but our challengers for the title are much better than they were last year - and obviously this is great for the league in general. But with our quality we have the ­responsibility to play every game in every ­competition like we have a ­realistic chance to win it. But I can’t predict for sure whether it (the quadruple) is ­actually possible. We can challenge everyone in every competition. When you have such a great squad, it doesn’t matter how many games you have in the end because you can change ­players in ­different positions but still have a team with great quality. I never had the feeling that our quality dropped because we ­always stick to one plan, we have game-changers on the pitch and it doesn’t matter if there’s two, three, four or even five different players, you still have the feeling we should win</p>

The club doesn’t rush me, I don’t rush myself, so I have still more than one year to go so I try to see it relaxed and then we will see.<br /><br />I think in terms of playing football, in terms of enjoying the game, at the moment in Europe there is not really a better place than here<br /><br />Obviously that’s a great sign when one of the greatest managers asks you to stay in this team<br /><br />We were very dominant, that was my feeling. We had a lot of possession, obviously it’s always hard when your opponent is so tight, so defensive, five at the back, four in midfield, it makes it a little harder, especially when they defend in front of their goal, that’s why we may have struggled to have clear chances in the first half but I think we did it well<br /><br />Yeah obviously it’s another job, it’s different to playing as an offensive midfielder when you have to wait a little bit in the spaces between the back five and the midfield row, so you have a lot of responsibility in terms of having defensive stability. So that’s why you have to take care, especially when your opponent has pacey players up front like Bournemouth had. But like I say I think we controlled everything quite well and for me it’s just another job, I just have to be aware that I’m not really allowed to go much up front, but that’s fine, I know we have a lot of quality there so I just try to fulfil my role in that position and when we are able to not concede and win the game I am also very happy</p>

But we could have done better, not really with the result in the league game, but with the performance in the first half.

  <p><b>[Coronavirus: Gundogan funds shopping service and hospital support during crisis]</b> In Manchester, I followed the news of the situation in Germany closely. I was struck with the pictures from the particularly badly affected district of Heinsberg. That is why I wanted to start a relief action exactly where the need is greatest. Thank you to the football club SVG Birgden-Langbroich-Schierwaldenrath, which are supporting me with all the deliveries and can hand them over on my behalf. We footballers, whether amateur or professional, must show this solidarity and together support those people who urgently need our help.</p>

When asked if he would be in favour of top players in England sacrificing their salaries in order to help clubs in the lower leagues survive, Gundogan responded: Of course I would find that okay, of course. But the lower league clubs do not have it so easy<br /><br /><b>[Gundogan added on how he is coping in self-isolation at his home in Manchester]</b> I have to admit that it is not that easy to deal with. It is an exceptional situation that cannot be fully grasped. You are sometimes afraid to go for a walk for 10 to 15 minutes outside. Even though it was oddly and ironically extremely beautiful from the weather here in Manchester<br /><br /><b>[The 29-year-old also expressed doubts over the season resuming next month]</b> Honestly, I can’t imagine that and I don’t know how realistic it is</p>

In terms of style I think there is still a lot of potential<br /><br />Sometimes it’s so difficult to predict. A player can have all the quality and everything it takes to play for a big-six team or to play for the best teams in the world but then sometimes it happens and it doesn’t work out. It’s not because of the player or the club, sometimes it’s just the environment, it’s the wrong timing.

  <p><b>[Gundogan admits to struggling with motivation during coronavirus lockdown]</b> I have a few things to do and then I’m ready to go. To be honest, it’s not so easy to motivate yourself these days every day when you are training. You know, like people who are working from home, you can maybe compare it to that. For those people it’s also not the same as driving to work every day and then doing their jobs. You have to motivate yourself to do things and to do your work. Some days it’s harder than others<br /><br />I’ve done these things because I can identify with them. Heinsberg was pretty much the coronavirus outbreak in Germany and it’s not far from my hometown, so there’s a connection. Gelsenkirchen is my home and there was a possibility to do something so I did it, and Nuremberg, I’ve lived there for a long time, it was my first professional team. My former school principal contacted me. I like him a lot and I’m still in touch with him. We made a plan and did something. Those were all things I could identify with, 100 per cent. I’m a privileged person and I am grateful that I am able to help in those situations. There are many people who struggle, who don’t have a home or food and things like that. Not only during the coronavirus crisis. I was very happy to be able to help</p>

Some days we do our exercises via FaceTime. It’s worked out well so far and we’re on it and trying to be very focused. For everyone, the situation has its good and bad sides. On one hand, Leroy had already trained with the team and he had his comeback in sight, even though he still had a few minor things. But he was almost back at playing again. Especially for your psyche, it’s important to be able to play again after such a long time. On the other hand, he now has a bit more time to figure out those minor problems he still had. The fact that others can’t play either is not so bad for him.<br /><br />I have a few things to do and then I’m ready to go.

The first one that comes to my mind about the Turkish player I want to see at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> is Caglar. I would also count <a href="cenk-tosun.html">Cenk Tosun</a>. He may be at this level in the near future. I think he has also played well, but he suffered an unlucky injury.
