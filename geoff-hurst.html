  <p><b>[Geoff Hurst Hails <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> But Thinks Bobby Moore Was Better]</b> Bobby started each and every one of his 108 games for England. In my opinion he would have won significantly more caps had he played these days. <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> has had a fabulous career and has been a wonderful ambassador for the English game. But in recent seasons he’s been able to increase his number of caps by making brief appearances as a substitute, something that simply didn’t happen when we were playing for England. It’s difficult to make a relevant comparison between the two because so much has changed in the game, but you can’t question David’s loyalty and commitment. He’s a great athlete and has had a wonderful career. But, you have to remember that Bobby Moore was a world-class player - probably the best defender in the world. He lifted the World Cup and he won the player-of-the-tournament vote in 1966 ahead of world stars like <a href="pele.html">Pele</a>, <a href="eusebio.html">Eusebio</a>, <a href="franz-beckenbauer.html">Franz Beckenbauer</a> and <a href="bobby-charlton.html">Bobby Charlton</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[Quote on <a href="bobby-charlton.html">Sir Bobby Charlton</a>]</b> To score that many goals from midfield is just a remarkable achievement. He was a great player, capable of a brilliant shot but also a brilliant player to have in the team. He was a clever player, won so much and will go down as one of the all time greats in world football</p>

As players he kept us all on our toes and we knew no one was guaranteed a place in the team. It’s fitting that his legacy both as a coach, and as a man, will be remembered here in the wonderful facility that is St George’s Park</p>

  <p><b>[Geoff Hurst speaks about current <a href="fa.html">Three Lions</a> forward <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>]</b> Well, it’s astonishing. Look at the hat-tricks. In my career at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>, I think I scored about ten or 11 hat-tricks and I was quite proud of that. He’s scored eight in a season. His record, so far, in the last two or three years, he’s been consistently a good goalscorer and he’s got a good knack of scoring the goals</p>

  <p><b>[England hero Hurst hails telepathy of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> duo]</b> I’m a big fan of <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a> - he’s developed a great understanding with <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, and at the top-level football isn’t always about individuality. Looking back, Alfredo di Stefano and <a href="ferenc-puskas.html">Ferenc Puskas</a> had that for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> - it was almost telepathic. Dele has that with Harry, and I am sure he would have created a lot of chances for me<br /><br />Many may expect me to say <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>, given that he is a striker who can score goals at the highest level, but I actually think his playing style is similar to mine and we may not have hit it off. Harry is used to playing as a lone striker, and I always played alongside a second striker<br /><br />Instead, I’ve gone for another two players that I feel would have benefited me a lot more in terms of creating chances and helping me to score goals. It may come as a surprise, but I would have <a href="kieran-trippier.html">Kieran Trippier</a> and <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a>.<br /><br /><a href="kieran-trippier.html">Kieran Trippier</a> has been brilliant for England since he has come into the set up. He had a fantastic World Cup tournament, scoring a great free-kick against Croatia in the semi-final and he delivered dangerous crosses throughout the campaign.<br /><br />His delivery is as good as any traditional winger I ever played with, and nobody would have enjoyed playing with him more than I would. He makes the art of crossing look so easy, and that’s a valuable skill to possess. I could see myself getting on the end of his excellent crosses - perhaps not now, but definitely in my prime!</p>
