  <p><b>[1966 hero Hurst is backing the 29-year-old Wayne Rooney to establish himself as one of England’s greats]</b> I think the only thing people hold against him is that he hasn’t scored enough in major tournaments because he has only scored one goal at the World Cup. As a striker, you say that the team has to be there to give him opportunities and in recent tournaments the whole team has underperformed. I think he will break Bobby’s record soon and he might set a new record that can never be beaten. Wayne has time to put himself way out ahead. Wayne can only keep doing what he is doing and he deserves to be up there as one of the best English players ever<br /><br />Bobby’s record is brilliant because he was a midfield player and Wayne is a striker. It makes you realise just how amazing Bobby’s career was, God bless him. You can’t really compare Bobby with Wayne because they were different types of players in different eras. I always find it difficult trying to measure a player from the 1960s up against a player from now</p>

  <p><b>[Geoff Hurst Hails <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> But Thinks Bobby Moore Was Better]</b> Bobby started each and every one of his 108 games for England. In my opinion he would have won significantly more caps had he played these days. <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> has had a fabulous career and has been a wonderful ambassador for the English game. But in recent seasons he’s been able to increase his number of caps by making brief appearances as a substitute, something that simply didn’t happen when we were playing for England. It’s difficult to make a relevant comparison between the two because so much has changed in the game, but you can’t question David’s loyalty and commitment. He’s a great athlete and has had a wonderful career. But, you have to remember that Bobby Moore was a world-class player - probably the best defender in the world. He lifted the World Cup and he won the player-of-the-tournament vote in 1966 ahead of world stars like <a href="pele.html">Pele</a>, <a href="eusebio.html">Eusebio</a>, <a href="franz-beckenbauer.html">Franz Beckenbauer</a> and <a href="bobby-charlton.html">Bobby Charlton</a>.</p>

In my career at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>, I think I scored about ten or 11 hat-tricks and I was quite proud of that. He’s scored eight in a season. His record, so far, in the last two or three years, he’s been consistently a good goalscorer and he’s got a good knack of scoring the goals</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham have been warned off making a move for Yaya Toure]</b> I see them linked with Toure I just think that’s completely and utterly off the wall. I absolutely cannot believe as a club we’re looking at him. We bought the full-back - Ryan Fredericks - from Fulham which was terrific. But looking at Toure - with his comments about Pep Guardiola and the business with his birthday cake a few years ago - for West Ham to even think about talking to him is a very, very poor decision. There comes a time when a player is past his best and we shouldn’t be buying cast-offs from other teams.<br /><br />Wilshere is injury prone and you don’t want to sign players like that. We’ve already got Andy Carroll. Wilshere again for me is a complete no. There’s enough players in the world. West Ham don’t need to sign cast-offs, injured players and players that are too old. For God’s sake surely we have enough money to buy a bit of quality</p>

  <p><b>[Jack Wilshere has a great opportunity at West Ham]</b> It is a great opportunity, I wouldn’t say resurrect that is too strong and it is obviously subject to keeping himself fit. That’s a very important issue for him. He has got the opportunity to play in a side now that we have acquired other players, not just him. I think that’s good for the club as a whole. If the teams performs well, increases its position with Jack, if he performs then I wouldn’t discount him from getting back into the national team squad. That’s if he performs like we know he can on a regular basis, without the injuries. The team playing well also helps people individually and brings a focus to that player. So I think the two things could combine very well. I think that’s an opportunity. I certainly think <b>[Gareth]</b> Southgate would pick him, as well as two or three others. They have a chance in the game to come and make a go of it<br /><br />With the appointment of Manuel Pellegrini, a high profile manager, there was always going to be a high budget this year to support the high profile leadership which we have already seen. It looks very positive but you never know, like at any club, when you buy a lot of players whether they are going to fit in, whether they are going to perform within the club in this league with their issues. But on the surface, and what we have seen so far, as a West Ham fan it looks very encouraging. What we are looking for this year is a gradual improvement, bearing in mind were in the bottom three last year for a long time. So improvement for us is, and I am being conservative, is to be in mid-table and out of trouble, not looking over our shoulder and then we can aspire to get towards that top six. With the enormous amount of money that the big clubs are spending, we are not there yet, but if we can get close then everyone will be quite happy with that. For me, that would be a big step after what was a disappointing year last year</p>

  <p><b>[England hero Hurst hails telepathy of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> duo]</b> I’m a big fan of <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a> - he’s developed a great understanding with <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, and at the top-level football isn’t always about individuality. Looking back, Alfredo di Stefano and <a href="ferenc-puskas.html">Ferenc Puskas</a> had that for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> - it was almost telepathic. Dele has that with Harry, and I am sure he would have created a lot of chances for me<br /><br />Many may expect me to say <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>, given that he is a striker who can score goals at the highest level, but I actually think his playing style is similar to mine and we may not have hit it off. Harry is used to playing as a lone striker, and I always played alongside a second striker<br /><br />Instead, I’ve gone for another two players that I feel would have benefited me a lot more in terms of creating chances and helping me to score goals. It may come as a surprise, but I would have <a href="kieran-trippier.html">Kieran Trippier</a> and <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a>.<br /><br /><a href="kieran-trippier.html">Kieran Trippier</a> has been brilliant for England since he has come into the set up. He had a fantastic World Cup tournament, scoring a great free-kick against Croatia in the semi-final and he delivered dangerous crosses throughout the campaign.<br /><br />His delivery is as good as any traditional winger I ever played with, and nobody would have enjoyed playing with him more than I would. He makes the art of crossing look so easy, and that’s a valuable skill to possess. I could see myself getting on the end of his excellent crosses - perhaps not now, but definitely in my prime!</p>

  <p><b>[Former England and West Ham striker Sir Geoff Hurst has said playing at Wembley has become tiresome for Tottenham]</b> You could say that playing at Wembley so often has taken away the privilege for Tottenham and their supporters. It’s a fantastic stadium, befitting for big occasions such as England matches, cup semi-finals and finals. But playing there every week has become tiresome for the team. Their players have made noises about looking forward to leaving and playing in their own ground, and you can see why as the atmosphere and turnout isn’t what it could and should be for the national stadium.<br /><br />Should they have been allowed to have played there? I don’t see why not. It’s important that the FA help English teams when they can, and Spurs have been flying the flag for the country when playing in the Champions League, so it made sense to help them while the stadium was being built</p>

  <p><b>[Callum Hudson-Odoi has been told that trading Chelsea for Bayern Munich]</b> In terms of Hudson-Odoi being linked with Bayern Munich, it makes sense and I’d look at it and think it’s an easy decision for him to make. If he’s playing for Bayern Munich and does well there, I think he’ll give himself a better chance of becoming a regular for England than if he stays with Chelsea. Chelsea aren’t developing English players, given the amount they have got and the number who leave on loan and don’t get opportunities. It would be a lesson learnt again for rich English clubs like Chelsea if a player like Callum rejected their contract offer and moved elsewhere. But first and foremost, I really hope he does well for England and fingers crossed he can start off his international career in the best possible way - with a win and a good performance<br /><br />I’m not surprised to see Callum Hudson-Odoi in the England squad because it’s consistent with what Gareth Southgate has done in his time as England manager - put faith in younger players. He isn’t afraid to bring in young English players who haven’t got a great deal of experience playing regularly for their clubs in the first team, and Gareth has been pushed into that because of the nature of the Premier League. Too many English clubs are reluctant to play young players in the league on a regular basis. Chelsea are farming out lots of young talent and when teams do that it presents a problem for Gareth Southgate. I wasn’t selected for England until I was proving it week in week out with West Ham, but I thought I should have been given an opportunity earlier, so it’s nice to see guys like Hudson-Odoi get the chance to prove it at a young age</p>

  <p><b>[England will be serious challengers at the 2022 World Cup due to the timing of the event in Qatar]</b> Yes, I do - November is the peak of the season for us. After starting in August, the players will be at their peak - they should not be tired - so I can only see a benefit to our country. Also, the resurgence of our national team in the last 18 months, at the World Cup and qualifying for the Nations League, beating Croatia and Spain and scoring five goals a game, it’s a really opportune time for us coming into this tournament. If we continue to improve and our young players get more experience, the signs are very good. It’s a very exciting time for our national team and coincides with the World Cup in three years’ time. I’m always very confident England are going to do well and I’m even more confident now with the timing of the tournament.<br /><br /><b>[Southgate has done a remarkable job since stepping up from the U21 ranks to become coach of the senior side]</b> It’s quite evident looking at the way the players play, the way they talk in the media and the way they celebrate goals that his management style is proving very effective. It’s something we haven’t seen for some time. One of the most important aspects of a sport doing well is the people at the top - the leaders. We were very fortunate in our time to have a great leader in Sir Alf Ramsey - he was instrumental in picking the right players and playing the right way. And Gareth Southgate seems to have a knack of doing that. What is amazingly different - and I often state I played in medieval times - is that what we’re seeing now is players playing for England who have hardly kicked a ball for their Premier League clubs, <b>[Callum]</b> Hudson-Odoi for example. I look back now and say retrospectively I should have been playing for England three years earlier, when I was scoring goals regularly for West Ham and winning the FA Cup and Cup Winners’ Cup. So it’s changed dramatically, but overall, Southgate’s managerial style and what he’s doing, and the way they’re playing, is just fantastic</p>
