  <p><b>[Kieran Trippier speaking after England put three past Spain]</b> You want to play against the best and we want to be the No 1 team. We want to beat the big teams. In the past few games we have had draws and not scored, but I think we showed <b>[against Spain]</b> we can beat the top teams and defend well against the top teams. It was a statement and, ­hopefully, in the future, we can put performances in like this as well. We want to win every game and play like that in every game</p>

Gareth Southgate has included skipper Harry Kane in his 23-man squad ahead of next month’s UEFA Nations League finals - but there is no place for his Tottenham team-mates Kieran Trippier and Harry Winks.</p>

  <p><b>[Kieran Trippier knows he can play ‘so much better’ than he has done this season but is ready to give everything to help Tottenham beat Liverpool to a Champions League title. Asked if those fitness problems impacted his form]</b> Yeah, of course, I have said it in many interviews that it has not helped. Obviously with the World Cup in the summer and coming back and playing straight away…The season has gone now, I have to accept the way I have played this season, I know I can play so much better. But it’s about accepting it, looking back and reviewing it like I always do after every game. It has happened, the way I have played. One big game left, if I play I can give everything to the team to help us win.<br /><br /><b>[Trippier sustained a minor groin injury at the back end of 2018 before picking up an ankle problem in March]</b> It has been a difficult season with injuries. I have had different types of injuries. It feels like these three weeks have enabled me to recover, and manage it properly without so many games. We’ve had three games a week and it has been difficult to manage that. But now I have had three weeks to properly settle down and do my rehab on it and I am feeling fit and ready and hopefully I will get the nod to play<br /><br /><b>[Trippier acknowledged has felt odd ahead of Saturday’s date with Liverpool in Madrid]</b> It has been strange, because if you look at the whole season we have always had a few injuries. Now everybody is back, everybody is fit, it is going to be interesting, whoever is selected</p>

I know what I need to do to get back in that England team. I know I need to be playing better and it’s right that I’m not in the squad because I haven’t been performing well, I know that. I know what I need to do get in that team. Trent and Kyle have been unbelievable this season. They deserve to be playing and I don’t, simple as that, I know that for a fact. I need to regroup in the summer, get fully fit, come back flying in the new season and try and catch Gareth Southgate’s eye again. I’m the first one to know if I play badly and I’m willing to admit that, but it’s something you can learn from. The season’s gone now, I’m happy it’s gone but the England situation, yeah, it’s a tough one to take but I’m willing to accept Gareth’s decision.</p>

  <p><b>[Kieran Trippier is hoping to be given the chance to stay at Tottenham]</b> If the manager selects me to play, I will always give everything I can. Everybody makes mistakes - I have made plenty this season but I am the one to own up to them. I have had plenty of interviews about my performances this season and it has not been good at all. I am the first one to say that.<br /><br /><b>[An inability to find consistency in his game has led to Trippier being overlooked by England boss Gareth Southgate for the Nations League finals]</b> I had a good chat with Gareth. I am grateful for all the opportunities he has given me. I know what I need to do to get back into that England team. I know I need to be playing better and rightly so I am not in the squad because I have not been performing well. Trent Alexander-Arnold and Kyle Walker have been doing unbelievable this season and they deserve to be playing and I don’t. Simple as that and I know that for a fact. I need to regroup now at the end of the season and get fully fit and try and catch Gareth Southgate’s eye. I am the first one to know if I played badly. It is something you can learn from. I am happy the season is gone. The England situation is a tough one to take but I am willing to accept Gareth’s decision.<br /><br /><b>[Asked where he sees his future]</b> I am happy to be here. It is a great squad. In football things happen so quickly. I have had a great few years here. But it is just one of them. I will enjoy my rest, come back in pre-season and have a talk with the manager and see what is next</p>

  <p><b>[Quizzed again on his future in the wake of a Champions League final defeat to Liverpool]</b> I don’t know. I go home now, spend time with my family, just recover after a long, difficult season. Everybody’s got a decision to make, no matter what. Obviously this club has been very good for me over the last few years but I’ll enjoy my summer, come back in pre-season and that’s when I’ll sit down with the manager and have a talk about my future. I see a lot of speculation about me not being here. I give everything, 100 per cent every game, win lose or draw. So we’ll see what happens in pre-season.<br /><br />I want to stay in England. But what can you do? I’ll see what happens and what the club wants, most importantly. I give everything for this club - training sessions, games - so we’ll see what happens in pre-season</p>

  <p><b>[Kieran Trippier is delighted at the prospect of working under Diego Simeone after completing his move to Atletico Madrid]</b> It’s an amazing feeling. I’ve always wanted to play abroad and what a place to play. A fantastic team, an unbelievable manager and I’m just looking forward to getting on with it now. They’ve been to some major finals, they’ve done so well in LaLiga over the years. They have world class players and a brilliant manager. I can’t wait to work with the manager, learn from the manager and help the team be a success in the future. You can see how close he is with his squad<br /><br /><b>[Trippier made 38 appearances across all competitions for Tottenham in 2018-19]</b> THANK YOU. I’ve met some amazing people at @spursofficial many of whom I now call my friends. To the Tottenham fans from around the world - you’ve been amazing. The support you’ve shown me and the team took us to new heights, and with the new stadium I have no doubt that the team and fans have many exciting times ahead!

  <p><b>[Kieran Trippier says he had no hesitation about leaving Tottenham for Atletico Madrid because of his long-held ambition to play abroad]</b> The Premier League is one of the best leagues in the world, but I didn’t think twice when Atletico were interested. It’s a great opportunity to come and live in Madrid. Not many British players come abroad, but I always wanted to play abroad, especially in La Liga, since I was young. I’m looking forward to learning the language straight away, which is my first priority. The quicker I can do that, communicate with my coach and team-mates, the better. I want to enjoy playing for Atletico and living in Madrid<br /><br /><b>[If starting his career across town does not attach enough pressure, Hermoso also has the unenviable task of trying to plug the gap left by Diego Godin’s departure for Intermilan]</b> It’s a beautiful, important challenge. Diego has been a symbol for the club. What better way to continue making history. I hope to continue that line</p>

Two wins from two games and long may it continue<br /><br />I’m extremely proud to be here and willing to give it my all. The supporters have been incredible.

The lads have been unbelievable with me. Since I’ve been through the door they’ve welcomed me with open arms, the coach as well.

  <p><b>[Kieran Trippier has admitted he struggled in the second half of last season, though he believes <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> may have made a mistake in selling him]</b> The whole season I had no excuses. My (bad) performances started after Christmas because I thought I had an okay first-half of the season if I’m honest, but then it was just like a car crash. It just went ‘bang’, things weren’t going my way. I wasn’t playing well. I heard rumours about them selling me and it’s not nice but it happens and it’s football. <b>[<a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>]</b> didn’t say he wanted to move me on. I tried to speak to the chairman about it. I spoke to the manager about his plans and I didn’t get a yes and I didn’t get a no. So you get the impression. It’s disappointing. I gave everything for the club and I wanted to stay, I had another couple of years left, but everything happens for a reason. Me and the manager didn’t leave on bad terms, he has done a lot for me and I respect him highly. It is just a few things, I tried to speak to the chairman I just didn’t really get an answer<br /><br />We all did so well at the World Cup but I didn’t have the best season after. It wasn’t an easy decision. I love <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but I’m in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> now and loving it. I set the bar high at the World Cup and they knew how well I could do but I just feel that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> probably got rid of me at the wrong time because I just needed that four-week rest for recovery because I was struggling with injuries to come back, fresh, ready. So maybe I could have stayed, but I’ve got no regrets<br /><br /><b>[Trippier still it was still heartbreaking to hear the news]</b> I had a chat with Gareth, 40 minutes on the phone. I was sat in my bedroom. I was devastated. I was expecting it because of my performances. There’s competition everywhere so not getting back int the squad does play at the back of your mind. There’s four right-backs who are doing very well for their clubs so you need to play well to stay in the England team</p>

He just calls me that because it’s the first name that came into his mind. And everywhere I go, they shout <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a>. When I warm up, everyone’s shouting it. Everyone.

I heard people saying it was a risk, there were a few warnings, but it didn’t scare me. I thought this was a great opportunity. When I first spoke to my wife it was a bit of a shock. The language will take time. I’ve just got to be patient. I just want them to know I’m trying. I couldn’t have asked for a better group.<br /><br />The most important thing is I’m enjoying my football. I’ve come to a different league, different surroundings, different culture, everything. Maybe the new challenge has woken me up. It was there to see last season that sometimes my concentration was lacking. Sometimes it led to goals, I know that. I’ve said many times over the last 16 months my defending needs to improve. People questioned the move but it was the perfect team. If I play for <a href="diego-simeone.html">Cholo</a> <b>[Diego Simeone]</b>, I know defensively I can improve</p>

He was unbelievable<br /><br /><b>[When asked what it is like to play against <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> as a defender]</b> It’s weird in a way. He spends a lot of the game just walking and walking. You play against (Liverpool’s) <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, for instance, and if you take your eye off him for a second, he’ll just dart in behind you. But with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, you look four times and he’s still there. It’s weird. A lot of the time he just walks and walks - and then, before you know it, it’s a goal. I’ve played against him a few times now and he’s so good at just picking up those little pockets of space. Before <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> have made three passes, he already knows where the ball’s going. It’s amazing how clever he is. Even when he’s walking like that, you’ve always got to be aware. He’s unbelievable, the best ever. But it’s not just <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. There are the players around him.

I’ve got a lot of mates at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> - players and staff. It wasn’t nice to see what they went through, not getting the results they wanted. It wasn’t nice to see them getting criticised. Now a new manager has come in and hopefully, they’ll get the results they want and push further up the table, where they deserve to be, but everyone knows how good he (Pochettino) is as a manager. For sure he will be successful wherever he goes in the future. Obviously it was the chairman’s decision to let the manager go. That’s football. It happens. Players go, managers go</p>

It’s a very difficult competition to win<br /><br />I knew when I left <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and I hadn’t been picked for the Nations League last summer that I had to perform better. I’ve had plenty of chats about that with the staff at England. I want to play at the highest level for as long as I can in order to play for England. That’s my objective. There is no bigger moment for me than representing my country. I just need to perform well, I know what I need to do, because there are so many right-backs know. There are about six right-backs and they are all playing at the highest level. I just need to focus on myself. <b>[Moving to Atletico]</b> is a big change, different culture, different types of football, but I am loving every minute of it and hopefully my performances for Atletico can keep me in the England squad.</p>

  <p><b>[Kieran Tripper has responded to <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s criticism of <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>’s preferred style of play in the Champions League]</b> If you go there and go toe-to-toe with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, you’re going to get beat 6-0. I don’t know what people expect. You see pundits complaining because we did defend, but did they expect us to go there and play attacking football, especially with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> playing the way that they’re playing at the moment? You need to go there with a plan and we did that. We did have to defend, but the most important thing is that we got the win.<br /><br />We knew they would blow up because of the amount of pressure they’d applied and the amount of energy they’d put into the game. We knew they’d slow down. It took us over 100 minutes, but we won 3-2. People can complain as much as they want, but we thought it was necessary for that type of game. As I’ve got older it has stopped bothering me. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> didn’t put their chances away and we beat them in both legs. It worked and that’s what football is about</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> star Kieran Trippier has urged Dwight McNeil to remain at Turf Moor]</b> Dwight has burst onto the scene, and when he trained with us last season for England he was brilliant. He’s got to stay focused, keep performing well while he’s young, and his time will come. I’d say ‘don’t rush anything, just keep playing’ and Dwight is at the right club to do that. He just needs to keep playing games, because that’s the most important thing for somebody his age. He’s got the right manager to guide him and he’ll be in no rush to go anywhere. If I was him I’d stay put and keep playing games.<br /><br />Sometimes it can be difficult when you go to another club. I’ve experienced it. I went to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and I didn’t play for months and you get frustrated. For somebody like him, who is doing really well, why would you move now? There’s no point. Just keep performing well on the biggest stage and stay put. I was in a different situation to him, I’d just been relegated so I needed to go to a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> club. He’s playing well week in week out for a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> club. He’s a big player for <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a>.

  <p><b>[Atletico Madrid defender Trippier slams <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> for forcing him to delay surgery]</b> I certainly feel I am a better player than I was last season at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. Last season was a difficult moment because I was struggling with injuries. It is not an excuse because I was not hiding about it. But I struggled for months with my groin and pelvis and I eventually had surgery just after the winter break in Spain in January. Because of the timing of the break and the operation I was only out for a few weeks and now I feel so much better. I should have had it last season at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> but people didn’t want me to have it then. I had so many issues with the last season there and about the way I performed and struggled with injuries. It got to a point where I had to have surgery this season and really I should have had it done last season. But there were so many important games…I don’t really want to go into it.<br /><br />I am absolutely loving it at the moment and that is the most important thing. The culture and the football are so different to England. <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> is totally different to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I had to improve on my defending and that was ­something I openly admitted last season. And now I know there is no one better to learn from than ‘Mister’. He is ­unbelievable with the team and individually. It is a joy to play for him.</p>

  <p><b>[Trippier raring to go after ‘difficult’ recovery from injury that plagued him at Spurs]</b> For me personally, after my surgery, I was used to getting treatment every single day but obviously I couldn’t get that at home. It was difficult but always you find a way to train, keep yourself in the best possible shape so when you return, you’re ready to start the competition again. I feel very good to be back. It was very difficult not seeing team-mates, staff, and training every single day, but everybody understands the circumstances of the time. Obviously everyone’s excited. The team is just looking forward to getting ready for the game against Athletic and it’s important that we start the season off again strongly and try to win as many games as we can from now until the end of the season.<br /><br />I’ve played in some games where there have been no supporters before and it’s different. Obviously you want the fans there supporting you every single game, but everybody understands the circumstances at the moment and it’s important that everybody is safe. We’ll always try to find a way to win and the fans are always there watching on TV, so we have the full support from them back home</p>

  <p><b>[Kieran Trippier says he has mixed emotions about his last year at Tottenham]</b> I had mixed emotions throughout the season. Injuries played a massive part (on my form). I told them I needed surgery. I could have been less selfish, playing-wise. But I couldn’t help it that I was getting picked most of the games. I was playing some of them at 60 or 70 per cent. Maybe I should have taken a step back, but we had City in the Champions League, <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> … you want to play in these games. In March, April, I heard - through people I trust - they tried to offload me, offering me to clubs. So you’re getting mixed messages. If I play I’ll give my best, but that’s why I pulled the manager in pre-season and asked if I’m part of his plans. I did knock on his door and tell him ‘I’ve got the chance to go to <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>, (but) if I’m part of your plans I’ll stay’. He didn’t give me a yes or no in his office. So, as a player, you think ‘okay no problem’. I went to the chairman and said exactly the same. I haven’t really spoken to (Pochettino) since I left <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. I have a lot to thank him for. I’ve never once bad-mouthed him. I just told how it was<br /><br />For me personally, selling Mousa <a href="ousmane-dembele.html">Dembele</a> <b>[…]</b> you can ask anyone that’s played with him, he’s the best player I’ve ever played with. You can’t replace him. We sold him in January. I personally feel, if we kept him for a further five months, we would have done a lot better. I think we would have won the final</p>

He ranks as one of the best midfielders I’ve played with, but Mousa <b>[Dembele]</b> is Mousa and he’s on a different planet that guy. Even in training, he was in cruise control. Thomas is still a very young player and everyone loves him out here. Going to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> who knows? Obviously I want him to stay here because he’s a valuable member to our team. He speaks perfect English, very good English. I don’t think he’d have a problem with the Premier League<br /><br />He just asks what’s it like, the style of play, but a few players have. It doesn’t mean they are leaving by the way!
