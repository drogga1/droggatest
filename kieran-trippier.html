  <p><b>[England star Kieran Trippier has admitted that he used to study David Beckham and Andrea Pirlo]</b> I used to watch Beckham and Andrea Pirlo. Players like that, they had a fantastic right foot on them, everyone knows that. Beckham was the one I always looked up to. The technique, his crossing, on the move or set pieces. He is the one I used to look up to on crossing the ball<br /><br />My delivery is something I always used to work on. Me and Steve Eyre the coach at Manchester City used to stay behind for ages, after more or less every session. You can always improve on everything, really, and crossing was the one I really wanted to work on. There is a lot of room for improvement for everybody, no matter who you are, so that is all I did really: practice. Literally near enough every day after training, we used to stay out and practice and practice<br /><br /><b>[Southgate’s 3-5-2 formation]</b> The formation is perfect for me. I can get forward as much as I can and try to get the crosses in and help my team as much as I can. If I manage to help them I am delighted. <b>[The set pieces]</b> depends on who you are playing too because you see Colombia, we changed our set pieces a bit because they have got big lads. And Panama are good in the air. It depends. It’s mainly just practising in different areas, putting mannequins in the way on the training field. Just practice really and being consistent</p>

  <p><b>[Kieran Trippier insists that he would never disagree with Christian Eriksen over the possibility of taking a free kick at Tottenham]</b> No way, I’m not like that. Fulham was my first game back and I felt good. Me and Christian, if we have a free kick and I place it but he says he fancies it then I’ll let him take it, no problem. No problem at all. If he came up to me and said: ‘I fancy this,’ I’d say: ‘Take it, mate.’.<br /><br />It’s a World Cup semi-final but the day before, and throughout the tournament really, there was me, Youngie <b>[Ashley Young]</b>, Trent <b>[Alexander-Arnold]</b> and a few other boys hitting free kicks well, to be fair. Before the game we were talking - which side did we want it on? - me and Youngie. It’s all about who feels confident at that moment in time and I said: ‘I feel confident, do you mind if I take it?’ And he said: ‘No problem at all.’ I’m happy it went in but frustrated and disappointed about the result<br /><br />Serge has come in, who is great competition, and Kyle Walker-Peters has been excellent in pre-season. He’s unbelievable and he deserves a mention because he works so hard on the training field and he deserves a lot of praise for the way he has conducted himself over the last 18 months. There are three of us trying to play in the right-back spot and that’s why you have to keep working hard, because the manager doesn’t miss a trick. If you’re off it, don’t complain if you’re not playing at the weekend</p>

  <p><b>[Kieran Trippier believes that Saturday’s Nations League clash against Spain will give the Three Lions the ideal opportunity]</b> You need to beat the best and Spain are one of the best in the world. In the World Cup, you can only play who you are drawn against. Obviously, Spain will be a big test and we want to play the likes of them to show that we are here and we are ready. We want to beat these teams, we want to beat the best and Saturday will be no different. So it’s an exciting one and we are all really looking forward to it, but we need to beat these sorts of teams if we want to be up there. Come Saturday, we’ll be ready and give everything to do that. We know the quality we have got in our dressing room and on our day we can beat anyone.<br /><br />The progress and the journey that we went on was fantastic but obviously we were disappointed to get beaten in the semi-final, given the way we started. But we overcame so many obstacles in that tournament and we have got to be proud of ourselves. The nation and the players are back. We’ve set the bar high at the World Cup with how well we did as a team and obviously we go into every tournament wanting to win it. Every opportunity we get, we always try to do the best we can for our fans and ourselves and the tournament in two years will be no different. If we get there, which we will do, we will go there wanting to win it</p>

  <p><b>[Kieran Trippier says England want to be the No. 1 team in the world]</b> You want to play against the best and we want to be the No. 1 team. It was a great night and we move forward now. We want to beat the big teams. In the past few games we have had draws and not scored, but I think last night we showed we can beat the top teams and defend well against the top teams. It was a statement last night and, ­hopefully, in the future, we can put performances in like this as well. We want to win every game and play like that in every game. We know how well we can play as a team and last night in the first half we showed that. It is something to build on, we have a lot of confidence going into the next games. We just have to keep working on our formation in training and, ­hopefully, on matchdays we can put out the performances. It is good to come to places like this for the young lads to get the experience and, obviously, for me as well.<br /><br />The players who came in the other day did very well and we have got so much young talent coming through into what’s already a young team. It is a bright future for this England squad. We learned a lot as a group and individuals at the World Cup. The manager has changed the formation and I think it releases the forwards more to press. Maybe sometimes at the World Cup, we were getting dominated in possession, but in this system that we are playing now, the midfielders can press easier higher up the field and we can play better. In the past two games, we played fantastic against difficult opponents as well</p>

  <p><b>[Kieran Tripper has claimed his Tottenham team-mate Heung-min Son is amazing]</b> If you look at Son, he’s played in three major tournaments this season and he still looks fresh. He’s come back and scored goals and topped it off with the result the other night which was amazing.<br /><br />The past few weeks have been very good. We could have played a lot better, we all know that, but the results are the most important thing. We’ve had a few injuries recently and the people that have stepped in have done really well<br /><br />It took me a good 16 months to settle in at Tottenham. But what Pochettino does really well is developing players and getting them to play for their national teams. His record speaks for itself - he’s got five in the Tottenham squad now and the same happened at Southampton. He makes players become bigger and better. He helped me develop as an attacker. He sets everything out day by day in training perfectly for the lads, the sessions are unbelievable</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham defender Kieran Trippier has credited Sean Dyche with helping turn his career around]</b> He helped me a lot. I was still going out when I was younger - drinking - and I wasn’t looking after myself properly. He came in and sorted it all out. The gaffer was a quality manager to play for; he taught me how to become a better defender as well as a better attacker. We were close when I was at Burnley and I would love to play for him again one day. We usually talk once every two weeks, just to keep each other updated on things. We’ve always stayed in contact, we’ve always had that kind of relationship. We’ve probably become even closer since I left. We just have that understanding, I think everybody that plays for him does. Hopefully one day it will happen; never say never.<br /><br />My career has totally changed. Burnley helped me get to where I am and I’ll never forget that. I’ll always be thankful to them. It would be nice to think that I could play for Burnley <b>[again]</b> one day. I still look out for them, of course I do. I experienced so much there, getting promoted and almost staying up. It’s always nice to go back to Turf Moor. That’s where it all began for me. But we need to get the win</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham right-back Kieran Trippier has admitted he has not been at his best in 2018-19]</b> I could have done a lot better this season. I’ve picked up a lot of injuries and there’s been games when I’ve looked back and watched, and thought ‘I could have done this better’, ‘I could have done that better’. It’s all about learning, but I admit I could have done a lot better. I am here now and I need to try to impress to try and start for England and try and do the best I can with every opportunity I get between now and the end of the season. It’s just one of those things, it just happens. You know when you’ve had a bad game. You can always improve, and we’ve got a good manager back at the club. He sits us down individually and as a group, shows where you could have done better, and with a good manager like that you can always only learn.<br /><br />Obviously, it’s a long World Cup getting to the semis and stuff. The Premier League come around straight away, but it’s what we do it. It’s our job. If we get picked, we all want to play. People can say the World Cup is the reason why, but, for me personally, I don’t think it was. I think it’s just one of those things, you pick up injuries. Obviously rest is the most important thing and it would have been nice to get an extra week or something, but the season came around early, so you’ve just got to get on with it</p>

  <p><b>[Kieran Trippier and Moussa Sissoko were disappointed with Tottenham’s slow start in their 1-0 first-leg semi-final loss to Ajax]</b> It was a difficult first 20, 25 minutes. We just couldn’t close them down as we like to, the pressing that we do week in, week out. I thought we gradually got into the game and kept on pushing. We did everything to try and equalise in the second half. It’s only 1-0, we go to their place next week and hopefully we can get a performance. Obviously Sonny (Son Heung-min) and H (Harry Kane) are massive players for us, especially with the attacking outlet that they’ve got - Sonny running in behind and Harry’s goals, but we always believe as a team that the players coming in can step up. Fernando <b>[Llorente]</b> has scored crucial goals and Lucas <b>[Moura]</b> has been fantastic for us but Sonny’s back for the next leg and we’ll go out there and give everything we’ve got. Of course we still believe we can win the Champions League, we all believe, we have belief in the squad. Next Wednesday we’ll go there with nothing to lose and try to score as many goals as we can like we did at Man City. Anything can happen.</p>

I don’t know the timescale with his injury but obviously we’re all hoping he can be back because of his presence, even here at half-time, he’s coming in going mental at us because we can do better which we all knew. But this is what we need, the leadership that he has, the way he came in at half-time. He wasn’t happy and we all knew that. He just gives us that extra lift because his presence is massive for us.</p>

It is just a few things, I tried to speak to the chairman I just didn’t really get an answer<br /><br />We all did so well at the World Cup but I didn’t have the best season after. It wasn’t an easy decision. I love <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but I’m in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> now and loving it. I set the bar high at the World Cup and they knew how well I could do but I just feel that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> probably got rid of me at the wrong time because I just needed that four-week rest for recovery because I was struggling with injuries to come back, fresh, ready. So maybe I could have stayed, but I’ve got no regrets<br /><br /><b>[Trippier still it was still heartbreaking to hear the news]</b> I had a chat with Gareth, 40 minutes on the phone. I was sat in my bedroom. I was devastated. I was expecting it because of my performances. There’s competition everywhere so not getting back int the squad does play at the back of your mind. There’s four right-backs who are doing very well for their clubs so you need to play well to stay in the England team</p>
