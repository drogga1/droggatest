<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Marko Grujic urged to find Liverpool exit but avoid Lazar Markovic mistake. Zoran Stojadinovic said]</b> Grujic has to go somewhere in January in a loan, in a team where he will play. It must be an English club, so as not to make a mistake like Lazar Markovic did<br /><br />Had Lazar been my client, I would never advise him to leave England. He changed the country, the style of football, the temperament, the climate, and therefore his return to Liverpool was an impossible mission. To return to Grujic, he is very much appreciated in Liverpool and therefore he did not go anywhere because they did not want to let him go. But he needs more minutes in the field and that’s why the loan is the best solution for him in January to return to Liverpool after his return to the starting line-up</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool midfielder Marko Grujic has joined Cardiff City on loan]</b> We jointly agreed that Cardiff is the best solution. The club is fighting to be in the Premier League, believing that Grujic is what they lack.</p>
