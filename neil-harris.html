  <p><b>[Cardiff struck three times in the final 21 minutes to win their play-off battle with Preston 3-1 at a rain-lashed Deepdale]</b> It’s a huge win for us. We felt it was really vital that we followed up the performance and result against <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> with another solid one today. It’s a big confidence boost for us and pushes us in the right direction<br /><br />What pleased me most was the character. When you are 1-0 up away from home you want to see it out. To bounce back, like we did after they equalised so quickly, and go on score two more goals is testament to my players’ character</p>

  <p><b>[Cardiff and Charlton saw their 100 per cent records since football returned come to an end as the two Championship sides shared a goalless draw in the Welsh capital]</b> The euphoria of the last two games and my praise for the players was right, but we still have a long way to go and that was shown tonight. We dominated the ball but lacked a killer instinct. Fair play to Charlton, we couldn’t break them down but I’m pleased with a clean sheet and some individual performances</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="aleksandar-mitrovic.html">Aleksandar Mitrovic</a> scored on his return for Fulham as they climbed up to third in the Championship with a 2-0 win over Cardiff]</b> It was disappointing to lose the game as there wasn’t a lot in it. First half I thought Fulham shaded it, but second half we had a strong performance. But it was fine lines. I was disappointed to concede the penalty. Experience outweighed a bit of naivety at the back post, but I thought it was cheap. But then we might have got away with one in the second half. We played with a lot of bravery in the second half, but we didn’t do enough in the penalty area, and that’s where games are won and lost. Fulham were better in both areas</p>

  <p><b>[A <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> mistake all but ended Derby’s promotion hopes as Cardiff consolidated their position in the Championship play-offs with a 2-1 home victory]</b> Any team who is going to dominate the ball like Derby did there are going to be times when you get the ball and have time and space to play. If you do that you are going to get chances, and when you do you have to take those chances<br /><br />We knew we had to stop <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> having time and space on the ball. We did that and Lee then had to provide the finish, which he did exceptionally well</p>
