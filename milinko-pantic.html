<blockquote>
  <p>[Former Atletico Madrid midfielder Milinko Pantic believes VAR is a great way to achieve justice in the game] I am the only one who has scored four goals for Barcelona at the Camp Nou. I know there are other players who have achieved it but nobody as a visitor. What can I say about that? It still hurts me a lot. Especially for me, I think football was not fair to me that day but we have to admit that Barcelona had a great team.<br /><br />[When asked about VAR and the goal, Pantic said he was certain it would have been ruled out under review] Absolutely yes, because there was offside on the goal by Juan Antonio Pizzi. I’m very sure that it would have changed<br /><br />It’s a wonder, for the poor it’s a great invention. We’ve won the lottery. Because it’s been seen that more justice is being done, and that’s why I’m in favour. And it’s very fun and I’m convinced that as time goes on it will go improving, it will be faster. We just live the first year with VAR but I like it a lot<br /><br />[Simeone] has players like Koke and Saúl Ñíguez who are fantastic, world-class players like Antoine Griezmann, budding phenomena like Rodrigo, expensive players like Thomas Lemar, Vitolo, who I loved during his time at Sevilla. You can not say that you do not have players for anything else. There are many good players, so I think the team could play better. They have to achieve their goals because they are very complete players, Any of them can play in the top teams. I think this is the best Atlético team in history and I’m not the only one who thinks that<br /><br />It’s hard to compare. We played different football. I’m a coach and I always say that each team is the reflection of their coach, Ours was Antic’s mirror and this is Simeone’s, which is totally different. In a matchup, I’d say our team because it was a humble team, without stars, but we knew what we wanted on the field</p>
