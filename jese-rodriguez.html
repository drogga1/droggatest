  <p><b>[Jese Rodriguez believes he’d be an undisputed starter at Real Madrid were it not for his 2014 cruciate ligament injury]</b> I have thought about it. And I’ve never liked comparing myself to anyone, but I think I would be an undisputed starter for Real Madrid. Of that I’m sure.<br /><br />I did not expect it and I do not feel good. We have lost all four matches and I have not scored a goal. Things have not turned out the way we wanted them to, but I feel even worse because the team is creating really good chances. Let’s see if we can end this streak, we have played some good teams and good players<br /><br />No, clearly not. I owe Real a lot, they are the team that welcomed me, as a person and as a young footballer. I owe them a lot and, out of respect and admiration, I wouldn’t celebrate</p>

  <p><b>[Stoke City have announced that Jese Rodriguez’s loan spell at the club has been terminated]</b> In order to respond to recent press speculation surrounding Jese Rodriguez, we would like to confirm that the Club has given Jesé permission to take unpaid compassionate leave until the end of the season for personal reasons and therefore he will not be returning to Stoke during his loan period</p>

  <p><b>[Jese Rodriguez has expressed his disappointment at being let down by supposed friends at Real Madrid]</b> When you leave the club you realize plenty of things. But this is not a critic, everybody can do what they want to do. I thought I had friends in Madrid’s dressing room and I was wrong. They are not friends anymore because they didn’t reply to my messages or ask me how I was<br /><br />I’m now training with the person who was working with me prior to the injury. Other than training with the team, I also do a personalised session with him and another one at home. I’ve dropped seven kilos. <b>[Thomas]</b> Tuchel said a month ago during a team meeting that I was a good example for the rest of the squad because of how I am responding to my situation within the club. He thanked me<br /><br />What I regret the most is not taking advantage of the moments I had in Madrid after the injury. I’ve been thinking and I admit that had I taken things as seriously as I’m taking them right now…Then I came to Paris, I had surgery and was out for two months, never played on a consistent basis. Had I been as disciplined after the injury in Madrid maybe my career would’ve been different</p>

  <p><b>[Jese Rodriguez said he is relishing the chance to play for Portuguese giants Sporting CP after speaking to <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>]</b> I am very happy for the opportunity Sporting CP is giving me. It is a historic club in Portugal. I have a friend named <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> who has always told me very good things about this club, which created him from a young age. I am very excited to start training with my colleagues. I have seen the players the team have and I think we can do something important. We will fight for all competitions. With joy and work we can achieve good things<br /><br /><b>[On <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> superstar <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>]</b> He told me it was a very important club for him and he was very fond of Sporting CP</p>
