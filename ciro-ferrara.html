  <p><b>[Juventus coach Ciro Ferrara is clinging onto his job at the club as he tries to salvage their season against Inter in the Coppa Italia]</b> I don’t feel sacked. Please don’t make me say something against <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, I wouldn’t even do so even if they sacked me. It’s not a problem for me and I don’t care about this at all. I have always been considered well. In 20 years of <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> this is my first bad moment and I accept it. But, I will not take it out on the club. I don’t think the club has disowned me in front of the team. I have professional people here and they know we cannot say it’s finished until it is finished<br /><br /><b>[Ferrara insists he will not leave his post and he is ready to fight on despite what seems to be a losing battle]</b> I just have to switch on the tv to understand what is going on. I have not received any communication from the club, therefore I will go to the <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a> with the professionalism. When I am told something then I will react differently. I have respect for this club and I will continue to work until someone tells me otherwise. I am not thinking about resigning from here. I am tranquil. Everyone here is on my side. I need to work harder and improve the situation. This has not happened yet, but I am not ashamed</p>

  <p><b>[Italy Under-21 Boss Ciro Ferrara Happy To Be Coaching Again]</b> I wanted to return to coaching, at whatever level <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> or Serie B. I continue my career with enthusiasm. I feel positive. It is a new adventure for myself and the young lads, many of whom were already a part of the Under-21 team. We have the desire and the right atmosphere to make this journey together. Until June, the friendly matches will represent important opportunities to gain knowledge and construct a good team. I have studied the team and the players have studied me. I am proud and happy with this job</p>

We controlled the ball well and could have even scored more. I have to congratulate my players. Now we must rest and then think about the game against Germany on Tuesday</p>

  <p><b>[When asked if <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> may feel apprehensive in working with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>]</b> Well, actually I think it should be <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> who feels intimidated by <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>, rather than it being the other way around.<br /><br />Obviously this is a new role for <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> so he has to, slowly, match after match, through the words he says to his squad, gain their trust. Even though at the moment he probably already has their complete and undivided trust, something you automatically have after having been a true legend like Zizou<br /><br />After that he is going to have to find the right way to transfer his philosophies, maybe not many at the start. Especially because it isn’t like in Italy, where managers tend to focus a lot on tactics, in Spain they tend to do it much less. But I’m sure that <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> will have a few tactical ideas that he picked up during his years in <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> which he will want to tell his side.<br /><br />I don’t think that <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zizou</a> will ever go to <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and tell him: ‘Look, you need to kick the ball in this way’ or go to <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a> and tell him how to defend. The players already know what to do and it is then up to the former greats to show intelligence, in order to simply help them get better<br /><br /><b>[Ferrara does not agree that <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>, along with other former great players, was destined to become a successful coach]</b> Well, I think that this is actually a myth, that great champions all want to become managers. I have played alongside great champions and I felt like this was actually the case. They are obviously players that like to have responsibilities on the pitch, even sometimes tweaking a certain aspect of their game that maybe eluded their managers.<br /><br />After that it is up to the players to be able to make these calls, and <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zizou</a> has incredible players at his disposal and this is going to be a great advantage obviously for him<br /><br /><b>[Ferrara himself took charge of <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> for an ill-fated spell in the 2009-10 campaign]</b> Honestly I don’t know why, but I noticed this statistic a few days ago. Some have had more luck than others, say, like me, for instance!<br /><br />It might be because in those years we had a manager to whom we were very attached and who managed to impart some of his knowledge. But it might also just be coincidence, too.<br /><br />Obviously the image and the role of the manager is completely different. You can’t think about your own individual performance any more, but instead have to think about all 25 players on your team. And it doesn’t stop there as you need to deal with the fan base, the club and even with the media.<br /><br />That of the manager is a completely different world from that of the player. When you shift from the pitch to the dugout, with all of the pressure that goes with it, you can’t for example take for granted that your players are capable of doing certain things, even if they are top players. Having said this I feel like <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> is going to be able to get through to his players - as I said before, having such a strong team already he would just need to teach the group a few important, yet very clear, concepts</p>

  <p><b>[Ciro Ferrara says <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> star <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> will be fired up by <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> anger]</b> The first time I went back, I was welcomed in a nice way, but then something changed. Maybe because, for personal reasons, younger fans only remember me as a <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a> player and not as the defender who won the Scudetto with <b>[Diego]</b> <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>. I expect a varied welcome <b>[for <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a>]</b>, somewhere between indifference and whistles. I really hope that, beyond the predictable whistling, there’s some space for some witty, subtle teasing. I hope that education and respect prevail.<br /><br />I don’t know <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> personally but I know for a fact that a champion of his calibre will not be scared or intimidated by a hostile atmosphere. After all, he’s already scored against <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> in a <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> shirt, though it’s true that that was at the <b>[Juventus]</b> Stadium and not the San Paolo<br /><br />Experience tells me that games like these two upcoming ones give a real lift to champions, and <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> is one of those. The jeers could be a huge motivation</p>
