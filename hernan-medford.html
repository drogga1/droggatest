  <p>[CCL still ultimately comes down to one question: Can someone outside of Liga MX win it?] We’re looking for Costa Rica to once again have the Concacaf champion. It’s not easy, but it’s also not impossible. What’s the key? A bit of luck? No, it’s not luck. Only three teams in Concacaf have finished third in the world. One was my team when I managed Saprissa in 2005. After that Monterrey and Pachuca. Has it been tough for us to get back to being champions? Yes, it’s been tough. The last champions have all been Mexican. But we’re here to change history, and the idea is to be able to change it at this stage</p>

  <p>[Hernan Medford is expecting an enormous challenge from Atlanta United] I was part of 2005 with Saprissa when we were champion and got third place in the world, which is something historic for a Concacaf team. I want to repeat that feat with Herediano. We start with a difficult team in Atlanta who has done things really well and is still evolving. The atmosphere there is really good. They won’t have the same coach, Tata, but I’ve always said between the manager and the football player makes up 80 percent. So, I think Atlanta is going to have almost their same team and we’re expecting a really complicated side.<br /><br />It already was the third time! I’m not trying to say that Atlanta isn’t going to be difficult but we wanted something different now. It’s going to be complicated, and we have to prepare for the game really well, get motivated to win because every game is a final and they have a team that can win.<br /><br />Maybe as a team they haven’t done it but when you look at the individual players, a lot of them have played this type of tournament. So, I don’t think it makes a difference. I think it’ll be a level match and we’ll see who is better<br /><br />We can’t deny that teams from Mexico, in MLS, can bring in great players from abroad. The economic aspect really comes into play, which is too bad, but we have to believe that on the field everyone is equal</p>
