  <p>[Newcastle Jets have confirmed they have signed brothers Dimitri and Kosta Petratos for the 2017-18 A-League season] Dimitri will be a great asset to the club. It is good that some of the best players in the country want to come and play for the Jets. Kosta is an emerging talent. I have always said that I am keen to work with the best young kids in the country.</p>

  <p>[Newcastle Jets coach Mark Jones says a clear pre-match plan to unlock Melbourne City on the counterattack was vital to his side’s 2-1 win] We knew on the counter we could hurt them. We knew if we sat they would over-commit and we thought we could pick them off and score two or three goals. It’s worked out that way. We blocked a number of shots, we hung in the game and I thought we should have put it to bed [earlier].<br /><br />[on Andrew Nabbout] He had plenty of potential, he just needed to play regular football. He’s playing regular football and he’s showing what he can do. In Malaysia we pushed him to get up and back and work hard and that’s carried over to here</p>

  <p>[Newcastle Jets coach Mark Jones has backed FFA’s decision to postpone Saturday’s match against Melbourne Victory due to extreme heat] It just means we get a little bit more time to prepare. Obviously, a little bit inconvenient but these things happen. It’s better than playing in 42-degree heat, obviously.<br /><br />We’ve had to do that before and we’ll manage that</p>

  <p>[Both coaches were left frustrated after Monday night’s 0-0 draw between Newcastle Jets and Melbourne Victory in the A-League] I’m very frustrated that we didn’t win the game. In the general balance of play, I thought we had more shots and more crosses. We had enough possession and did enough to win the game.<br /><br />[Adelaide and Central Coast are the bottom two sides in the A-League table] It’s a good time for us. We’ve got to seize the moment and we’ve a great opportunity to make the six if we play well</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Newcastle Jets coach Mark Jones has laid down the gauntlet to Aleksandr Kokko to build on his maiden A-League goal] I talked to [Kokko] about being effective and if he’s going to play he needs to score goals, and for that matter, that’s anyone who plays nine or 10. We haven’t scored enough goals from that area in comparison to other teams and we need someone to stand up. Basically, I’m not too fussed on who does it - someone has to stand up and score those goals</p>

  <p>[Newcastle Jets coach Mark Jones can’t wait for the introduction of Video Assistant Referees in the A-League after he and Jason Hoffman were sent off against Brisbane Roar] I hope [the introduction of VARs] is in sooner rather than later because they are the sorts of decisions that can be reviewed and hopefully corrected.</p>
