  <p><b>[They will want to be far higher in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and winning titles again]</b> The discussion as so often with United is about recruitment - sometimes they want a director of football, sometimes they do not. And the question has to be raised as to why they did not get that Fernandes deal over the line in the summer?<br /><br />Can you imagine the difference he might have made to <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> and where United would have been if he had been there the complete season? Some United fans are even saying his impact is on a par with <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a> 28 years ago and maybe we will look at this period in the coming months and years as being a key point in raising the fortunes of United<br /><br />Because, if we look back to where United were in January when he joined, that home defeat to <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> was a real low point and <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>â€™s position was under threat. And now, these other positions do need addressing going forward, another centre back maybe, looking at the goalkeeping position long term<br /><br />But how are those decisions being made and do they still need to have a bigger overhaul or reassessment of how recruitment is being made at United going forward. They will want to ensure that while it was a success to get Fernandes in in January, they do not make the same mistake in the future as they look to go a lot higher than fifth<br /><br />And while they might be in those Champions League places now, they want to be far higher in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and making sure they are in the Champions League every year and winning titles again</p>
