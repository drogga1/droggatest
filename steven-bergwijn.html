  <p><b>[A summer move would mean the end of an eight-year spell at PSV for the 21-year-old and he has fond memories of his time in the club’s academy, highlighting the warm atmosphere as a particular plus]</b> Things are just really friendly and down to earth here. It’s a very warm and friendly club. You feel at home straight away at PSV. That was important for me and I think it is important for everyone.</p>

  <p><b>[Inside PSV academy graduate Steven Bergwijn’s rise to the European top]</b> Leaving Amsterdam wasn’t that difficult to be honest, because my parents always supported me and drove me to Eindhoven and back all the time. It did take a bit of time to get used to my new surroundings. You obviously end up in a different city, with different people. But they gave me a warm welcome.<br /><br /><b>[Inevitably, Europe’s finest came knocking, but the ambitious youngster had no intention of leaving PSV Eindhoven just yet]</b> No, I did not really consider leaving. I was obviously still quite young and I really wanted to make it into the first team here<br /><br /><b>[He would soon find out that there was a significant difference between breaking into the first team and becoming a key figure]</b> I would play one day, then sit on the bench the next and be back with Jong PSV again another week. That was quite difficult for me. You just have to be patient, though. PSV always wanted me to take things one step at a time and take it easy. But in the end, you’ve all got to do it on your own. I never doubted myself. I have always been saying that I would make it as a professional player<br /><br /><b>[One of the coaches taking Bergwijn under his wing during those difficult days was Ruud van Nistelrooy]</b> I worked with him at the U-19 team and he was part of the coaching setup in 2017-18 as well. I learned a lot from him, especially when it comes to finishing.<br /><br /><b>[Van Nistelrooy himself, meanwhile, has been impressed with Bergwijn’s development in recent years]</b> I think he’s shown great development over the last three years. He’s playing more and more minutes every season. He’s playing every game now, he’s decisive with goals and assists. He’s got a lot of personality as well, he’s got a very strong character, so he’s definitely one of the players with great potential<br /><br /><b>[With 15 goals and 13 assists from 41 appearances in all competitions in 2018-19, there is no denying Bergwijn has indeed become a decisive player for PSV under head coach Mark van Bommel]</b> I have a good relationship with Van Bommel. It’s hard to describe what it is that makes him such a good coach. Sometimes it almost feels like he is one of us. He knows what’s on our minds and what we’re thinking about. He obviously used to be a player himself as well. That definitely makes a difference. It just helps in the relationship between players and coach<br /><br /><b>[His sublime performances have earned Bergwijn comparisons with Memphis Depay]</b> I’ve heard that comparison a lot of times. Memphis is a fantastic player, so it’s a compliment if people say that<br /><br /><b>[Following in the footsteps of Depay and moving to Old Trafford might be an intriguing option, but the 21-year-old is in no rush to make a move and has no plans of leaving PSV for just any club]</b> Manchester United are definitely a nice club. I am still only 21 and I am in no rush to leave PSV. It would have to be a good club that have a clear plan with me. I also think that when you join a new club, perhaps a better team, you automatically raise your game because of the level of the other players on the training pitch. If something good comes up, then yes, I would be ready for it. If that doesn’t happen, I will happily stay at PSV. I am happy here and feel comfortable at this club<br /><br /><b>[Regardless of whether a transfer happens this summer or not, Bergwijn is not afraid to set the bar high when it comes to his personal objectives]</b> I would love to win the Champions League, the Euros and the World Cup, all of them</p>

  <p><b>[Netherlands winger Steven Bergwijn has described Liverpool star Virgil van Dijk as an absolute beast]</b> Van Dijk is an absolute beast. Of course, it is good to be able to measure myself against him in training with the national team. But not just Virgil, they all play for massive clubs. I learn from all of them really. They all have a lot of experience and almost everyone plays for a big club.</p>

  <p><b>[When asked about interest from United, Steven Bergwijn previously told that Manchester United were a nice club, but that at his age he was in no rush to depart PSV]</b> Manchester United are definitely a nice club.

I also think that when you join a new club, perhaps a better team, you automatically raise your game because of the level of the other players on the training pitch.

  <p><b>[PSV star Steven Bergwijn has signed a new five-year contract as the Eredivisie giants appear to have warded off interest from Bayern Munich and Manchester United]</b> This is the right decision. I had other options, but in the end everything has to fit well for me, but also for PSV. The result is that I’m staying here, with a lot of joy and confidence. That means I’m feeling well here and I’m not done learning. I get to play for trophies here and feel very at home in Eindhoven</p>

  <p><b>[Steven Bergwijn has denied claims he refused to play for current club <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> in order to force through a move]</b> Good evening <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> fans. A lot was said about me, I’ve read all of it and I’m disappointed with how this went down. None of it is true, I never refused to play for <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> and I would never do so in the future. The media is twisting this whole story; I called the coach this morning and said some things are going on and he gave his permission.

I’m happy I can give them this back. When I was a young boy I looked to the coach, like ‘oh it’s Mourinho’, now I play for him. You have to believe in yourself and I know what I can bring for this club. I’m good with the ball, I can score. They play good football and that’s what I like. To play here is a dream for me.

And I said: ‘OK, watch me, I’m going to score.’ I did it. When I heard Appie had brain damage, I just can’t describe my feelings. At that time I didn’t sleep so much.
