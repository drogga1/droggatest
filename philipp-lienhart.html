<blockquote>
  <p>[Cristiano Ronaldo is a ‘great role model’] He’s very ambitious and always wants to win, and his work on and off the pitch, for example, in the gym, is extremely impressive. Cristiano is a great role model, especially for the younger players, and he always helped me wherever he could, so, if there were any problems, I could always come to him.<br /><br />[On working under Zidane] It was a wonderful experience. Of course, I tried to implement all the tips he gave me, so I just wanted to take as much of his advice as possible<br /><br />At first I was a bit shocked, but then, of course, I was incredibly happy. It’s really not commonplace. If you get the chance to play for Real Madrid, that’s not a difficult decision. My goal was to give the best impression in the game and in training so that they would make a firm commitment to me, and the fact that they actually took that step to sign me made me very happy. That was also a personal success for me as I fought very hard and worked to get that move</p>
