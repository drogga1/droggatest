  <p><b>[Kushal Das - D license coaching course will be available in Hindi]</b> The ‘D’ coaching license course will start in Hindi. It is very clear to us that we have to be vernacular. Hindi is the starting point. Eventually the plan is to introduce the course in more languages like a Bengalli or a a Malayalam.<br /><br />This is what we have been discussing. We must get our Indian coaches up to the level. We have cooperation agreements with the French, German and Japanese Football Associations. We want to start an exchange programme. We are in the process of identifying 10-to-15 young Indian coaches who understand the modern philosophy. We cannot only rely on foreign coaches<br /><br />Savio is a fantastic person. He was the assistant coach of India under Bob Houghton. I gave him the opportunity to be the head coach and his knowledge of the game is very good. He has been handling coach education for long. We cannot always have a foreign technical director. No country which is developed in football does that. They may have one foreign possibly to be the national coach. However, more and more roles has to be eventually filled up by Indian coaches</p>
