  <p><b>[New York City FC has signed MLS veteran Rodney Wallace]</b> It’s a great honor to be an NYCFC player - it’s a dream come true to get this done and be here with such a great organization and a good team. I’ve watched a lot of the NYCFC games since the team came to the league and I was attracted to the style of play. I want to win trophies with this club, I want to come here and add to a bigger piece. We all want to achieve big things together and I’m just really happy to be here and to work towards that.</p>

  <p><b>[How Ronald Matarrita convinced Rodney Wallace to join NYCFC]</b> <b>[Matarrita]</b> was the first person I called as soon as I found out they had interest and told him the situation. Right away he pushed for it to happen because he’s a player that’s been on the team. They know him and trust him, and have confidence in what he had to say.<br /><br /><b>[Portland]</b> had interest in me since November, but I was still under contract with <b>[Sport Recife]</b> and was trying to figure out how to get out of that deal. Towards the end, the window of opportunity for that situation just kept getting smaller and smaller and at the same time <b>[the Timbers]</b> were making their moves. This opportunity came about where New York showed interested and for me it was a good opportunity that I wanted to explore. Things just started happening faster with New York, and I was able to get out of my contract with Brazil<br /><br />Once they reached out, they were pretty consistent and persistent with their approach and their interest. As a player you want to be somewhere where you’re valued, and where they believe in you, and ultimately it felt like New York was that place for me<br /><br />They’re a team that was close to doing it last year, and now they’ve added more pieces, which just shows their ambition to win. You always want to be a part of that</p>

  <p><b>[NYCFC newcomers Wallace, Moralez shine in romp over DC United]</b> The game plan was to come out from the start and force them to make mistakes, and I thought we did that. We needed to be more ruthless against Orlando and you saw the difference today, both in the attack and defensively.<br /><br />I had a short preseason and I believe that I’m still getting to my top shape. I’m taking it obviously week by week and game by game, but today was personally a good game for me. I think I have a long way to go, but right now I’m just focusing on getting better and getting fitter</p>

  <p><b>[Rodney Wallace should thrive on the small field, where his tireless two-way work can be even more effective]</b> It definitely works in your favor because you don’t get as tired. It will take some getting used to, but you can tell the guys are already used to it.</p>
