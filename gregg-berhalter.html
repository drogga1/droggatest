  <p><b>[Berhalter leaving the door open for Johnson to make USMNT return]</b> I was in Germany a couple weeks ago and I was able to meet with Fabian and talk to him about how he’s doing and his international career and his thoughts moving forward, and he’s a guy that still is available.<br /><br />I spoke to him and said, ‘Listen, if you’re needed, we’ll certainly look at you and bring you in.’ I’m very comfortable with Fabian and what he’s done. I’ve known him for a long time. I’ve probably known him for 12 years. I played with him in Germany and I left the door open and I said, ‘We’ll stay in contact’<br /><br /><b>[Even with his willingness to return, and his relationship with Berhalter, Johnson still faces an uphill battle to still be a viable option by the 2022 World Cup, when he would be close to 35]</b> When I look at his profile and look at his position and being an outside back and the demands of an outside back and I’m projecting towards 2022, he’s one that’s right on the borderline. It’s a tough one. Having said that, I said, ‘Listen, we’re not closing the door. We’ll leave it open but here’s where we’re at right now’</p>

  <p><b>[United States national team coach Gregg Berhalter said Wednesday that he and his staff are continuing to watch LA Galaxy teenager Efrain Alvarez and said the 16-year-old will get an opportunity with the U.S. if he continues to excel]</b> Regarding Efrain, for us it’s been interesting to watch from the background because he’s a guy that has taken a pathway that, you’d call it a somewhat normal pathway although it’s been accelerated. He started out in the academy of LA Galaxy, he played there, he went to the second team of LA Galaxy, he did really well with the second team and now he’s making an impact with the first team. That’s exactly what we want to see continuing. It would be great that he continues to chip away and get playing time and now can be a consistent performer for one of the top clubs in MLS<br /><br />We’ll be there watching the whole thing, and when he’s doing what we expect him to do, there will be an opportunity for him with the U.S. national team. Regarding a potential choice for him, we want to create an environment that players want to be in. We want to create a playing style, a team spirit that players want to be a part of. If we do, we’re confident we can get players like that and keep players like that in our program<br /><br />We’re not necessarily looking at these players as solely dual national players. We’re looking at them as players. There’s a universe of players that are eligible to play for the United States. We’re looking at all of those guys. I think that’s an important process<br /><br />I’ve said all along that every player has their own pathway. What I want for my players - each and every one of them - is that they can maximize their own potential, so then they have different ways to do that. For some of them it’s going to be going to an <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> academy, playing for an <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> second team and signing with an <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> first team really developing that way. For other guys it’s going to be different pathways and it is going to be going to Europe or it is going to be playing at a mid-level team in Europe and then making a jump from there. Every player has a different pathway</p>

  <p><b>[Curacao squad that is arguably the toughest team the Americans will have faced so far in the tournament]</b> I don’t ‘think’ (Curacao) could be a dangerous team, they ARE a dangerous team. It’s a good team, a lot of flexible movements offensively. They get into high positions with their fullbacks. The wingers are tucking inside, overloading the middle of the field and they have good players</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT vs Curacao. If Curacao’s qualification was only sealed at the last gasp, the U.S had the luxury of being able to rotate their entire squad for their last meeting against Panama]</b> The decision to start 11 new players was an easy one to be honest. We believe in the group, we believe in keeping the group together, we believe that everyone can contribute to this team for the team’s success, and we wanted to show that. The guys have been training really well and they deserved this opportunity</p>

Gregg Berhalter is bringing back his original 11 starters for Sunday’s quarterfinal clash against Curacao. Columbus Crew striker Gyasi Zardes has been given the nod over Jozy Altidore for the target striker role</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Pulisic dons the armband and leads by example in USMNT win against Curacao]</b> He’s a guy that can lead through performance. I talked to him about being captain in this game, and it was something that he readily accepted. You see his work. He’s a guy that - despite getting fatigued in the game - he didn’t stop working, and then he has the quality to give a great pass to Weston, an in-swinging cross. He was in on a number of other chances, shots from the top of the 18, had that other chance in the beginning of the game that was really close to going in, And his defensive work was excellent. Really happy with his performance, and that’s why he was captain, to be able to put in performances like that.</p>

  <p><b>[Perfect Gold Cup record hiding worrying flaws for USMNT]</b> I think we could have been more efficient with our midfield line, moving closer to our forwards to press more. I think we could have been tighter with our backline, pushing up more. We allowed too much space. We allowed them to play balls into the striker too easily, and that would have made things easier for us in the game.<br /><br /><b>[Berhalter did credit Curacao’s man-on-man approach for helping to disrupt the U.S. team’s tactical spacing]</b> We became disconnected, and a lot of times in build-up you saw either a 4-1-5, or a 3-1-6, where Michael <b>[Bradley]</b> would either drop on the other side of the attacking line and have only Weston <b>[McKennie]</b> central. Or Michael would be central and we’d have five guys high and that’s just not proper spacing. It becomes very difficult to get any type of offensive flow when that’s what your shape looks like<br /><br /><b>[Berhalter said of Jamaica]</b> It’s very similar opponent to what we’ve been seeing in terms of some strength, and some speed. Their wingers are high-quality players, I think they have maybe a different gear of speed than we’ve seen in this tournament in particular. That’s why it was good to see them in the beginning of June, to see what that looks like<br /><br /><b>[Berhalter said of Leon Bailey]</b> I don’t think we’ve seen his best yet. I think he’s got another gear. I’ve seen another gear in Germany. It’s just him getting integrated to the team, him feeling comfortable, him being used the right way<br /><br />The success of this team will be measured by whether we win this tournament or not. We want to get to the final, we want to win the final. If you asked me a month ago, the answer was still the same</p>
</blockquote>

<p>: 2019 07 04
Gregg Berhalter has used the same starting lineup for three of the U.S. national team’s four Gold Cup matches, but the challenge of short rest and a dangerous opponent in Jamaica should lead to at least a modest shake-up in personnel</p>

  <p><b>[Jamaica vs USMNT. The progress of the U.S. has been unconvincing, typified by their struggle to overcome minnows Curacao in the previous round]</b> We could’ve been more aggressive with that, for sure, and that’s something that I think about. Jamaica has quality. They’ve always had quality, especially in their attacking positions. When you talk about Leon Bailey or Dever Orgill, it’s a talented group of players.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Pulisic has registered a team-leading three goals and three assists for the USMNT so far in the Gold Cup]</b> When I think about this month for him it’s been a lot of personal development in terms of him blossoming with his personality within the group, his importance to the team on the field. The skills haven’t changed from a month ago, but in terms of his role, what he’s comfortable with, how he’s embracing his role within the team, and his role on and off the field, I think it’s been really nice to see.<br /><br />The most important thing we’ve focused on is giving Christian flexibility, putting him in position where he could affect the game in a number of different ways. We wanted to play him central, but also get him wide. When you think about him being central, arriving in the penalty box, the two goals (against Jamaica) were a result of him being in good positions to be able to finish off plays that end up in front of goal<br /><br />When you think about some of the assists he’s had they’ve come in wide areas, notably against Curacao. With Christian we know he’s a top talent and we want to get him into position to affect the game. We know he can affect the game on an individual level, and he’s shown that so far in the tournament</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico’s Tata Martino, USMNT’s Gregg Berhalter express mutual respect]</b> I really like him as a coach. I think he’s, first of all, a very nice person, a very good person. Also, the way his teams play, he’s very clear, very specific. He gets them to compete, there’s a very certain, specific intensity level that he gets with his teams. I really like the offensive transition that they perform. I really like the defensive pressing that they do. There’s nice interchanging movement on the wings - they get three players on the wings and that really create problems for each opponent. Overall, I have a lot of respect for him. His Atlanta teams really performed well. They had some good talent, and I’m looking forward to the match tomorrow</p>

  <p><b>[Gregg Berhalter watched his team attack Mexico’s defense relentlessly in the first half, creating chance after chance, but as those opportunities went unfulfilled]</b> It cost us a lot of energy to play the way that we were playing. We had very quick attacks. You can’t go from your goalkeeper and try to go to their goal 15-20 times a night. You need also to change the rhythm of the game, keep the ball, get them moving side to side, and we didn’t do that<br /><br />We felt like we had an advantage on them with speed, with quickness, and we definitely showed that in the first half. Again, as we continually try to have quick attacks it will cost energy in the end and Mexico, they stayed calm. Their experience really helped and they were able to keep moving us around and we lost some power<br /><br />Mexico definitely have an experienced team, but we have a quality team. We believe in a lot of the young players and we think at the end of the day we need to gain experience so a game like this is perfect for us. It was a big occasion, a lot of the player’s first time playing in a game like this and we need to learn. We weren’t ready for the step tonight but we will be ready. I think the guys will learn a lot from this game. There’s a lot of guys playing in their first game like this. For us, the whole month the focus was on making progress and when I look back and evaluate it I think we did make progress. This experience will help us moving forward</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT looking to rediscover intensity and send a message in Canada rematch]</b> Canada hadn’t beat us in 34 years and was playing like it. And for us to be successful in away matches, we need to match the intensity of our opponents and that’s been a consistent message in this camp. You would think that it would go without saying that we know that, right? That’s the logical thing to think, but when you think of seven players playing in their first away game, when you think about a coaching staff coaching in their first away game together, in a competitive Concacaf match, these are the things that go along with it. The message was received loud and clear<br /><br /><b>[Changing that perception starts on Friday. If the U.S. fails to secure all three points, Canada will move on in the Nations League]</b> We’re embracing it because that is our situation. When you look at the history of U.S. Soccer, we’ve been in games like this before. In the pre-Hex groups, we’ve been in must-win situations. In the Hex round, we’ve been in must-win situations. This is what builds the team and makes the team strong. We need matches like this.

Individually, can guys make a case for their involvement going forward?<br /><br />It’s a strong age group that we have right now. It would be nice to put these guys in position to compete in the Olympics. We’re not going to be able to pull from all of the players in this qualifying tournament, but nonetheless it’s still an opportunity for guys to step up and be battle-tested in a Concacaf qualifying format and learn from it.

  <p><b>[Gio Reyna has seized that opportunity, scoring a goal in the DFB-Pokal while emerging as one of <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>’s go-to supersubs]</b> They’re using him in a way where you know they’re not asking him to take full responsibility. He doesn’t have to carry a team. He’s playing a role, and he’s executing his role. What I really liked from him? His position when he gets the ball in the pocket, his awareness to turn and his efficiency and when he’s turning is excellent. He doesn’t waste any touches turning, he turns right away.<br /><br />Second thing is his ball security under pressure is phenomenal. And, you know, there’s a play against <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> where I mentioned he got the ball on the sideline. And <b>[Thomas]</b> <a href="thomas-meunier.html">Meunier</a>, and I forgot who the other player was try to close him down, and he just turns and gets out of pressure.<br /><br />He just did it with so much awareness, that it was really impressive.

I can see him playing as potentially a number 10 in a 4-3-3. He can play in a number of different positions. I like him being able to affect the game on the offensive side, similar to <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a>. They’ve been using on him on the left, (but) he can also play on the right, so I think he gives you flexibility<br /><br /><b>[Berhalter says that <a href="giovanni-reyna.html">Gio Reyna</a> would not have been released to join that group]</b> We talked about this a number of times about this throughout the course of last year and saying we want our younger players performing playing at a high level, and he’s doing that. And as a result of him doing that he gets an opportunity with the first team<br /><br />It was a collaborative process together with Jason. Jason’s taking the lead on who he prioritizes in each position, and then us deferring in some cases. Normally we’d love to have Reggie <b>[Cannon]</b> and Jackson Yueill come to Europe and play with us, but it was a priority of Jason to use them. And, we’re doing everything we can to support him and his group to qualify. It’s challenging, the qualifying process, with 17 players on the roster plus three goalies and there’s a lot of games in a short period of time.

  <p><b>[USMNT coach Berhalter sees improvement in Christian Pulisic]</b> When Christian was moving from <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> we knew there was going to be an adaptation period. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is an extremely fast and physical league, and we knew time would be needed for him to get up to speed. What I really like about how his season unfolded, particularly in the beginning, is that he had to endure adversity to overcome struggle. He had to get used to the English game. It took time, and as he did that he came out performing really well, helping the team and scoring goals and being influential. All these things we projected him being able to do took an understandable time period. When you go into the injury period he had, it’s unfortunate because he was in such good form. The next part of it was him dealing with a serious injury. He was in a lot of pain. It was a difficult injury to come back from quickly although I know the fans wanted him back<br /><br /><b>[Berhalter added on where <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Pulisic</a> has taken his game to even greater heights]</b> The thing he’s really improved on that I’ve seen this year is his finishing ability. He’s done a great job of that, and it’s something the high-level players, when you look at the top players in the world, they’re able to score a big number of goals because they have that finishing quality<br /><br />Some of his best actions for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have been when he’s central, playing the ball behind the line, combining and making things happen in a central position, but having moved inside from the wing. Both <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and us want him affecting the game, in a position where he can hurt the opponent. Sometimes it’s going to be wide, sometimes that’s going to be central. It’s a different <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> than we’re used to seeing. It’s interesting what they’re doing and that they’re still able to get results. They’ve done a great job of that with a young team. They have an athletic team with exciting players in key positions, and to me it’s been fun to watch. Christian has the quality that he can adapt with a more experienced team as well, but there’s a lot of room for these players to grow and he’s in a good spot</p>

They haven’t been creating a lot of chances, and that’s difficult for a striker. For him, it’s a case of hanging in there, continuing to do the things that got him to that level. It’s about continuing to think about his movement off the ball, how he’s moving in the penalty box, and when he gets opportunities, making the most of them<br /><br />After 25 minutes, I could see Josh suddenly closing down the central defender at pace because he wants to put pressure on. This means that the eight has to step out, then the six steps out, and <b>[Hertha winger Matheus]</b> Cunha comes into the danger area in behind. Sometimes we do not do things that are clearly discussed and that work well as a solution. And that drives me crazy. Why do you move away from the plan? So, Josh has to learn that to focus on completing the little things</p>
