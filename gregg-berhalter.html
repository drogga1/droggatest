  <p><b>[Columbus Crew lean on new-look defense to get back on track]</b> Last year at times we <b>[possessed the ball]</b> extremely well - in fact better than we have in the past. Where we got hung up and where we got in trouble was at times we didn’t fully commit to it, and I think that put us in a bad position. The beauty of this system is it needs all 11 players wanting the ball, wanting to open up, wanting to move and wanting to take chances.<br /><br />The first thing is identifying players that play in teams that have a similar philosophy. I think that’s very important. And the second thing is that as we’re recruiting a player, we ask them to watch some games of ours. We ask them to look at our system and see if it’s something they can imagine themselves fitting into<br /><br />Our objective is to maintain ball possession and disorganize the opponent. It just so happens that another way to do that is having them try to press you and being able to play out of a press. It makes the field that much bigger and gives us the opportunity to take advantage of that space there<br /><br />It’s very important for us to be able to play a high line and for us to be able to play with space behind us. A lot of times, if we have the ball, we advance into the opponent’s half and we need a physically imposing center back that can dominate on these possessions that we lose and the ball comes out. That’s one of the main strengths we saw in Jonathan - he’s a very good 1v1 defender, extremely strong, very hard to knock off the ball, very hard to gain position on<br /><br />I think it’s a great challenge, to be honest. It’s the type thing that gives you energy. You’re disappointed and you have to refocus and you have to get a group playing well again, and I’m excited about it</p>

You get to see what you need to improve on, you get to see the high level of competition, because we know they compete. If anything, I’m disappointed in the first 15 minutes of the game. We didn’t compete well enough. That kind of set the tone for what was going to happen later. Both teams wanted authority in the game, and they got it in the first 15 minutes.<br /><br /><b>[Ball movement]</b> just wasn’t quick enough. The space was there.

  <p><b>[Change of paths has Zack Steffen shining in Columbus]</b> Every player’s situation is different. Just because one guy makes it or doesn’t make it that doesn’t mean he can’t be a good, solid pro. I’ve spent enough time in Germany to know it’s not the easiest place in the world to live. The conditions can be difficult. If he didn’t feel his pathway was in Germany I commend him for changing it and altering it and looking for a place where he was going to get more playing time.<br /><br />People had a lot of confidence in what they thought he could be and maybe because he didn’t stay in Germany that hurt their opinion <b>[of]</b>. Maybe he has to build that back up<br /><br />For such a young goalkeeper he plays like he’s more experienced. He stays calm. He’s not flustered by big moments or big crowds and I think that’s important. Goalkeeper is a difficult position, especially in our system. We ask them to do a lot with their feet and we need them to be calm, and he’s done a great job of that<br /><br />As he continues to play people will realize how good of a goalkeeper he is. I think he certainly has that potential. As we do well as a team it will give him more exposure. He’s a good goalie and as he gets older he’s going to keep showing</p>

  <p><b>[Crew try to maintain consistency to clear championship hurdle]</b> Obviously in losing Justin Meram and Ola Kamara, we knew there was going to be pretty big void to fill. They both had very good production last year. And we knew that was going to be an issue in trying to get the goal production with their replacements.<br /><br />In Gyasi Zardes we see that as a like-for-like with Ola in terms of he’ll play the No. 9 position and we see him contributing to the team in a similar way, albeit they have different skill-sets<br /><br />With the younger guys, you’re shaping them more instead of trying to alter something to their games. So with Eduardo and Valenzuela we’re shaping them into the players that can be productive in our system<br /><br />I think last year the team was just focused. Obviously, the news was disruptive on the outside. But on the inside we were able to focus and really go after what we wanted and that was to be successful<br /><br />There’s been very little talk about relocation. The way we see it is it’s not something that we can control. We can only control the product on the field and putting an entertaining effort out for the fans</p>

There wasn’t space, there wasn’t many options for them, and you take two high-caliber players out of the game and it helps your chances to win.<br /><br /><b>[On Zack Steffen]</b> He’s calm. He’s a calm guy. He came in at halftime and said ‘Thanks for bailing me out guys. He knew. He knew what his mistake was, and I think that’s a real underrated quality of Zack. His ability to stay composed, and even if he makes mistakes - and he’s had very few this year - he’s able to stay calm and play through it. Mistakes are going to happen, especially as a goalkeeper. The ball’s going to end up in the back of the net. You’ve just got to move on and stop the next one. You can’t focus on it, it’s in the pass, you’ll learn from it and you’ve just got to move on<br /><br />We’ll go back to Colombus and we’ll play our game.

  <p><b>[Crew’s Federico Higuain gamble pays off, leaves Red Bulls in all-too-familiar playoff jeopardy]</b> I spoke to Pipa <b>[Higuain]</b> at length and got a feeling <b>[of]</b> where he was at. I think he actually recovered really well and was in a position to potentially start the game, but we felt we needed something else in the first half. We needed power. We needed to stretch them. We need to open them up. We needed to really get after them in the first half, and then thinking about will he be able to maintain that for 90 minutes. We took a gamble, and we don’t normally do that. This time, I think Patrick came in and gave us exactly what we were looking for, and then Pipa came in and gave us the match-winner with a nice assist<br /><br />The mark of a goalie who is worth his weight in gold is a goalie that can come up with a big save even though he doesn’t have a lot to do, and that was exactly what Zack Steffen did tonight. To me, that was a different level that he showed he has<br /><br />Our message to the group was, ‘We’re halfway through a 180-minute game, potentially more with extra time.’ We’re happy, but we’re not done. That’s the important message. I guarantee you in New York, it’s going to be a difficult game, as it was tonight</p>

  <p><b>[A study in contrasts, Berhalter confident he can strike the right balance for USMNT]</b> The important thing is that we’re in it together with the players. I adapt to the quality of the players we have. It’s a structured system, but within that there’s flexibility. When you look at what we do in Columbus, we highlight the strengths of the guys we have.<br /><br />There’s two parts. First thing is I have to look at the player profiles of my system and match it up with what we currently have. It’s really important that the player profiles match in a playing system. And then, what I have to do is see how the different players interact with our playing system. When we start teaching the principles I think we’ll be able to see more clearly exactly who can execute what we’re looking for. But in watching the national team the past year I’ve seen intelligent players. I’ve seen capable players and now it’s about getting more out of them<br /><br />When I first started playing, and I was in Holland, I lived alone that first year. I would come home and write all my training sessions down.<br /><br />Holland was such a hotbed for soccer at that time. Ajax winning the Champions League, PSV in the Europa league final. There was so much discussion about soccer, and it was really great. Holland is a really combative place for discussion about soccer, and it was great<br /><br />We want players to be comfortable having the ball. We want them to be brave. We want players to be able to disorganize opponents and create scoring chances. Obviously, you want to win games, but we want to do it playing beautiful soccer. If we can play beautiful and win then I think everyone will be happy<br /><br />I can’t control the criticism. My job is to work hard, to be clear with the players, and get the best out of the group and build a team that plays together</p>

  <p><b>[Gregg Berhalter says he has no doubt that Zack Steffen has everything needed to succeed in England]</b> Yes. I’m very comfortable saying that <b>[he’ll succeed in England]</b>. He has such a unique skillset for such a young age. He’s a top goalkeeper, very explosive, good with his feet. I think he has a future in the Premier League.<br /><br />I think everyone in their career experiences setbacks. The important thing with Zack is that we had a plan. He understood the plan, he accepted the plan and he worked very hard to execute the plan. He went on loan to the USL in his first six months and he got games. We eventually got him to a spot where he was competing to be the No.1, he won the No.1 spot, and we’ve seen his progression on and off the field. I think he’s matured. He’s at a different level than he was before. His poise is exceptional in big moments and he’s improved in every area of his game. I’m confident when I say that he’ll continue to improve and become the goalkeeper that we all expect<br /><br /><b>[Under Pep Guardiola, goalkeepers are very much expected to play with their feet, an expectation that was also the norm under Berhalter with the Crew]</b> It was a very key thing in playing in our system.

I think with Ederson I think they probably have the best in the league right now, but Zack is good and he’s going to get even better</p>

That’s the way he’s looking at it<br /><br />What I like to say is that we’re always going to be a diverse group of players. We’re going to have players playing in Mexico, players in MLS, in Europe.

This isn’t a random group of guys assembled. We looked at what we’re going to need to be successful and picked those guys. A guy like Corey Baird, who has the timing to get behind the backline, is interesting. Christian Ramirez is a striker who is very good inside the penalty box. And then Daniel Lovitz, who has the attributes of an attacking left back. Those are just some examples.<br /><br /><b>[On Sean Johnson]</b> It was more from me seeing his transformation in playing with his feet. We were able to play against him in Chicago a lot, and I saw him not being that comfortable with his feet. Then, when Patrick <b>[Vieira]</b> took over and brought him in <b>[to NYCFC]</b> he really improved. It was that improvement that intrigued me. When you see a player that age still be able to improve his game and make progress and develop, that’s exciting<br /><br /><b>[on discussing Tim Parker’s omission]</b> The issue at center back is we’re deep when you look across the pool. In this particular case we decided to go with younger athletes but, like all players, Tim has an opportunity through his play in Major League Soccer to get an opportunity down the road. When I look at the center back pool, I mentioned the depth that we have, I mention the age range, you start with Tim Ream and go all the way down to McKenzie. We’re talking 31 to 19, so you have a good group of players there, and in this particular case we chose the younger players to see how they can develop, see how they can get the level when they’re around more experienced players<br /><br />We see a very versatile midfield player, a creative midfield player who can create goals and score goals himself.

  <p><b>[Sebastian Lletget and Paul Arriola shine to help USMNT pass tougher test from Costa Rica]</b> We talked about the opponents getting increasingly more difficult and you saw that tonight with Costa Rica. It looked like a tentative first half, we had to come to terms with that. We haven’t faced that intensity yet in this camp. So, it was a great experience today, we certainly learned that if we can continue to persevere, if we can continue to try to play our game it has a cumulative effect on the opponent, and you saw what happened with Costa Rica, they got very fatigued in the second half and they couldn’t match us, and I like that mentality from the group.<br /><br />The mentality of the first half was too passive. We want to be much more aggressive, so we addressed that. Secondly the speed of the ball, particularly along the backline, was much too slow. When we’re able to speed it up, we were able to catch them out of position and create some spaces, so those two things led to a much better second half<br /><br /><b>[On Paul Arriola]</b> I thought he had an excellent game. I thought he was sharp tonight. What we ask of our wingers is to be dynamic, to be aggressive, to take players on 1v1, to try to get behind the backline and I think from roles and responsibilities he certainly met all of that</p>

  <p><b>[Gregg Berhalter didn’t have much time to bask in the glow of securing his second straight victory as U.S. national team coach]</b> Every player in camp impressed me with their work ethic, with their openness, with their ability to take in information, to keep pushing, to train hard, to be a good teammate. So, when I look back at this January camp, I told the guys this in the locker room, it was successful in the fact that we met our benchmarks. There were three items that we’re looking to address: team ability, style of play and competing, and I think each and every one of them met those marks.<br /><br />What we ask of our wingers is to be dynamic. To be aggressive, to take players on 1-v-1, to try to get behind the backline and I think from roles and responsibilities <b>[Arriola]</b> certainly met all of that<br /><br />I think if you ask Gyasi Zardes, he’ll be frustrated that he didn’t score, but if you ask the coaching staff they’ll be pleased with his performance and his work rate. Part of our strikers scoring is going to be a team collective effort. I think he could’ve done a better job in the first half if he had better service. Overall, we’re happy with Gyasi’s play, he proved that he could be a valuable player as well</p>

I think it’s really important when you talk about the history, the heritage and culture of what it means to play for the National Team. In Omar and Tim’s case, they’re both playing at a high level, they’re both playing every week and we thought this would be a good camp to evaluate their performance.<br /><br />We had to make decisions for this camp and we looked at the players in a number of different buckets. For example, we have some younger guys that aren’t getting the game time that they would have expected and they’re still age-eligible for the Olympics, so we think it’s a great opportunity for them to play two international games with the Olympic team.<br /><br />We have other players that we have evaluated thoroughly in the January Camp and we’re going to bring back in the future, but not in this camp. That’s another group. Then we have some guys that are returning from injury and we thought now is not the right time to subject them to the intensity of international soccer and the National Team</p>

  <p><b>[How will Berhalter use Pulisic, McKennie and Adams with the USMNT?]</b> I’m really excited about it. What I’ll say is we’ll do something in this camp and it won’t be set in stone. It’s not to say that these guys are always going to play that position, but this is our initial idea. We’d like to see how they interpret those positions. We know it’s not going to be perfect given the runway, and that’s fine<br /><br />Our job, we’ve been talking to them about where they’re going to play, and it’ll be nice to actually see. When I think about the versatility, it gives the coach more ideas and it gives them more flexibility. Whether I’m thinking about Weston as a number 10 who then defends as a number eight, or Christian as a number 10 who can also move wide, or Tyler as a right back who can come inside, but can also attack overlap or inner lap. Those are the kind of things that are exciting to me. It gives a lot of flexibility to the team<br /><br /><b>[On Christian Pulisic]</b> In this camp we’re going to look at him as the number 10 slanted to the left. We’ve played with two number 10s last camp, we’re going to do the same this camp. Within that structure what we’ve seen is there is flexibility. When you looked at last camp, there’s times when the wingers go inside and the 10s go wide, and we just want to see how that looks. We want Christian to be flexible. We want to take advantage of his 1-v-1, but we also want to get him in front of goal. With Christian, and I’ve been consistent saying this, we want to find a spot where he can affect the game and he can get more out of his teammates and also put him in position to score goals and make assists<br /><br /><b>[On Tyler Adams]</b> I’ve been watching him with Red Bull Leipzig and I think he’s been doing a great job. I’ve been talking to Red Bull Leipzig at length about his development and they’re really happy with him. It’s interesting because I think he can play the right back tucked in naturally, and when you look at his skill set he’s slanted to the right a lot with Red Bull also, especially when he’s pulling out in buildups and opens up to get the ball. I also think he can play central midfield. For us it’s going to be bringing him to camp and looking at him in one of those positions, and moving forward we know that he can play a number of positions and I think that flexibility is only going to help the group</p>

He started out in the academy of <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a>, he played there, he went to the second team of <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a>, he did really well with the second team and now he’s making an impact with the first team.

It would be great that he continues to chip away and get playing time and now can be a consistent performer for one of the top clubs in MLS<br /><br />We’ll be there watching the whole thing, and when he’s doing what we expect him to do, there will be an opportunity for him with the U.S. national team. Regarding a potential choice for him, we want to create an environment that players want to be in. We want to create a playing style, a team spirit that players want to be a part of. If we do, we’re confident we can get players like that and keep players like that in our program<br /><br />We’re not necessarily looking at these players as solely dual national players. We’re looking at them as players. There’s a universe of players that are eligible to play for the United States. We’re looking at all of those guys. I think that’s an important process<br /><br />I’ve said all along that every player has their own pathway. What I want for my players - each and every one of them - is that they can maximize their own potential, so then they have different ways to do that. For some of them it’s going to be going to an <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> academy, playing for an <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> second team and signing with an <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> first team really developing that way.

  <p><b>[Projecting the USMNT lineup versus Ecuador]</b> Tyler Adams we want to use as a right back, and we want to use him as a right back who comes inside and stays wide. We think there’s advantages to gain in wide areas of the field and we think he can do it. We see him pulling away in central midfield sometimes for Red Bull, getting on the ball and being able to penetrate on the ball. We’re going to take a look at him in that position in this camp<br /><br />If we can be controlling the game how we want to control the game, he’s going to be up in a two-three while we’re attacking, in a position to win the ball back right away. He’s not going to be in the back. he’s going to be forward, at the top of the penalty box, or he’s going to be combining in wide areas. That’s right in his skill set<br /><br />When you’re looking at the profile of a Michael Bradley or a Wil Trapp, a very controlling player, and you have the dynamic guy next to him in Tyler, who can come inside and still be influential from that position, we think it’s exciting and we want to take a look at it. It may not work exactly how we have planned, and we have to adapt. In theory, it’s something worth trying.<br /><br />This is the beginning phases. We want to test it and we want to see how it looks and we want to see how (Adams) adapts, and what he gives our team overall<br /><br /><b>[On DeAndre Yedlin]</b> We’re not going to ask him to do things he’s not comfortable with. We’ll adapt to him to a certain extent. I’m watching all of his games and what I see with him is a tremendous ability to build momentum from behind with his speed, to take advantage of underlaps or inner-lap situations. He has a good cross, and he’s primarily used in wide positions. I can say that he’ll be primarily used in wide positions here as well</p>

That is sometimes the answer, but I think when you have a guy that’s a total team player, understands his role, and can score by the way, you can be successful</p>

The structure around him accommodates him being flexible and he can go wide, he can come inside. He can create space for himself. We can use the striker to get him the ball, bouncing it back to him. That’s what we’re trying to do, and the reason we’re trying to do that is because he has these game-changing abilities and you saw that tonight. Very fluid with his movement, dynamic, able to take players on, good ball security. And today was great because the final product was there also, which is always important for attacking players.<br /><br /><b>[The Americans head into their group finale against Panama on Friday with momentum]</b> What we’re seeing is the team is getting confident, and we’re getting fit and that’s important.

  <p><b>[USMNT looking to rediscover intensity and send a message in Canada rematch]</b> Canada hadn’t beat us in 34 years and was playing like it. And for us to be successful in away matches, we need to match the intensity of our opponents and that’s been a consistent message in this camp. You would think that it would go without saying that we know that, right? That’s the logical thing to think, but when you think of seven players playing in their first away game, when you think about a coaching staff coaching in their first away game together, in a competitive Concacaf match, these are the things that go along with it. The message was received loud and clear<br /><br /><b>[Changing that perception starts on Friday. If the U.S. fails to secure all three points, Canada will move on in the Nations League]</b> We’re embracing it because that is our situation. When you look at the history of U.S. Soccer, we’ve been in games like this before. In the pre-Hex groups, we’ve been in must-win situations. In the Hex round, we’ve been in must-win situations. This is what builds the team and makes the team strong. We need matches like this.

We talked about the theme of this camp being ‘stake your claim’ or ‘seize your moment’. Everyone has a different situation, somewhat to make the Olympic qualifying group, some want to be starters in that group, some want to be starters on the full national team, some want to be involved with the full national team. Everyone has a different way that they’re looking at this, but collectively, can we perform well as a group? Individually, can guys make a case for their involvement going forward?<br /><br />It’s a strong age group that we have right now. It would be nice to put these guys in position to compete in the Olympics. We’re not going to be able to pull from all of the players in this qualifying tournament, but nonetheless it’s still an opportunity for guys to step up and be battle-tested in a Concacaf qualifying format and learn from it. When you think about what we have in store for us this year, we’re going to be going through 60 percent of our qualifying games for the World Cup.

He doesn’t have to carry a team. He’s playing a role, and he’s executing his role. What I really liked from him? His position when he gets the ball in the pocket, his awareness to turn and his efficiency and when he’s turning is excellent. He doesn’t waste any touches turning, he turns right away.<br /><br />Second thing is his ball security under pressure is phenomenal. And, you know, there’s a play against <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> where I mentioned he got the ball on the sideline. And <b>[Thomas]</b> <a href="thomas-meunier.html">Meunier</a>, and I forgot who the other player was try to close him down, and he just turns and gets out of pressure.<br /><br />He just did it with so much awareness, that it was really impressive.

I can see him playing as potentially a number 10 in a 4-3-3. He can play in a number of different positions. I like him being able to affect the game on the offensive side, similar to <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a>.

And as a result of him doing that he gets an opportunity with the first team<br /><br />It was a collaborative process together with Jason. Jason’s taking the lead on who he prioritizes in each position, and then us deferring in some cases. Normally we’d love to have Reggie <b>[<a href="reggie-cannon.html">Cannon</a>]</b> and Jackson Yueill come to Europe and play with us, but it was a priority of Jason to use them. And, we’re doing everything we can to support him and his group to qualify.

  <p><b>[USMNT coach Berhalter sees improvement in <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a>]</b> When Christian was moving from <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> we knew there was going to be an adaptation period. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is an extremely fast and physical league, and we knew time would be needed for him to get up to speed. What I really like about how his season unfolded, particularly in the beginning, is that he had to endure adversity to overcome struggle. He had to get used to the English game. It took time, and as he did that he came out performing really well, helping the team and scoring goals and being influential. All these things we projected him being able to do took an understandable time period. When you go into the injury period he had, it’s unfortunate because he was in such good form. The next part of it was him dealing with a serious injury. He was in a lot of pain. It was a difficult injury to come back from quickly although I know the fans wanted him back<br /><br /><b>[Berhalter added on where <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Pulisic</a> has taken his game to even greater heights]</b> The thing he’s really improved on that I’ve seen this year is his finishing ability. He’s done a great job of that, and it’s something the high-level players, when you look at the top players in the world, they’re able to score a big number of goals because they have that finishing quality<br /><br />Some of his best actions for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have been when he’s central, playing the ball behind the line, combining and making things happen in a central position, but having moved inside from the wing. Both <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and us want him affecting the game, in a position where he can hurt the opponent. Sometimes it’s going to be wide, sometimes that’s going to be central. It’s a different <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> than we’re used to seeing. It’s interesting what they’re doing and that they’re still able to get results. They’ve done a great job of that with a young team. They have an athletic team with exciting players in key positions, and to me it’s been fun to watch. Christian has the quality that he can adapt with a more experienced team as well, but there’s a lot of room for these players to grow and he’s in a good spot</p>

They haven’t been creating a lot of chances, and that’s difficult for a striker. For him, it’s a case of hanging in there, continuing to do the things that got him to that level. It’s about continuing to think about his movement off the ball, how he’s moving in the penalty box, and when he gets opportunities, making the most of them<br /><br />After 25 minutes, I could see Josh suddenly closing down the central defender at pace because he wants to put pressure on. This means that the eight has to step out, then the six steps out, and <b>[<a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha</a> winger Matheus]</b> Cunha comes into the danger area in behind. Sometimes we do not do things that are clearly discussed and that work well as a solution. And that drives me crazy. Why do you move away from the plan?
