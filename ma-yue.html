  <p><b>[Shanghai Shenhua dismiss Tevez banishment claims]</b> Tevez has never been told that he has no place in the first team, and the claim that he refused to answer clubs’ calls <b>[to play with reserve team]</b> is not true. Quite the contrary, head coah Wu Jingui and team leader Mao Yijun have shown great concern for him and the communication between them is very smooth.<br /><br />Tevez brings a private coach from Argentina during the season and does extra training of his own accord after 4pm every day. We are not making excuses for Tevez, the club just want to clarify that he hasn’t abandoned himself like some foreign media have claimed. He should have realised that he will not be picked in the starting lineup purely on reputation. We have five healthy foreign players, if he wants to be one of the three who are eligible to play, he’s got to show the real stuff</p>
