  <p><b>[Tony Popovic has spoke of his ambition to coach the Socceroos]</b> Of course <b>[the Australia job is]</b> on my radar one day, but I haven’t spoken to anyone and it’s not something I’m waiting for. If I was part of the Socceroos equation, that’s for FFA to decide. I’d love to do it one day, and the opportunity would be a great honour. I can only deal with what’s in front of me now. If there’s a job for me in Europe tomorrow that I thought was right, I’d take it tomorrow.</p>

  <p><b>[Perth Glory coach Tony Popovic has called on his players to avoid being captivated by <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s many stars ahead of Saturday’s night exhibition match]</b> I’m sure that there is time to admire them and consider who you played against after the game. But we don’t want them doing that during the match. We’ve got players here in our group that get disappointed when <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> doesn’t win, and they stay up and watch the games. I’ve got one of my sons (Gabriel) that does not miss a game of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. That just shows how big and special they are as a club. It (playing against United) is something these players haven’t experienced and may not experience again. So you want to make the most of it. You don’t want to get stage fright on the day. I really want the players to be relaxed and enjoy it and also be focused and go out there and show our football</p>

  <p><b>[From the opening whistle, the Australians found themselves on the back foot as Al-Hilal relentlessly pressed forward in search of a goal. In their way however was then 39-year-old keeper, Ante Covic, who was refusing to be beaten. Despite being the victim of laser pointers from the stands throughout the match, Covic held firm in front of his goal and produced a stunning late save to ensure the second leg ended goalless and the Wanderers claimed a shock ACL title less than three years after being formed]</b> We were called a small club yesterday. Today we are the biggest in Asia. It is still a little surreal for me as a coach. I am sure it will hit home in the next few days when we reflect. I am just proud for these players and our club. The first time in the competition, to win it, I think in the future we will really understand how special this run has been. We don’t have the resources or the funds that some of these other teams have but we have something that money can’t buy, the desire to win, the resilience to play for each other and do anything we can to win. No money can buy that.</p>
