  <p><b>[Graham Arnold’s comments about Sydney FC’s defence were hit for six by Western Sydney Wanderers]</b> He <b>[Arnold]</b> can say whatever he likes. At the end of the day I hope he’s right cause if he <b>[Vukovic]</b> doesn’t make a save it means he’s pulling the ball out of the net.<br /><br />If it’s a youth player I’m sure Arnie will have them ready but it’s a good opportunity for us to probably try get at them early and test them out. The boys are pumped and we’re ready to turn it <b>[the Wanderers’ losing derby record]</b> around</p>

  <p><b>[Western Sydney Wanderers coach Tony Popovic was thrilled with his team’s maiden clean sheet of the season]</b> We had our first clean sheet, so that was important for us. We looked very solid defensively and we stopped a team that’s in good form from creating anything, apart from a few moments.<br /><br /><b>[Sydney full-back Michael Zullo blocked a shot with his hand in the box]</b> OK, if you miss the handball, OK. But how it’s not a corner is just hard to understand</p>

  <p><b>[Coach Tony Popovic remains convinced Western Sydney Wanderers can win the A-League grand final]</b> No. Certainly not. For me <b>[this season]</b> is far from gone … we have ten games to go and I believe we can still win the grand final. I believe everything is still possible for us this season.<br /><br />The fans in the first couple of years probably had hope. But the football department from year one, we had expectations of winning trophies. Now the fans have joined us with that expectation. At the moment they’re frustrated and we’re as frustrated as they are<br /><br />We made a decision after we won the Champions League to change 18 players. That was a decision made based on the philosophy of the club in terms of how we want to play and in terms of longevity we believe we can have success over a period of time. That was a conscious decision and we certainly don’t regret that. And the fans certainly were happy with those 18 changes <b>[after the team made the grand final last season]</b>. This year there have been changes but the changes are different this time. A lot of the changes this year - and I’ve said this publicly - is due to not being able to afford a player. A couple of foreign players that we tried to keep. Salary cap constraints don’t allow you to go as high as you’d like to keep those players. And then you have legends of the club <b>[Mark Bridge and Nikolai Topor-Stanley]</b> that as a reward you should help them go. So a little bit different this year in terms of the changes but ultimately we are judged on results<br /><br /><b>[The guest marquee rule allows clubs to play players outside the A-League salary cap]</b> I’d love a bit more clarity from FFA on what is a guest marquee and what passes as one. So we’ve tried to do that as well and unfortunately that wasn’t passed by FFA. Certainly a big-name player we could afford … we’d welcome</p>

  <p><b>[Western Sydney coach Tony Popovic has hinted at a few changes to his starting line-up]</b> Everyone is fit and healthy and everyone wants to play in the derby. You have to respect every player for that. They all want to play, they are all training well. There’ll be some tough decisions this week. Of course in this period every player will play, whether it’s the A-League or ACL, and we have to be good enough to compete in both competitions.</p>

  <p><b>[Tony Popovic declared Western Sydney Wanderers’ 4-0 capitulation at home Urawa Red Diamonds]</b> You realise very quickly the level of this competition, and you get punished for your mistakes. It makes you realise what can happen here <b>[in the ACL]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[Beanpole teenage striker Majok made his senior debut against the Reds]</b> It’s something he’ll <b>[Majok]</b> never forget, playing in the Champions League. He held his own and I’m sure he’ll learn from it.<br /><br />At 0-0 we were in the game but just as we were having a few good moments and getting on top, we got punished. And that’s what you get at this level and they are a very good side</p>

  <p><b>[A disallowed goal for Dimas’ in Saturday’s 0-0 draw with Adelaide had Western Sydney Wanderers’ manager Tony Popovic frustrated with the officiating once again]</b> I just don’t want <b>[say]</b> to because it’s too many times. It’s all year, it’s every week. It’s a clear goal, it’s a legitimate goal. And he found a way for it not to be a goal</p>

  <p><b>[Wanderers boss Tony Popovic added his acclaim for the work of his evergreen front-man Mitch Nichols]</b> I’ve mentioned many times my admiration for him as a person and player. That’s shared by everyone at the football club, by his team-mates and the staff. He gives everything he has for this club - he always has - and he’s reaping the rewards. We have to do everything we can as a staff to enable him to keep producing week-in, week-out.<br /><br />We’ve been playing well for a number of weeks now. Yes, the results have <b>[only]</b> turned recently, but the team has been playing well. If we can carry on with the confidence I’m sure the players have gained from those three points, we give ourselves a good opportunity to carry on and win again at home</p>

  <p><b>[Coach Tony Popovic remained philosophical about Western Sydney Wanderers’ loss to FC Seoul]</b> In the end, the fighting spirit was fantastic. You know, they kept fighting to the end. We scored two wonderful goals but gave away three very poor goals.<br /><br />I think it’s showing, <b>[they’re development is]</b> clearly accelerating. Jonathan I thought was very good tonight … I thought Lachie fought hard, he battled hard and, you know, the kid was cramping in the last 10 minutes and he scored a wonderful goal. It’s a fantastic striker’s goal and had we not lost tonight, I’m sure you’d be speaking a lot more about the two wonderful goals we scored<br /><br /><b>[Popovic bemoaned the Wanderers’ inability to break down Seoul’s back five in the first half]</b> The final decision kind of let us down. We maybe started holding onto the ball too long instead of really trying to penetrate</p>

  <p><b>[Western Sydney Wanderers know a blockbuster clash against archrivals Sydney FC is potentially 90 minutes away]</b> It’s always in the back of your mind - what could happen if you win and who you might play. We’d be lying if we didn’t say that. Brisbane will be looking at it in the same way - if they win the match, they go to Melbourne <b>[to play Victory]</b>. But ultimately it comes down to tomorrow. The season is on the line and if you lose, you don’t get that opportunity. If our minds drift tomorrow, that would be a mistake<br /><br /><b>[They’re]</b> two very good players who are doing very well at this moment. But they’re a very good team all round. They have a very good balance. Those two players are excelling at the moment and I’m sure they’ll try and continue that but it would be a mistake from us to just focus on those two players. If we do that, we’ll come out of the game not getting the result we want</p>

  <p><b>[Western Sydney Wanderers underlined how they are well placed for a much stronger 2017-18 A-League season in their 3-2 win over Shanghai SIPG]</b> I think he’s <b>[Jumpei]</b> been outstanding for us the last two months and some players take time to settle in and you can see now he looks comfortable, he’s got running power, he’s creating chances late in games, he’s scoring goals now. It’s a very good foundation and base to build on next year.<br /><br />I’m confident that we’ll be challenging <b>[in the A-League]</b> next year. Our football was always good and that’s what gave us confidence … the second half of the year, we were very good<br /><br />You can see with someone like Jumpei, that’s coming. You know, he scored in Japan, he scored here, he played very well, so you can see that players like him have now adapted and will move forward</p>

  <p><b>[Tony Popovic has spoke of his ambition to coach the Socceroos]</b> Of course <b>[the Australia job is]</b> on my radar one day, but I haven’t spoken to anyone and it’s not something I’m waiting for. If I was part of the Socceroos equation, that’s for FFA to decide. I’d love to do it one day, and the opportunity would be a great honour. I can only deal with what’s in front of me now. If there’s a job for me in Europe tomorrow that I thought was right, I’d take it tomorrow.</p>

  <p><b>[Perth Glory coach Tony Popovic has called on his players to avoid being captivated by <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s many stars ahead of Saturday’s night exhibition match]</b> I’m sure that there is time to admire them and consider who you played against after the game. But we don’t want them doing that during the match. We’ve got players here in our group that get disappointed when <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> doesn’t win, and they stay up and watch the games. I’ve got one of my sons (Gabriel) that does not miss a game of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. That just shows how big and special they are as a club. It (playing against United) is something these players haven’t experienced and may not experience again. So you want to make the most of it. You don’t want to get stage fright on the day. I really want the players to be relaxed and enjoy it and also be focused and go out there and show our football</p>

  <p><b>[From the opening whistle, the Australians found themselves on the back foot as Al-Hilal relentlessly pressed forward in search of a goal. In their way however was then 39-year-old keeper, Ante Covic, who was refusing to be beaten. Despite being the victim of laser pointers from the stands throughout the match, Covic held firm in front of his goal and produced a stunning late save to ensure the second leg ended goalless and the Wanderers claimed a shock ACL title less than three years after being formed]</b> We were called a small club yesterday. Today we are the biggest in Asia. It is still a little surreal for me as a coach. I am sure it will hit home in the next few days when we reflect. I am just proud for these players and our club. The first time in the competition, to win it, I think in the future we will really understand how special this run has been. We don’t have the resources or the funds that some of these other teams have but we have something that money can’t buy, the desire to win, the resilience to play for each other and do anything we can to win. No money can buy that.</p>
