  <p>[Goa Super Cup to feature innovative coaches’ conclave] We want to establish this tournament as an avenue not only for the young players but also for the coaches. They will share knowledge and learn from people like Venkatesh and Floyd Pinto. Moreover, with panel discussions planned, they will get an insight into the technical aspects of coaching, which can only help the development of the kids who are under these coaches.</p>

  <p>[Elite league to feature established youth teams like Dempo, AIFF Elite Academy] This is a great opportunity for young aspiring footballers to watch and learn from youth teams of professional clubs. Not only will it serve as a motivation for the teams from lesser known areas of the country to be noticed, even the coaches from these schools can learn from professional club coaches. Moreover, the presence of such big teams will raise the profile and standard of Goa Super Cup. We expect to become one of the most prestigious youth tournaments in the country.</p>
