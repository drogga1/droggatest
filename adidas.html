  <p><b>[Sam Handy on Nemeziz]</b> Part of our design philosophy at Adidas Soccer is to look back to help us look forward, something we’ve held true to with the design of Nemeziz. The idea of torsion and taping is not a new idea, it is present in some of our classic products and in other fields, such as martial arts. It has been around for generations. Our design for this product was taking that idea, of the relationship between torsion, support and agility, and using it to support the most disruptive players in the game.<br /><br />Our main goal is always to provide the athlete with the tools to maximise their own creativity, and with this product we feel we have provided the structure and support that can help players like Messi, Sanches and Firmino reach their true potential</p>

  <p><b>[Adidas vice-president of design Sam Handy said]</b> When designing the Predator 18+ we wanted to create the most innovative boot on the market while staying true to the very ethos of what made the Predator such an iconic boot. We wanted to create a boot for those players who control the game through a killer touch or defence-splitting pass. The new Predator will provide athletes such as Paul Pogba and Dele Alli with the tools they need to maximise their own creativity, such as the introduction of a control skin and a new hybrid stud configuration to support the dynamic movement required for professional athletes.</p>
