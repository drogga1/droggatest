I’d go that far. <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>’s at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a>, so it’s hard to compare…but the ability he’s got, it’s up there</p>

  <p><b>[Yannick Bolasie says Man Utd flop Zaha ‘can be as good as Neymar’]</b> He can go as far as he wants. I said the other day that he’s got the same kind of ability as Neymar and people were raising their eyebrows. But now they’re starting to see it and nobody is saying anything anymore! I’m just kind of laughing to myself and I’m like ‘Well, I said that already’. It’s whether people take notice or not. He’s catching the eye now and doing well for himself. At the moment, he’s helping Palace a lot.</p>

  <p><b>[Aston Villa have confirmed that they have signed Yannick Bolasie on loan from Everton]</b> My main aim here is to get this club promoted. A club of this stature has to be in the Premier League. I looked around both Villa Park and the training ground, and me and my family just said: ‘Wow.’ It’s Premier League everywhere you look. I’m here to make myself smile again and use all my ability to try and help the team. It’s great to be here.</p>

  <p><b>[Everton set £7m price tag as Newcastle &amp; Southampton battle for Yannick Bolasie]</b> I have been playing football with a smile and I think that is showing on the field. I definitely made the right decision coming over but it helps when you are scoring goals. It was a bold move and a different challenge but it has worked out well for me so far. Rom <b>[Lukaku]</b> had a part to play as well. When I asked him about it, he said ‘Yeah, that is a good fit’ because he knows what type of person I am. He knew I could play attacking football with some very decent technical players at a big club in Belgium.</p>

  <p><b>[Yannick Bolasie concerned about Afcon impact on <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> career]</b> Logically, if I really wanted to think <b>[about it]</b>, I’d just put my career first and say I’m going back to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. I feel myself, I’m back sharp, and I’d go and do a full preseason, which I haven’t had in two years and which makes the difference to anyone’s season. For me, it’s not a case of coming here to try and turn myself <b>[around]</b>. I want to play at the Africa Cup of Nations to the best of my ability, but I’m also taking <b>[the tournament]</b> as preparation for pre-season going into the next season<br /><br /> think I’ve been on top form this season. <b>[but]</b> my season has probably been stretched out because of the Afcon. You think: ‘I’ve got to go to the Afcon,’ and it’s just the wheels spinning, spinning, spinning. You need a little bit of a break. I don’t make any excuse, it is what it is. I’ve come to perform for my country, my heart’s in it, and I always want to do that. I enjoy doing it, and I’ve come<br /><br />I always like a challenge. I think everything I’ve done has been a challenge in my football career, it’s never been straightforward.</p>

  <p><b>[Yannick Bolasie says <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> has the lot]</b> Bruno has the lot to be honest. I think he will cope fine with the expectations. When he was at Sporting he controlled all the matches. Everything Sporting did went through him. He can play with both feet and is not afraid to shoot with his left but his right foot is his main foot. He can see a pass and has good long-range passing, free-kicks and penalties.<br /><br />He is at his best getting on the half turn and making passes in between the lines. He likes giving passes and likes scoring, that is his game. He knows what he can do and is good at and can link up with the forward players really well. He has his own style because he has been in Italy before but has similarities to De Bruyne, Silva and <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Eriksen</a>.<br /><br />Bruno likes to go and get the ball and might end up on the left side or end up on the right. He needs to play with that protection behind to give him that freedom to venture around rather than adapting to the team. It will be interesting to see how United end up using him. But he always wanted to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, for sure, and it is going to be a good test for him. It’s much slower in Portugal and nowhere near <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s tempo. In some of the games in Portugal he could probably coast through whereas in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> no matter who you are playing, the opponents won’t let you walk over them<br /><br />It is always going to be a great option and is a good move for Bruno. It is a monster of a football club, it doesn’t matter where they are right now. If you go there your life changes - on the field and off the field. He has a chance to shine but football is about results so let’s see</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> team-mate Yannick Bolasie <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> has ‘a <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> kind of ability’]</b> I think I would have taught him some things, to be honest, some little things he would have taken from my book. When I said Wilf has a <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> kind of ability, people were like: ‘Nah, nah, nah,’ but then they started looking and saying: ‘Actually, he does. Every season for me, he’s come out and proved he’s got better. Just in different types of ways. He’s setting up teammates, setting up people to score, he’s releasing passes quicker than I’ve seen him release passes before. I’m seeing an improvement in his whole game, he’s not just this dribbler that everyone thinks he is; he can see a pass and a through ball.<br /><br />Since then <b>[meeting]</b>, we’ve had a close bond. I know his brothers. From then, it’s just been a family thing: they check in on me sometimes, I check in on them and for me to see where he’s at today is what I expected. It is what I expected, but then for things to actually take place, that’s a different type of feeling. I’m very happy for him and what he’s doing and when I watch Palace and see him play and I feel: ‘Hmm, you could have done this there,’ I do tell him. Because I do feel like I’ve got that relationship with him. Not to try and coach him but to tell him: ‘Maybe you could have let that shot go a little bit earlier, you didn’t need to do that.’ Or whatever. I do feel like I’ve got that relationship with him and I can tell him that kind of thing. It was great playing with Wilf and also credit to Palace for bringing him through and having the confidence in him after that move to bring him back home and you can see what he’s doing now - it’s unbelievable stuff</p>
