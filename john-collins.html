  <p><b>[Monaco forward Kylian Mbappe is considered to be a top, top player]</b> This season I think everybody can see he’s got great legs, great energy, he’s got skill. He carries the ball well and he can score goals, he’s got that calmness in front of goal. Sometimes you see young players they get to that final position when they’re going to shoot and they get over excited and try to hit it too hard or miss the target. But he’s got that calmness which all top players have, key moments in the game they stay calm, and also he carries himself, he’s got that look ‘I’m the man give me the ball,’ he’s playing without fear and that probably is the key to being a top, top player.<br /><br />Two, three years ago the recruitment was sensational, they got 50 million <b>[pounds]</b> for Anthony Martial from Manchester United. Monaco always get good deals, it’s been a skill, an art, to get top money and they invested that money, there’s not a team in world football that has invested 50m as well as Monaco has. English clubs have got lots of money, and what English clubs have done in the last few years is waste a lot of money. Another reason why Monaco is so successful with the young players, what you don’t have here is the pressure and the tension to win things instantly and all the time, like some of the big clubs in England do, so it’s a great environment for young players</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal passed up the opportunity to sign Virgil van Dijk from Celtic for £12 million]</b> Arsenal’s chief scout <b>[Steve Rowley]</b> thought he was too nonchalant. Maybe that was part of his game but he ticks so many of the other boxes. He’s got pace, power, balance, distribution and he’s good in the air. He can be a bit nonchalant but he is a quality player. Gary McAllister was the assistant to Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool and I told him I hope you’re going to come and take Virgil but Brendan didn’t fancy him and didn’t think he was better than what he already had. He would’ve cost around £12m - every team watched him regularly but the worry was he was showing it against Scottish players but you could tell he was strong, powerful and a well balanced player.</p>
