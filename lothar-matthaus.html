  <p><b>[Lothar Matthaus gives some insight into his football upbringing that led to success at the highest levels of the game]</b> I come from a moderately successful footballing family. My father played in the fifth tier of German football while my brother was in the third division, but I was always captivated by the sport. I was always the youngest and the smallest and repeatedly had to hold my own against bigger opponents to make sure I didn’t lose every game. That was a huge incentive for me</p>

So one has to accept his decision now as well<br /><br />Personally, I still believed in him as a right-back even against the fastest opponents. I think he still had a few years in him. To leave the game altogether comes as quite a surprise. I find it hard to understand his decision to turn down the offer to become sporting director. A chance like that might come only once in a lifetime. There is no guarantee the situation will not be completely different in 2019. He might no longer be the top candidate then</p>

  <p><b>[Germany legend Lothar Matthaus believes that the next logical step for Mario Gotze could be a switch to the Chinese Super League]</b> Honestly, even if it sounds a bit nasty, if it does not work for Gotze at Dortmund, he has to go to China. Gotze certainly does not want to make less money. He will not go to Schalke, he will not go to Leverkusen, Gladbach cannot afford to sign Gotze. Top clubs from abroad aren’t that interested anymore. If he does not get in the team at Dortmund, and has the same salary demands, then he will be off to China - but that would be a poor test for a 24-year-old.</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil does not identify with the Germany national team]</b> I often have the feeling that Ozil does not feel comfortable in the Germany jersey, that he is not free, almost as if he does not want to play at all. There is no heart, no joy, no passion. It does not seem impossible that he might withdraw from the national team after the World Cup. For a year or two, Ozil has been much weaker and at a level that does not justify the free ticket Low gives him.<br /><br />Ozil did not understand why there are such great discussions in Germany about him. He is unaware of what the people in Germany expect from a national player, and that it would have been right, after the mistake of the Erdogan photo, to show commitment to Germany and to open up to the fans<br /><br />I don’t care about Mesut Ozil’s attitude towards the team and the fans or that he does not sing along with our national anthem. But I cannot understand why he does not consider it necessary to acknowledge the fans and clap briefly. If you have already made a mistake, then such a gesture would have been a beautiful symbol towards the national team, but I feel he does not identify with this one. He gives the impression that he is in his own world and not part of this team<br /><br /><b>[There was]</b> no pressing, no stability. The distances were so big that you were almost scared. Especially the gaps between central defenders and midfielders. There should never be between 30 and 40 metres in between them. Our virtues were not there. Everything a German team has always been was non-existent. The so-called Low regulars have abandoned our national coach. By that I mean above all Ozil, Sami Khedira and Thomas Muller</p>

After the latest impression, it is not out of the question that he will be out of the national team after the World Cup.

  <p><b>[Lothar Matthaus has savaged Germany’s World Cup flops after their stunning defeat to South Korea]</b> Now I know, a little bit, what it must have felt like to be an England fan for so many years. But in Germany we cannot complain. We ended up with the outcome our performances deserved. Maybe we were lazy, or just over-confident. The sun has been shining on Germany for the past few years. But today will be grey, with heavy rain. I have never seen a German side play so badly for three successive games at a World Cup. It was not a Germany I recognised at all. At home the fans are shocked and surprised. But I am not angry that we have gone out. I am angry at the WAY we have gone out. For the next few weeks there will be much debate about the reasons. For me, while Joachim Low will stay as coach, this has to be the end of the generation that won in 2014. Right from the start, in the game with Mexico, I could see things were missing. We did not have the right squad. We did not have the team spirit. We did not have the passion. And we did not have the leaders.<br /><br />I still cannot understand Joachim’s decisions for the Korea game. He got it so wrong. He dropped Mesut Ozil and Sami Khedira after the Mexico game. We were slightly better without them against Sweden yet they both came back in yesterday. Why? I can only think it was out of loyalty, because they won the World Cup for him four years ago. But they are not the players they were then. Their body language is wrong. They have lost the passion and mentality they had. When I look at Ozil, I don’t see the player I used to see. He has lost his pace, and I don’t like the way he plays any more. It’s the same with Khedira. That was just part of it. Every good German team has strong leadership in the side. This was a Germany without a leader. It was, for me, a ship without a captain. And that meant nobody could steer them to the right port. So now we must change. It is time for Ozil to go, Khedira, even Mats Hummels and Manuel Neuer<br /><br />This morning, I wake up a little jealous of England. You are still in the World Cup, with a young, quick team and a proper striker. But we will be back. We will be back</p>

I see the football player Mesut Ozil and he didn’t perform like before<br /><br />I never speak against Uli Hoeness, but OK, Uli Hoeness was very angry this morning because this was too much the last two months about Mesut Ozil. The German team lost the games against Mexico and South Korea, not only Mesut Ozil. But Mesut Ozil was - is - a part of this national team. And he’s normally a leader but in the last one, two years, he didn’t show he’s a leader, he didn’t show the right performance. And then all the things were coming from outside - include it and everything else, and this makes a story. But for me, it’s only important <b>[if]</b> Mesut Ozil can help the national team or not, and I have this feeling in the last one-and-a-half years, he never played on this level how we played before, and now it’s time for changes.

  <p><b>[Ronaldo doesn’t make Juventus the best in Europe]</b> Ronaldo is no longer in the best age for a footballer. I think he will focus on the Champions League. There he can show his best performances and did that again last year at Real Madrid. As curious as it may sound: with Napoli and Inter they have two really strong rivals. I think the league will be more exciting after seven successive Juve titles, but they are going to be more dangerous for the top teams thanks to Ronaldo. They can get closer to the absolute top teams and keep up, but I would not say Juve are top of the elite level because of Ronaldo<br /><br />It’s a big loss for the Spanish league, but Real Madrid remain Real Madrid, even without Ronaldo. The club has always lost big players, which is part of the history of Real. They will commit new stars.

Since this season, Bayern have increasingly relied on young talents. An example of this is the departure of Arturo Vidal and the commitment of Leon Goretzka. As the first few games have shown, this strategy seems to work and Bayern is currently the league leader. But they can´t rest, because the newly established BVB and revived VfL Wolfsburg are close to their heels. I expect an exciting season.</p>

He has fantastic speed, great technique, a good eye for his colleagues and that key pass. Everything he does he pulls off at high speed at the right moment. For me he is a perfect player. The ability he has is instinctive, natural. You cannot teach that brilliance. What is clear is that he loves just playing football, loves the ball. He is not thinking about money, about the next Ferrari he can buy. He looks to have both feet on the ground. He arrived in Dortmund as a 17-year-old, leaving England for the first time. He was away from his home and family for the first time. Dortmund gave him time. Now, when he plays, he makes the difference and excites everyone. They bought him for only £7m. And they know that in three or four years’ time, when it is right for Sancho to move on, they will get an awful lot more than that. For the next two years he should concentrate on getting into the Under-21 side, play games and learn about international competition. That is better for his development than going into the senior squad and sitting on the bench.</p>

It would have to be something special for him to leave the club. But if it’s going to happen, it will have to be soon. He’s 25 now. If he does not go in the next two years, by the time he is 27, he will never leave. If he did, Real are the only club that would be right for him. Real shine brighter than any other club in the world. If it happened, everyone would understand, nobody could be angry.<br /><br />Levy knows what Harry’s done for the club. It wouldn’t surprise me if there is an understanding, a gentleman’s agreement, between them. He would not have anything written into his contract. He is not that sort of player. But if he knocked on Daniel’s door, at the right time, and there was a truly serious offer on the table, it may be different</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich are paying the price for making the biggest mistake of not upgrading an aging squad quickly enough]</b> Bayern have dominated the German championship for the last six years. Bundesliga is always a very interesting project. We have a lot of good players and surely the best team in Germany is Bayern Munich over the last six years. They have won the title six times. They have the players who have been playing for the last six years like <b>[Arjen]</b> Robben, <b>[Franck]</b> Ribery, <b>[Jerome]</b> Boateng, <b>[Thomas]</b> Muller. Times change, football is going faster and faster and the young generation is coming more. The biggest mistake Bayern made before the season was that they didn’t make the change. And now, step by step, they have to fight back. Bayern have very good young players and with Niko Kovac as the coach, he has to give the chance for the young players to play.<br /><br />Niko Kovac was a player with Bayern 15 years ago. He has the DNA of Bayern, he knows the Bundesliga. He has Croatian roots but he was born in Germany. He was playing in the Bundesliga, he had good results last year with Eintracht Frankfurt. He was the Croatian national coach, he has the experience to work with stars. But Bayern Munich is something special. And for this, he needs a little bit of support from the people who are working in the club. For me, the mistake Bayern made was that they did not change the players. Kovac has to manage players who have won everything in the previous years. I don’t see motivation from some players. When you have won the title six times, how can you motivate yourselves? It is not on purpose, it is automatic psychologically. This was the problem for him. Maybe <b>[he got]</b> some decisions wrong. He has to learn and I think he will learn. He is a good coach. He is working very hard from morning until evening to make players better. If Bayern gives him the support, the president, the director, the fans, I am sure Bayern will have the same results with Kovac that they were having in the previous years with other coaches<br /><br /><b>[On Axel Witsel]</b> He is working very well for Borussia Dortmund over the last three months. But Bayern Munich wants to think long-term. If Witsel is playing the same next year as he is doing now, sure, he can be a good player for Bayern Munich. But Bayern have a different strategy. Bayern have Javi Martinez in the same position. Martinez has played better in previous years than he is now. <b>[Leon]</b> Goretzka, who played a great Confederations Cup, is a great No.6 or No.8 player. Witsel has experience. He is the right player for this team in Dortmund, it doesn’t mean he is the right player for Bayern because Bayern and Dortmund play different styles of football. Is Witsel a player for Bayern Munich? Sure, he is a very good player and I am sure he can play for Bayern Munich, but now he is playing for Dortmund</p>

  <p><b>[Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo will continue to illuminate world football]</b> Life changes, sure Ronaldo and Messi are very important for international football but a younger generation is coming. Modric was not somebody from a younger generation, but he had a perfect team around him and for this, like Ronaldo and Messi, Modric profited from his team, from the quality of other players. Because only with a team can you make results. When you have results, you can make a difference and when you make a difference, you can win the Ballon d’Or. Messi played with Barcelona, Ronaldo and Modric for Real Madrid, this helped them a lot to enjoy this personal result. In the future, maybe it will be Mbappe, he is a very good player. Shining from Ronaldo and Messi is not over, but there is now Mbappe, Griezman, maybe Hazard from Chelsea. A lot of players make something special.<br /><br />Yes, the Ballon d’Or was for 10 years in the hands of Messi and Ronaldo. For me, it is the right decision. Ronaldo dominated the Champions League and Messi dominated the Spanish league. But during the World Cup, Portugal went out in the second round. Argentina went out as well. I did not see Messi so much. I am a fan of Messi but this World Cup was not a World Cup for Messi. Not a World Cup for Argentina. Modric had a great season with Real Madrid and a World Cup with Croatia. This is also the same for Griezmann and Mbappe from France. They won the World Cup, Griezman won the Europa League, won the Super Cup with Atletico Madrid, he scored a lot of important goals. Modric was a captain of the Croatian team, was a key player from Real Madrid. I think they performed generally better in 2018 and it was not a surprise that we had a new Ballon d’Or winner with Luka Modric. Congratulations from my side to him</p>

  <p><b>[German legend Lothar Matthaus says that Borussia Dortmund’s signing of Jadon Sancho was a major coup]</b> I saw him for the first time two years ago - at the European U-17 Championship. England played against Norway and I was in the gym on the treadmill, in front of me on the screen was the game. Normally I do not let anything change my focus, but there I stopped after 15 minutes because I followed the game and I noticed a player: the left side winger for England. Dribbling, double passes. Very strong! I called my manager to tell me who that is and where it came from. Five minutes later the SMS returned: Sancho, Manchester City. I called him and told him that if he signed him, he could make a lot of money. I had only seen him play for ten minutes. And to get that for little money from in England is like winning the lottery. He not only helps Dortmund, he also helps the Bundesliga beyond the borders. In England, the Bundesliga is gaining in importance, and now he is an international player<br /><br />The young players like Sancho are bursting with self-confidence. They are now prepared differently for professional football, for this big stage. He hits the balance between self-confidence and arrogance and is not overbearing. For this sort of player I count Sancho, in the Bundesliga also a Serge Gnabry or a Timo Werner. They are the future. Sancho will not let himself be driven crazy in Wembley, but he will enjoy showing off in England. And he can also show it to his former coach Pep Guardiola, who did not put his trust in him and let him slide through the screen. He is a player just like Leroy Sane. I’m surprised Guardiola did not see that. Sancho will also start his dribbling in Tottenham. He can make the difference in the Bundesliga, even against Leipzig or Bayern Munich. Why should that be different in the Champions League? If this continues, Dortmund will again be able to record a very high transfer revenue. I hope not in the next year or two. The player seems like he feels good and plays in Dortmund in one of the 10 best teams in Europe</p>

  <p><b>[Don’t feel sorry for Bayern Munich, they are ready for Liverpool]</b> Niko Kovac had to understand the system inside Bayern, to realise that this is a very different club to Eintracht Frankfurt, where he was before. It took some time for them to find each other, to find a way together. At the start the players did not know their position under him. They weren’t sure where they stood because he kept on chopping and changing. It seemed he was making changes for the sake of it. Every week it was a different team, players did not know if they were going to start or be on the bench. That disturbed the brains of the players, Jerome Boateng in particular. But he is a coach who likes to learn. He’s not the type to say ‘Hey, I’m here, I’m the guy who knows everything’. He doesn’t think he’s better than everybody else. He knows he has done some things wrong. Maybe he tried to change too much but now he has found himself and his first team. Niko has the fans behind him. They like him because he has been open and communicated. He doesn’t talk about blame or the mistakes of the players. Instead he asks himself what he could do better. I feel the whole club is behind him. He has his ideas and is working very hard. The atmosphere is much better in the team and I know they are all motivated to play against Liverpool. So I would warn everyone not to feel sorry or afraid for Bayern.<br /><br />I know the mentality of the club and that they will be focused to face Jurgen Klopp and his Reds side. Results give you security and confidence and things have got into the heads of the players. But since the end of the winter break I feel now that they are in a good way. The performances have been much better. When you are coming up against a team like Liverpool, with all the interest in this game from around the world, I am sure they will be focused and concentrated. They will fight to make a surprise</p>

  <p><b>[Lothar Matthaus warns against Champions League charge]</b> 0-0 is a decent result on the face of it but of course Bayern don’t have an away goal, and that’s all the more dangerous when you’re playing Liverpool, who carry a huge attacking threat. Bayern have to find the right balance - don’t concede, and score one themselves, that’s all they need. But the balance is very important - and also very dangerous: a bit too attacking, and Liverpool can exploit that; too defensive, then that’ll maybe reduce Bayern’s own attacking threat. They’ve got to score a goal somehow, because I don’t believe that in a game like this you can aim for a 0-0.<br /><br />You start with a solid defensive game, in the same way they played in Liverpool, but definitely not too defensive. Firstly they’re playing at home, and secondly they’ve got to get a goal, but actually in recent weeks Bayern have been good at the back, compact, and that’s how you keep in check a strong attack like Liverpool’s. You can’t throw everything at Liverpool from the start, no coach would be that crazy, because we know how strong Liverpool are, and that’s why the approach in the first leg was a bit more cautious than in other Champions League games</p>

  <p><b>[Former Germany captain Lothar Matthaus has criticised Joachim Low’s management of the national team]</b> For about 40 years I have been experiencing more or less closely the events of the German national team. And I cannot remember that a change, a cut, a new start ever took place before a qualifier or tournament. This always happens after an event. I see bankruptcies, bad luck and mishaps and they started, even before the World Cup. The catastrophic handling of the personality Mesut Ozil. The non-nomination of Leroy Sane. And after the embarrassing departure in the preliminary round, no consequences were drawn. Everyone - even the players - would have understood if they had been gracefully moved on right after the tournament. Low missed that chance and, out of loyalty, gave most of them a second chance in the Nations League. As you know, this was not used<br /><br />For me that’s not acceptable and not fair and appropriate. I can understand his decision from a sporting level, totally. He wants to integrate young, ambitious, hungry and talented players. But just as the players often made the wrong decision at the World Cup on the pitch, so did Low in terms of timing and communication of the upheaval. He got it completely wrong<br /><br />The captain’s armband cannot decide whether you’re playing or sitting on the bench. Ter Stegen has earned a fair chance due to his world-class achievements over the past two years. If you decide with the performance principle, it has to be valid for everybody</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich legend Lothar Matthaus is tipping Liverpool to win the Champions League]</b> Other countries have had dry stretches and our teams have met strong opponents in the round of 16. Last year Bayern had Besiktas, this time Liverpool, my personal favourite for the title. Bayern did not deserve to progress through both games. You do not expect so much from Schalke anyway, considering their Bundesliga results this season. They played above their standards last season when they became runners-up. Dortmund had a good first half against Tottenham both in the first leg and in the second leg. That’s not enough at this level. If you want to progress against a top team, you have to produce a top performance in both games over 90 minutes.<br /><br />Bayern will still have to sign one or two other players to be on par with the teams from England, Spain, Italy and Paris Saint-Germain. With Lucas Hernandez and Benjamin Pavard, two French world champions will arrive for the defence. There will also be something in attack. Timo Werner is a candidate who can play in many positions. Thorgan Hazard is a good player, but I do not know if he is good enough to help Bayern Munich. There are several candidates. The people in charge have a list and look around, they do their homework. In the end, of course, the player must fit into the concept of the club and the coach<br /><br />The Bundesliga is quite crazy this season. Bayern had a weak phase, Dortmund had a weak phase. But I think Bayern have the advantage. They play at home and have more experience in the championship fight. There are many indications that they will win the title again at the end</p>

  <p><b>[Lothar Matthaus believes that <a href="mario-gotze.html">Mario Gotze</a> isn’t fast enough to play in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> anymore]</b> I assume that his time at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> has ended. I would be very surprised if there could be an agreement in the upcoming negotiations. Today, his way of playing football is no longer in demand. Above all, he lacks speed to keep up with the football that <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> and many other top clubs practice. The move to <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> was not what he dreamed of in the end. He never really got back to his best at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> after his return.<br /><br /><a href="mario-gotze.html">Gotze</a> must find a club and above all a coach who builds around him and aligns the game plans with him. It is quite possible that Italy would be a suitable league for him. At least the game is not played so quickly there and that would benefit him. He has no lack of will. I have seen him play a few times and one can certainly not accuse him of listlessness or lack of ambition. But he is also not the player you want to see running 30 metres back to win balls deep in his own half. <a href="mario-gotze.html">Gotze</a> is not a football worker. If he has to do such tasks, I’m almost sorry</p>

  <p><b>[Lothar Matthaus has warned <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> against joining <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I think Timo is a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> player in mentality and style. He is a very fast and strong player. He is direct and doesn’t like to just hold onto the ball. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> likes fast players in attack and Werner has pace, but he has to play. At Leipzig, Timo has his position. He is a fixed player in the system of <a href="julian-nagelsmann.html">Julian Nagelsmann</a>. But <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are one of the best clubs in the world. They are strong not only in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but the Champions League as well. They have a lot of players who are very good. Sure, Werner could fit in at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> but he likes to play the big games and he would have to get someone out of the team. I am talking about Mane, <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> or <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>. I think when all these players are fit to play, then Werner would sit on the bench, which is not good, as he is a player who loves to play all the time. So, maybe it would be better to have another year at Leipzig. This season, for example, he has improved a lot, and not only in terms of the number of goals he has scored, but how he is playing overall. He can be a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> player in the future but he would be unhappy if he has to sit out big games on the bench. For this reason, if I were his manager, I would tell him to spend another year at Leipzig and to get ready for playing for the German national team at the European Championship in 2021. I am sure he will not finish his career at <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> and that he will soon play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. But I just hope it is not next season<br /><br /><b>[Matthaus is not predicting a straightforward home win, he does feel Leipzig are in a very strong position to challenge for the title]</b> Freiburg has nothing to lose, they are safe in the middle of the table with a lot of points and they have done a good job this season. But Leipzig are favourites and still have a chance to win the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. They have already played twice against <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, Borussia Monchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen, so the only big game left is <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> at home. Of course, they need to hope <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> and <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> make mistakes and lose points but I think Leipzig can still win it. They weren’t in the best form before the break but they are only five points behind and have good quality and harmony in the club. Nobody is putting pressure on them either. Of course, they are also only three points ahead of Leverkusen in fifth, so they could just as easily lose their Champions League spot as win the title! But they are a well-run club and, at the very least, I expect them to make it back into the Champions League again next year</p>

  <p><b>[Lothar Matthaus was stunned by <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a>’s transfer from <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> in 2017]</b> I was watching in the gym and I stopped the training session to call a friend of mine who works in the sport to ask, ‘Who is the English guy on the left-wing?’. My friend told me, ‘His name is <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> and he plays for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>.’ I thought ‘Wow! He is a great player and he will have a great career.’ Then, he signed for <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> six months later and I was like, ‘How could <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> let this great player go?’. I didn’t understand it at the time, as I knew <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> had a good eye for young talent. And <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> had speed, made assists, scored goals and was always running. Sure, he wasn’t working defensively back then but he didn’t need to; a young player is never perfect. But I saw the talent in him, so I was happy he went to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. It has helped him develop. Maybe he will go back to England but I know <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> will ask for a lot of money for this diamond. He is very good and we like having him here in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. He is one of the best things we have ever got from England! He is a good ambassador for the Bundesliga; he is young and full of confidence. He still has a contract and I hope <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> do everything they can to keep him in the league for another one or two years<br /><br /><b>[The fact that the game will be played behind closed doors at Signal Iduna Park makes it difficult to predict the outcome]</b> From the beginning of March to now, it’s completely different. I don’t know who is better prepared, or anything about the condition of the players or the injured players coming back. It is a bit of a lottery at the moment but it will be a really big game. It is like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and Arsenal: a big fight between two teams with a long history and many good players. Two years ago, both teams were playing in the Champions League. Sure, <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> played well in the last weeks before coronavirus and I think they are the favourites and it’s a home game for them. However, is that really in their favour now? Normally, at a <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> game, you have the support of 80,000 people behind you. They are the best home team in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> but now they have to answer these strange questions: Where are the fans? Where is the atmosphere? They have a good team, though, I think they will compete for the championship with <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>. So, <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> is, for me, the favourite against Schalke.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> is the first of Europe’s ‘Big Five’ leagues to return to action]</b> It is a special moment for football. If the Germans can do it well, then everybody can do it. Discipline is very important - not on the field but off it. Everybody has to follow the rules. I cannot say how the players are feeling, of course. I never experienced such a situation. I always travelled to the stadium with my team-mates and in the same dressing room as everybody else. Now, everything is different and I am very interested in seeing how they handle this. It is not easy for them. Everything has changed from eight weeks ago and the world is looking at us - and not only the football world. Everybody. We can be an example for each sport and for each competition. Nobody knows what will happen after these games, but we have done everything possible to make it work</p>
