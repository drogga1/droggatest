  <p><b>[Lothar Matthaus on <a href="franck-ribery.html">Franck Ribery</a>]</b> Franck has a great chance of winning the Ballon d’Or. He certainly deserves it. He has thrilled us all with his outstanding displays at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, not only with his dribbling but also with his work-rate. In 1990 I had the chance to play for two of the world’s best sides: <a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a> and Germany. Team-work was the key in both of those sides, and Franck has learned that recently. My top three for the award would be <a href="franck-ribery.html">Ribery</a>, Lahm and <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a>, although I fear <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> may win a fifth in a row</p>

  <p><b>[Lothar Matthaus gives some insight into his football upbringing that led to success at the highest levels of the game]</b> I come from a moderately successful footballing family. My father played in the fifth tier of German football while my brother was in the third division, but I was always captivated by the sport. I was always the youngest and the smallest and repeatedly had to hold my own against bigger opponents to make sure I didn’t lose every game. That was a huge incentive for me</p>

  <p><b>[Lothar Matthaus on <a href="philipp-lahm.html">Philipp Lahm</a>]</b> Philipp made a smart decision to retire from international football after Germany won the World Cup in 2014. He did very well because he saw that it was no longer possible to combine the two. That decision allowed him to focus on <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>. So one has to accept his decision now as well<br /><br />Personally, I still believed in him as a right-back even against the fastest opponents. I think he still had a few years in him. To leave the game altogether comes as quite a surprise. I find it hard to understand his decision to turn down the offer to become sporting director. A chance like that might come only once in a lifetime. There is no guarantee the situation will not be completely different in 2019. He might no longer be the top candidate then</p>

  <p><b>[Germany legend Lothar Matthaus singled the defender out, claiming he cared more about how he looked off the pitch than how he performed on it]</b> For Boateng, I think <b>[the question should be]</b>, is football the most important thing or is it the sunglasses and the earrings?.<br /><br />First, things have to be right on the pitch. These are signs of the outside, which the fans do not want to see. We treat every player like this, especially if the performance on the pitch isn’t right.<br /><br />But they do not have that with Boateng. You have to ask yourself - was the focus on football?

He is an absolutely exceptional player and shows that in almost every game. He is about to decide where he wants to play in the next few years. He has to weigh up if he is satisfied with fewer games but otherwise feeling good under Pep in Manchester. If that is the case, then he must stay there.

But <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are one of the best clubs in the world. They are strong not only in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but the Champions League as well. They have a lot of players who are very good. Sure, Werner could fit in at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> but he likes to play the big games and he would have to get someone out of the team. I am talking about Mane, <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> or <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>. I think when all these players are fit to play, then Werner would sit on the bench, which is not good, as he is a player who loves to play all the time. So, maybe it would be better to have another year at Leipzig. This season, for example, he has improved a lot, and not only in terms of the number of goals he has scored, but how he is playing overall. He can be a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> player in the future but he would be unhappy if he has to sit out big games on the bench. For this reason, if I were his manager, I would tell him to spend another year at Leipzig and to get ready for playing for the German national team at the European Championship in 2021. I am sure he will not finish his career at <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> and that he will soon play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. But I just hope it is not next season<br /><br /><b>[Matthaus is not predicting a straightforward home win, he does feel Leipzig are in a very strong position to challenge for the title]</b> Freiburg has nothing to lose, they are safe in the middle of the table with a lot of points and they have done a good job this season. But Leipzig are favourites and still have a chance to win the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. They have already played twice against <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, Borussia Monchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen, so the only big game left is <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> at home. Of course, they need to hope <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> and <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> make mistakes and lose points but I think Leipzig can still win it. They weren’t in the best form before the break but they are only five points behind and have good quality and harmony in the club. Nobody is putting pressure on them either. Of course, they are also only three points ahead of Leverkusen in fifth, so they could just as easily lose their Champions League spot as win the title! But they are a well-run club and, at the very least, I expect them to make it back into the Champions League again next year</p>

  <p><b>[Lothar Matthaus was stunned by <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a>’s transfer from <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> in 2017]</b> I was watching in the gym and I stopped the training session to call a friend of mine who works in the sport to ask, ‘Who is the English guy on the left-wing?’. My friend told me, ‘His name is <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> and he plays for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>.’ I thought ‘Wow! He is a great player and he will have a great career.’ Then, he signed for <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> six months later and I was like, ‘How could <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> let this great player go?’. I didn’t understand it at the time, as I knew <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> had a good eye for young talent. And <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> had speed, made assists, scored goals and was always running. Sure, he wasn’t working defensively back then but he didn’t need to; a young player is never perfect. But I saw the talent in him, so I was happy he went to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. It has helped him develop. Maybe he will go back to England but I know <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> will ask for a lot of money for this diamond. He is very good and we like having him here in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. He is one of the best things we have ever got from England! He is a good ambassador for the Bundesliga; he is young and full of confidence. He still has a contract and I hope <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> do everything they can to keep him in the league for another one or two years<br /><br /><b>[The fact that the game will be played behind closed doors at Signal Iduna Park makes it difficult to predict the outcome]</b> From the beginning of March to now, it’s completely different. I don’t know who is better prepared, or anything about the condition of the players or the injured players coming back. It is a bit of a lottery at the moment but it will be a really big game. It is like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and Arsenal: a big fight between two teams with a long history and many good players. Two years ago, both teams were playing in the Champions League. Sure, <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> played well in the last weeks before coronavirus and I think they are the favourites and it’s a home game for them. However, is that really in their favour now? Normally, at a <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> game, you have the support of 80,000 people behind you. They are the best home team in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> but now they have to answer these strange questions: Where are the fans? Where is the atmosphere? They have a good team, though, I think they will compete for the championship with <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>. So, <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> is, for me, the favourite against Schalke.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> is the first of Europe’s ‘Big Five’ leagues to return to action]</b> It is a special moment for football. If the Germans can do it well, then everybody can do it. Discipline is very important - not on the field but off it. Everybody has to follow the rules. I cannot say how the players are feeling, of course. I never experienced such a situation. I always travelled to the stadium with my team-mates and in the same dressing room as everybody else. Now, everything is different and I am very interested in seeing how they handle this. It is not easy for them. Everything has changed from eight weeks ago and the world is looking at us - and not only the football world. Everybody. We can be an example for each sport and for each competition. Nobody knows what will happen after these games, but we have done everything possible to make it work</p>
