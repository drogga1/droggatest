<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Wolves’s executive chairman Jeff Shi has announced that their preparations for the next campaign have already begun]</b> I think the first thing is that we want to see more growth and more development from the current squad, but the next thing is about how to do something in the window. I think, depending on Nuno’s identity and philosophy, we are very clear about what profile of player we want. But it depends on the market. You know what you want and that’s the most important thing, but you also need the market to release the players you want. I cannot say very concretely now, but what I can say is we will work very hard to improve the squad, and also try to compete with the best teams.<br /><br /><b>[Wolves manager Nuno Espírito Santo will therefore be looking to bolster his squad to help them cope with the extra games]</b> It doesn’t only depend on us, it’s depending on the market, but currently we are at a better position than the last season. To be honest, in the last season when we were just promoted, I felt some players didn’t want to come because ‘oh, you’re just promoted, maybe you will go down again’. Now we have shown that we can be very competitive in the Premier League, and we have also beaten many strong teams which makes the club more attractive to the top players in the world. We have a top coach and a top team, so I think the job will be easier to us, but because we are already here, the requirement for the quality of the players will be higher</p>
