  <p><b>[Barcelona will be without Lionel Messi for El Clasico for the first time since 2007]</b> It is going to be a game with many goals because El Clasico is always like this. It is very attractive, with ups and downs. I want Barcelona to win, always. Real Madrid are a big club though. I think the result will be 2-1 or 3-1 for Barcelona. It is true Barcelona are currently without Messi but they have other big players too. Messi is almost everything, but there are also other big players. Real Madrid are a bit down now, but Real are always Real and every single game is a different world. It is the biggest event. Barcelona-Real Madrid makes all the people excited. It is a big party for all the Barcelona fans and even more for a former academy player. You’re very proud to play in El Clasico. Fortunately, I have been able to play Clasicos and, being honest, it is spectacular. The week before, the minutes before the game … and especially during the game it is very intense.<br /><br />Messi has always been shy since he was a child. He is quite reserved. Anyway, I think as time goes on, people get experience and extroverted. I left a few years ago, but I think now, being captain, he has to take the team on his own and link everyone, being the leader. I believe, even if he is still a bit shy, he is doing a good job as captain. It is a unique experience being able to play and train with Messi. And also to get along with him every day because at the end of the day football is your life. It is a unique experience. He is a great guy and as a player he is very good in the games and even better in the training sessions. He is a player who thinks much more in advance of you. When you try to tackle him, he has already dribbled past you. He is a cracking player<br /><br /><b>[Watching Los Blancos’ success in Europe]</b> Yes, being honest, it is something painful. Real Madrid winning three Champions Leagues in a row, it is something which will never happen again because it is extremely difficult. It is something historic, and yes, it is painful. It is tough to see the eternal rival winning that many Champions Leagues. It is time for Barcelona to win the Champions League and hopefully it will be this year</p>

  <p><b>[Martin Montoya believes that good performances for Brighton and in the Premier League can earn him the chance to make his Spain debut]</b> I have good relationship with Luis Enrique. I played for him for two or three years at Barcelona B and then a year in the first team. It is true though, I didn’t play so much in my last year at Barcelona, or at least as much as I would have liked. I think it is possible to get called up from Brighton. I know how difficult it is, but I have a thorn in my side because I was called up and I didn’t make my debut. I have played in all the youth age groups but at the end what everyone wants is to play for the national team. I was unlucky. I know it is very difficult, especially now when we have great players in my position, like Dani Carvajal, Alvaro Odriozola and Hector Bellerín. There is a big competition and they are players who are with big teams. Anyway, you have to focus on doing your job in your club and in the end if the manager calls you up, you are more than welcome. Jonny, from Wolves, was selected in the last list. So the Premier League is a great platform and also the national coaches know me already. Of course I would like it.<br /><br />I always dedicate the goals to my mother looking to heaven, but it is true I want to celebrate like a seagull. I want to do the gesture of the seagulls because when I was young, a long time ago, I used to celebrate the same way as Celta Vigo legend Catanha did. I was doing the seagull! I don’t know, maybe I will do it again as it would link to Brighton. Anyway, when I score a goal, I always dedicated it to my family. It was very hard for me to lose my mother. It is very hard for anyone when you lost a mother or father. I fight to achieve every goal thanks to her and I do it for her<br /><br />We are in a good run, back to back victories against direct rivals. We should try to win these games. It is very difficult to qualify for European competitions because there are lots of big teams in Premier League. They are very difficult to beat and overtake. However, a few years ago Leicester became champions, so anything can happen in football and we would love to be in European competition<br /><br />There are many teams which are of a high level. We have faced Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham. They are fantastic teams and they know what they do. They are world-class teams, which are always great, not only in the Premier League, but also in European competitions. I see City as very strong. City and Chelsea. If I have to choose someone, I would say City or Chelsea are the best<br /><br /><b>[On Pep Guardiola]</b> In my opinion, he is one of the best managers in the world. I have been lucky to be coached by him, to have had training with him and to have played under him and have been taught by him. As a manager, he is 10/10. He speaks a lot and makes the players feel pampered. He explains to you what are you doing well and what are you doing not that well in order to improve everything. He wants all the team to know how to develop the play and gets every single player to know his role</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar wants to return to Barcelona]</b> I don’t know, I think it is difficult to get done. Paris is also a great team and I don’t think they will let him to leave easily. Paris paid a big amount of money for him and I don’t think Barcelona would pay the same price for him <b>[to come back]</b>. I think Neymar wants to go back because he was really comfortable and adapted the three years he was at the club. He had a great connection with Luis Suarez and Messi, but I think it is very difficult for him to come back to Barca.<br /><br />Yes, he is scoring a lot of goals for Inter in the last years, being the top scorer in the Serie A. He is going to be, well, he is already a world-class player. He is still young, so he keeps improving. He is playing Champions League now. I think he will be a reference player in attack. Barcelona is always Barcelona. They are one of the best teams and can beat you anytime. They have great players. Look at Tottenham. Tottenham is a great team and they were well beaten at Wembley. It is true all the away games are tough in the Champions League. The competition is very close, but I really think Barcelona is the favourite<br /><br /><b>[Montoya looks back at Barcelona legend Xavi as someone who can follow in Guardiola’s footsteps]</b> Yes, no doubt. He will be manager yes or yes, 100%. He used to be a leader as a player, exactly like Guardiola in his football playing career. He was talking a lot and a player who was already a leader. They are very smart, knowing what to do at every time. Xavi used to read the game perfectly and these are the kind of guys who become great managers</p>
