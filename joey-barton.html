The club I left and watch now are two totally different organisations. The club I played for wouldn’t have treated a player that had been a servant for as long as Joe has in the manner that it has. I think it is disgusting.<br /><br />He is a full international, somebody who, probably before City took the money, could have gone on to bigger and better things himself but stayed and wanted to be at City.<br /><br />I don’t see what he has done wrong to be treated the way he has.

  <p><b>[Joey Barton has hit out at pundits for suggesting that Chelsea midfielder N’Golo Kante is one of the outstanding midfielders in the world game]</b> In England, there are boxes and it is impossible to get out of them. At the moment, for example, everyone swears by N’Golo Kante. It’s fashionable. For pundits, he’s the best midfielder in the world. That’s not the case - he’s very good, but I played against him three weeks ago. He’s a phenomenal destroyer who played in a phenomenal team, but he’s not a creator. And it’s impossible to be so definitive with a player who has not played in the Champions League. Two years ago, no-one knew who he was and I was surprised that the scouts missed him. I’m sceptical, like Dimitri Payet. He was incredible last season with West Ham, which surprised everyone, including me. When I was with Marseille and he played with Lille, he was only seen against Sochaux and Brest - never in the big games. It was the same with OM afterwards. But in England, it was different after his first game. Except, no big club made a move for him: it was China or Marseille? Why?<br /><br />We focus too much on a player when he works well, we don’t focus on how he behaves in difficulty. If you look at Zlatan Ibrahimovic at PSG, he was very consistent - that’s the mark of a great</p>

  <p><b>[Philippe Coutinho will inevitably end up at Barcelona at some point]</b> He wants out, and if you’re getting up to what Liverpool are now, almost £120m, it just looks like how much rather than if or when. He’s not a Scouser, he’s a Brazilian. He’s already living a fair distance away from home and he’s probably grown up wanting to play for Barcelona. No disrespect to Liverpool, but that’s the club Brazilian youngsters grow up wanting to play for nowadays. It’s not the Liverpool of the 80s, it’s Liverpool who haven’t won a title for over 20 years, so you can’t blame the boy. As I said, it’s just a case of how much and at what moment he goes.<br /><br />Liverpool should have pre-empted this. They should have known a big club was going to come sniffing for him and, although he’s difficult to replace, they should have had replacements lined up for him</p>

  <p><b>[Ross Barkley’s £35 million transfer to Chelsea collapsed because Antonio Conte had turned his phone off on deadline day]</b> I heard a really interesting thing about what happened with the Ross Barkley transfer. Conte turned his phone off and Barkley’s representatives were trying to contact him. He wanted to say ‘look, where am I going to play’, and Conte turned his phone off. That is why Barkley got cold feet and never signed. He thought, ‘well, if the manager isn’t answering the phone to me he clearly doesn’t want me’, and that is why he went back to Everton.</p>

  <p><b>[Joey Barton says Pep Guardiola needs to stop complaining and get on with it]</b> What does he want, a non-contact sport like Spain or Italy where the game is broken up by a series of set-play after set-play? We need to let the game flow. The pace it is moving, there are going to be one or two challenges that are mistimed. Pep has to understand this is the nature <b>[of English football]</b>. There is a physicality to our game which is different to the continent and if you are going to win leagues, it is par for the course. You are going to have to stand up to the examination of our game. Stop complaining, get on with it!<br /><br />The game has progressed. We do protect our players very, very well in this country now compared to what we used to. If you look at Serie A and the French league, they are horrible leagues to watch. It is stop, stop, free-kick, free-kick, foul. That is why our league is the best because it does flow</p>

  <p><b>[Joey Barton insists he never wants to see England win the World Cup]</b> No. I dream of winning big titles with the big clubs but not as an international manager. If you ask a Liverpool supporter: ‘Would you prefer Liverpool to be champions or England to be world champions?’ They would say Liverpool. And if you win the World Cup, you get a title! That would annoy me. You win a football match and you’re a knight! Sir Harry Kane? You’re joking! There are more important things.<br /><br /><b>[Barton said when asked about the tournament]</b> Don’t get me started. They beat no one and ended up in the semi-finals without anyone understanding how. But everyone was happy. In this country, nobody sees things rationally. It’s worrying</p>

  <p><b>[Former Marseille midfielder Joey Barton has taken a swipe at Paris Saint-Germain superstar Neymar]</b> I think he’s the Kim Kardashian of football. Neymar’s not the best player in the world, as we saw again in Russia. He’s not at the level of Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi. There are many other players in the world in front of him. Neymar’s not a footballing phenomenon, he’s an advertising phenomenon, like the Kardashians. When you see PSG wearing a Jordan jersey! Really? Come on guys, this is a basketball brand! And you’re a football club. Is it just me or is that me?<br /><br /><b>[Speaking about current footballing culture]</b> Now everyone wants to support the big teams, those that win. When my son plays, he wants to be the best players, Messi, Ronaldo, Mohamed Salah - but definitely not Neymar or Harry Kane. We don’t say that name <b>[Neymar]</b> at home<br /><br /><b>[Barton played 25 times with Marseille, where he discovered a new way of playing]</b> I learned a new style, a different approach. In England, some of the things we see in France just wouldn’t happen. Here, football must be like basketball, an attack here, an attack there. Otherwise, fans get upset. In France, there’s more patience. Here, football is a show</p>

  <p><b>[Joey Barton believes that the Football Association must alter their szero-tolerance approach to gambling in football]</b> They have to revise their approach. The players that are getting exposed and banned for it are really the tip of the iceberg. There’s a lot of people who have vested interest in promoting and advertising gambling, I don’t think it’s a problem with that. I just think it’s a problem when we ban something that is clearly a massive part of our game and then we start banning players for it.<br /><br /><b>[Barton is of the opinion that the FA should be more lenient with their regulations]</b> I’m not saying we should allow betting on games because obviously it would probably hurt the integrity of the sport but I think we need to be a bit more 21st century about our approach. I do think the rule here is a little bit too draconian, a little bit too hard line. What difference does it make if a player in the Premier League is betting on the Brazilian league, how can he influence that? The zero-tolerance approach is clearly always going to have casualties</p>

Obviously, it accumulated in us winning the Championship in tremendous style, with the club almost emerging as a kind of phoenix from the flames of the disaster that was there less than 10 months before<br /><br />Fast forward, we didn’t even get to the Christmas period. We made a fantastic start in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.

We’ve got a group of lads in there who’ve given me everything since I walked into the football club.
