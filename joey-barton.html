Fleetwood Town manager Joey Barton has been charged with actual bodily harm following an incident at his side’s match against Barnsley at Oakwell in April</p>

  <p><b>[Joey Barton explains why he told <a href="alan-pardew.html">Alan Pardew</a> no one wanted him at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a> on first day]</b> I don’t think I’d chin him but you have to put into context in terms of <a href="chris-hughton.html">Chris Hughton</a> had taken over the club at a point where it was toxic. It was really toxic. We were in the dressing room when they were relegated. We were in the dressing room when they couldn’t find a manager and <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a> didn’t take the position that everybody expected him to take because of a dispute with <a href="mike-ashley.html">Mike Ashley</a> and then Chris and Colin Calderwood with a great dignity and a great respect did an incredible job at putting that football club back together piece by piece. Obviously, it accumulated in us winning the Championship in tremendous style, with the club almost emerging as a kind of phoenix from the flames of the disaster that was there less than 10 months before<br /><br />Fast forward, we didn’t even get to the Christmas period. We made a fantastic start in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. The team had a nice flavour to it in terms of we had <a href="andy-carroll.html">Andy Carroll</a> leading the line, we had Kevin Nolan, we had people who genuinely cared about the football club and all the players who maybe had contributed negatively towards the demise of <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a> had left and we were left with a real solid core, a real solid foundation we felt we could build a football team from<br /><br />I loved the area, I was settled in the area. My family were settled. I know speak for a lot of other players when that was the case and we really felt we could build a really exciting team and Chris and Colin Calderwood were a huge part of that<br /><br />For a player to come into a dressing room when we were eighth or ninth in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at the time in our first season back around and not at Christmas yet and clearly holding our own in a division above and for Chris to be sacked in the manner he was in my opinion a disgrace</p>

  <p><b>[Wycombe took a huge step towards reaching the League One play-off final as they beat Fleetwood 4-1 in a madcap encounter at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Highbury</a> on Friday night]</b> We just had an off night. It was a big game for the lads and Wycombe, to be fair to them, got off to a flyer. We managed to pull away from that, get a goal and get ourselves back in it but you just have to say it was a disappointing night. We’ve got a group of lads in there who’ve given me everything since I walked into the football club. People will, rightly, be disappointed with elements of the game, but I’d rather it be 4-1 tonight than 4-1 on Monday because that would be the final nail in the coffin.</p>

  <p><b>[Wycombe booked their place in the League One play-off final with a 6-3 aggregate victory over Fleetwood, following a 2-2 draw in the semi-final second leg at Adams Park]</b> We knew that it was going to be tough after the opening skirmishes and giving two goals away in six minutes <b>[in the first leg]</b> which we haven’t done in the entirety of the season, but it is what it is. I must give massive credit to Wycombe. Gareth and his boys earned that over two legs and now they have a chance of getting into the Championship, which is an incredible achievement<br /><br />It would have been easy to come here and just roll over because of the enormity of the task. I’m really proud of my players tonight</p>
