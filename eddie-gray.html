  <p><b>[Ten Legends of the Beautiful Game to be honoured by National Football Museum]</b> I played in a great <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> team that did not always get the credit it deserved. It is nice to see us now being recognised.</p>

  <p><b>[Eddie Gray returned to take over on a temporary basis. One of the best and most popular players in Leeds’s history, having been a key component of Don Revie’s all-conquering side, he had managed the club for three years during the 1980s. A youth team coach responsible for bringing through Ian Harte, Harry Kewell and Alan Smith amongst others, he had also served as <a href="david-o-leary.html">David O’Leary</a>’s assistant before being let go by Reid]</b> To tell you the truth I wouldn’t have done it for many people but it was Leeds United and the chief executive at the time - Trevor Birch - was someone I’ve got a lot of respect for. He asked me to go back. If it wasn’t for Trevor I wouldn’t have done it because I knew the situation the club was in from a financial point of view. There was a new regime coming in and it was difficult. It didn’t take long to realise that it would need someone much better than me to turn it around<br /><br />The biggest challenge was that the players who were worth something knew that the club was trying to sell them every day, which didn’t go down well. It doesn’t lead to a happy camp. Players are more or less thinking they might be leaving in the morning. That was the nature of the job at the time. But that’s no excuse. You always think you can do better<br /><br /><b>[A young team, featuring eight academy graduates, controlled the game and should have won, but a familiar brittleness undermined their efforts. They went 3-1 up through Alan Smith’s penalty with just over 20 minutes left, but then Jason Euell capitalised on some poor defending to score twice in quick succession, condemning Leeds to relegation]</b> It felt terrible. It was the lowest point I’d ever had at the football club. If you’re good enough to stay up you’ll stay up. We were six points off staying up, which is quite a lot when you actually look at it. There were a few games which we might have won and didn’t. When you’re down there things seem to go against you, or you imagine they do, but in football it’s about doing it yourself and making your own luck<br /><br /><b>[The arrival of <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Marcelo Bielsa</a> last summer only added to the sense that a brighter future could be just around the corner]</b> Getting promoted would mean everything to the fans. The fanbase is tremendous, home and away. It would mean a lot to the city, but more importantly the club itself. I hope to see them get back to playing against the best teams in the country. It would mean a lot to everyone connected with the club - past and present. It would definitely mean a lot to me after what happened in 2003/04</p>

  <p><b>[Eddie Gray on Norman Hunter]</b> Norman was a truly great football player. A lot of great players have walked through the gates of <a href="leeds-united.html">Elland Road</a> and Norman was right up there with the best of them. It’s a sad day for everybody connected with the club. He was a great reader of the game, great left foot, great passer, so influential in our team</p>

  <p><b>[Fellow Whites legend Eddie Gray, were lucky enough to have played alongside Hunter in the all-conquering Whites side of the 1960s and early 1970s under Don Revie]</b> Norman Hunter was as important as anybody in <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> United’s history and I mean anybody. He was a great lad, and a truly great footballer but he also had time for everybody. He was a great mate</p>
