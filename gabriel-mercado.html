  <p><b>[Gabriel Mercado facing uncertain future as Sevilla contract runs down]</b> It doesn’t just depend on me. I do my part, which is to come here and train every day and be ready to play and give my best. That will not change until my last day. The people who make the decisions will analyse if I fit or not. For the moment there has not been any type of contact <b>[regarding fresh terms]</b>, but I know that there is still time and I will give my best until the last day. If my link with Sevilla ends, I cannot question anything and nobody can question my effort and my commitment to this club.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on the club’s title credentials]</b> There is a long way to go, we have to maintain this good streak of victories. The last match <b>[against Valladolid]</b> wasn’t our best game, but we won and that highlights how good and solid our team is because despite all of the problems we face, after many injuries to important players, our team always overcomes this and we are fighting. Football always changes but it is good that this year’s La Liga is entertaining. There is equality and any team can beat another. Normally at this time of a season the giants usually impose themselves with their squads and budget, which is to be expected when you play against Barcelona, Madrid or Atletico. But we’re looking to take advantage of our opportunities, we’re growing step by step at the top, but we can’t get too caught up in that as our goal is to just keep working and improving<br /><br />We have come down one step after two years in the Champions League, which was really special for me. We are one of the bigger candidates for the Europa League, and we know it. We have a responsibility to fight to win this competition</p>

  <p><b>[Argentina are waiting for Lionel Messi with open arms]</b> Argentina without Messi isn’t the same. We have to respect his decision, he has his reasons for wanting to take time out and if he wants to consider a return at some point, that will be really important. All Argentineans are waiting for him with open arms, so we have to wait and see what will happen.<br /><br />It was really difficult for Argentina since the qualification with three different coaches. Jorge <b>[Sampaoli]</b> arrived and tried to implement his ideas and we couldn’t do it at the World Cup. It is not easy to play a World Cup because all the teams want what you want. Argentina had additional pressure because at the last World Cup they lost the final and would only be happy with winning the cup. We tried, it was our dream, but unfortunately we couldn’t do it and Jorge had to leave us. I will always have a huge respect for him because he helped me to join Sevilla and to play at the World Cup. I wish him the best</p>
