  <p><b>[Fernando Hierro on <a href="raphael-varane.html">Varane</a>]</b> There is no centre-back in the world like <a href="raphael-varane.html">Varane</a>. For his age, his understanding of the game is amazing. He has the maturity of somebody who has been playing for 20 years</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo’s Ballon d’Or success in an era of Lionel Messi magic and Barcelona supremacy is huge]</b> Cristiano will be among the best players in Real Madrid history for sure. We will miss him once he leaves. In an era of Barcelona supremacy, in front of Messi, and winning many titles, there’s a huge merit in Cristiano winning four Ballons d’Or. Huge!<br /><br />Gareth Bale will achieve what he wants to achieve, with the ambition he has. It’s true that in his years at Real Madrid there have been too many injuries. But having good physical and technical condition, some day the success will appear. He still has a lot of potential to show<br /><br /><b>[A man who spent 14 years with Madrid in his playing days]</b> I went to La Rioja to watch Isco playing a territorial league when he was 15 years old. After 10 minutes, I left the pitch: it was enough! What could Isco’s value be in this transfer market? His price would be huge.</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Hierro’s mood had been adversely affected by the pessimistic environment in which he had found himself]</b> I’m going to leave this press conference now because it feels like a funeral in here when, in fact, tomorrow we’re going to play in the World Cup, which is a marvellous event.<br /><br /><b>[The former defender says that he does not plan to make any significant changes]</b> Much of the coaching staff is the same. So, not much is going to change in two days. You’re going to see the same Spain, a team that tries to be the protagonist in games</p>

  <p><b>[Spain manager Fernando Hierro praised Cristiano Ronaldo after the Portugal star’s hat-trick against his side]</b> When you have a player like Ronaldo, it is extremely fortunate for whichever team has him. I have a really good relationship with Ronaldo, but I certainly would not change him for any of the players in my squad<br /><br />I keep talking about Cristiano but what more can I say? He’s the best in the world. I hope that he keeps scoring and if he’s there in Qatar, I hope he scores again</p>

  <p><b>[Spain coach Fernando Hierro warns players to take nothing for granted]</b> I think there are 32 great teams here at this World Cup and no-one is giving anything away, so anyone who thinks it is going to be very easy to score and win by a landslide is wrong. In some groups two teams have already qualified, but our group is very tough. Morocco lost 1-0 to Portugal but they were fighting to the end. As a 23-man group we are very committed - we are one team and that is how we will play until the end. We know we still need to improve but hopefully as we do that we will keep winning.</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Hierro believes that the team simply must get better, as he readily admits that he and his players were fortunate to top Group B]</b> I like the group, it was a level playing field, we weren’t sure who was going to be first or second until the last minute and I have to admit we were lucky to finish first. We have to be very demanding with ourselves. This is not the way. We can’t allow the opposition so many chances. If we want to get to where we dream, we have to adjust these details and be self-critical, knowing there is room for improvement.</p>

  <p><b>[Spanish FA has announced that Fernando Hierro will not continue in the post of Spain head coach]</b> After many kilometres of walking together, the Royal Spanish Football Federation and Fernando Hierro put an end to their relationship once the participation of Spain in the World Cup in Russia ended. The coach declined to return to his previous position as sports director of the RFEF to seek new horizons and undertake new professional challenges.<br /><br />After two spells as sporting director of the Federation, the first between 2007 and 2011 - coinciding with the best period of the national team, which won the 2008 European Championship with Luis Aragones as coach and the 2010 World Cup with Vicente del Bosque - and the second from November 2017 until now, the RFEF wants to thank Fernando Hierro for his commitment and sense of responsibility when he took the lead in the national team in this extraordinary situation, as well as in the performance of all his duties.<br /><br />The Federation wants to highlight the professional and human values of an extraordinary athlete who wants the best of fortunes. Thanks for everything, Fernando</p>

I’m relaxed, enjoying the moment, enjoying life and living all the situations that I come across day by day. Things will happen and decisions will have to be made, but I’m relaxed for now. When something really calls out to me, that will be when I think about the next step. I’m enjoying everything that comes my way. It’s not a question of missing something or not. I’m enjoying life</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> Santander ambassador Fernando Hierro encounters about his playing days with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> We all miss the day today, the smell of the grass, being in the dressing-room with the other players. It is a profession that you choose because you are passionate about it. It is short, ends quickly, and just going to training every day is what I miss the most<br /><br />Together with <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo Nazario</a>, <a href="luis-figo.html">Luis Figo</a>, Raul, <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>, <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a> … every training session was just a delight. Even if I was injured, or could not train for whatever reason, I would go along just to enjoy it. To watch the magic that one or another would come up with.<br /><br />Raul was underrated because he never got a Ballon d’Or he deserved,<br /><br /><b>[Born in <a href="malaga-fc.html">Malaga</a> in 1968, Hierro played for two seasons at Real Valladolid, before joining <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> in 1989]</b> 14 years at a club like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, at that level, you have to be satisfied and proud. That was the club I dreamed about playing for when I was a child. I felt privileged. The nine months with Al-Rayyan was the right thing for me, to see another culture and another way of thinking. Bolton was such a family club, with a marvellous heart. It had always been a dream to play in England too.<br /><br /><b>[He generously says his achievements are now being matched by current Blancos captain <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a>]</b> What <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a> does isn’t normal. Sometimes I played as a midfielder. <a href="gerard-pique.html">Gerard Pique</a> also scores goals, but Sergio is out of this world, for his club and for the national team<br /><br /><b>[He recalls his favourite moment for his country as the flying header which sealed qualification for the 1994 World Cup in the United States]</b> I don’t know if it was my best goal, but I always remember the one I scored in 1993 against Denmark to qualify Spain for the World Cup<br /><br /><b>[His most difficult opponent as a defender, he remembers, was later to be a future teammate at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and is now president at Hierro’s first <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> club Valladolid]</b> Defending against <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> was terribly difficult, during his year at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. You knew that wherever the ball went, he was going to get there first. And if he got clear at the goal, he would score for sure. He was a marvellous player</p>

Years ago we defenders had more chances to score, we’d often play in midfield. But in today’s day and age, in the 21st century, Sergio is extraordinary.<br /><br /><b>[Gerard]</b> <a href="gerard-pique.html">Pique</a> scores quite a few goals too, but Sergio really is an anomaly.
