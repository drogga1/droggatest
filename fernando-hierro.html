  <p><b>[Fernando Hierro on Varane]</b> There is no centre-back in the world like <a href="raphael-varane.html">Varane</a>. For his age, his understanding of the game is amazing. He has the maturity of somebody who has been playing for 20 years</p>

  <p><b>[Spain coach Fernando Hierro warns players to take nothing for granted]</b> I think there are 32 great teams here at this World Cup and no-one is giving anything away, so anyone who thinks it is going to be very easy to score and win by a landslide is wrong. In some groups two teams have already qualified, but our group is very tough. Morocco lost 1-0 to Portugal but they were fighting to the end. As a 23-man group we are very committed - we are one team and that is how we will play until the end. We know we still need to improve but hopefully as we do that we will keep winning.</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Hierro on <a href="laliga.html">LaLiga</a> add four more ambassadors: himself, <a href="guti.html">Guti</a>, <a href="denilson.html">Denilson</a> and Lomba]</b> Ever since I retired, I’ve represented Spanish football. We’re lucky to represent <a href="laliga.html">LaLiga</a>. It’s a pleasure. All we need is a coach to lead this great team, but we have Fernando Sanz, who is doing very well. This initiative is fantastic</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Hierro believes <a href="raul-gonzalez.html">Raul Gonzalez</a> can manage Real Madrid]</b> Raul has everything you need to become <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> Coach. We had all been told - when we were players - about a kid who was scoring for fun in the underage groups…that he was different. This was a boy who had his eyes wide open, who had plenty of enthusiasm and a level of drive and ambition that was much higher than usual. We all understood what he represented and what he would become</p>

  <p><b>[La Liga Santander ambassador Fernando Hierro encounters about his playing days with Real Madrid]</b> We all miss the day today, the smell of the grass, being in the dressing-room with the other players. It is a profession that you choose because you are passionate about it. It is short, ends quickly, and just going to training every day is what I miss the most<br /><br />Together with <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo Nazario</a>, <a href="luis-figo.html">Luis Figo</a>, Raul, <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>, <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a> … every training session was just a delight. Even if I was injured, or could not train for whatever reason, I would go along just to enjoy it. To watch the magic that one or another would come up with.<br /><br />Raul was underrated because he never got a Ballon d’Or he deserved,<br /><br /><b>[Born in <a href="malaga-fc.html">Malaga</a> in 1968, Hierro played for two seasons at Real Valladolid, before joining <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> in 1989]</b> 14 years at a club like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, at that level, you have to be satisfied and proud. That was the club I dreamed about playing for when I was a child. I felt privileged. The nine months with Al-Rayyan was the right thing for me, to see another culture and another way of thinking. Bolton was such a family club, with a marvellous heart. It had always been a dream to play in England too.<br /><br /><b>[He generously says his achievements are now being matched by current Blancos captain Sergio Ramos]</b> What <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a> does isn’t normal. Sometimes I played as a midfielder. <a href="gerard-pique.html">Gerard Pique</a> also scores goals, but Sergio is out of this world, for his club and for the national team<br /><br /><b>[He recalls his favourite moment for his country as the flying header which sealed qualification for the 1994 World Cup in the United States]</b> I don’t know if it was my best goal, but I always remember the one I scored in 1993 against Denmark to qualify Spain for the World Cup<br /><br /><b>[His most difficult opponent as a defender, he remembers, was later to be a future teammate at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and is now president at Hierro’s first <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> club Valladolid]</b> Defending against <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> was terribly difficult, during his year at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. You knew that wherever the ball went, he was going to get there first. And if he got clear at the goal, he would score for sure. He was a marvellous player</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Hierro labelled <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> captain <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a> extraordinary]</b> <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a> is absolutely remarkable. Years ago we defenders had more chances to score, we’d often play in midfield. But in today’s day and age, in the 21st century, Sergio is extraordinary.<br /><br /><b>[Gerard]</b> <a href="gerard-pique.html">Pique</a> scores quite a few goals too, but Sergio really is an anomaly. His goalscoring record for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and the national team is remarkable.</p>
