  <p><b>[Nathan Baxter, meanwhile, is one of England’s brightest goalkeepers and the Ross County loanee was more than happy to travel from Kent to play for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> as a teenager because he was so enamoured with the youth set-up]</b> I loved growing up at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. It is a wonderful academy. The support I received growing up through the age groups was absolutely unbelievable. The way they support me while I am on loan is great. They are in constant contact with the staff at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. Neil Bath, in particular, has been really supportive of all my loans. I am grateful to be at the club</p>

  <p><b>[Goalkeeper Nathan Baxter, who played alongside Ugbo in the 2016 triumph on FA Youth Cup]</b> The FA Youth Cup matters. It helped me to play senior football at the age that I did because I had played pressured games in the youth team. It meant when I was on loan at every other team I went to, I could handle it</p>
