  <p><b>[Marcelo Bielsa and Kemar Roofe winning the EFL Manager and Player of the Month awards for August]</b> It has all stemmed from our pre-season. It has been the best pre-season I have had so far - the hardest - and the style of play that Marcelo is giving us and educating us with is obviously showing. The style of play with the ball, without the ball, our fitness and off the pitch as well, every day he’s educating us on how to be better people as well. I feel like I can express myself a bit more. I am playing in a position where I can show what I can actually do and the team plays to my strengths as well and also to everyone else’s strengths. We are not doing something we’re not capable of doing<br /><br />The main thing, though, is that we are top of the league and we are getting good results. The longer we can keep our unbeaten <b>[league]</b> run going, the stronger chance we have of maintaining our position high up in the league, we are going to keep working hard on the field and in the gym and hopefully we will improve</p>

  <p><b>[Kemar Roofe has sealed a £7million move to Anderlecht from <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>]</b> Thank you <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> for an incredible three years. The support I’ve got from the fans since day one has been unbelievable. I have absolutely no doubt that you will be back in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> where you have always belonged very soon. It’s what you all deserve. Despite having some unfortunate injuries, I always gave my all for the shirt, and <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> will always have a place in my heart #MOT</p>
