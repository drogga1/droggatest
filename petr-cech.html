But there is a long way to go and there is always a twist in the tail so you keep working hard every day and try to keep getting results. If we believe then I think we can still do it - there are more than enough games to put ourselves back at the top of the league so we will work for that</p>

That is because every goal will be important when you see how tight it is in the top five places. Every goal might count so we try to make sure, when we can, to continue to search for more goals. And we wanted to make sure that at 3-0 and 4-0 we didn’t concede. Every time you can score more goals you should try to do so.

We had a loss at Everton and suddenly we had another two games where we dropped points. But we gave the right answer here that it doesn’t matter. You have to carry on, get ready and there are a lot of games to be played. We have to play everybody who is around us, so we can take points from them. So we are in a good position</p>

  <p><b>[Petr Cech says Arsenal team-mates Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez need to be shown how much we need them]</b> I think for us it is important to show them how much we need them in the team and to show them how much we want to win. Then obviously it will make their decision easier. If they see that we are competitive, everybody is ready to win things together and they know how important they are for our team, then this will make their decision easier.<br /><br />I believe it’s completely against the spirit of what a football club should be. Once you are on the train at the start of a season, you stay on the train until the end of the season. I personally don’t think that it is right<br /><br />On Saturday <b>[against Swansea]</b> we were missing players due to injury and so they are all basically close to fitness and back to the squad, apart from Santi <b>[Cazorla]</b>, who will need a little bit more time. If everyone is fit then we have a strong squad. So this is probably why the boss said what he said. It is his decision. We concentrate on our game and then we train. If he brings in a player or not, that is his decision</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Cech has offered his support to Ryan Mason as the Hull City midfielder recovers from surgery on a fractured skull]</b> I offered him my support because I have experience in what he’s going through, and I’m happy to share my experience if it helps him. The possibility to be able to offer him my experience, it was the first thing I had in my mind to do. I’m obviously glad that he’s back home and that he’s started his recovery process. Hopefully he will get well very soon. When you’re in this situation, you need people around you to help. Then you have someone who has the experience and can tell you: ‘Don’t worry about this, it’s completely normal, and don’t worry about that because I went through it too’.<br /><br />It can obviously help because you have a lot of doubts, a lot of questions and nobody seems to have the answer. You can have someone who went through that and they can tell you not to worry about it, it will just take time and that you can carry on doing what you’re doing. You need your closest around you to help you when you don’t feel right. It’s a situation which not only involves the person who got injured, but also the people who are supporting him, the people around him like his family. Even for them it’s a challenging situation</p>

And obviously not only looking ahead but we need to look behind as well because for the Champions League positions the table is very congested.<br /><br />We need to be consistent, that’s the first thing. We have periods when we are doing really well, then we had a week when we lost both games and didn’t play well. So we need to make sure that we carry on and improve where we can. We need to make sure we are ready for every game because each game will be like a final</p>

I don’t think Chelsea will lose so many points, so now we need to concentrate on finishing as high as possible and qualifying for the Champions League.<br /><br />We had two weeks to prepare for the game. We knew they were fast on the counter-attack and that they like to press a lot, so we didn’t want to give them a chance to counter-attack. The two goals we conceded in the first half were when we were in position, behind the ball and not in immediate danger. They always managed to find the opening unfortunately, and that shouldn’t have happened because we should have been organised enough to prevent it. We were not at the level we should have been at in the first half, and it’s difficult to say why</p>

This is the way it is. This week after Bayern especially was a difficult three days, we had to make sure we got ready for Lincoln and this was the reaction you need. We booked our place at Wembley and we are looking forward to the semi-final, which is always great. But obviously we need to improve the form in the league - this is what’s going to be crucial now. We have an away game at West Brom then the international break so we need to make sure we go into Saturday’s game ready to get three points</p>

  <p><b>[Petr Cech insists the uncertainty surrounding Arsene Wenger’s future at Arsenal is not a huge problem]</b> I think at this moment it is clear Mr Wenger is our manager, and he will be until the end of the season, and then he has the cards in his hands. We will see what his decision will be, but I don’t think it makes the situation more different. You have the manager and you know you have to deliver the performances and you need to work towards the games to win the games, and everybody needs to do their best. Whether the manager stays or not, at this moment I don’t think it is a huge problem. I don’t see it personally as a problem, I just do my best every day and try to prepare for every game, and if somebody is different and has a different feeling, it can happen. Personally I don’t really follow that too much because I am concentrating on my work<br /><br />When you see the training sessions, after we beat Leicester and started preparing for Spurs, I thought we were in a good shape. We looked ready, and then obviously you don’t transfer the work, and this positivity if you don’t transfer it to the game, the performance can be like that. This is disappointing because you try to work hard, try to prepare to put out the best performance, and there have been far too many games this season, especially in 2017, where we didn’t transfer that from the training ground to the pitch.<br /><br />Everybody involved is so desperate to win the title, because it has been a long time, and this is probably where the frustration comes around. Year after year Arsenal have come very close, and in the end there is that missing piece. This is what adds together every year and the people can be disappointed. This is the first year in 20 years where there is a chance the club won’t qualify for the Champions League, which is a completely new situation for everybody. Nobody who was involved or attached to Arsenal wants to see it this way, so you can understand the disappointment</p>

  <p><b>[Petr Cech acknowledges that Arsenal are yet to embrace the win-at-all-costs mentality which has delivered Jose Mourinho so much success]</b> He hates draws. If we returned to the dressing room with a draw, we knew he would not be satisfied. On the other hand, he also wanted be able to keep a 1-0 or beat a team 5-0 if possible. No matter how, Mourinho wants the result. The philosophy at Arsenal is completely opposed to this: it is not win at all costs but we want to win in a certain way. This approach is beginning to change.<br /><br />It is true that we are close to classical music, the beauty and the synchronisation of instruments. It is a philosophy now anchored in the genes of the club: they refuse to play without and it is passed on from generation to generation. I believe that the right balance has been found last months of last season. The idea is to continue to control the match but securing more behind<br /><br />We finished <b>[last]</b> season fifth with 75 points. The previous season, we finished second with 71 points. We must see how the Premier League has evolved. When I arrived, there was Manchester United, not still really Chelsea, City did not count in the title race, Tottenham either. Today, the competition is crazy. Winning a match becomes more and more complicated each season</p>

We have been doing that. Especially at home we feel like we have won the fans back on our side and hopefully we can keep them happy as long as we can. Home is always home. Every fan has the right to show if they’re not happy but as players I think we’ve shown the way and they are supporting us everywhere we go. I think this is great to see.<br /><br />We play them both and they are games where we will have the opportunity to close the gap. Yesterday we were watching all the games and results. We knew every team ahead of us won their games so we needed to continue our run and keep winning to keep the gap the way it is. Unfortunately we have to be chasing, so we need to make sure we win our games and if the teams ahead drop points we can close the gap or get ahead of them</p>

It made me think of the Zidane goal in the Champions League final in Glasgow against Leverkusen. The ball went the other way but the technique was a moment of brilliance which literally won the game. He had a fantastic game.<br /><br />I think sometimes people forget that when you play for a top national team then you play every week, play every summer, have a short break and you carry on, carry on, carry on - I think the first few months of the season the fatigue caught up with him. You could see he was as not as sharp as he is now which I think he benefits from<br /><br />A few weeks ago, I hoped that, with so many games coming up before Christmas, that the Liverpool game would be the one where I could actually get the 200th, so it’s going to plan. Hopefully we can get a win and obviously the clean sheet, but the win will be more important</p>

I think it’s a matter of time <b>[before we see his best]</b>. But for a player who has just come to the Premier League, he’s had a pretty good run. He has immense quality in front of goal.

But when you make mistakes, you have to find the reason. We gave them the second goal which decided the game. We are in the two competitions, so we need to keep switching between them and do our best. We are in a position where we must win all our remaining games and hope it lifts us in the table. We are in a very difficult moment because everybody else has a big advantage. In the Europa League we have a semi-final to play so we need to make sure we are ready.

  <p><b>[Petr Cech warns Arsenal could become a hiring and firing club]</b> It will depend how well the club and manager will do. If you are at the club where there is continuity then everybody gets used to it, but it is really rare. You can see the example of Manchester United - Sir Alex Ferguson stopped and when <b>[Louis]</b> van Gaal came everyone thought it was going to be a long-term coach, and he was not as successful as everybody expected and they made a change after two years. Consistency in football is one of the hardest jobs, especially when you are a manager or coach. The new manager will find the club in a very healthy position and obviously he will need to succeed as well. That will determine how long the new manager or coach stays.<br /><br />When you see our home form this season we are up there. The difference between us and the others were away games. We had a terrible run of results away from home and this is what cost us the season. It has been a disappointing season as we ended without a trophy. It has been disappointing because we are out of the top four. The away form has been our issue, if you look at our home form we are right there at the top of the table. But away from home we unfortunately dropped too many points to be in the top four. It is something we need to change for next season</p>

This club has not won the league for over 10 years so, obviously, you need to get back into knowing how to do it. We started with the new manager from scratch, basically, and we try to get this mentality of winning every game, progressing every game, working every day and, hopefully, we can build this up and win the title sooner rather than later. That will make the big difference. In the past I would say the Arsenal way was more important than getting the points sometimes and this is not how you win the league. Sometimes you need to make sure you win an ugly game, when you are not playing well but you just dig deep, close the back door and win 1-0 no matter how. I think this is what we lacked. Yesterday, we went through difficult moments but got the win with the clean sheet, so this is very positive</p>

  <p><b>[Petr Cech talks about life in the <a href="arsene-wenger.html">post-Arsene Wenger</a> era and working under head coach <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a>]</b> He is very demanding and this is how you improve. I think the place has become much more demanding in every way so this is great to see because this is what initially drives everybody forward and gives you the kind of kick that ‘I’m not doing enough to start the game’, or ‘I’m not doing enough to keep my spot in the game’, because the manager asked for precision and hard work every day. This is how it should be. We have very healthy competition and we are actually taking the benefit of it</p>

  <p><b>[Cech concedes Arsenal could have played for hours against BATE and not scored]</b> It was one of those games where if we played for another couple of hours probably we wouldn’t have scored. But there are games in football like that. You try, you play, the goal does not arrive and you have to go home with the result you don’t want but you have to pick yourself up and be ready for the second leg. This is the advantage of playing two-legged ties - when one game goes wrong you can always make up for it</p>

  <p><b>[Petr Cech feels <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are too nice, with there ‘not enough pressure’ at the club following 22 years working under the guidance of ‘gentleman’ <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>]</b> It will sound strange but I think generally at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> there is not enough pressure. Arsene is a real gentleman. As much as he hates losing, he stays a gentleman. If you lose, you win, you lose, you win, he kind of carries on. That’s something I’ve never experienced before. At <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, at the times when we drew, it felt like a funeral in the dressing room. It was so bad. If we drew against a big team at home, it was like, ‘Oh no, it is impossible we didn’t win at home’. It came from everywhere: the players, the coach. Since the start when I was there, the pressure was there every game.<br /><br />I feel that when <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> need to win, we win. You go to Athens in the last Champions League group game <b>[of 2015]</b> needing to win 2-0 and you win 3-0. No matter where, we win, because that fire was right behind us as we had to really win. The pressure was what was pushing us. I completely disagree with people who say, ‘When the pressure comes, <b>[you don’t win]</b>’. No. I think we lose points when there is not enough pressure. So, we went to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> <b>[on April 7]</b>. You know you win, you go third… you lose, you stay fourth. We lost. That week with <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> <b>[losing at <a href="wolves-fc.html">Molineux</a>, either side of defeats to <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> and <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>]</b>, it was the same situation. There was always a cushion, there was always, ‘It is not such a disaster’. We should probably create more pressure on everybody because that would give people more to think about. We went to <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> <b>[in the quarter-finals]</b> and everybody says, ‘Oh, you are rubbish away, they are brilliant at home’. We win 2-0, and then you go, ‘How do you explain that?’. If you are under pressure and you can’t perform, you lose that game. But we didn’t because the pressure was so high. You know you lose, you are out. You lose 3-1 at Rennes <b>[in the last 16, first leg]</b>, you have to win at home: you win. The semi-final? We win. So, the examples are there</p>

You can have as much talent as you want, you can have so many opportunities from people around you, but if you don’t work hard and you are not prepared to take them, your career can take a completely wrong direction or never kick off. I will say everything goes down to work and love for the game.<br /><br />You also need to keep challenging yourself and that you can learn at any age. People sometimes say, ‘He is too old to learn’. No, it is not true. If you keep challenging yourself and you keep trying to get better, this is how you actually improve yourself and get better. I can tell you that at 37 years of age, at the end of my career I’m still learning and still improving every day because I actually work every day to get better. I think this is the only way to have a successful career and actually make the most of it. As best as you can be, this is actually the best advantage and the best way to have a great career.<br /><br />If you are down to earth, you work hard for yourself and the team, then you are the guy who gives people confidence and people generally like you. It brings probably brings the most out of you and out of your team-mates. In the moment you need their help, people will actually help you. I think sometimes we underestimate that. In the moments when your career is going great and everybody is telling you how great you are, you need to keep your feet on the ground, actually keep working the same way and keeping working the same basics because this is the only way to be successful. As I said, the aim is to have people around you who will believe in you and trust you</p>

  <p><b>[Cech played for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> with two broken shoulders prior to fracturing his skull]</b> There was one thing I never talked about, and people didn’t know at the time.

It didn’t! During the second season I already had a massive problem with my shoulder and I was protecting it.

I was trying to get the pain low for the games and find ways to train properly so I didn’t feel the unbelievable pain every day, which was difficult to avoid. I thought about having surgery during the second season, but I didn’t want to risk missing the World Cup in Germany that summer. Nobody really knew how long it would take me to come back. To my relief I decided to have the surgery after the World Cup. I came back fast from that and I was enjoying games and not having pain while training and moving. A few games later, we played Reading!<br /><br />When you come back from a career-threatening or life-threatening injury, you don’t think about pressure. I just enjoyed every moment. I suddenly realised every game could be my last one. So whenever I played from then on, I enjoyed it because I had another game to play. I was so happy the journey hadn’t ended in Reading. It was a positive feeling and played a part in my recovery. Every game felt like medicine for me. Leading to the end of the season and <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup final, it felt like there was no other outcome than us winning it. I was so positive. It was a great joy and satisfaction.
