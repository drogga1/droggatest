  <p><b>[Chelsea’s Petr Cech says <a href="carlo-cudicini.html">Carlo Cudicini</a> Is ‘Doing Well’]</b> It is very sad but sometimes life brings unfortunate situations. I went and saw Carlo yesterday in the hospital. He has always been a great character and you can see he is coping well with it. He is doing well and he will undergo some operations today to help him to be as fit as possible. I think that everybody should keep fingers crossed for him to get well soon</p>

  <p><b>[Petr Cech says Fraser Forster robbed of victory after watching the Southampton goalkeeper deliver a man-of-the-match performance at the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Emirates Stadium</a> on Tuesday]</b> Fraser Forster robbed a point from us because it was only thanks to him they got a draw here. They did really well in the first half but in the second half we did much better and created a lot of chances - probably the most we have this season at home. We just couldn’t find the back of the net because he was outstanding and made important saves<br /><br /><b>[The Southampton stalemate left <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> on 45 points after 24 games, five adrift of league leaders <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> in fourth place, having failed to win any of their last four league outings, with no goals scored since the 3-3 draw with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> on January 13]</b> We had a position where we could only look at ourselves but now we are behind so we need some of the results to go our way. But there is a long way to go and there is always a twist in the tail so you keep working hard every day and try to keep getting results. If we believe then I think we can still do it - there are more than enough games to put ourselves back at the top of the league so we will work for that</p>

  <p><b>[Petr Cech talks about life in the <a href="arsene-wenger.html">post-Arsene Wenger</a> era and working under head coach Unai Emery]</b> He is very demanding and this is how you improve. I think the place has become much more demanding in every way so this is great to see because this is what initially drives everybody forward and gives you the kind of kick that ‘I’m not doing enough to start the game’, or ‘I’m not doing enough to keep my spot in the game’, because the manager asked for precision and hard work every day. This is how it should be. We have very healthy competition and we are actually taking the benefit of it</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea’s newly appointed technical and performance advisor Petr Cech has confirmed that Frank Lampard is in the running to return to the club as head coach, but he is not the only candidate for the job]</b> The club has identified several candidates, the situation is open. Frank is one of them. Before the first team begins preparations we want to solve the issue of the new manager. The most important thing is to choose a new manager, it will be crucial in the context of further work. The coach will have ideas for the team, we will be completing the team for next season. He will have to look at the players and decide who will go to Japan.<br /><br /><b>[The 37-year-old has already dived into the next chapter of his career with great enthusiasm and he is well aware of the responsibility he has been handed]</b> It’s something new to me, but I don’t feel nervous. That’s the thing that surprised me. When I decide I want something to work in some way, I have to go to the club management first to allow it. I’m new to the role. But I have enough possibilities to influence the club, which is a great responsibility and I like it. My job description is to look at the first team, the academy, the transfer policy, the data from training. The range is broad, occupying all the disciplines that belong to football. My job is to report and especially bring ideas</p>

They help them become better and keep them grounded. And the biggest part is the coaching staff and the manager because he sets the tone on the training ground. He takes the biggest credit<br /><br />Some people find it surprising but we have always had huge fines at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. The commitment to work is really important. To respect the rules is something where you need no talent. You can have zero talent, but you can be on time. It is about commitment. This is not to scare people.

  <p><b>[Cech played for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> with two broken shoulders prior to fracturing his skull]</b> There was one thing I never talked about, and people didn’t know at the time. Halfway through my first season at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> I broke the labrum in my shoulder. I carried on and finished the season. It felt like during the summer it would recover. It didn’t! During the second season I already had a massive problem with my shoulder and I was protecting it. Then, in the first part of my second season, I did exactly the same thing to my other shoulder. So I played my second season with broken shoulders! I was trying to get the pain low for the games and find ways to train properly so I didn’t feel the unbelievable pain every day, which was difficult to avoid. I thought about having surgery during the second season, but I didn’t want to risk missing the World Cup in Germany that summer. Nobody really knew how long it would take me to come back. To my relief I decided to have the surgery after the World Cup. I came back fast from that and I was enjoying games and not having pain while training and moving. A few games later, we played Reading!<br /><br />When you come back from a career-threatening or life-threatening injury, you don’t think about pressure. I just enjoyed every moment. I suddenly realised every game could be my last one. So whenever I played from then on, I enjoyed it because I had another game to play. I was so happy the journey hadn’t ended in Reading. It was a positive feeling and played a part in my recovery. Every game felt like medicine for me. Leading to the end of the season and the FA Cup final, it felt like there was no other outcome than us winning it. I was so positive. It was a great joy and satisfaction. It was the first FA Cup we won together as a group, and it felt like the right end to the season</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea legend Petr Cech admits he was not happy at all when the decision was taken to drop him behind <a href="thibaut-courtois.html">Thibaut Courtois</a> in the pecking order at Stamford Bridge]</b> I was not happy at all. I could see in pre-season how hard I was working. There was nothing obvious suggesting I wouldn’t be ready to keep my spot. But in a football team you can only have one goalkeeper playing every week, and unfortunately that was the way it went. Thibaut was regarded as the future of the club with all his potential and quality. I understood the choice was made, even if I didn’t think it was my time. Leaving <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> was the hardest decision I had to make. Having played for this club for such a long time, and becoming a big part of the history of the club, I always thought I was going to finish my career at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, or maybe leave for the last couple of years. At that moment I didn’t feel like it was like the last couple of years. That was not what I pictured in my head. But it was clear my journey had come to an end, and I decided I was going to go and try something else<br /><br />When I look back, I’m happy for the good things, I’m obviously not happy with the things that didn’t go exactly as we wanted, but they played an important part, so I wouldn’t change a thing.

When I came in 2004, probably the top 12 teams were very strong, with strong squads, and then it would really depend on the years for the other eight teams. For them it was harder to bring in international players. It started changing around 2007, 2008 when <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s dominance started. You would suddenly see international players coming to every team, even promoted teams. The league became a big attraction. Teams started getting stronger and stronger, and the competition became harder and harder every year. That has continued to this day. It’s what makes <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> the best</p>
