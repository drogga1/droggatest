  <p>[Meet Arsenal fan &amp; NxGn ace Alban Lafont. As his father put it after he debuted] Five years ago, he was still playing as a striker and scoring goals. A month ago, he was just a youth player. Now he’s a pro. Leave him alone.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Toulouse have spent much of the last two seasons frantically battling against relegation from France’s top flight] You learn faster and it’s harder. But I come out of it stronger.<br /><br />Since I was little, I’ve really like Arsenal. Since the days of Robin van Persie, in fact. I really liked his style and thought he was elevating the whole team’s level. I wasn’t a goalkeeper at the time, but even if you’re a keeper, you can love attackers. And it is through him that Arsenal made an impression on me</p>
