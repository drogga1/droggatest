  <p><b>[Oribe Peralta, whose recall to the national team may have boosted him in a season that’s been full of peaks and valleys thus far]</b> Today you’re an inspiration for me and for many people Diego <b>[Lainez]</b>. Keep on the same path without straying from this passion and happiness you have for playing football at the moment.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico concerned about qualification, not CONCACAF giant status]</b> Personally, it doesn’t matter to me if we’re the giant or not, what’s important here is to qualify for the World Cup and do it the best way possible, getting the most number of points possible, so the first thing should be to take advantage of our home games and after that go and look for three points on the road. The objective is clear, and we can achieve it.</p>

  <p><b>[Clasico Nacional lacks luster with leader America facing subpar Chivas]</b> America right now is much higher than Chivas. They have the hope of winning the Clasico to save their tournaent. We’ve kept a good pace in the whole of the tournament and we hope to keep doing things like that until the end and to be able to win the title. That’s what we’re aspiring to, not winning the Clasico.</p>

  <p><b>[Oribe Peralta is planning to announce his retirement from international play after the World Cup]</b> It’s going to be my last World Cup. After Russia, I’m retiring from the national team<br /><br />We have enough talent to take the step, to be champions of the world, to go there and get what we want. It’s in our hands to do it<br /><br /><b>[On Juan Carlos Osorio]</b> For me, he’s a very prepared coach, someone who knows what he wants and knows how to express that to his players. He knows how to give this confidence so they’ll do what he says. People only don’t like his style of work because it’s different</p>
