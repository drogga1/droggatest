  <p><b>[Arsenal midfielder Mohamed Elneny speaks after Egypt’s 2-0 win over Ghana in World Cup qualifying]</b> It’s not vital to put in a good performance, winning is more important. Ghana are a strong team and have great players. We let their players control the possession, but they still failed to pose any threat on our goal throughout the 90 minutes. I trust in the abilities of the current generation to achieve Egypt’s dream of reaching the World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Elneny says he was taken aback by <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a>’s humble and respectful nature when he joined Arsenal]</b> When Mesut joined from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> I thought he would be arrogant and full of himself after playing at such a big club. However, he is so humble and respectful. He never saw himself above the club. There are footballers playing at far smaller clubs who have got a far bigger ego. Mesut surprised me and my team-mates at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, everyone has respect for him<br /><br />With Mesut, we are like brothers. Before I moved to Turkey he was who I spoke to, he assisted me, I could ask him anything and asked about Besiktas, he advised me on my transfer</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Elneny claims <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> could come to Fenerbahce at some stage]</b> Mesut really loves Fenerbahce. He’s always speaking about the club and the fans. If you ask me, I think he could come to Fenerbahce. He’s always trying to annoy me by singing Fenerbahce chants<br /><br />If he were to leave then Fenerbahce would be an option. At the end of the day it is a huge club and I think <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> would say yes to an offer if it came down to it<br /><br />After this season I have one more year, so after that I will know because I can’t see the future. The thing I can do is give everything for the team, for myself, to be successful and let’s see what happens</p>

  <p><b>[Elneny keeps <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> exit door open with Besiktas future admission]</b> Of course I am happy because I feel like I am part of the Besiktas family. Always, always, know I am glad to be here and I don’t know about the future. Of course I don’t know about the future, but if Besiktas want me they can pay my current team and I can stay. Of course I am happy to be here and I always fight to help my team-mates, to help with the club, to improve and to be like I wish. Every time I wish we win every game. That’s what we expect because we are a big club and we have big players and we have a good team<br /><br />Football always changes and I don’t know about the future. I don’t know if the club (Besiktas) want me or not, you have to ask the club as well if they want me or not and if they want me to continue with them. I have said all the time I am happy here. I am glad to be here. I always loved playing at big clubs. Before I played at Basel in Switzerland, the big club there, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is one of the biggest clubs in the world and Besiktas is a big club around the world - everyone knows this. It is up to the club because if the club want me, I want to stay. I can stay, no problem</p>
