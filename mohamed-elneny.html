  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> midfielder Mohamed Elneny speaks after Egypt’s 2-0 win over Ghana in World Cup qualifying]</b> It’s not vital to put in a good performance, winning is more important. Ghana are a strong team and have great players. We let their players control the possession, but they still failed to pose any threat on our goal throughout the 90 minutes. I trust in the abilities of the current generation to achieve Egypt’s dream of reaching the World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Elneny has spent just 12 months in English football but says it has always been his intention to become an Arsenal legend]</b> I want to be a legend at this club. Like Thierry Henry. I mean, obviously not exactly like him. I have my own personality, my own character. I want to be different to anyone that’s gone before. But since I got here, I’ve always had that in mind. I wanted to become an Arsenal legend<br /><br />It’s been a great year for me. Playing in England, at one of the best five clubs in the world. Since I arrived, I’ve enjoyed the whole experience. Not just playing for the club, but the country itself. The friends I’m making, the supporters. The whole atmosphere around the football. It’s been one of the best years of my life. In Basel I gained experience. But when I came to England, and Arsenal, I adapted so quickly because I felt straight away it was like a family, a whole big family. You are someone new, but they embrace you. They bring you in. Everyone loves each other. When you feel like people love you, and they want you around, that makes you adapt quickly, you enjoy being there</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Elneny has revealed that several clubs were interested in signing him before he committed to a contract extension with Arsenal]</b> There were some clubs interested in me because I was not playing enough games and maybe they thought they could sign me or even have me on loan. I heard about this in the news just like everyone else and I was not interested at all. I spoke with the people here at the club and I told them, ‘I don’t want to leave. I want to fight for my position’. I trust myself, I have a dream to pursue and I am not going to give up on it. I dream big and this is one of the biggest clubs in the world and I want to stay. The club welcomed my decision to stay and that was the end of it. People were saying, ‘You aren’t playing enough games, maybe you should leave or go on loan somewhere’ but I wanted to prove myself. I played the first game of the season in the Community Shield and I proved I can play for Arsenal and will continue to fight for my position.</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Elneny says he was taken aback by <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a>’s humble and respectful nature when he joined <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> When Mesut joined from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> I thought he would be arrogant and full of himself after playing at such a big club. However, he is so humble and respectful. He never saw himself above the club. There are footballers playing at far smaller clubs who have got a far bigger ego. Mesut surprised me and my team-mates at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, everyone has respect for him<br /><br />With Mesut, we are like brothers. Before I moved to Turkey he was who I spoke to, he assisted me, I could ask him anything and asked about <a href="besiktas.html">Besiktas</a>, he advised me on my transfer</p>

If you ask me, I think he could come to Fenerbahce. He’s always trying to annoy me by singing Fenerbahce chants<br /><br />If he were to leave then Fenerbahce would be an option. At the end of the day it is a huge club and I think <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> would say yes to an offer if it came down to it<br /><br />After this season I have one more year, so after that I will know because I can’t see the future.

That’s what we expect because we are a big club and we have big players and we have a good team<br /><br />Football always changes and I don’t know about the future. I don’t know if the club (Besiktas) want me or not, you have to ask the club as well if they want me or not and if they want me to continue with them. I have said all the time I am happy here. I am glad to be here. I always loved playing at big clubs. Before I played at Basel in Switzerland, the big club there, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is one of the biggest clubs in the world and <a href="besiktas.html">Besiktas</a> is a big club around the world - everyone knows this. It is up to the club because if the club want me, I want to stay. I can stay, no problem</p>
