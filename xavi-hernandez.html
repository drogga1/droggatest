  <p><b>[Former Barcelona captain Xavi believes England can pull off a surprise and win their first European Championship in 2016]</b> I think England have a real chance. Before we <b>[Spain]</b> won our first title I believe it was the pressure that meant we never progressed past the quarter-finals. Because of our quality there was so much pressure on us - and it got to us. England - when they had their golden generation of <b>[Frank]</b> Lampard, <b>[Paul]</b> Scholes, <b>[David]</b> Beckham, <b>[Steven]</b> Gerrard - had that same pressure and it is difficult to cope with. Mentally it can be a big block. Now England have this new generation of <b>[Harry]</b> Kane, <b>[Raheem]</b> Sterling, Dele Alli and the English guys that have doing incredible things for Leicester <b>[City]</b>. They have some very good players, but I don’t think there will be the same expectation on them to win the tournament. That could work for them, because it allows them just to go and play football. If they can get their leader and great player Wayne Rooney back then they have a big chance.<br /><br />There is no reason why Spain can’t make it three European Championships in a row. We have a team that can beat anybody. <b>[Cesc]</b> Fabregas, <b>[Gerard]</b> Pique, <b>[Andres]</b> Iniesta, <b>[Sergio]</b> Ramos all know what it takes to win the tournament, but also we have a new generation of players who can bring new life.<br /><br />Of course it will be difficult, but there is a lot of reasons to be confident. Germany will be another of the big favourites. They are the current world champions and have some exceptional players. In these tournaments you can underestimate the importance of playing at home, so because of that and also the quality of some of their players you also have to consider France as well</p>

At his peak he would have got into any team in the world - he was an exceptional talent and a model professional. There are some players who don’t get the full appreciation at the time they are playing - but Frank will be remembered as one of the best midfield players in the history of the game. Not only was he a complete midfield player - he had the goalscoring record of a striker - maybe we won’t see that goalscoring ability from a midfield player again. Only he knows what he is going to do next - but if he went into coaching he has so much knowledge to give.</p>

Technically he is the sort of player that Pep loves - his only problem has been injuries - and if it wasn’t for the issues he has had with injuries I am sure he would be one of the best midfield players in the world.

  <p><b>[Xavi has highlighted the threat posed to Barcelona by Juventus forward Paulo Dybala]</b> I would say that the most talented member of the Juventus team is Dybala. Higuain too can scores goals at any time, but I think Dybala stands out as the most talented Juve player.<br /><br />If I could take any Juve player for Barca, I’d obviously take Dani Alves back. He decided to leave but for me he is the best right-back currently playing in the world and Barca miss him a lot<br /><br />Dybala, for example, would be a great option for Barca in the future but it is difficult, Barca have practically the best players in the world right now and it is hard to improve on that. Juventus have a great team, though. It is going to be a very tough tie for both teams, I’d say Barca are favourites but Juventus could make it very hard for them,<br /><br />Buffon I’d take too, of course, but Buffon is practically at the end of his career. Clearly with Buffon we are talking about one of the best goalkeeper in the sport’s history, along with <b>[Iker]</b> Casillas and a few others. He has been an historic goalkeeper but he is now 38 or 39, logic says he is at the end of his career. But the career Buffon has had is admirable, as is the fact he is still playing at the highest level<br /><br />A result? I think Barca will score in Turin. I think Neymar, Messi and Suarez can do a lot of damage. I think Barca will score, maybe in a score draw, 1-1 or 2-2 in the first leg and then Barca will win at Camp Nou 2-0 or 3-1. Barca will go through. I hope a comeback is not needed because they already made me sweat too much after the 4-0 in Paris. It was incredible. If I had bet on a Barca comeback it would have looked hard to me, there was almost no chance. It had never before happened in Champions League history, coming back from 4-0 down in the first leg. Never. Only Barcelona can do these things</p>

From the first time he came up to the first time you can see it, he was different. He is a player who can dribble with ease, who sees the game in front of him, who can take on players easily. He also has great personality and guts, and a great shot. Leo has mastered all aspects of the game and mastered them to perfection, we are talking about the best footballer in history. But I think Messi already started out as an extraordinary player, although he has improved and right now he is of course the best we can see in the entire world - I would go as far as to say he is the best in history<br /><br /><b>[Marco Verratti]</b> would be ideal for Barcelona. <b>[Ivan]</b> Rakitic is clearly doing a brilliant job, I think he has adapted well to Barcelona’s football.

  <p><b>[Barcelona legend Xavi Hernandez has given an insight into how his mind works on a football pitch]</b> That’s brutal, right? Coming from Maradona, an idol. But I am not a football genius. I am just a student of Johan Cruyff’s school, and Cruyff summarised football in a sentence: ‘Football should be played with the mind’. I have had to use my brain to play football. I am not Kylian Mbappe. How does he play? He runs, pushes the ball, passes a player. I don’t have Mbappe’s legs, but I use my brain. I compensate like that. I came to Barca when I was 11 and, from the first day, I was forced to understand everything I did. We cannot play football if we don’t understand everything that happens on the pitch. It goes deeper than just the contact between the foot and the ball. Each reflection, each question, opens new perspectives. Why are we asked to create space for each other? Or to open up the game? It’s logic. Imagine that I have the ball and I want to give it to a team-mate but an opponent is in the middle of the two of us and wants to take the ball. If there is enough space between my team-mate and l, the opponent can’t do anything. I think like: ‘If he comes to me, I pass the ball to my team-mate’. And bam, the ball has already gone in the other direction. If we are in a confined space, we can easily lose the ball. That’s the mantra of Cruyff. sWhen we don’t have the ball, what should we do? Defend high up the pitch and quickly. Why? To fucking stifle the opponent by closing the spaces. The less space we give our opponents, the less chance they have to reach our goal. What’s football? It’s space-time<br /><br />It’s incredible <b>[the criticism]</b>! Who is boring? Barca or the team playing against them? Sometimes I hear: ‘Barca is not dangerous enough’. But how can you be when you have 11 players in front of the goal? It’s impossible. The team that plays on the back foot is not the team that tries to play football, but refuses to. Isn’t it boring when you watch teams wasting time or sending the ball into the stands to break the rhythm of play? In front of ultra-defensive teams, I ask myself: ‘How can I find spaces? There are not any!’ But there are always spaces. You have to move the ball from one side to the other, move and move again, and there you go, there is the space. I spent my life searching for it, finding ways to find it. Where is there space? How do I make it happen? I was turning my head in all directions, I was nicknamed ‘The Exorcist’s daughter’. I do not tum my head 360 degrees like her, but there are games where I have rotated mine more than 500 times!</p>

Physically, nobody comes close. Who runs faster than him? No one. But with all due respect to him, he will never make any difference on a football pitch.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed further on why Bolt would be wrong for football]</b> Because we cannot supplant mental speed and game intelligence with physical abilities. It’s impossible<br /><br />, personally, always had the will, I would even say the curiosity, to understand what is happening on the pitch. Why? How? Where? These are questions I would constantly ask myself and will continue to do when I become a coach. We do not all have the same thoughts.

  <p><b>[Xavi backs <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> to return to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> while eyeing managerial role]</b> Why not? Soccer-wise I have no doubts and I have lived with him in a locker room and he seems to me a great person.

Now that I have tried as a coach, I see myself as capable and it is an illusion, a dream to return to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. I have already said it on many occasions, I consider <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> my home, it is my life. I am in an apprenticeship. I am learning a lot as a coach here in Qatar.

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> legend Xavi says <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> football-obsessed and makes success inevitable]</b> With <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> as manager, I had no doubt <b>[City would dominate]</b>. Admittedly, the first year was tough for him because you always have to adapt to the different style and standards, even a different culture or background. However, there was no question that <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> was going to be successful. I have said this many times before, and in many interviews: all he needed was time<br /><br />My concept is very similar. <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> also wants to be dominant, he wants to have the ball, strong possession, lots of attacking movements. It’s ultimately about being proactive within the game. It’s about skilfully attacking the opponent in a certain way. In this sense it is not my idea. I’ve learned a lot with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>, from the way he is, the ambition he has, the desire and passion that he feels. He’s a football-obsessed tactician and it has been a pleasure to be around him. We talk often. We’ve got a good relationship. We met up in the summer and grabbed a bite to eat, which was really nice. To be honest, I consider him the best coach in the world right now. So any knowledge he can impart to me will be more than welcome. It’s a privilege to have him around contributing ideas</p>

  <p><b>[The importance of finding space is highlighted here by for former legendary <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> midfielder Xavi Hernandez]</b> Football is a sport in which you have to watch what is going on around you to find the best possible solution. If you do not relate to others, you do not know anything and you cannot do anything.<br /><br />There is the space-time thing to apprehend in this game <b>[…]</b> it is the possibility of controlling what you do and what others do, because you play with your head and not only with your feet. ‘But how can I find spaces if there are not any?’ There are always some. You have to move the ball from one side to the other, move, move again, and there you go, there is space.<br /><br />I spent my life searching for it, finding ways. Ask where is there space? How to make it happen?</p>
