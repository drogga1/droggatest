  <p><b>[Xavi signs one-year Al-Sadd contract extension amid speculation of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> return]</b> I am happy that the squad is complete today after the return of the remaining first team players, in preparation for this upcoming period and the resumption of the league championship. I am happy to continue with Al-Sadd, and the team’s goal will always be to compete for all titles.</p>
