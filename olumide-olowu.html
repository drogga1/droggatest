<blockquote>
  <p>[Kelechi Iheanacho has been urged to leave Manchester City by his advisor after being treated unfairly by Pep Guardiola. Olumide Olowu said] Iheancho needs to leave Manchester City and he will find a better place to continue his young career. Guardiola seems to have his own players that he wants to play and you can’t expect a young player with huge potential to be wasting away on the bench. Kelechi had already shown his quality before Manchester City signed Gabriel Jesus, he had already proven himself. I’m not speaking for Iheanacho, but as someone who is involved in advising him, I don’t think he has been treated fairly by Guardiola and I think his career will be better elsewhere. For whatever reason, he has not been given the opportunity to continue his progress at City.</p>
