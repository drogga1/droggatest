  <p><b>[Axel Witsel speaks about his expectations for Russia 2018]</b> I think for our team, for our generation it will be the most important World Cup. I think the team is ready, we are more experienced because we played in Brazil and in the European Cup in France. So I think we are ready but we have to play like we always do and game by game try to do better than in the last World Cup in Brazil</p>

  <p><b>[Axel Witsel is set for his first crack at one of Europe’s top five leagues after agreeing a move from Tianjin Quanjian to Borussia Dortmund]</b> After the World Cup, it was my goal to move from China back to Europe. I’m totally happy and also proud to be allowed to play for BVB soon. After our first conversation, I did not have to think twice, because for me Borussia Dortmund is one of the best clubs on the continent. Honestly, I can not wait to run around in front of 81,000 people</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Pulisic and Jadon Sancho have the potential to be among the world’s best wingers]</b> We have a lot of new players and the way we are playing right now, usually it takes more time. I cannot explain why we are doing really well and this is good for us, and we will of course do our best to keep going like this. The coach, the message he gives to us, everybody listens to him, and this is important. The way we play now on the pitch is because of the players but also the message the coach gives everyday in training. <b>[Pulisic and Sancho are]</b> young but really talented. If they keep going like this, they can be – I will not say the best winger – but they can become one of, because they’re really talented, but they need to keep working hard, and I hope we will keep them for a few years<br /><br />Even when we play really good, on the video when we do a meeting, he always speaks about the things we didn’t do good. You receive the ball from the right side, for example. He wants you to control with your left <b>[foot]</b>, and pass with your right so you don’t lose time. If you control with your right, you need to maybe take another touch and then play. It’s small details but in the end it’s really important<br /><br /><b>[Der Klassiker could prove extremely important in BVB’s attempt to break their rivals]</b> Why not? In football everything is possible, so why not? Against Bayern if you want to win then you have to be on your top level, and if everybody is ready – 100 percent physically, technically and playing the football we are doing now – we can beat them</p>

  <p><b>[Witsel believes Dortmund’s attacking excellence is purely down to how Favre has his players performing]</b> It’s not an accident because if it’s an accident it happens only one time in one game. But you know with our style of play, we have really talented players. Everybody, technically, is really good. Sometimes we take a lot of risks - from the goalkeeper also - but that’s our style of play. Like I’ve said before, we will not change it against anyone.</p>

  <p><b>[Borussia Dortmund midfielder Axel Witsel believes England starlet Jadon Sancho can become one of the best wingers in world]</b> It’s good because he’s getting a chance here in Germany. English players used to stay in England but what Jadon is doing now is amazing. He has a lot of quality, I think he can be one of the top wingers in the world if he keeps working hard and listens to us a little bit!<br /><br />It’s my first season here and the atmosphere they make in every game is crazy. It’s just amazing</p>

  <p><b>[Borussia Dortmund midfielder Axel Witsel admits Dortmund were scared in 5-0 Bayern rout]</b> I have no words for today’s match. Today we didn’t see the Borussia Dortmund I know. Normally we’re a team that dominates matches. That really wasn’t the case today, we were chasing after the ball all day. We have six games ahead of us, and we have to come back fighting, work hard and quickly put today’s defeat behind us. Everything is possible. Now we just have to stay focused and see what happens in the end</p>

I played against <a href="julian-brandt.html">Brandt</a> in Leverkusen, it was hard work. I’m delighted for Thorgan, too; he’s only going to get better, but they’re all good transfers. We need them, and perhaps there are more on the way<br /><br /><b>[<a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> appeared well placed to secure domestic dominance last season, only to suffer an untimely wobble]</b> We gave away too many points during the second half of the season, but we’re a young team. It was still a positive experience because we played a brilliant season. Nobody expected it from us. Now we have to learn from the experience<br /><br />We want to play an even better season next term. We’ve got young players, but experienced guys, too. You need that in a title race. We can win titles and cups, anything is possible!</p>

  <p><b>[Axel Witsel says even the <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> defenders were scared of technically strong and complete winger <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> as he fired <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> to DFL-Supercup victory]</b> Jadon is damned talented. Even <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>’s defenders are scared when he has the ball. But that’s normal because Jadon just has a lot of quality. He is fast, technically strong and he can score goals as well as put his team-mates in the spotlight. He is really a complete player<br /><br /><b>[Witsel says things are coming together in training and is confident the extra competition in the squad will help them]</b> We work very hard on defending in training because last season we just conceded too many goals. Especially with set piece situations we had problems. I think we’ve already improved because we work on it every day. The coach is doing a very good job. We have done well against <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>. We will do everything to make sure that the title ends up with us in the end. It is a relatively large group, but also with a lot of quality. That’s why everyone has to go full throttle in training. It’s true that we could set up two good teams and I think we missed that last season. The competition is good for us all. Everyone has to be careful not to let up, but we can stay fresher that way. Sometimes, I don’t want to say in easy games, but if you lead maybe 3-0, it is possible to change things earlier and give some players a rest</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> midfielder Axel Witsel has opened up on the numerous transfers in his career that nearly went through, including moves to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>]</b> I could have joined <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> when <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> was there. But then Real signed <a href="luka-modric.html">Luka Modric</a>, so a transfer to Madrid made no sense to me. Shortly before the end of the transfer period <a href="zenit-st-petersburg.html">Zenit</a> called. I had good discussions with the people responsible and finally agreed. I am an open person and was not afraid of Russia<br /><br />My contract with <a href="zenit-st-petersburg.html">Zenit</a> expired and I wanted to move to <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a> to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. I had already passed the medical check and actually only had to sign the contract. I waited all day in the office and <a href="zenit-st-petersburg.html">Zenit</a> told me to come back. In retrospect, that was perhaps a twist of fate. Maybe it was just not the right time<br /><br /><b>[The right time eventually did arrive last summer as he joined <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>]</b> First (Dortmund sporting director) <a href="michael-zorc.html">Michael Zorc</a> approached me, then (manager) <a href="lucien-favre.html">Lucien Favre</a> called me. I also had other offers, maybe I could have gone to Paris or Manchester, but I did not want to wait. And I had the feeling that I was the first choice for <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. It is important to feel good when you go to a new club. So after the talks with <a href="michael-zorc.html">Zorc</a>, <a href="lucien-favre.html">Favre</a> and (CEO) <a href="hans-joachim-watzke.html">Hans-Joachim Watzke</a>, I decided to join <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a>. <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> is a top club - and I really wanted to join a top European club. Maybe it was my last chance at 29 years old. It was the right decision</p>

They were more aggressive, had more motivation. We didn’t want to end the season like that. It wasn’t enough without a ball. We all have to defend together. If only a few players run and defend, it’s difficult to win a game. We may be the better team on paper, but it is different on the field<br /><br /><b>[Looking back on the season as a whole]</b> We had ups and downs in the first half of the season.
