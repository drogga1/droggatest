  <p><b>[Keylor Navas on the breakdown of his swap deal with <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a>]</b> I was waiting in the airport - I didn’t even have suitcases. At 19:00 CET my agent said, ‘You have to catch a flight <b>[to Manchester]</b>’. The contract offer arrived really late. My agent reviewed it and it was fine. I didn’t want to go. I did the medicals in Valdebebas after that, but I didn’t return to the airport - there was no time. The transfer window had shut. As soon as I got home, near my wife, I burst into tears.</p>

This team is of a very high calibre, with players who achieve incredible things individually but the most important thing is that the squad is united 100 per cent. I am very happy, everyone here welcomed me really nicely, my family feels good and I have great team-mates. I am really enjoying myself. However, that is never sufficient. I always want to win, again and again. I did not come to <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> to have a good time, but to work with humility, desire and above all to win titles because that’s what we love</p>

  <p><b>[The Costa Rican appeared on the cover of ‘Onze Mondial’ magazine, where he spoke about his beginnings in football, recalling an anecdote from his early years in the sport]</b> It’s a story that goes back many years. I think I was signed in exchange for some footballs. Beyond the signing itself, I think that the leaders of the club were asking for help because of a lack of resources because we played in a small football school<br /><br />In Europe, there are a lot of very strong teams, but winning the Champions League is not easy. <b>[…]</b> You have to win every game and that’s the demand we have here. We have a team with a lot of quality. We are an excellent group. The unity we have within the group is formidable and everyone has clear ideas when it comes to tackling competitions</p>

We know our responsibility<br /><br /><b>[Navas admitted the break from football will likely see the team be rusty when it returns, but he himself had been working harder than ever to return stronger and avoid injury]</b> We are going to take a little time to pick up the pace because we are all physically good. We, the goalkeepers, have a specific job. But if the physical condition is good, it will help me become a cat on my goal line as soon as possible. I run a lot. More than in my whole life. It’s important to maintain our physical condition. So I run every day. Some days a little more than others. Trying to manage it well so that there are no injuries</p>
