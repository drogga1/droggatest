  <p><b>[Keylor Navas on the breakdown of his swap deal with <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a>]</b> I was waiting in the airport - I didn’t even have suitcases. At 19:00 CET my agent said, ‘You have to catch a flight <b>[to Manchester]</b>’. The contract offer arrived really late. My agent reviewed it and it was fine. I didn’t want to go. I did the medicals in Valdebebas after that, but I didn’t return to the airport - there was no time. The transfer window had shut. As soon as I got home, near my wife, I burst into tears.</p>

I know there are many things out of my control, but I will fight hard for the things that I can control. I want to be here for many years. I am relaxed about it all. I would love to retire here at Madrid. To be here is a blessing, a privilege and a responsibility.</p>

I can turn the situation around and make the fans trust in me. People are free to give their opinions, I respect that. I am going to work to change those whistles into applause. I know when I make a mistake, I do not hide. I was called into action four times and made one mistake. When the bullets are firing you must show your chest<br /><br />I am just focused on working hard and performing as best I can. You never know what might happen in the future, but for the moment I am defending this shirt right to the end, as I always do</p>

I hope he doesn’t go and that he’s with us for many years.<br /><br /><b>[The likes of David de Gea and Thibaut Courtois continue to register on the transfer radar]</b> It would be difficult, but nothing is impossible. My wish is to keep enjoying all of this and I hope I could retire at Real Madrid. That would be a dream for me</p>

I don’t want to be interpreted wrong, but the country is going through a difficult situation. There are families where things are going poorly, Costa Rica is totally flooded. We hope God stops the rain and everyone will be good and when we have to play the game that we can qualify for the World Cup.</p>
