  <p><b>[Troy Deeney would offer a different dimension for England were he to be called upon by <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a>, says <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> team-mate Ben Foster]</b> Yes, he offers a different dimension. Like when <a href="peter-crouch.html">Peter Crouch</a> was in the team, he brought a different dimension at the time. That’s what Troy’s got. If you get the ball up to him with quality, he will hold it and, as long as you can can get around him, you can get yourself so high up the pitch. He is such a strong boy and his work rate is second to none. Troy can only do his talking on the pitch. That’s what he has done at every game since I have been here this season<br /><br />He is a winner, that’s why he is our captain. He is such a good leader. He is a great guy to have in the team. He’s always geeing us up, no matter where you are, in meetings before the game, in the changing room, going out on the pitch, that’s you want from your captain and I think we are lucky and blessed to have him. He does it on the pitch in his actions as well, and when people see that as well they cannot help but follow suit.</p>

  <p><b>[Ole Gunnar <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> will bring back a feeling of togetherness at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, according to former United goalkeeper Ben Foster]</b> He just brings a togetherness. Management nowadays has evolved, where players almost know what they’re doing. They just need somebody who can really instil confidence and stick an arm around players and tell them that they’re doing a good job. I think that’s what they’d been lacking in the last couple of years. It just seems a better place now, a happier environment, and that’s what Ole brings. When I was playing for him when I was in the reserves here, he was just brilliant. Everybody loves playing for him: you go out on the pitch with a smile on your face and a spring in your step. I am delighted for Ole. I’m really happy for him. He was great when he was my reserve manager at United once I’d been left out of the first team. I’ll always have a really good word to say about him, as will probably everyone who has ever met the guy. He’s a top bloke and I am sure the lads will enjoy playing for him as well.</p>

  <p><b>[Goalkeeper Ben Foster went further, admitting that the scale of defeat, 8-0 against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, was humbling for <a href="watford-fc.html">the Hornets</a>]</b> It’s probably a bit of shock, embarrassment. I think we let ourselves down today and the fans a bit. The fans were giving it everything, all they’ve got. Unfortunately, we on the pitch didn’t give it all we have got. As a keeper coming to City and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, if you let five in in 20 minutes you fear the worst, you think cricket scores. They are without doubt the best team I have ever played against. We were poor, didn’t lay a glove on them, but at times it was breathtaking watching them. You come away to City and I’m not joking, you come here and think if you keep it to two or three - they are so good. Them and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are a different level. We didn’t do our job today. We have to take some positives but that’s football. You have to clean yourselves up, move onto the next one. We have a few experienced lads but you have to keep smiling. I have just let eight in. I’m not happy but it is what it is. There is no point in dwelling, get ready for the next game and get ready</p>

  <p><b>[Despite trailing 5-0 to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> at half-time on Saturday, <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> goalkeeper Ben Foster admits he was over the moon <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>’s side hadn’t brought up double digits in the first 45 minutes at the Etihad]</b> It was absolutely no fun. As a goalie, coming here in the first place, it’s almost an achievement to keep it at one or two goals. Like all the best laid plans, after 50 seconds, it went straight out of the window, and it was carnage. To go 5-0 down after less than 20 minutes, I was thinking ‘God, this could be double digits’. I was over the moon to get in at 5-0 at half-time. From a goalie’s point of view, it was just relentless. You could see them opening us up and the chances developing in front of your eyes. It could have been a cricket score. They’re without doubt the best team I’ve ever faced<br /><br />They will do it to somebody - there will be a nine or 10 out there soon. What makes them so devastating? Their aggression, they are always on it, always on the front foot. Nobody gets a second to think about it. Our players are getting the ball passed to them, and before they know what to do with it, they’ve got a <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> player attacking them. They all do it together. Their shape is incredible. They’re all absolute specimens of men. If you look at them, they’re all the same sort of build, not the tallest, but they are all so strong and rapid. Their acceleration and touch is incredible</p>

  <p><b>[Ben Foster joked he would have retired had he scored and salvaged a dramatic point for <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> in their 2-1 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> loss to Chelsea]</b> If I score at the end, that’s me retiring. Fair play to Kepa - that was some save. They were a very good team. Fair play to them: they’re young, energetic. Our manager told us before the game that they are like kids in the playground. If they’re in the playground and the gates are open, then they will run free. You need to shut the fences, you need to shut the doors. I don’t think we did that at times today, which was a bit disappointing.<br /><br /><b>[Chelsea meanwhile have risen to third and have now won their past five league games with <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> particularly pleased with <a href="mateo-kovacic.html">Mateo Kovacic</a>’s performance on Saturday]</b> <a href="mateo-kovacic.html">Kovacic</a>, his ability to play - him and Jorgi together - and then that ability to drive from midfield, that’s not the norm. As a midfield player it’s your worst nightmare having a player who can play and then drive by you out of nowhere. He was doing that today to great effect. Really pleased with him</p>

But, I am out of contract in the summer. There’s been nothing yet <b>[a new contract offer from <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>]</b> but it’s not something I’m really thinking about too much. It’s the first time in my whole career that I’ve actually been out of contract at the end of the season, and I don’t really know what to make of it. I’m enjoying it, not because I’m trying to leave <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>, that’s not even an option and I can categorically say I’ve had no contact from anybody else, but I think it opens your options and gives you a bit of freedom. I’m very laid back in generally about stuff, and if I was to start getting annoyed or frustrated about not being offered a new contract it just wouldn’t help, it wouldn’t help me. So it is what it is. I’m not trying to leave <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>, I’m very much enjoying my football, honestly - I didn’t’ come in for this!</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> goalkeeper Ben Foster says he has been making soup and watching Star Wars to pass the time in isolation after a coronavirus scare]</b> I’ve just been making soups for the family. Nice, healthy, veggie soups. I was actually fairly ill last week, to the point the club were quite concerned it might be coronavirus so they sent a nurse down to do a test on me, but thankfully it was negative. I just had a cold. Once I got the results though to say it wasn’t coronavirus, I was like: ‘Right I need to start doing something’, because I was pulling my hair out. It’s very boring. I’m probably doing the same as most people. I’m watching a lot of Netflix, watching TV, reading random and weird stuff, anything to pass the time. I’m one for the classics. I’ve re-watched The Office this week for the 100th time, Entourage, I watched Castaway last night with the wife, I’ve watched a few Star Wars things - there’s plenty to keep up with! You’ve got to watch what you eat as well. When you’re bored and not feeling so great it’s so easy to just start picking at food and not really watching your diet, but you’ve got to be careful<br /><br />We’re off until Friday now, so in the meantime it’s a case of doing as much gym work and strengthening as you can and I’m out on the bike as much as I can. You’ve just got to get your head down and get on with it.</p>

  <p><b>[Ben Foster believes <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs must commit to a blanket policy on pay cuts during the coronavirus pandemic]</b> Pretty much every footballer I’ve spoken to… I think it is something we understand, we completely agree that something needs to be done. But from a player’s point of view, and I’m sure the <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> will be talking about it today. As long as it is done in a structured manner. It is important to cover every team with the same <b>[policy]</b>, whether it’s a deferral or a cut, so that we are all under the same blanket. Now, more than ever, it is so important that we do this together. When you start getting teams doing their own individual wage cuts or deferrals, that’s when it starts to get a bit messy. I know from talking to everyone at <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> that we are understanding that this needs to happen. Something like this is unprecedented. No one knows where it’s going or how hard it’s going to be. If we can do something in the meantime, you’ve got to do it.</p>
