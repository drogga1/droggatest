  <p><b>[Former Brazil forward <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>’s agent Giovanni Branchini revealed to the Scottish Daily Mail how close the striker came to signing with Rangers]</b> The clause in his contract was a novelty at the time and it scared a lot of clubs off. The three who were really interested were Inter, Lazio and Glasgow Rangers, who followed negotiations all the way. The offer from Glasgow Rangers was incredible. They told us he didn’t have to play on a Saturday in the Scottish League. They were desperate to win the Champions League and were going to allow him to play in European matches only. But Inter had followed him from when he used to play in Brazil. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> reneged on a new contract and Inter were the first club to meet the release clause so he went there.</p>

  <p><b>[Giovanni Branchini says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> held strong interest in <a href="douglas-costa.html">Douglas Costa</a> over the summer]</b> I sincerely say that <b>[Massimiliano]</b> <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> and <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> have never thought of letting him go. The interest of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> was strong, a club that has always been interested in the Brazilian. It was not the only club but in England it was certainly the most active team on the trail of Douglas Costa<br /><br /><b>[The injury concerns of his recent past appear to be behind him]</b> Douglas has had countless health problems. Last season he was very often injured. He is wanting to recover with great professionalism after standing still. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> never intended to sell him despite the big pressure from United<br /><br /><b>[Costa still has much to prove if he is to keep his place, but looks to be thriving under the guidance of former <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> boss <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>]</b> Douglas is a ‘cool’ professional in the best sense of the word. He is able to adapt to everything. Just think of how well he did in Ukraine, in a country totally different from Brazil. He loves <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> but is able to adapt to every reality. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is a beautiful championship but for now United have failed in all their attempts to convince <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> to sell him. The player remained in Turin and is a champion</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Massimiliano Allegri</a> continues to ignore the speculation surrounding his future]</b> To date, nobody is thinking about their coach of next year. Everyone thinks of this season, we were therefore focused on this season. Max has enjoyed a peaceful year, he needed it. He is recharged and lives the reality that we are all living, we will see how things will go. Making assumptions today would be making fun of people</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> have the option of permanent deal and Branchini expects <a href="ivan-perisic.html">Perisic</a> to remain in Germany]</b> Everything was going to plan and then there was the injury that stopped him. We were summing everything up, then there was the breakdown of the season. I don’t know what will happen, he is a professional athlete. <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> are totally still in the frame, he is thinking of staying in German football</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="gabriel-jesus.html">Gabriel Jesus</a> to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>?]</b> We are talking about a great footballer and a great club, everything is possible. The difficulties of acquiring power will lead to not many transfers, it is better to keep who you already have in the squad, there will not be a lot of movement on the transfer market. But some clubs with great economic power could lead to some sensational transfers that previously appeared unthinkable<br /><br /><b>[there have also been reports of City boss <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> being a long-standing target for Juventus]</b> I am convinced that he will stay at City as long as City want him, as long as the team wants to maintain a certain type of profile. The only hypothesis I see is that if the owners should reduce their commitment or ambitions - which I don’t think will happen - he will accept the farewell, but he will never want to leave</p>
