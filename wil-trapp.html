  <p><b>[The Columbus Crew have signed defensive midfielder Wil Trapp to a multi-year contract extension]</b> I’m excited to stay here in Columbus and build this club and its brand on and off the field. It’s a wonderful opportunity with a great group of players to continue to push this club, style of soccer and my career forward. Playing in Columbus means a great deal to me and my family and I am humbled to remain a Crew SC player.</p>

  <p><b>[Columbus Crew look sharp in 3-4-2-1 formation]</b> We knew that they wanted to cross balls into the box. Our center backs played really well, and it gave us a lot of flexibility in terms of defensive shape as well as moving into transition<br /><br />I thought Harrison and Jukka did a really, really good job of timing it well and closing space quickly</p>

  <p><b>[Three takeaways from the USA draw with Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina]</b> I think we did a really nice job of coming together as a group. It’s a lot of inexperienced players. The ability to come in off the offseason and put in the work, and then find a result against Bosnia. We had some chances, they had some chances, but it’s the beginning of preseason in a lot of ways so you have to expect some growing pains in that. But I think the group did a really nice job of sticking together.<br /><br />It’s an exciting future for us. When you look at a guy like Tyler Adams, who went 90 minutes tonight. There’s a handful of other guys, here and not here, that people should be excited about because the quality is real and they have good heads on their shoulders and they want to learn and they want to get better. That’s all you can ask for at age 18, but they’re pushing the level and it’s exciting to see</p>

  <p><b>[Crew try to maintain consistency to clear championship hurdle]</b> When it comes to speaking about the players we lost, of course Justin and Ola were both key contributors and wonderful teammates. But it’s something that you lose one part of Ola’s movement and gain another part in Gyasi’s athleticism. Or you lose one part of Justin’s unpredictability and you gain something in Pedro Santos’s passing ability. So for us I think we look at it as just an adaptation and evolving into a team that may do things differently but it shouldn’t make us less successful.<br /><br /><b>[On communication and feeling of unity]</b> How is the team gelling together? What is the chemistry like? That’s my role and I think a year on from last year I’ve just been more comfortable and confident in that role<br /><br />From the first day I meet a new player to every day you see them in the locker room, it’s about being consistent with my actions. How you talk to guys, being a presence that can be approachable, being a presence that can also hold guys accountable - those things are for me very important. And also leading by example. I have to epitomize and uphold the team I want us to be<br /><br />I think the best way to do so is just focusing on your craft. Go to training every day, try to get better. Try to become a better teammate to those around you and try to raise your level<br /><br />Every year you want to win. We were close a year ago. But if this is the last year in Columbus, of course we want to leave it with the best way possible and that would be with the MLS Cup in Mapfre Stadium</p>

  <p><b>[On Gyasi Zardes]</b> Gyasi is guy that is craving a new environment. It’s a situation where I think we can tap back into the form that he had two seasons ago where he was scoring goals on the regular and was a handful for defenders. I think our system fits him extremely well and you’re already seeing that in preseason where he has four goals in three games. So he brings quality. He brings athleticism and just a hunger that we’re definitely going to tap into and enjoy this year.</p>

  <p><b>[Youthful USMNT squad’s final exam will be a brutal one as full-strength France awaits]</b> We know that we’re not preparing for a tournament, but at the same time these are invaluable experiences for a group of players that is just starting to come together. It’s their last game before the World Cup so we know that the energy, the excitement from them, the quality, should be high and we’re prepared for it, we’re excited for it. It’ll be difficult, but these are the games you want to play in.</p>

  <p><b>[Brazil teaches USMNT youngsters a lesson in mismatch]</b> We have to learn, especially in this game, keep the ball. But keep the ball with a purpose. I think we just had some poor giveaways that, when you’re defending and defending and defending, and you finally win it and you give it away, it just compounds the effort.<br /><br />It’s good for this group to go through that. It’s a baptism by fire in a lot of ways. Playing good opponents early in this cycle and understanding that, yes there’s excitement around this group, but we have to get better</p>

  <p><b>[On Dave Sarachan]</b> As an interim <b>[coach]</b>, it’s always a tricky position. In many respects, he could have mailed it in and he never did that. From the first game in Portugal last year to tonight, he’s always put out a lineup that he’s confident in and he’s always given the group a plan. I can’t say enough good things about how he’s approached this situation and the way he’s brought this group along.</p>

  <p><b>[Berhalter confident he can strike the right balance for USMNT]</b> You look at what do we like to do with our wingers. One winger, in Columbus for example, can get the ball wide and run 1v1, or come inside. Who’s probably the best American player to do that, probably other than Landon Donovan? Christian Pulisic. So think about plugging these guys in. Ball-playing center backs, like John Brooks and Matt Miazga, that’s exactly what we want. These types of players. DeAndre Yedlin getting up and wide as an outside back. Those are profiles that fit what he has done in Columbus extremely well<br /><br />You’ve seen guys play and are smart and are high-level players that play for the national team, and they want clear directives. Give us a plan that we can step out on the field and we feel prepared to play. That was the biggest thing I was easily able to communicate to guys. Every time we step on the field <b>[under Berhalter]</b>, you feel prepared for what the opponent’s going to bring and what’s expected of you</p>

  <p><b>[On Michael Bradley]</b> He’s still one of the best players in the country in my opinion. His ability to lead, to make passes, to dictate tempo, to affect everyone else on the field is immense, so I think for all of us stepping into a camp with Michael is always great because he brings such a wealth of knowledge and experience. You can just talk to him about the game and you can learn. Not only can he teach young guys, but then when he gets on the field he performs. As you get to know him, he’s such a driven individual he wants to win, he’s competitive and that translates very well into this group.</p>

  <p><b>[Anthony Precourt intended to relocate the Crew to Austin]</b> The toll that it was taking, not so much on me on the field, but on the off-the-field perspective with family, friends. The idea of growing up with this club and it disappearing from Columbus was difficult.<br /><br />Once we heard some concrete news that the club was going to stay and the Haslam and Edwards families were going to purchase the team, truly it was elation for me, if I can put it bluntly<br /><br /><b>[The #SaveTheCrew movement that sealed the deal]</b> We know the reaction will be wonderful. But for us really it’s about just getting everyone on the same page, prepared, fit and ready to execute in front of our fans<br /><br />I think the more you build into your fans, the more they keep coming back</p>

  <p><b>[Crew hoping transition from Berhalter to leads to championship result]</b> Tweaks. I think it’s being more the aggressor in a lot of ways. You won’t be able to dictate the game every single game, but it’s stepping onto the field knowing we want to dominate in every aspect of the game. With Caleb in Columbus I think it is a wonderful opportunity to work with a guy that I know very well and see how he can take what we built here in Columbus to another level. It’s really exciting to see, in my opinion, the incremental steps we’ve already made in preseason</p>

  <p><b>[On Tyler Adams]</b> From a defensive perspective, look, he can cover the most ground on the field. He’s unbelievable in terms of his engine and ability to win balls and break up plays. But you still saw he’s more of a midfielder when we have the ball, so he can come inside and still be flexible to get wide. But when he’s in the middle he can combine well. He can break lines well and also run off the number 10s in between the lines.</p>

  <p><b>[Wil Trapp ready for Miami challenge after leaving ‘safety net’ of hometown Crew]</b> You just have to connect back to what you love about the game. Ultimately, yes, it’s a different place, a different style, a different city, all those things, but ultimately, you want to play soccer, right? You want to perform and do your best. You want to win and you want to help other people reach their dreams as well. For me, that was something in Columbus that, because it was home, because it was comfortable, you lose sight of that at times. The shake-up, the freshness, something new, almost organically allows that to happen<br /><br />Of course it was an amazing time in Columbus. It wasn’t an easy decision by any means but I think it was the best one for my career and moving forward<br /><br /><b>[Porter, who coached Trapp at the University of Akron, called the decision mutual, but it was emotional as well]</b> What hit me most was leaving. We were in Cancun with Columbus, but leaving preseason with them and having to say bye to some people I’ve known for my entire professional career, some of my closest friends, having a few moments to say a few words to them as I was leaving, was emotional. But, at the same time, I’ve been very happy since I set foot here in preseason with Miami. It’s been 100 miles per hour, but it’s been so enjoyable from the first moment. I’ve had a blast<br /><br />A big part of this decision as well was stepping out of a comfort zone. It’s something where there is no safety net, and I have to grow, not only as a player but as a person. I’ve been in Columbus and Ohio pretty much my entire life. That what I mean when I say I’m excited about stepping out and doing something different for my career and for my family. You grow most when there’s tension and there’s pressure. It’s an opportunity to build towards some of those moments in the future<br /><br />We have to understand that it won’t be perfect. There will be ups and downs and the process of building an expansion team is never a perfect thing that happens right away. Understanding that every day, it’s about us as a group taking on the ideas of the coach and developing them to be successful. The bones of it, the foundation that’s been laid, is painting a good picture for what’s ahead<br /><br />You adapt to whatever comes. It’s quite a crazy little unfurling of events. They came back and wanted to make the trade, I was very excited for the opportunity to be a part of something building, something new, something that’s a process but is going to be done in all the right ways</p>

  <p><b>[How Inter Miami is staying fit and finding togetherness in coronavirus quarantine]</b> Our coaching staff has really rallied to bring information for us to continue to learn and adapt our game. We’re an expansion team with new players, a new coach and a new model of play. The growth as a group is so important each and every day, and when you’re not together, you need to find ways to bridge that gap. It’s stimulating to have that homework, that soccer homework, and that’s a great way for us to stay engaged and be together in a way that, even though we’re apart, we can still grow and learn and fine-tune our ideas<br /><br />It’s an exercise in being creative and utilizing the ability to order things online and building your own home gym, so to speak. It’s been something I’ve wanted to do for a long time, but this has prompted it as a necessity to maintain fitness, strength and all of those things</p>

  <p><b>[Family life and fatherhood are helping <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> stars cope with coronavirus quarantine]</b> It’s been amazing. Honestly, it’s interesting because preseason is such a difficult time when you have a family because you’re away from them for six, seven weeks. And I know for us being traded in the midst of preseason was another wrinkle. And with my son now being five months old, that’s a whole other beast. Now, it is a little bit of Groundhog Day every day, but it’s been amazing to see and be with them and spend the family time that we usually don’t get to have. And for us settling and getting used to life here in Florida, albeit a different type of life than we expected at the moment<br /><br />It’s been a blessing, so to speak, that we’ve had the family time. But that doesn’t change the fact that we want to be back on the field doing what we love to do every single day</p>
