  <p><b>[Wil Trapp ready for Miami challenge after leaving ‘safety net’ of hometown Crew]</b> You just have to connect back to what you love about the game. Ultimately, yes, it’s a different place, a different style, a different city, all those things, but ultimately, you want to play soccer, right? You want to perform and do your best. You want to win and you want to help other people reach their dreams as well. For me, that was something in Columbus that, because it was home, because it was comfortable, you lose sight of that at times. The shake-up, the freshness, something new, almost organically allows that to happen<br /><br />Of course it was an amazing time in Columbus. It wasn’t an easy decision by any means but I think it was the best one for my career and moving forward<br /><br /><b>[Porter, who coached Trapp at the University of Akron, called the decision mutual, but it was emotional as well]</b> What hit me most was leaving. We were in Cancun with Columbus, but leaving preseason with them and having to say bye to some people I’ve known for my entire professional career, some of my closest friends, having a few moments to say a few words to them as I was leaving, was emotional. But, at the same time, I’ve been very happy since I set foot here in preseason with Miami. It’s been 100 miles per hour, but it’s been so enjoyable from the first moment. I’ve had a blast<br /><br />A big part of this decision as well was stepping out of a comfort zone. It’s something where there is no safety net, and I have to grow, not only as a player but as a person. I’ve been in Columbus and Ohio pretty much my entire life. That what I mean when I say I’m excited about stepping out and doing something different for my career and for my family. You grow most when there’s tension and there’s pressure. It’s an opportunity to build towards some of those moments in the future<br /><br />We have to understand that it won’t be perfect. There will be ups and downs and the process of building an expansion team is never a perfect thing that happens right away. Understanding that every day, it’s about us as a group taking on the ideas of the coach and developing them to be successful. The bones of it, the foundation that’s been laid, is painting a good picture for what’s ahead<br /><br />You adapt to whatever comes. It’s quite a crazy little unfurling of events. They came back and wanted to make the trade, I was very excited for the opportunity to be a part of something building, something new, something that’s a process but is going to be done in all the right ways</p>

  <p><b>[How Inter Miami is staying fit and finding togetherness in coronavirus quarantine]</b> Our coaching staff has really rallied to bring information for us to continue to learn and adapt our game. We’re an expansion team with new players, a new coach and a new model of play. The growth as a group is so important each and every day, and when you’re not together, you need to find ways to bridge that gap. It’s stimulating to have that homework, that soccer homework, and that’s a great way for us to stay engaged and be together in a way that, even though we’re apart, we can still grow and learn and fine-tune our ideas<br /><br />It’s an exercise in being creative and utilizing the ability to order things online and building your own home gym, so to speak. It’s been something I’ve wanted to do for a long time, but this has prompted it as a necessity to maintain fitness, strength and all of those things</p>

  <p><b>[Family life and fatherhood are helping <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> stars cope with coronavirus quarantine]</b> It’s been amazing. Honestly, it’s interesting because preseason is such a difficult time when you have a family because you’re away from them for six, seven weeks. And I know for us being traded in the midst of preseason was another wrinkle. And with my son now being five months old, that’s a whole other beast. Now, it is a little bit of Groundhog Day every day, but it’s been amazing to see and be with them and spend the family time that we usually don’t get to have. And for us settling and getting used to life here in Florida, albeit a different type of life than we expected at the moment<br /><br />It’s been a blessing, so to speak, that we’ve had the family time. But that doesn’t change the fact that we want to be back on the field doing what we love to do every single day</p>
