  <p><b>[<a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> legend Hugo Sanchez endears himself to a nation by arguing that it would be a mistake to get too excited by Mexico routing the All Whites 9-3 on aggregate in their World Cup intercontinental playoff]</b> We beat a team that is no more than a group of buddies who were rejected because they couldn’t play rugby in New Zealand, and they had no choice but to switch to soccer</p>

  <p><b>[Hugo Sanchez on <a href="carlos-vela.html">Carlos Vela</a>]</b> Carlos <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is to Mexico what <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> is to Argentina and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> is to Portugal, and we simply can’t afford not to have our best player in the team. Imagine if <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> didn’t want to play for Argentina - he would have coaches and administrators begging him to play. The same goes for <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> if he wasn’t playing for Portugal. The Mexican chiefs haven’t pulled out all the stops. When you’re attempting to convince a person, you bring four aces up your sleeve. You come up with lots of different ways to convince him to return. <a href="carlos-vela.html">Carlos Vela</a> is a necessity for the national selection</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico legend Hugo Sanchez could be returning to direct involvement in the game, saying Tuesday night that he’s spoken with Carlos Lopez Chargoy about buying Liga MX club Puebla]</b> I directly told <b>[Chargoy]</b>, who I already had the chance to meet with in Puebla when there was the chance that I would manage there before <b>[Manuel]</b> Lapuente, I met with Carlos Hugo Lopez Chargoy and we talked. Now, I don’t rule out <b>[buying the club]</b> because I have a lot of friends and a lot of people who would like it if I invested in Puebla, in the soccer team and even more in Puebla that is getting more beautiful and better than ever.<br /><br />So I’m not ruling out the possibility of buying Puebla and collaborating and contributing in the way that I focused on my career as a soccer player. First I was a player, later a coach, later manager of the national team and I also have prepared as a director, that’s why I was a director for 14 years with FIFA. I don’t rule out returning as a director and in this case as the owner of a team that would be Puebla in the case we arrive to an agreement</p>

  <p><b>[Booing Ronaldo and Zidane - are Madrid’s Bernabeu fans the worst in the world?]</b> I suffered many difficult situations, lots of insults - but playing away from home. At the Bernabeu, you expect support and affection to lift you. It is something strange what is happening with Cristiano. Ronaldo, season after season, is the leader and goalscorer who gets the team out of difficult moments. We must keep respecting him, supporting him, and helping him.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> legend Hugo Sanchez urges old club to bring in <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> star]</b> I’m of the opinion that <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> should have two teams and two strong No.9s. I’ve noticed <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> for a long time. I’d sign him, even for €200m. <b>[<a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> also cost a lot and look what he gave the club. But knowing <a href="florentino-perez.html">Florentino Perez</a>, with his magic he surely has something in his head to do something, but I know the remodelling of the stadium will take money out of the budget<br /><br />Since <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> left, <b>[<a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a> has]</b> fulfilled that role, but he’s missing an <a href="emilio-butragueno.html">Emilio Butragueno</a>, which I had. <a href="luka-jovic.html">Luka Jovic</a>? He hasn’t had many chances. I don’t think he’s a bad player for the future, but <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> need the best strikers for today. I think Kane is that<br /><br />The most difficult thing to do in football is score. You spend €300m on six or seven players, but none guarantee goals. That’s why I’d spend €200m on a No. 9 like Kane. Nothing guarantees titles like goals<br /><br /><b>[When asked whether he thinks the Kane would be a better replacement for <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> than Paris Saint Germain ace <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a>, who has also been touted for a switch to <a href="real-madrid.html">Santiago Bernabeu</a>]</b> They’re two different players. Kane is a natural replacement for <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, but <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> and <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> are different top players</p>

  <p><b>[Mexican football legends Hugo Sanchez and <a href="javier-aguirre.html">Javier Aguirre</a> believe that <a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a> has overtaken Liga MX in reaching out to a global audience]</b> Without doubt I think that Mexican coaches are capable of managing in any part of the world. The advantage some of us have is that we first played in Europe and later coached in Europe, like in the cases of <a href="javier-aguirre.html">Javier Aguirre</a> and I. Sadly, in the Mexican league, we don’t have visionary leaders that <b>[internationalize Liga MX]</b>, like they did in England and Spain in promoting their tournaments. It would mean that games from Mexico could be seen in other powerful countries in the world. Instead, the United States are smart and do it better than us</p>

  <p><b>[Hugo Sanchez says <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> need to find another killer No.9 in the <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> mould]</b> Madrid needs a killer in the area, as I was, as is <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, who for many years performed that function at the Bernabeu perfectly. So you have to find another.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether he rates <a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a>]</b> How can I not like him? He is a striker with exceptional class, but he is not a killer, he is not a pure man of the area. He is a great second striker. He is as <a href="emilio-butragueno.html">Butragueno</a> was. Emilio and I understood each other perfectly. Karim could use a killer ahead of him. I used to like <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>, but with so many injuries he’s stalled. And <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a> has the problem of age. The search is not easy<br /><br /><b>[The Mexican said of <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a>]</b> He has talent and a nose for goals. Madrid can take him into account for the future. But this team needs someone to come ready-made, with proven experience and baggage behind them, as I came in after four years of scoring goals at Atleti. He is still very young. Madrid has to have the best in the world in every position</p>
