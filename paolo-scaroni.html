<blockquote>
  <p>[AC Milan have announced the appointment of Paolo Scaroni as chairman as the club heralded the dawn of a new era under new owners Elliott Management] I am humbled by the opportunity to lead AC Milan’s board of directors, and grateful for the trust and support of my fellow board members. This is a critical moment in the club’s storied history, and we’re all grateful to have a new owner committed to returning AC Milan to its former glory. At the board level, we will do everything possible to put the coach and the players in a position to succeed. There is considerable hard work ahead, and we are eager to build upon today’s momentum.</p>

  <p>[Paolo Maldini is back at AC Milan] There are no words to describe what Paolo Maldini represents for Milan. It was a privilege to see him play and win countless trophies on the field, I am happy and honoured to work with him in his new role. Paolo’s leadership and experience will be of great benefit to the club, as well as his passion and energy, and today’s appointment is a further sign of Elliott’s commitment to building a solid foundation for a long-term success. It will not be easy and it will take time, but we have ambitious goals and the arrival of Paolo is an important step towards the return to the great Milan.</p>

  <p>[Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be free to choose his new team] Ibrahimovic will be free to choose his new team. He’s a fantastic player. I love him as a fan for how he combines his height with agility, but I don’t make decisions with regards to transfers. Besides, my absolute favourite player is already in our team: Suso. Leonardo and [Paolo] Maldini have been our great success. They’ve given stability and competence to a club who, in recent years, had lost direction<br /><br />[A successful takeover by Elliott Management Corporation has helped to steady the ship] There are no negotiations with investors, there aren’t any in sight and neither are we looking for any. If a fantastic buyer comes up then who knows, but right now there isn’t scope for one. Gordon Singer carefully monitors investments, purchases and sales. [Silvio] Berlusconi calls me from time to time. He has his own ideas and is very decisive with them. [Adriano] Galliani is a real Rossoneri fan and a great expert of football. If he speaks then I listen to him</p>

We will make a new <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a> together, next to the old one in the same area of land. The old man will be knocked down and in its place there will be new buildings built.<br /><br />[Milan is a candidate city and Scaroni dreams of seeing the new <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a> host the opening ceremony] It’s an extremely complicated process. It would be beautiful to have the Olympics’ opening ceremony in the new <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a>, but we are not certain</p>
