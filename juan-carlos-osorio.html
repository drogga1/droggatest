  <p><b>[Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osorio will call upon five players he does not want to have at his disposal]</b> In Liga MX, we have four or five players with all the qualities to play in Europe, among them Jurgen, Hirving, Nestor and others. Hopefully we can help so that in the next two or three years more Mexican players emigrate and this will make it so we might have a much stronger national team.<br /><br />Currently, we have 14 players there. We want to use these games to promote and help others to be able to go to Europe. The Mexican player is as good and professional as any other on the planet. Up until now, the experience has been extraordinary. They’ve got great work ethic and get better with the repetition of exercises and concepts</p>

  <p><b>[Will Jonathan Gonzalez go to the 2018 World Cup with Mexico?]</b> I think he’s a player with very good technical abilities. I’d think that for our structure, he’d be a player who would play interior midfielder and obviously he’d have to fight for a place against all the players there are there because in the central midfield, above all in international football, we’re inclined to go with another type of player with a different profile. But I’d think that in a one-two structure he could be an important player as one of the two interior players.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico to face Iceland in first March friendly]</b> They play in a way that favors direct football. In their central midfield, they have one of the best holding midfielders and we’ll be playing against one of the teams that played a better type of football as far as not elaborating too much but playing direct. So I think it will be very important for us to see how we cope with that kind of football.<br /><br />I think Iceland is a country that’s an example, a country with fewer than 500,000 people and to get in the last rounds of the last Euro and now qualifying for the World Cup, it’s an example of something extraordinary that’s happening. It’s happening because they’re doing the work of preparing their coaches. I think they have more than 500 UEFA A-Level and B-Level licensed coaches. So they’re talented, very well structured. They’ve modified their training ground to be able to train even with the bad climate that hits them more often. I think they’ve known how to combine the factors that really can take a nation to the competitive level they belong to now</p>

  <p><b>[hicharito? Miguel Layun? Diego Reyes? Which Mexico star must move this winter?]</b> It’s a worry of mine because our players are at a good level and they need an opportunity. Any human being gets better through competition and through pressure. Competition is what makes you better and that’s what we’re suffering from. Our players have lacked the week-to-week competition with their clubs competing at the highest level.</p>

Giovani especially, I think you’ll see, like I said last week when I was in LA, that he’s been working and he may be in the best shape of his life.<br /><br />Really, as the manager said I’ve taken advantage of this time to work the best way possible. I’m good physically. I think it’s been the best offseason I’ve had in my career. I’m mentally and physically very strong. As I always say, it’s always an honor to be with the national team, and hopefully we do things well tomorrow.</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Carlos Osorio’s master plan for 2018 begins Wednesday]</b> In March, I hope that once again and under strictly footballing parameters, as has always been our procedure, we’re able to pick the best 23 players at this time because this implies that we’re going to have the same chance to work on three principles. We want to see how everyone on the field behaves.<br /><br />As far as I’m concerned, the Mexican national team nowadays has enough experienced players, Hugo <b>[Ayala]</b>, Giovani <b>[dos Santos]</b> and others, but there are also spaces for young players, Orbelin <b>[Pineda]</b>, Erick <b>[Gutierrez]</b>, Hirving <b>[Lozano]</b>, now Jonathan Gonzalez, Jesus Gallardo and some other payers that I would like to see how they will develop. So as far as I’m concerned, up to today, I’m very pleased to be here. I’m extremely happy, proud and I would like to continue. But we all know what happens in modern football<br /><br />We’re in the job not only for the performances but for the results. So hopefully we’ll have good results and then we’ll make a decision that will make everybody happy. The one thing that’s clear is I did not want to force the Mexican federation to be responsible for my next four years as far as my salary. I don’t work for the salary. I work for the glory, to achieve something with this team. As far as I’m concerned, if the results go hand-in-hand then it would be perfect to continue. On the other hand, if the results do not go our way, then I will be the first one and I will not need anybody to tell me that it’s time for me to go.</p>

  <p><b>[Osorio said after the match he didn’t give Dos Santos the hook because of poor performance]</b> About Giovani, I totally disagree with you. I think he keeps showing that he’s a player capable of being on the the ball, can go from the outside and to the interior and speaking with him these are two positions where he feels comfortable. Today we decided to play him as a winger on his natural side behind a single forward. I think he looked well when he played inverted. I think he’s definitely a player who, from what we’ve seen, is going to keep preparing himself in the best way and he’s going to be in top condition to fight for a place against anybody</p>

  <p><b>[Jonathan Gonzalez takes to advanced role]</b> I think Jonathan had 30 minutes, if we think about his youth and that he was dressed for the first time in the national team shirt I think the message was positive. It’s not easy to play in this space between lines and complete specific functions. It leaves us with the feeling that he understands the game, understands his responsibilities. He has an extraordinary present and a promising future.<br /><br />We have to work on our players continuing to compete, that Carlos Vela achieves - with Giovani as well - top condition physical condition, above all playing in this position where both can be very difficult to defend<br /><br /><b>[Fullbacks go the distance]</b> Well, speaking with Ricardo Ferretti I agree how he describes him, who knows him better than I do. I think we all know that at the start of this, Luis was an interior and he’s able to play that role in the game as well. One thing in particular, playing in a back four and playing outside, we look for good aerial play and good crossing from an outside back. I think today it was clearly shown that Luis and Jesus are getting forward and can do that well. So we’re very satisfied, not only with Luis but also with Jesus, with their showing in this position</p>

Croatia is one of the best teams in Europe to play offensive football and for this time they will have all the best players, including Modric, so it will be a fantastic opportunity for us to compete face-to-face in our way of playing against their way, which is very similar. I think the fans will enjoy it.<br /><br />We think that Croatia tries to control the game through their passing ability, like the Germans do,” he said. “A lot of the players control the ball very well and pass it as well.

  <p><b>[Osorio explains influence of Bulls, NBA great Phil Jackson]</b> When I had the chance to come here as an exchange student, I was at Clarke College in Iowa. When my studies ended, I had a friend invite me to go to Chicago and her dad invited me to training on two or three occasions and I was impacted by seeing, for example, all of the situations that can happen after a rebound with either numerical inferiority or numerical superiority. From there, the playing styles are generated.<br /><br />Obviously, I had the chance to read more deeply from Mr. Jackson and I’ve learned big things, not only about sports but also because life is about opportunities: How to maximize try and maximize players’ potential starting from the good things the players do. Yes, I have a deep admiration for him, his teams and obviously at this time it was the top team and they had the Messi of basketball, Michael Jordan. So, I think I learned a lot from this experience<br /><br />It’s one thing to be a manager and to coach your team on game days, but it’s another matter completely to train the way you behave on the field - how you play, if you play direct football or you play elaborated football. That’s training and it takes the day-to-day. I’m sure you know about Malcolm Gladwell and the 10,000 hours. I would say for any country in the world, you have to have those young players playing those 10,000 hours of high quality, training high-quality with high-quality players</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico manager Juan Carlos Osorio was delighted to see Hirving Lozano move to Europe from Liga MX]</b> It was a great move for Lozano to join PSV. I almost begged the <b>[Pachuca]</b> sporting director to allow him to move, and Andres <b>[Guardado]</b> also played a role in the transfer. He has started scoring more and experienced a different sort of pressure. But don’t underestimate the Mexican league. A lot of foreign players struggle. There are bound to be clubs that will make approaches for Lozano. It’s up to him to decide (whether he should stay another year). Davinson Sanchez left the Eredivisie after one year and that could be an option. He is developing well in the Eredivisie, though.<br /><br />Would PSV be a good club for Erick Gutierrez? He should go to a club that suits his style of play as a midfielder. He will learn new things abroad and pop up in front of goal even more often.<br /><br />It’s clear that we are in a tough group at the World Cup. South Korea are quite possibly the strongest Asian team, Sweden beat Italy and Netherlands, while Germany are the favorites to win it. We have 13 players who play in Europe, we have a good chance of reaching a high level if seven or eight of them are in good form come May</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Carlos Osorio knows who is going to the World Cup]</b> I have it. I have it. And that’s why I’m answering you the way I’m answering. There are three positions where I have three players and there are only two places. At the end, something will happen that will tell me, ‘This is it.’ The items are: Who can play where, who can play against who and who is in the best possible shape<br /><br />When I will be on the final list and I have to make the decision, this is what I will be thinking: Player A, there’s the situation against Germany, against South Korea and against Sweden. Where do I see this player playing against any of those three teams versus Player B and Player C? Who is in better form? Who has followed the program?<br /><br />When I make the selection we will run the players through different types of tests. In my opinion, that will be irrelevant because they will already be selected. So what I suggested to the federation is to run those exams or those tests in March and use them as an item of selection. There are different factors, different ideas. In <b>[an interview with a top manager who utilizes rotation]</b>, he says if you are like Jesus Gallardo from Pumas, he’s a winger with defensive discipline, you can play as a left back. And there are many cases like that. Many. Gary Bell. Messi, well, Messi is Messi. Rafael Marquez, our Rafael Marquez with Barcelona. He started as a central defender, he was moved to defensive midfielder. So when they criticize my decision I can honestly tell you A, that doesn’t bother me because I don’t follow that. This morning, I ran and I run basically every day, I watch Holland 74 and 78 every day, watching different things. So when I make one of those decisions I have already spoken to the players, put him in that position in a few practices and then I make the final decision<br /><br />From the corner to the line it’s 14 meters. That’s where our winger plays for the 1 v. 1. A proper midfielder like Iniesta plays this way with one shoulder there and one shoulder there. I put Jonathan in there and as soon as I saw him receiving the ball this way, I answered my own question. He can play there. He is intelligent enough to play in that role. There are key elements of my decision</p>

The fact of the matter is that they believe in a way of playing, and to be honest I admire that, that they keep competing and keep believing in the way they play. It’s a very simple way of doing things. Start from the goalkeeper into the striker, it’s a flick-on and we go for the rebounds. Eventually they will have a shot on goal and they did.

If he doesn’t play in his club, I think it’s our responsibility with a Mexican player with great talent, that we give him a chance in the Mexican national team. I think, I respect every opinion. But today, I think, Diego for example played the potions where he always has played as center midfield or center back. Right now he’s playing better as a center back, that’s for sure. But it also gives him the chance for Jesus Molina to be in a place where we think he’s one of the best and most complete. That’s also my responsibility, not only to take care of the present of Mexican soccer but also the future. Today, Omar Govea came in and to me he looks like just like against Poland he has moral courage to come in and play and play well. I hope, as always, the players in their clubs play and for their performance in their club might get to their optimal level. Those who aren’t playing in their clubs I think it’s the national team’s responsibility to give these players the chance to get their level back. We can’t for get, for example, Marco Fabian was in the Olympic team and has given a lot to Mexican soccer<br /><br /><b>[On Sweden will be different]</b> Well, in scenarios like today like when you play against a team that plays in this way, because that’s how Sweden will play and some teams have played and maybe some people think in the same way, we have to be more consistent in competing not for 10 50-50 balls or 20 or 30 because in one situation the whole path of the game can change. We’re going to keep respecting each opponent and preparing for them in the best way possible. Now, there are things to fix in the mid-term, corner kick, how we tried to get players out of their area.

  <p><b>[Mexico manager Osorio endorses Lozano for PSV exit]</b> I think today it’s very easy to say that Hirving has to be play the starting XI of the Mexican national soccer team. It wasn’t like that two years ago. I’ve always thought it’s my responsibility and I take it on as that to make choices and take on the criticism based on the results. I remember when we brought Hiriving to the national team, for a lot of people he was a simple player with a lot of speed. At that time Tecatito <b>[Jesus Corona]</b> was one of the only players who couldn’t be dropped. I always thought Tecate was one of the best players in the duels, with his change of direction, ability to turn, his low center of gravity and ability to turn. I always thought that Hirving, with other characteristics <b>[than Corona]</b>, could be exportable. Today, for me, It’s very gratifying and makes me very happy to see Hirving where he is. Now we have to contain Hirving, and among those things is his emotional control. It didn’t escape our notice that, on our third goal, Hirving acted in an inappropriate way that could cause us problems in the future. We’re all taking that on, but we think Hirving, as we thought two years ago, has the potential to go to a bigger club, and to a league with more history, respecting and appreciating PSV and the Dutch league for believing in our talent and our players. We we know how to manage Hirving and that he, as it seems, accepts constructive criticism and becomes a player who attacks well like <b>[the players]</b> there are in other teams <b>[and are]</b> valued highly<br /><br />We’re going to continue with the plan, but we’re thinking seriously about give a chance to three of our young players. They’re thinking of the future and we are as well. It’s worth thinking about Edson <b>[Alvarez]</b>, Jorge <b>[Hernandez]</b>, Omar <b>[Govea]</b>, about Jonathan <b>[Gonzalez]</b>, and we’ll see the XI we’re going to put on the field. It’s definitely going to give us the chance to win and compete against a team we still respect a lot despite their absences</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico’s big tune-up loses luster with Croatia absences]</b> We use two or three items when making decisions as to who to compete against. In this particular case, we think that Croatia, like Bosnia, Serbia, they all tend to play an elaborated type of football. That means long sequences of passes and control of the game, basically, are through possession of the football. We identify ourselves with that type of football and obviously with different types of players they try to play like Germany, like Argentina, Brazil. That means keeping possession. Amongst their best players, Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic. We certainly think they are one of the top teams. It’s no surprise to anyone they’re 15th in the FIFA rankings. I strongly believe the higher the competition there is, the best for the preparation. Croatia is going to be a very difficult team<br /><br /><b>[When asked if the game would still be a glimpse into how Germany will play]</b> No. We’re thinking obviously that without Modric, they don’t have not only a generator of play in the middle but also don’t have a conductor who finds lines to pass through with the ability he has to make decisions. It’s impossible to say so because they don’t a player as good or better. If Rakitic is there, we thinking about a different player. Without Mandzukic, they don’t have a forward who plays outside going inside like he does with Juventus<br /><br /><b>[On Marco Fabian and Carlos Salcedo]</b></p>

Because of the mechanism of action of Nestor and seeing the video replay, it suggests that it’s something he could recover from, but the doctor also suggested being prudent, wait for a deeper medical exam and be able then to define what the course to take is. Unfortunately, those two, for Nestor and for Carlos, it seems to be very serious the injury and obviously we’re deeply sad.<br /><br /><b>[On Carlos Salcedo]</b> It’s very unfortunate.

  <p><b>[El Tri took a 1-0 loss to Croatia on Tuesday night]</b> We’re going to get together and analyze everything this week, but it definitely changes and it changes based on the seriousness of the injures. I think unfortunately, we take this on, we analyze and have to be prepared for a scenario in which neither of them can be there. It’s rough for the team and also for the two men on a personal level.<br /><br />We respect Croatia deeply, we really think that they have midfielders who are very, very capable. Rakitic and Kovacic are top players. So, if we add that they have a central midfielder, we decided to play with a diamond figure so we have an extra player in the center channel, trying to control the game staring from there. I do think that in the first half nobody dominated the game but we were in control. They didn’t create too many chances but there’s one thing I’d criticize and that’s the fact that we didn’t create chances either. In general, I think it was a good opportunity for Jorge Herandnez, for Omar Govea and Rodolfo Pizarro but I do think it was a game that’s probably, at the moment, too much for them. That’s part of the developing of players and consolidating of players as well. We are OK with that<br /><br />Our big difference was we were playing two central midfielders, Jorge <b>[Hernandez]</b> and Jesus <b>[Molina]</b>. I think we controlled things and had chances but we weren’t efficient in the final third. I think it’s been a good exercise for them in their growth for Jorge, for Omar <b>[Govea]</b>, for Rodolfo. We’re sad about what happened but I think it was a game played against a very good opponent. In the end, the difference was a dead ball, a penalty. I do think we have to defend much better and we can’t give an opponent of this level a penalty like that<br /><br />It would’ve been really good to have everyone, but I think maybe those they were missing, Modric, Mandzukic and the other players would’ve given us the chance and them as well to put the best possible team out. Understanding and respecting and knowing they still had Kovacic and Rakitic and had players with a high level, our decision was to give a chance to three young players who are very important for the present and future of Mexican soccer, I’m talking about Omar, Rodolfo, and Jorge<br /><br />It’s very unfortunate. The guys in the locker room are really hurt, really sad because you often see it happening from afar and you think it happens to other national teams. When you have to live it in the flesh I think it’s devastating. It’s very sad</p>

Hector Herrera had a scan and we knew, according to what the doctor explained, that he wasn’t in condition to play.<br /><br />If we’d pressured him to play there could’ve been serious consequences for him, and personally I’d really regret that, and even more so in the name of Mexican soccer. I hope Porto, with the professionalism it’s known for, will make a responsible decision and keep the health of our very important player in mind</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico manager Juan Carlos Osorio feels good about the 28-man preliminary squad he named Monday]</b> I have to be honest with you. Uncomfortable? No. I’m optimistic, happy, proud, longing for the World Cup to start. What we’re working on, more than being worried about, is a true and negative reality which is the limited participation our players had in Europe<br /><br />The most important on this list is that I think, as we talked about two press conferences before this one, it’s a national team where you can make a list with the chance to play against three different styles of play that we’re going to face in our group and have great chances. We have the chance for a competitive team with aerial football, one that can play with transitions from defense to attack with the speed our players have because we have two or three capable of coming forward with speed, there are box-to-box players, maybe we have an elite player able to play in whatever top league like Hector Herrera. We think that beyond what we have, we can compete with anyone without using any pejorative adjustive, the Mexican player is resistant, brave, with good control, good technique, we have to get this out of games vs. other countries with a different class of athlete. Us, in Mexico, with what we have, being in good athletic condition we’re going to have great chances against any opponent<br /><br />We’re very hopeful. We think the national team, understanding the difficulties we’ve had, the obstacles, the injuries we have, I think it’s a very well put together team with the previous squads in mind. When you look at the last four tournaments we’ve played, the quadrangular, the Hexagonal, the Copa America and the Confederations Cup, obviously without leaving aside the Gold Cup where we gave another group a great chance, at the end of the day I think we’re calm within the group even with the difficulties of trying not to be unfair with human beings and in this case obviously with those who are out of the list. We’re good.</p>

  <p><b>[Osorio has shown he’s fond of players who can do multiple things]</b> I’d prefer an expert, somebody who can play as a winger but can also play as an inside midfielder meaning 20 meters back. That’s perfectly illustrated with Carlos Vela. So, Carlos has played his football for the most part as a right winger playing with his left foot, so he has the ability to come inside and play give and gos and take shots on goal. Well, I think he can play 20 meters farther back and start as an inside midfielder. The question is will there be places for specialists? Well, if at the end I have to make a decision, I will make a decision based on that: What this player has to offer to the team vs. Player B. Hopefully I will make a decision then.<br /><br />It’s been hard, very hard for me but at the same time I think it’s a chance for others, as happens often in life. The problem for one person is a chance for others, in this case an opportunity for Hugo, for Edson, Diego who is recovering, Carlos who fortunately is here and hopefully at the end we make the best decision for everyone<br /><br />I think any player you ask if it’s their dream will see themselves there.

I will not disagree with you that Hector can play a more offensive football from there, but Jesus’ aerial game is second to none.<br /><br />I think it’s something we’ll keep working on, but I think it’s about, if suddenly, not passing the responsibility from one to another, and if you’re in front of the goal, you have to take a shot.

We’re continuing to work on the same principles of play, independent from who might be playing, who is going to be competing, the team has to perform like it did last game. It showed pressure in the attacking zone, the defensive line almost to midfield, immediate reactions when losing the ball. If the game is today obviously there are four different players and that’s because of being forced to make those changes.<br /><br />We’re still thinking about who should play and for what reasons they should play tomorrow. We resisted the temptation to put Hirving Lozano in against Wales and we’re still debating about tomorrow. With him, I could name more, another is Hector Herrera.

In the second, understanding that the entrances in our attacking third were from the wings, we tried to get stronger in that aspect and made a change, a permutation with the same 11.

If we do, we will have chances, and we can score goals<br /><br />The players believe we can play against top teams because we’ve had very good games against Uruguay, Portugal, Belgium, Poland. The teams we have played in the last year or so that have really stretched us to compete at that level<br /><br />The German squad will have a lot of players that played in Confederations Cup, and we played against them. People will say it was a bad result, but while the score was 4-1, we had better possession and we hit the crossbar and missed two very good chances that could have tied the game. We have made a video of that game with all the chances and how we put pressure on them and how we regained the ball. We are preparing the game plan based on those real facts<br /><br />I think we can do something like South Korea did <b>[in 2002]</b>. Hopefully that will be the case<br /><br />The infamous squad rotations? That’s just baloney. If you look at the 25 important games we have played, there are always seven, eight, nine players that always play. Guillermo Ochoa, Hector Moreno, Andres Guardado, Miguel Layun, Hector Herrera, Javier Hernandez, Carlos Vela, Hirving Lozano, Tecatito. Then there is the misconception that I have a problem with short players, and prefer tall players. I never mentioned the height of the player, I have mentioned that we need to be strong in the air, but I’d never say anything about short players. There’s talk that certain players aren’t here because they’re short, but the fact of the matter is our team is full of players who would be considered short, so it’s all BS<br /><br />One of the improvements that we have made as a team is the fact that we can play in three different systems and the players are pretty adapted to that. They have embraced the way we prepare and the way we approach the game, and that’s a big achievement because now going into games we have a Plan A and Plan B and we can adjust defending on what we need<br /><br />We need our top five-six performers performing really well. Guillermo Ochoa, Hector Moreno, Andres Guardado, Hector Herrera, Javier Hernandez and Hirving Lozano. If we have those six players on top form I think we can make a good run because they can lead the group and give us a strong foundation to face any opponent<br /><br />We’re going to play against the World Champions, and that’s a fantastic opportunity. We’re going to compete against the best, and that’s what we’re in this sport for. All of my life I have been dreaming of playing against the world champions and this is it for me</p>

Today we decided to go with Hirving Lozano, who is the fastest player we have and is a winger, and a player coming in on the outside as the case of Miguel Layun<br /><br /><b>[Focus on Korea]</b> I prefer to say we’re going to recover and prepare the game against South Korea well, which surely is going to be difficult, then the game against Sweden and we’re going to see how far we can go</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal &amp; Liverpool target Lozano considered ready for the Premier League after Mexico heroics]</b> I think Hirving, since he moved to PSV Eindhoven, I think he has made the next step up. He’s an unbelievable prospect. His pace, his ability to take people on makes me believe that he is a player that will go very far, hopefully he can show that in the next game. I just think that whoever takes a chance on him will do well. His pace and again his ability to take people on, he can play in any league and any place. I think he will be able to - and he has the tools to play - in the Premier League<br /><br />We decided a plan a couple of months ago and confirmed the plan once we saw Germany against Spain, Brazil and their final preparation game against Saudi Arabia in Leverkusen, a game that I watched live. We prevented them from playing a top, top game. We put a lot of pressure on them and made their lives very tough and very difficult. I think we can go far, yes. I think it’s too soon to say we can win the World Cup. But watching the other games and seeing the way we performed yesterday I honestly think we can compete against any team</p>

I think we did it. If you remember, Carlos was the one who made the last pass for several of the shots we had, for many of the attacks getting into the final third. The idea was for him to give us everything for 60 minutes. He put in a really big effort. On dead balls he had to defend <b>[Mats]</b> Hummels and in open play he had to go after their central defender. The 60 minutes were what we’d budgeted.

  <p><b>[Mexico coach’s surprising Socceroos praise]</b> Personally, I’ve been favourably impressed by Australia. I really like Jedinak and Mooy, two central players very competitive in the midfield. I profoundly admire Australia as a country - what they do in order to recover their players and how they compete honestly and transparently<br /><br />In some cases they seem like rugby players playing football. They are gentlemanly, they don’t go into personal fights, they fight every single ball with all they’ve got. Then if we think about Leckie, for example, they play a very appealing, attractive football. Not only to control a ball and the game but to attack on the wings.

It will be a good memory, but as always soccer is about opinions, it’s very subjective. It constantly is changing and for a lot of people the analysis is worth more than the result. That’s why the easiest thing is to just keep preparing ourselves the best way possible, not get into rowdy victory celebrations but rather keep our humility intact<br /><br />Well, it’s tough, but we’re thankful to the people who truly have been with ‘the mister’ since day one. It’s great. Those who haven’t, well, there are always times to change your mind in life.

It’s definitely a factor to keep in mind, but it’s not important, nor has it been, nor will it be what defines our way of playing. We’re going to try to, within the game we identify with, have a great game with our structure, our performance and hopefully at the end get the result we all want.<br /><br />I imagine that the best thing for Mexican soccer will be, like we talk about with the guys, competing with our strengths, with our game in a game that will be decisive not just for us for the group, for four national teams and hopefully impose ourselves in the game and through that get the result we all want, which is to win and pass to the next round.

  <p><b>[On his team]</b> I have to say that we qualified because we beat Germany and Korea. However, and nevertheless, I am very hurt. I think that for the first time in many, many games, when we played against a team that played that idea of football, direct football, we usually play with three in the back plus an anchor man that is very good in the air. Basically we defend with four. Today for the first time I decided to play with four but not in that structure. At the end, we didn’t succeed in our penetration in the last third. That’s number one factor why we didn’t score. Second, we allowed them to score three goals, which I think is too many.</p>

  <p><b>[After the match, Osorio was asked if he’d rather play pretty and lose or play ugly and win]</b> Let me think. Today and after qualifying, I would rather lose the way we lost. If we wouldn’t have qualified, then I would probably accept that from my part. I think it was too much, and it’s always the case. Today, my sin was to be a purist, thinking that with the idea of playing football, we can compete and beat a team that plays the same type of football every week. It showed me and it taught me a lot of lessons. Hopefully, one day I will get it right, that we play good football and we can beat teams that play that way<br /><br />Believe me, I deeply respect that way of playing. I don’t agree with it because they never play from the back, everything is from the goalkeepers to the attackers, but that’s the way you feel football should be played. That’s very respectable. If you continue doing so I think you have a very good chance to get good results. It’s amazing to realize you can play in the same manner every time and compete and beat teams that play in a different way like we did.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico manager Juan Carlos Osorio says his side is facing the best team in the world in Monday’s round of 16 contest]</b> I think Brazil is a great team. I’d dare to say it’s the best in the world because, collectively, all the players have the ability to control and pass the ball really well. They’ve got collective behaviors like Spain, like Germany. There are three fundamental things - first players who arrive like Paulinho and Coutinho. They have three attackers at a high level, maybe four or five - Neymar, Willian, Coutinho, Gabriel Jesus and Douglas Costa if he’s in the game. It’s a super team. The defenders have good aerial game, the fullbacks come into the attack like few can. They have a coach Tite who is a high-level coach who, aside from knowing how to mix players really well, he always has a strong center with Fernandinho and Casemiro, and so I think it’s a great chance for Mexican football to face the best team in the world in the round of 16 and I think if we play to our potential it’s going be a great game of soccer.<br /><br />In our game tomorrow, we’re going to fight for possession. We’ve got midfielders with a lot of quality and I think we can have numerical superiority with our wingers coming back and try to have the ball. It’s a titanic task against a great team, but we’re going to try. When we can we’ll attack, obviously when the game gives us chances where we can attack in the transition from defense to attack, but the thought isn’t to go out and try to pack it in our own box. Brazil in the final third has really high skill and eventually they’d end up scoring a goal like they’ve showed against the teams who have tried to defend them by sitting back.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osorio slammed the refereeing during his side’s World Cup last-16 defeat at the hands of Brazil]</b> I think the officiating totally favored the Brazilians. It looked to me like their forwards were always looking for the contact and the foul and the referee always protected them. I think the officiating got too involved.<br /><br /><b>[On Neymar]</b> Unfortunately, it’s a shame we wasted a lot of time because of one single player. This is a real shame for football. We lost our style in the second half, due to the referee’s style of too many stoppages and my players got tired of that situation. There was a situation where there was a four-minute stoppage and that’s a poor example for the world of football and all the children. It’s a strong sport, a man’s sport and I think there shouldn’t be so much acting<br /><br />When you compare the possession against Brazil we had 53 percent against 47 percent, it looked to me the game was very even and it was decided in the penalty area. You have to remember that the second goal was at the very end of the game. Mexico gave a good account, stood toe to toe, but we didn’t have the efficiency in the final third that they sure do in the final third. Mexico started well, we had a good start, but unfortunately we didn’t finish our chances well, and when you face a team with that quality up front you’re always in danger of them finding the game</p>
