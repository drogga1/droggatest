  <p><b>[Juan Carlos Osorio talks about his admiration for former Chicago Bulls head coach Phil Jackson]</b> Obviously, I had the chance to read more deeply from Mr. Jackson and I’ve learned big things, not only about sports but also because life is about opportunities: How to try and maximise players’ potential starting from the good things the players do. Yes, I have a deep admiration for him, his teams and obviously at this time it was the top team and they had the <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> of basketball, Michael Jordan. So, I think I learned a lot from this experience</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico Head coach Juan Carlos Osorio refuses to identify <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> by name following the defeat but claimed the play-acting, and the ensuing delays in play, had been badly handed by the referee]</b> I think it’s a shame for football. We wasted a lot of time because of one single player… we lost our style in the second half, because of the referee. There were too many stoppages and my players got more and more tired of that situation. At one point there was a four-minute stoppage. I think this is a very bad example for the world and the world of football<br /><br /><b>[Despite his complaints about <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, who now has two goals in this tournament, Osorio suggested Mexico’s main problem had been Brazil’s superior firepower]</b> I’d like to say that playing at such a level against a team like Brazil, Mexico have shown they are a top team. I think Mexican football needs to have more players playing abroad, so they can match themselves up against the best. I’m deeply sorry for our fans, they’re the best fans in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Carlos Osorio talks about El Tri’s ambitions for Russia 2018]</b> Getting to the semi-finals of the World Cup, it’s very hard, but I think we have the right to dream and same right to think that it’s a goal that can be achieved</p>

  <p><b>[Former Mexico manager Juan Carlos Osorio believes that <a href="diego-lainez.html">Diego Lainez</a> would be a perfect fit for <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>]</b> I think Diego fits perfectly in Amsterdam. He is currently the greatest talent of Mexico. Diego is a smart player, very skillful, a real left leg, fast with the ball on his foot and very strong in the one-on-one.<br /><br /><b>[Osorio thinks <a href="diego-lainez.html">Lainez</a> could have a similar path to stardom with a move to Amsterdam]</b> He has the talent to succeed at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. And the past has proven that Latinos can be an added value for the Eredivisie. It is a nice springboard to larger competitions. Diego has the speed of Finidi George and <a href="marc-overmars.html">Marc Overmars</a> and is a true creator of the game</p>

  <p><b>[Osorio reveals ‘simple reason’ Mexico beat Germany at 2018 World Cup]</b> It’s unlikely to win if we don’t accept the possibility of losing. Originally, I designed it in Mexico. I remember that in an opportunity before the World Cup, they invited me and basically the interviews were forcing me to say that Mexico was going to lose against Germany and that was normal.I said ‘no’. In the commercial break I said, ‘Look, if your goal was to bring me in for this, I’m just going to go now, but I’m convinced that if we don’t try to win and accept the possibility to lose, it’s unlikely to win.’ That’s why we have this phrase, which I defend to the death<br /><br /><b>[Osorio wore a shirt with another of his famous messages]</b> You have to play for the love of winning and not the fear of losing<br /><br />I’m convinced that against Germany we were able to win for a simple reason, which is that Germany didn’t have the slightest idea how we were going to play. <a href="joachim-low.html">Joachim Low</a> isn’t going to worry about Mexico, and even less about Osorio, but Osorio did worry about all of Germany, about <a href="joachim-low.html">Joachim Low</a> and knows exactly how they play and how they were trying to play depending on the players they put on the field</p>
