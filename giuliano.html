<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Brazil midfielder Giuliano said he is desperate to make coach Tite’s final 23-man squad for next year’s World]</b> It was a bad feeling not to be included but on the other hand, it also served as a reminder to stay on my toes, not to get into any sort of comfort zone. It was a motivation, which served to make me work harder and dedicate myself even more. The work I do at my club will now be vital to keeping up my <b>[form]</b>.<br /><br />There are great players fighting for these positions and everyone wants to participate. We are all privileged to be part of this moment and we have to give it everything we have. Since we sealed qualification, our spirit was already focused on the World Cup and we began preparing with a greater responsibility. We are very well prepared now and we have demonstrated this in every game. We have performed well and we have to go to the World Cup with the same spirit, making sure we use these last games to grow in confidence and solidify as a group</p>
