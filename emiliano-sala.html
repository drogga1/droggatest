  <p><b>[The French Leicester City? Ranieri enjoying a flying start at Nantes]</b> Ranieri has brought his great experience, his serenity, and an Italian style that we have seen sometimes in matches. He wants us to have a defensive bloc that sits deep and is compact. For him, we have a kind of castle to protect. He always speaks to us about that castle.</p>

  <p><b>[Emiliano Sala - The Argentine outscoring Lionel Messi. Even Messi has been left in his wake]</b> That’s good. It’s true that it’s something special for me. But what interests me is being able to progress. I had seen that Mbappe was scoring a goal every 55 minutes, but I hadn’t seen that I was in front of Messi. I’m going to have to really work now!<br /><br />We speak the same language. He was a great attacker with impressive statistics, and he’s given me some pointers. With him, we’re playing more direct, with a solid defensive block and high pressure to help us attack more quickly. It’s giving us more chances<br /><br />Frankly, I’m someone who’s really honest, and it doesn’t bother me at all. I’ve got my style, it’s my nature, I’m not going to change at 27 - I’m Argentine! Being on the field, giving everything for myself and maybe scoring a goal, and seeing a friend or a member of my family happy in the stands, that’s what makes me happy<br /><br />I read a phrase a few days ago: ‘Men can lie, but numbers can’t’. However football sees me, I’m just a guy who tries his hardest. Some people have told me to hold back and economise my efforts, but I’m going to continue to make the same runs and try to be just as efficient. I don’t want to change</p>

  <p><b>[Marine scientist David Mearns: The plane that was carrying Emiliano Sala was found in the English Channel]</b> Wreckage of the plane carrying Emiliano Sala and piloted by David Ibbotson was located early this morning by the FPV MORVEN. As agreed with the AAIB they moved the GEO OCEAN III over the position we provided them to visually identify the plane by ROV. The families of Emiliano Sala and David Ibbotson have been notified by Police. The AAIB will be making a statement tomorrow. Tonight our sole thoughts are with the families and friends of Emiliano and David.</p>

On Friday morning, our thoughts turn towards David Ibbotson and his family, in the hope that the authorities can do everything to find him. We ask you for respect during our mourning in these difficult times and to keep Emi in your prayers and in your thoughts.</p>

  <p><b>[Speaking on behalf of Dorset Police’s major crime investigation team, Detective Inspector Simon Huxter said]</b> We have carried out a wide-ranging investigation into the circumstances of the death of Mr Sala and continue to work with partner agencies including the Civil Aviation Authority. As part of this investigation we have to consider whether there is any evidence of any suspected criminality and as a result of our enquiries we have today arrested a 64-year-old man from the North Yorkshire area on suspicion of manslaughter by an unlawful act. He is assisting with our enquiries and has been released from custody under investigation.<br /><br />This matter therefore is still subject to a live investigation and I would ask the media and members of the public to refrain from speculation, as this could cause additional distress to the families involved as well as potentially hinder the investigation. As is standard practice, we will not be releasing any further information as to the identity of the individual who has been arrested unless that person is charged to appear in court and again would discourage any speculation in relation to this</p>

  <p><b>[Emiliano Sala was exposed to harmful levels of carbon monoxide while on board the plane which crashed into the English Channel in January]</b> Toxicology tests on the blood of the passenger showed a carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) saturation level of 58 per cent. COHb is the combination product of carbon monoxide (CO) with haemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein molecule contained in red blood cells. A COHb level of 50% or above in an otherwise healthy individual is generally considered to be potentially fatal. In this type of aircraft, the cockpit is not separated from the cabin and it is considered likely that the pilot would also have been affected to some extent by exposure to CO</p>

  <p><b>[The Air Accidents Investigation Branch, meanwhile, has responded to calls from Emiliano Sala’s family to recover the plane’s wreckage]</b> The reasons for our decision not to recover the aircraft wreckage have been explained in detail to both families concerned. In February our underwater search operation successfully located the wreckage, recovered the passenger’s body and captured substantial video evidence from the scene using a remotely operated vehicle. It was not possible at the time to recover the wreckage. We have carefully considered the feasibility and merits of returning to attempt to recover the wreckage. In this case, we consider that it will not add significantly to the investigation and we will identify the correct safety issues through other means. In making our decision, we took into account the high cost of underwater recovery, the evidence we collected in February and the risk that, after a violent impact with the sea, the wreckage would not yield definitive evidence</p>

We shall be appealing to CAS in order to seek a decision which considers all of the relevant contractual information and provides clarity on the full legal situation between our two clubs. This is a complex matter, which includes ongoing civil and criminal considerations both in the UK and abroad, which will likely have an impact on the validity of the transfer. It is therefore vital that a comprehensive judgement is reached following a full assessment and review of the facts</p>
