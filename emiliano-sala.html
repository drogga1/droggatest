  <p><b>[Speaking on behalf of Dorset Police’s major crime investigation team, Detective Inspector Simon Huxter said]</b> We have carried out a wide-ranging investigation into the circumstances of the death of Mr Sala and continue to work with partner agencies including the Civil Aviation Authority. As part of this investigation we have to consider whether there is any evidence of any suspected criminality and as a result of our enquiries we have today arrested a 64-year-old man from the North Yorkshire area on suspicion of manslaughter by an unlawful act. He is assisting with our enquiries and has been released from custody under investigation.<br /><br />This matter therefore is still subject to a live investigation and I would ask the media and members of the public to refrain from speculation, as this could cause additional distress to the families involved as well as potentially hinder the investigation. As is standard practice, we will not be releasing any further information as to the identity of the individual who has been arrested unless that person is charged to appear in court and again would discourage any speculation in relation to this</p>

  <p><b>[Emiliano Sala was exposed to harmful levels of carbon monoxide while on board the plane which crashed into the English Channel in January]</b> Toxicology tests on the blood of the passenger showed a carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) saturation level of 58 per cent. COHb is the combination product of carbon monoxide (CO) with haemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein molecule contained in red blood cells. A COHb level of 50% or above in an otherwise healthy individual is generally considered to be potentially fatal. In this type of aircraft, the cockpit is not separated from the cabin and it is considered likely that the pilot would also have been affected to some extent by exposure to CO</p>

  <p><b>[The Air Accidents Investigation Branch, meanwhile, has responded to calls from Emiliano Sala’s family to recover the plane’s wreckage]</b> The reasons for our decision not to recover the aircraft wreckage have been explained in detail to both families concerned. In February our underwater search operation successfully located the wreckage, recovered the passenger’s body and captured substantial video evidence from the scene using a remotely operated vehicle. It was not possible at the time to recover the wreckage. We have carefully considered the feasibility and merits of returning to attempt to recover the wreckage. In this case, we consider that it will not add significantly to the investigation and we will identify the correct safety issues through other means. In making our decision, we took into account the high cost of underwater recovery, the evidence we collected in February and the risk that, after a violent impact with the sea, the wreckage would not yield definitive evidence</p>

It would appear the committee has reached its conclusion on a narrow aspect of the overall dispute, without considering the full documentation presented by <a href="cardiff-city-fc.html">Cardiff City FC</a> to <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>.<br /><br />Nevertheless there remains clear evidence that the transfer agreement was never completed in accordance with multiple contractual requirements which were requested by <a href="nantes-fc.html">Nantes</a>, thereby rendering it null and void. We shall be appealing to CAS in order to seek a decision which considers all of the relevant contractual information and provides clarity on the full legal situation between our two clubs. This is a complex matter, which includes ongoing civil and criminal considerations both in the UK and abroad, which will likely have an impact on the validity of the transfer. It is therefore vital that a comprehensive judgement is reached following a full assessment and review of the facts</p>

Not only to fully understand what led to the downing of the Piper PA-46 Malibu plane, but to answer the wider questions that have been highlighted in this case, specifically related to the use of illegal flights in the football industry and the role of intermediaries in player transfers.<br /><br />As a result of our investigation we believe there is sufficient evidence of wrongdoing that necessitates investigation by the French authorities of those responsible for the arrangement of the transfer on behalf of FC <a href="nantes-fc.html">Nantes</a> and for arranging the doomed flight. We have therefore passed over information to the Parquet de <a href="nantes-fc.html">Nantes</a> to assist their efforts.

This jersey, from which the entire sales profits will be allocated to the two Argentinian training clubs of Emiliano, is a way of paying homage to him</p>
