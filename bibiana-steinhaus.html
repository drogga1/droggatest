  <p><b>[Bibiana Steinhaus will become the first female referee to officiate in <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> history]</b> When Lutz Michael Frohlich <b>[the head of German referees]</b> informed me, I was quite speechless. I feel disbelief, joy, happiness, relief, curiosity - it was simply a roller-coaster ride of emotions! It has always been my dream to be a <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> referee. That this dream will come true naturally fills me with joy. On one hand it is confirmation of my hard work, and on the other hand it is a great incentive to continue to work hard</p>

  <dd>Steinhaus made history in Germany by becoming the first female to officiate a top-level league match. The setting was iconic too – Berlin’s 74,000-capacity Olympiastadion has hosted Olympic Games, World Cup matches and a Champions League final</dd>

  <p><b>[Bibiana Steinhaus speaks after becoming the first female referee in <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> history]</b> My gender is completely irrelevant to my colleagues. As referees we are all measured based on exactly the same criteria, and naturally this includes our performance. One excellent development, for example, is that one in four match officials at the upcoming U-17 World Cup in India will be women - based purely on performance criteria</p>

  <p><b>[Bibiana Steinhaus tells why she loves her job]</b> You have to manage 22 totally different players, under this microscope of media interest and with all the fans around and with all the noise and great atmosphere in stadiums. With a heartbeat of 180 because you’re running all the time … It is the best job in the world!</p>

  <p><b>[Steinhaus made history by becoming the first female to officiate a top-level league match]</b> It actually gives me goosebumps now as I’m thinking back to it. When we actually walked out there in Berlin in this Olympic Stadium – which is pretty impressive – and the noise and the atmosphere … it was just a wonderful moment. A moment that we all worked for such a long time and it’s just beautiful that we could make it<br /><br /><b>[But before long, however, it was back to business as usual]</b> We took a deep breath as a refereeing teamAnd, from that moment on, we prepared this game like every other game. We prepared as a team, we prepared the kickoff so when it finally came we were totally focused<br /><br /><b>[Steinhaus admits she didn’t anticipate the worldwide media attention her appointment drew, expecting it only to be news in her native Germany]</b> It was a lot of pressure<br /><br /><b>[Steinhaus’ performance received widespread approval, but the attention she drew for her second match between Schalke and Mainz was, it’s fair to say, altogether different]</b> Nobody cared. Nobody was really interested, it was like a mini note in the media. That showed me it’s accepted, people accept a good quality referee no matter what sex, no matter what size, no matter what background, what religion, what culture. If you have the quality and if you have the passion to do your job as best as you can then doors are open. And that’s what we want for the beauty of the game</p>

  <p><b>[She was part of second division football for nearly ten years. And after officiating as fourth official for years, she is now referee in a top-flight football league]</b> It’s just about performance and your dedication and passion to go for it. Then it works. The possibilities are there</p>
