He’s now feeling confident in playing an important role for Dortmund at a crucial time in their season where they’re trying to lock in qualification for the Champions League. They also have a huge match against Bayern Munich on the back end of our match against Paraguay, so when I factored all of those things together, as much as we wanted him here I felt it best suits the player to continue in the rhythm and form he’s currently in with his club</p>

  <p>[Sarachan ready to let loose USMNT’s confident youngsters against Paraguay] They won’t be overcoached, I can tell you that. We’re going to allow them to make a lot of decisions on the field, and that’s what this is all about.<br /><br />The technical level of these guys has shown to be very good, and obviously with youth comes enthusiasm and energy, but I think the soccer has impressed me so far in the training. I think the confidence of a young group, and playing without a lot of fear, has been the two things that have stood out to me. Nobody’s here that shouldn’t be here. I think they all belong here, they’ve all made a good case for themselves this week. It’s going to be a little bit of a challenge putting the first 11 out because I think the margins between what I would consider the very top to the very bottom is very thin. They’ve all made a good impression, a couple maybe that surprised me that I didn’t really know that well that have hung in there pretty well</p>

  <p>[USMNT vs Paraguay] This match once again represents an opportunity for some new faces. The roster has an average age under 24, so for the most part this is a group of younger players that we feel have a future with the national team along with some familiar names. The timing is right to give these guys international exposure, and they will certainly be tested against a strong and experienced Paraguayan team	.</p>

  <p>[Young USMNT passes test of toughness in gritty win over Paraguay] This game became a real big boy game and these guys kept their composure when things started to fly.

  <p>[Pulisic is set for USMNT return, and it shouldn’t be a brief one] There’s going to be a handful of guys that just went through a long year in Europe that will be finishing up close to when we’ll be bringing guys in. I’m trying to balance out the roster where players don’t have to finish their season, come to the States, train all week and then fly back to Europe. So there’ll be some of those guys that I think we’ll leave in Europe and not bring over. And then when we leave here on the 29th they’ll join us and be a part of the games in Europe.<br /><br />[On which games Pulisic will take part in] We’re going to have that conversation. He falls into the category of a long grind year and then Dortmund throws this postseason game on the group to come here. The challenge will then be after he’s here, how we manage him to go back. That’s still working through that<br /><br />[On Christian Pulisic] He’s been through a lot over the year personally. I know there’s a lot of demands on a guy like him and he’s being pulled in different directions. There’s still some speculation, this didn’t come from him directly, that maybe he’ll move from Dortmund. I know there’s a lot going on and I’m trying to be helpful in the process and allow him a little wiggle room in terms of the national team now. For instance, back in November I would’ve loved to have him in Portugal, but the circumstances were such that it wasn’t possible. The January camp wasn’t going to happen. The Paraguay game he was in the thick of things with Dortmund, but now with these games coming up, I’m hopeful. He loves the national team and he’s, I think, champing at the bit to get it right. He’s just gotta get through his year and all the rest. I think he understands what his role is and will be with the national team</p>

  <p>[Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Tim Weah headline young USA squad for Bolivia friendly] It has been challenging to build the roster given that we have these three matches - one domestic and two in Europe - while trying to be sensitive to the fact that MLS teams are currently in season. Having players available for all three games was a big ask. It was a challenge to try and balance that out in terms of time away from their club team and also the needs we have. Given the way the roster has come along for the Bolivia game and those who will be available for Europe, I think it’s developed well and I’m looking forward to getting started with the group that we’ve finalized for the opening of our camp in Philadelphia.</p>

  <p>[On Julian Green] He finished on a good note with his club, obviously scoring. That’s important, when guys have been playing and also having some confidence. He’s still got ability that I felt he deserved a good look this week in this environment again. He’s had a taste of it, on and off, and now I think it’s a good opportunity for him to jump in coming off a good back-end of the season.<br /><br />I would say in a general way that’s true for most young players. That there’s going to be ups and downs, and how they manage through that and come out the other end is really the challenge for all young players. Having this opportunity I’d like to think he’s excited and the confidence level will be good</p>

  <p>[On Tim Weah’s first-half struggles] He was all over the shop. He looked like a kid that has never played at a higher level, to a guy who was looking to come out of a game where he wasn’t sure if he was even hurt, to flying and beating guys. He was the prototypical young nervous guy, and he’s a good example of what you describe. He plays for a club that’s pretty well known, and so everyone assumes because he’s on the books at a place like PSG that he’s going to be at such a certain level. I think he can get there, but he’s not there, and what you saw tonight was a nervous kid, and yet the goal he scored was a great goal. He’s going to be a good player, but he’s got some growing to do, and maturing to do as a player. What you saw is kind of where he’s at.<br /><br />You look around the world there’s plenty of 18-year-old and 19-year-olds that are getting games at a high level. Josh was a victim of his birth year at Werder Bremen, where he wasn’t allowed to get first-team minutes with Werder Bremen this year. And we’re very thin at the number nine position in American soccer in my opinion. And so here’s a kid that has progressed through the age groups and World Cup settings, and I’m not projecting Josh to be a starter from here on in with the men’s team, but he possesses a certain mentality and frame and why not look at him at a time when you can? Because as I say, we need goal-scorers, we need to give them opportunities. And so, for me, I didn’t think twice about it. I thought this was the perfect time to give him a little introduction</p>

  <p>[Dave Sarachan has made multiple changes to his roster ahead of friendlies against Ireland and France] We’re excited about the chance to add some of the veterans from Europe as well as the younger guys in MLS who have been part of our group since November. The games against Ireland and France will bring increasingly more difficult challenges, so we felt it was important to bring in some players that offer a bit more experience. These matches will provide another big development opportunity for these players who are growing in their international careers</p>

  <p>[Breakout Bundesliga season has McKennie primed for big USMNT role] Clearly, when you’ve had those opportunities that he’s had at Schalke, and the way he finished the season, and seeing a lot of minutes, he’s grown as a player, he’s grown as a professional. I know at Schalke he’s played in a few different roles and with us now coming in, I would say we don’t have a lot of leaders within this group but he’s a guy that comes in with a lot of confidence and personality, and I think tactically has a real better feel for different positions in the central part of the field. The whole package has improved since the first time I had him.<br /><br />I think it still hasn’t hit me.</p>

  <p>[Youthful USMNT squad’s final exam will be a brutal one as full-strength France awaits] One thing I’ll tell you about this group is they don’t get intimidated.

Once we step on the field this group will compete.</p>

  <p>[Gonzalez made the decision to play for El Tri] That’s a real individual decision. Every person has to make those important decisions and Jonathan made his. I don’t think any more beyond that to be honest. It’s worked in the reverse cases for us as well. And as we move along, there’s probably going to be more examples of that.<br /><br />We have a big country, with a lot of people out watching. We have a lot of systems in place, but that can be improved in terms of identifying talent and trying to offer everyone opportunities to be a part of our national teams at the youth level moving on up. I think we’ve done well with our programming at the youth level for all players and those that have dual citizenship and have options, hopefully they’re getting a great experience along the way. We still have to be the best at every level going forward. Ultimately it is up to the players to make those decisions, but there’s going to be some that decide one way and some that decide the other no matter what you do. We know there’s improvements that need to be made in terms of the scouting and identification and I think we’re getting there</p>

  <p>[On Tyler Adams] This kid’s a beast. When you look at data and analytics and you look at the volume of work that he does in 90 minutes. You guys on the outside see a good part of it, but the data backs it up. He’s a winner, this kid<br /><br />I’ve been really pleased in terms of his growth with the ball in tight spots. We know that he can run and cover ground and win tackles and compete, but at the next level now can you do the next part and that is have a presence with the ball and picking your spots. He just keeps getting better. It’s not perfect, but I think he’s shown that he’s emerging as a guy that everyone’s starting to look up to a little bit. When the game’s getting crazy Tyler was starting to try and calm it down. A real good night for him<br /><br />[On Tim Weah] There’s certain things with Timmy. He’s got tools and he was hungry to get on the end of something tonight. You could tell. I keep repeating, for all these players who we think have a real future, these moments are going to add up in a positive way.<br /><br />[On Antonee Robinson] With Antonee, I was quick to pull him aside after that game against Brazil because I know everyone was very harsh on him. He had some pretty good moments in that game, but people remember the moment that wasn’t so good. That’s going to happen with every player and I think with him, he still has an inner confidence and you can see it. He even made a couple mistakes tonight, but generally very good. As an athlete you want to get back on the horse when you get knocked off it and I thought he did great<br /><br />I do think our guys showed great composure. I think that’s one of the things going into games against CONCACAF opponents is having composure in moments where it could lead to a red card or something. They got a good taste of it tonight<br /><br />I don’t think they would have been very happy with a draw tonight, which is a good sign for this group. They want to win every time they step on the field. Sometimes that’s the innocence of youth, but it’s good</p>

  <p>[Pulisic and Bradley headline USMNT roster for October friendlies versus Colombia and Peru] When you are building a team, at some point there has to be the proper blend of youth and experience. As we head into these last four friendlies of the year, I felt the timing was right to begin that transition. I think it’s important to do it earlier than a week before the Gold Cup or a World Cup Qualifier.<br /><br />Bringing in players like Michael and Brad, who have a vast amount of experience and can be a great resource for our younger players - both on and off the field - is an important step for us at this point in time. We’ve begun to develop a deeper pool across the board. As we continue to offer opportunities, it will strengthen us even more. At the same time, players need to understand that there is going to be competition for spots and for playing time, and that is part of the next stage of development for many of these young guys. I think we’re going to see that competition more and more as we move forward.<br /><br />With Tim (Weah) and Josh, we’re still taking the long view. We know that at both PSG and Werder Bremen, the competition for playing time is extremely difficult, yet both are gaining valuable experience at their clubs and their fitness and form are still at a good level. We feel it’s important to continue offering these players opportunities right now, knowing that it will pay dividends down the road</p>

  <p>[USMNT heads into Peru friendly with eye on keeping the ball] I’d like us to do better with the ball.

  <p>[USMNT’s all-teen attack impresses against Peru] Jonathan Amon showed some moments that give you hope and showed you moments that make you realize he’s 18. The speed of play got him on a few occasions but the moments that came where he had to take off and be creative, that was impressive and I think I’d love for this young kid to take away a lot in that regard.<br /><br />[On Timothy Weah] I think he’s growing. He’s got a lot to learn still but he’s getting used to the speed of play at this level and that’s been a real plus. He’s got a lot of tools. For young players it’s a matter of now putting those tools to the right test. I think his games lately, he’s been pretty solid<br /><br />[On Josh Sargent] The kid’s moving in a good direction. As a lone striker in the first half, he didn’t have a lot of the play but the moments that came to him, I thought he did pretty well. He did some clever movements in terms of keeping possession, he’s a strong kid. I thought on the night he had a good night. Getting the goal was the cherry on the sundae</p>

  <p>[USMNT vs Italy] Over the course of 12 months, in all the matches we’ve played, we’ve made it somewhat hard on teams, whether it’s getting in on tackles or blocking passing lanes or making it difficult for teams to really create a lot of chances. I thought in the England game we lost that element a little bit. We’ve addressed that, being a little more of a risk-taking team and being more aggressive, not in a way to foul but just making it hard on the opponent. I think that’s what we’re looking for.</p>

I feel as though this has been a very good year for the program and I feel - as the leader over the last 12 months of this program - I feel as though we’ve moved it forward. It may not look like that to everybody on the outside, but to look back on the games that we’ve played, the players we’ve exposed to this level, that we’ve brought forth, I’m certain it’s going to pay dividends down the line.
