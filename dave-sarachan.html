  <p><b>[2018 January Camp]</b> We’re excited about our 2018 January Camp roster. It’s all about the future and opportunity. Twenty-one of these players are 24 and younger so we’re excited about that, and we clearly feel that we want to have a look at these players that have the chance to be a part of the national team for a number of years to come. We think the balance was good and obviously we’re trying to bring in players that are coming off good seasons, are at a good age for the future, and to give the opportunity to those that have earned that right to be a part of the program.</p>

  <p><b>[Sarachan on new-look USMNT]</b> The attitude and enthusiasm of this group has been really refreshing. I’ve been around a lot of January camps that would always be labeled as a grind, but I think from my standpoint - and you can ask the players - you’d never use the word grind in this case. It’s been very positive. They came in with their eyes wide open, very eager to be a part of it, very eager to impress. From the start, to where we are now towards the end of the camp, there’s been no tail-off in terms of their day to day work<br /><br />With every new cycle, and every new camp, when there’s new faces, some of the veteran guys that have been a part of the past can now emerge, whereas in the past it wasn’t their time or their role. It’s a really key piece in every team, the veteran leadership piece. Clearly the older guys that are here - Justin Morrow, Ike Opara - have been looked to for a little bit more leadership given their age and experience. But even a guy like Jordan Morris - who is a young guy relatively speaking but has a lot of veteran miles on him given his experience in qualifying and the Gold Cup - I think he’s taken on a little bit of leadership as well. Even C.J. Sapong, being an older guy, I think that’s been a natural attraction for younger players to get their perspective on a lot of things<br /><br />The fundamentals of piecing together a team won’t change, regardless of the title I have. We get the group in on day one, we talk about what our goals and objectives are, then you evaluate and identify the strengths and weaknesses of the group, and then a system begins to take form. It takes shape really depending on the players, and that’s how I approach it<br /><br />Regardless of the system, we’re going to be aggressive and try to press when we can, and play without fear. I think the group in November embraced it, and I’m expecting this group will embrace it<br /><br />Of 29 players that we have here, I wouldn’t come away and say, ‘This guy doesn’t belong in this group’ about anybody. From top to bottom, the margins are real thin. It’s a good group</p>

  <p><b>[Three takeaways from the USA draw with Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina]</b> The soccer was spotty at times I thought. There were moments we were OK, and then there were moments where I thought we gave away possession pretty easily. Maybe still a little bit of rust is on a few of the guys.<br /><br />In terms of the defensive structure of the group, it was solid. With those three, they had the freedom to release and join in with C.J. <b>[Sapong]</b> early, whether it was Cristian or Tyler. I don’t consider them pure passing No. 10s, but at the same time I think with their runs out of midfield I thought we were dangerous actually. So it wasn’t so much the creative passing that we expected, but it was the dangerous third-man running that guys like Tyler can make out of the midfield. I thought <b>[Adams]</b> did a good job of that, and I thought there were moments where if we picked him out a little bit earlier we could have been even more dangerous<br /><br /><b>[On Ike Opara]</b> Ike was great. I thought he was in good spots most of the night. He broke up a few plays. He distributed the ball decently tonight, and held up physically</p>

The roster has an average age of just over 23 years old, so for the most part they’re younger players that we feel have a future with the national team, along with some familiar faces who were a part of January camp that we felt did well and wanted to continue looking at those players.<br /><br /><b>[On Timothy Weah]</b> He’s a versatile player than can fit in at a couple different positions, and when you have speed and technical ability combined as a young kid, I think he’s an interesting prospect to offer an opportunity to<br /><br /><b>[On Christian Pulisic]</b> I’ve had conversations with the sporting director at Dortmund and several with Christian personally about the timing of this friendly and where he is professionally at the moment with his club. He’s now feeling confident in playing an important role for Dortmund at a crucial time in their season where they’re trying to lock in qualification for the Champions League. They also have a huge match against Bayern Munich on the back end of our match against Paraguay, so when I factored all of those things together, as much as we wanted him here I felt it best suits the player to continue in the rhythm and form he’s currently in with his club</p>

We’re going to allow them to make a lot of decisions on the field, and that’s what this is all about.<br /><br />The technical level of these guys has shown to be very good, and obviously with youth comes enthusiasm and energy, but I think the soccer has impressed me so far in the training. I think the confidence of a young group, and playing without a lot of fear, has been the two things that have stood out to me. Nobody’s here that shouldn’t be here. I think they all belong here, they’ve all made a good case for themselves this week. It’s going to be a little bit of a challenge putting the first 11 out because I think the margins between what I would consider the very top to the very bottom is very thin. They’ve all made a good impression, a couple maybe that surprised me that I didn’t really know that well that have hung in there pretty well</p>

  <p><b>[Pulisic is set for USMNT return, and it shouldn’t be a brief one]</b> There’s going to be a handful of guys that just went through a long year in Europe that will be finishing up close to when we’ll be bringing guys in. I’m trying to balance out the roster where players don’t have to finish their season, come to the States, train all week and then fly back to Europe. So there’ll be some of those guys that I think we’ll leave in Europe and not bring over. And then when we leave here on the 29th they’ll join us and be a part of the games in Europe.<br /><br /><b>[On which games Pulisic will take part in]</b> We’re going to have that conversation. He falls into the category of a long grind year and then Dortmund throws this postseason game on the group to come here. The challenge will then be after he’s here, how we manage him to go back. That’s still working through that<br /><br /><b>[On Christian Pulisic]</b> He’s been through a lot over the year personally. I know there’s a lot of demands on a guy like him and he’s being pulled in different directions. There’s still some speculation, this didn’t come from him directly, that maybe he’ll move from Dortmund. I know there’s a lot going on and I’m trying to be helpful in the process and allow him a little wiggle room in terms of the national team now. For instance, back in November I would’ve loved to have him in Portugal, but the circumstances were such that it wasn’t possible. The January camp wasn’t going to happen. The Paraguay game he was in the thick of things with Dortmund, but now with these games coming up, I’m hopeful. He loves the national team and he’s, I think, champing at the bit to get it right. He’s just gotta get through his year and all the rest. I think he understands what his role is and will be with the national team</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Tim Weah headline young USA squad for Bolivia friendly]</b> It has been challenging to build the roster given that we have these three matches - one domestic and two in Europe - while trying to be sensitive to the fact that MLS teams are currently in season. Having players available for all three games was a big ask. It was a challenge to try and balance that out in terms of time away from their club team and also the needs we have. Given the way the roster has come along for the Bolivia game and those who will be available for Europe, I think it’s developed well and I’m looking forward to getting started with the group that we’ve finalized for the opening of our camp in Philadelphia.</p>

  <p><b>[On Julian Green]</b> He finished on a good note with his club, obviously scoring. That’s important, when guys have been playing and also having some confidence. He’s still got ability that I felt he deserved a good look this week in this environment again. He’s had a taste of it, on and off, and now I think it’s a good opportunity for him to jump in coming off a good back-end of the season.<br /><br />I would say in a general way that’s true for most young players. That there’s going to be ups and downs, and how they manage through that and come out the other end is really the challenge for all young players. Having this opportunity I’d like to think he’s excited and the confidence level will be good</p>

  <p><b>[On Tim Weah’s first-half struggles]</b> He was all over the shop. He looked like a kid that has never played at a higher level, to a guy who was looking to come out of a game where he wasn’t sure if he was even hurt, to flying and beating guys. He was the prototypical young nervous guy, and he’s a good example of what you describe. He plays for a club that’s pretty well known, and so everyone assumes because he’s on the books at a place like PSG that he’s going to be at such a certain level. I think he can get there, but he’s not there, and what you saw tonight was a nervous kid, and yet the goal he scored was a great goal. He’s going to be a good player, but he’s got some growing to do, and maturing to do as a player. What you saw is kind of where he’s at.<br /><br />You look around the world there’s plenty of 18-year-old and 19-year-olds that are getting games at a high level. Josh was a victim of his birth year at Werder Bremen, where he wasn’t allowed to get first-team minutes with Werder Bremen this year. And we’re very thin at the number nine position in American soccer in my opinion. And so here’s a kid that has progressed through the age groups and World Cup settings, and I’m not projecting Josh to be a starter from here on in with the men’s team, but he possesses a certain mentality and frame and why not look at him at a time when you can? Because as I say, we need goal-scorers, we need to give them opportunities. And so, for me, I didn’t think twice about it. I thought this was the perfect time to give him a little introduction</p>

I know at Schalke he’s played in a few different roles and with us now coming in, I would say we don’t have a lot of leaders within this group but he’s a guy that comes in with a lot of confidence and personality, and I think tactically has a real better feel for different positions in the central part of the field.

I know that he wanted to be a part of things and we certainly wanted him here, but unfortunately he won’t be available. That said, we haven’t had Christian in with the group aside from one game in the past six friendlies, so I feel confident that this group will continue to build on what we have started.</p>

That should be each and every player that we bring in, and Christian is no different. … Look at the Bolivia game. It was an outlier from that standpoint. Yes, he was tired. He was coming off a long season-whatever the reasons. But when you come in with the national team, those boxes have to be checked.<br /><br /><b>[referring the Bolivia friendly]</b> We needed a little bit more, and I think <b>[Pulisic]</b> knows that. He’s got the potential to be a major player for the senior national team. Will he maybe be a captain one day? He’s got the ability. We all know. So when he comes in, I’m hoping that he can be influential and bring the group together in an infectious way, and make sure he’s all in, because we need him. He’s that good</p>

I thought the second half we had better moments of using the ball better. I thought our coordination of trying to step out wasn’t very good in the first half. We got pulled apart a little bit. I thought in the second half we improved<br /><br />We’re always going to miss a guy like Christian Pulisic in any game for sure. If we had Christian tonight it’s hard to say, I can’t say we’d have the ball 40 more percent of the time, but clearly I think when you add players into the mix that have a certain comfort level and play out of tight spots like Christian it would help. Sure, we miss Christian but I’m not sure it would have changed the way the game went<br /><br />Overall this was a great game for us to play. These types of games, when you’re playing a team like Brazil, which is arguably as good as any team on the planet.

I don’t think any more beyond that to be honest. It’s worked in the reverse cases for us as well. And as we move along, there’s probably going to be more examples of that.<br /><br />We have a big country, with a lot of people out watching. We have a lot of systems in place, but that can be improved in terms of identifying talent and trying to offer everyone opportunities to be a part of our national teams at the youth level moving on up. I think we’ve done well with our programming at the youth level for all players and those that have dual citizenship and have options, hopefully they’re getting a great experience along the way. We still have to be the best at every level going forward. Ultimately it is up to the players to make those decisions, but there’s going to be some that decide one way and some that decide the other no matter what you do.

As an athlete you want to get back on the horse when you get knocked off it and I thought he did great<br /><br />I do think our guys showed great composure. I think that’s one of the things going into games against CONCACAF opponents is having composure in moments where it could lead to a red card or something.

As we head into these last four friendlies of the year, I felt the timing was right to begin that transition. I think it’s important to do it earlier than a week before the Gold Cup or a World Cup Qualifier.<br /><br />Bringing in players like Michael and Brad, who have a vast amount of experience and can be a great resource for our younger players - both on and off the field - is an important step for us at this point in time. We’ve begun to develop a deeper pool across the board. As we continue to offer opportunities, it will strengthen us even more. At the same time, players need to understand that there is going to be competition for spots and for playing time, and that is part of the next stage of development for many of these young guys. I think we’re going to see that competition more and more as we move forward.<br /><br />With Tim (Weah) and Josh, we’re still taking the long view. We know that at both PSG and Werder Bremen, the competition for playing time is extremely difficult, yet both are gaining valuable experience at their clubs and their fitness and form are still at a good level. We feel it’s important to continue offering these players opportunities right now, knowing that it will pay dividends down the road</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT vs Italy]</b> Over the course of 12 months, in all the matches we’ve played, we’ve made it somewhat hard on teams, whether it’s getting in on tackles or blocking passing lanes or making it difficult for teams to really create a lot of chances. I thought in the England game we lost that element a little bit. We’ve addressed that, being a little more of a risk-taking team and being more aggressive, not in a way to foul but just making it hard on the opponent. I think that’s what we’re looking for.</p>

  <p><b>[USA national team interim boss Dave Sarachan says that he expects Tuesday’s loss to Italy to be his last game in charge]</b> It was my last game - I haven’t been told that, but it’s evident there is going to be a change in the very near future. I feel as though this has been a very good year for the program and I feel - as the leader over the last 12 months of this program - I feel as though we’ve moved it forward. It may not look like that to everybody on the outside, but to look back on the games that we’ve played, the players we’ve exposed to this level, that we’ve brought forth, I’m certain it’s going to pay dividends down the line. So, for me, I feel as though, when the next person comes in they’re going to have a great starting point.</p>

  <p><b>[Former U.S. national team interim manager Dave Sarachan has been unveiled as the new coach for North Carolina FC]</b> I am very excited to be joining NCFC as its head coach. To have an opportunity to be aligned with quality people, excellent facilities, a soccer rich community and a shared philosophy in terms of vision and ambition is every head coach’s wish. I look forward to working with Steve and Curt and all of the NCFC family in building a team that we all will be proud of and that will contend for trophies.<br /><br />After my time here, which included a one-day press event, a training camp and a game, I came away very impressed. I got a real sense of the whole project of NCFC. I was impressed with everything from the people to the mission of the club, the facilities and the tie in with NCFC Youth</p>
