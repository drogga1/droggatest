<blockquote>
  <p>Newly crowned strawweight queen, <a href="weili-zhang.html">Weili Zhang</a>, isn’t sure who her next opponent will be. But she has her own ideas of who it shouldn’t be<br /><br />With things starting to shake out a bit between the division’s contenders, there look to be three top possibilities as to whom China’s finest may try and defend against first. Some of which Zhang has some thoughts on already<br /><br />From Rosa Namujanas’ loss to Karolina Kowalkiewicz at UFC 202 in July 2016 to literally all the way up until she was hoisted into the air by Andrade at UFC 237 earlier this year, she looked borderline unstoppable<br /><br />The now 27-year old standout from season 20 of The Ultimate Fighter (TUF) had grown exponentially since her promotional debut that saw her compete for the title opposite Carla Esparza in 2014. As evidenced by her three-fight winning streak against Michelle Waterson and Joanna Jedrzejczyk, Namajunas is still as good as it gets at 115-pounds<br /><br />Prior to this past weekend as well as even Zhang’s title bout with Andrade, many were clamoring for the undefeated dominant wrestler, Tatiana Suarez, to get the next title shot. With three of her five UFC wins coming by way of finish (two submissions, one TKO), the claims were perfectly justifiable. Unfortunately for the TUF 23 winner, a neck injury needed some time to heal following her most recent win over Nina Ansaroff at UFC 238 in June<br /><br />The division’s all-time greatest fighter, Joanna Jedrzejczyk, would go on to put on a vintage showing against her opponent in Michelle Waterson. In the end, Poland’s finest was awarded a clear cut unanimous decision victory<br /><br />With the three attempted pairings between Jedrzejczyk and Zhang earlier in the year, all of which were declined by the former due to her break time and Zhang’s lack of notoriety at the time … Things have now lined up about as good as they possibly could have for them to finally meet in the Octagon</p>
