<blockquote>
  <p>[Enugu Rangers head coach Gbenga Ogunbote has promised the fans that his side will make an appreciable improvement with time after Rivers United 1-0 win] was a good win for us and playing against a team that finished second in recent seasons, you can’t write them off. I will have wished we scored four to five goals at the early start of the season but most strikers we signed are yet to hit form. I know it is a question of time. As soon as the team gels, we will begin to score more goals. Rivers United have always been a good side because they have won the league, Federation Cup and represented the country at continental competitions.<br /><br />For Rangers fans, I still want to ask for their understanding, knowing fully well that if a team has not really gelled, you can’t see the best of them yet. Gradually, it is better we get three points in our home games and strive to get careless points on the road and before they know we are somewhere. The league season is just about six-week-old and we still have about 32 games to go which is a quite number. They shouldn’t lose their sleep except for their darling team been yet to make them happy the way they want this season</p>
