  <p><b>[<a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> is still pretty deadly]</b> It was the first time I managed to get a glimpse of whether he still had it or not. We had a shooting session and I was doing some one-on-one work with Romelu <b>[Lukaku]</b> and Paul <b>[Pogba]</b>. The manager came over and I could see he was limbering up in the corner of my eye. He got involved and he was still pretty deadly, I have to be honest. He had some bad luck because he kept hitting the same post in the same spot. But the touch was there and the instinct was still there. He is very, very clinical still. He did well and I am looking forward to seeing that game on Sunday.</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> boss <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> and current <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> manager Nuno are providing inspiration for Lee Grant as the experienced goalkeeper plots a career change]</b> It is strange that you don’t see a huge amount of goalkeepers making it into top-level management. Yes, <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> played in goal and Mike Walker the old <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> manager. The <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> manager Nuno - he was a goalkeeper. Kevin Blackwell. There have been a few. But, obviously, the <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> boss, Nuno, is probably a shining example of it in this day and age. A goalkeeper turned head coach. So, obviously, that’s a path I wouldn’t mind following. Us goalkeepers are a bit more difficult as, to be a goalkeeper coach, you have to have your goalkeeping badges as well. For me, it’s something I would want to do naturally anyway, coaching and management, and I mean the whole team, as it’s something I’ve really had my eye on.<br /><br />Strangely, in the earlier part of my career, coaching was something I was always dead against. I could never see myself in that role whereas, as I got to 26 or 27, my views changed on that dramatically. I’m completely the opposite now. It’s something I’m really looking forward to getting into and, hopefully, management at some stage. I’d really love to be part of a coaching team and, as I say, eventually lead a team. That would be the ideal scenario for me. I think something changed when I went back to Derby for the second time. I was working with <a href="steve-mcclaren.html">Steve McClaren</a> and I just saw the way he worked. I actually saw, first hand how a change in manager can have such a dramatic impact on a football club, and on a team of players. It really opened my eyes to it. So getting an opportunity to do that in the future, I’m really looking forward to that moment.<br /><br />I’ve had some excellent role models. For me, though, you learn just as much from the ones you don’t necessarily agree with, the ones you don’t see eye-to-eye with, or the ones whose methods you don’t like. You learn as much from those as you do from the ones you’ve really enjoyed working with, the ones you’ve studied and the ones you trust and believe in. So there is lots to learn and I am trying to pick up as much as I can. I feel like I’m in a wonderful position to do that at the football club I am at, at the moment</p>

  <p><b>[Lee Grant impressed by <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a>’s ‘seamless’ <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> transition]</b> It’s been seamless. Harry has definitely slotted straight in, in terms of the social side and in terms of his mentality and attitude, which has been first class. The most important thing, though, is his quality and he was able to show that against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. We could all see he is quite at home in front of the <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> crowd and quite at home as a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player</p>

  <p><b>[United goalkeeper Lee Grant joined Mata on the video call and said he too has been following club orders with his home training regime]</b> We have got our own special programme and, really, it just centres around doing as much as we can within the confines and the safety of our own houses. Of course, we are utilising what equipment we have and, as Juan says, the garden has come into play as well. We are really just doing what we can and trying to follow, as closely as we can, the programmes that the club have given us</p>
