  <p><b>[Lee Grant impressed by <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a>’s ‘seamless’ Old Trafford transition]</b> It’s been seamless. Harry has definitely slotted straight in, in terms of the social side and in terms of his mentality and attitude, which has been first class. The most important thing, though, is his quality and he was able to show that against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. We could all see he is quite at home in front of the Old Trafford crowd and quite at home as a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player</p>

  <p><b>[United goalkeeper Lee Grant joined Mata on the video call and said he too has been following club orders with his home training regime]</b> We have got our own special programme and, really, it just centres around doing as much as we can within the confines and the safety of our own houses. Of course, we are utilising what equipment we have and, as Juan says, the garden has come into play as well. We are really just doing what we can and trying to follow, as closely as we can, the programmes that the club have given us</p>
