  <p><b>[Corentin Tolisso says his road back from knee surgery in the last year hardened him and helped him grow mentally]</b> I think it made me grow mentally, it hardened me. I knew that I had to work hard to get back to the top level. I have to continue like this and find my true level before my injury. It depends only on me. I have to give myself a little time. With <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, I worked a lot too. I made good preparations. It’s up to me to continue like this. Today, I managed to return to the France team. It’s up to me to prove with <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> to return again. But it was very emotional. I was very, very proud to be here yesterday<br /><br /><b>[Tolisso praised <a href="kingsley-coman.html">Kingsley Coman</a> for his own mental toughness as he has overcame injury to get into fine form]</b> I think it was complicated for Kingsley. I know it’s been difficult, so I’m not going to talk to him about his absence at the World Cup. He is in great shape. What he has been doing since the beginning of the season is exceptional and I hope it will continue like this. We say injuries forge mental toughness and I think Kingsley is very mentally strong</p>

  <p><b>[Corentin Tolisso says France must continue to win despite the high-profile absences of <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a>, <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> and <a href="n-golo-kante.html">N’Golo Kante</a>]</b> <b>[<a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappé</a> and <a href="n-golo-kante.html">Kante</a>]</b> are very important players in our squad. We cannot wait for them to come back, but whether they are present or not, the France team has to win. I think that with or without them we would have won anyway<br /><br /><b>[asked if having to pick up greater defensive responsibilities was difficult alongside <a href="blaise-matuidi.html">Matuidi</a>, Tolisso admitted some adjustment is needed but that he gets on well with the <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> man]</b> I got on well with Blaise. We had already played together before. It’s easy to play with a talented player like <a href="blaise-matuidi.html">Blaise Matuidi</a>. At <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, we play more often two 8s with a 6 back. Being deeper is not a problem. These are two different styles of play where I simply need to adapt</p>
