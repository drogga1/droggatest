  <p><b>[Tolisso has perhaps been Lyon’s outstanding player this season]</b> I didn’t think I was ready to leave and discover something else. I know that staying was a very good decision and I had spoken to the staff and my family. This year, we’ll see what I happens, who wants me, and I’ll do the same - I’ll speak to those close to me and I’ll take the best decision.</p>

  <p><b>[A departure from Lyon, where he has played since he was 13, having been born less than 30 miles away, is not entirely guaranteed]</b> I want to continue to improve, and I’ll see what happens, whether that’s with Lyon or not. My principle aim is to go to the World Cup with France, and for that I have to be in the best condition possible. If I am to stay, it will be because I’ve decided that this will be the best choice for me to go to the World Cup.</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich midfielder Corentin Tolisso has claimed that international team-mate Ousmane Dembele has never been late on France duty]</b> I have not seen any lateness <b>[from Dembele]</b> while with the French team. Ousmane has extraordinary potential, I have been able to see him every day in training, in everyday life and in the group, he is someone who is appreciated by everyone and has an overflowing humour. He is young, he is 21 years old.<br /><br /><b>[Tolisso also commented on his side’s progress in Europe’s elite club competitions]</b> We are happy, we had to finish first. The match at Ajax was very, very difficult but we had to answer this<br /><br />I would prefer a Lyon-Bayern in the quarter-finals because maybe I’ll be able to play.<br /><br /><b>[Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund by nine points, sitting in third place]</b> It’s not a crisis. Sure it was complicated at one point, when you’re Bayern Munich you’re not allowed to make two draws in a row but it has been going better for a few weeks. We are winning our matches, we have to continue like this and we will come back little by little and we will go and get this Bundesliga title</p>

  <p><b>[Corentin Tolisso says his road back from knee surgery in the last year hardened him and helped him grow mentally]</b> I think it made me grow mentally, it hardened me. I knew that I had to work hard to get back to the top level. I have to continue like this and find my true level before my injury. It depends only on me. I have to give myself a little time. With <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, I worked a lot too. I made good preparations. It’s up to me to continue like this. Today, I managed to return to the France team. It’s up to me to prove with <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> to return again. But it was very emotional. I was very, very proud to be here yesterday<br /><br /><b>[Tolisso praised <a href="kingsley-coman.html">Kingsley Coman</a> for his own mental toughness as he has overcame injury to get into fine form]</b> I think it was complicated for Kingsley. I know it’s been difficult, so I’m not going to talk to him about his absence at the World Cup. He is in great shape. What he has been doing since the beginning of the season is exceptional and I hope it will continue like this. We say injuries forge mental toughness and I think Kingsley is very mentally strong</p>

  <p><b>[Corentin Tolisso says France must continue to win despite the high-profile absences of <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a>, <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> and <a href="n-golo-kante.html">N’Golo Kante</a>]</b> <b>[<a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappé</a> and <a href="n-golo-kante.html">Kante</a>]</b> are very important players in our squad. We cannot wait for them to come back, but whether they are present or not, the France team has to win. I think that with or without them we would have won anyway<br /><br /><b>[asked if having to pick up greater defensive responsibilities was difficult alongside <a href="blaise-matuidi.html">Matuidi</a>, Tolisso admitted some adjustment is needed but that he gets on well with the <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> man]</b> I got on well with Blaise. We had already played together before. It’s easy to play with a talented player like <a href="blaise-matuidi.html">Blaise Matuidi</a>. At <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, we play more often two 8s with a 6 back. Being deeper is not a problem. These are two different styles of play where I simply need to adapt</p>
