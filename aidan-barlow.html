  <p><b>[Aidan Barlow - Man Utd’s hidden gem who could become their greatest treasure]</b> I just want to push on. It’s my second year and I must become a leader in the team, pushing to break into the under-23s team. I have been around it before and got a few minutes away to Chelsea last year, which was good experience.</p>

  <p><b>[Aidan Barlow, who has played with <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a> since the age of nine, describes him]</b> It is so natural what he does. It is like he is born to do it, and has been like that since he was nine. He has never changed; two-footed since he was young. Him being in the first team so young was never in doubt. He is a top lad. He is funny, he is a real character, but he can be quiet as well. He is a humble guy. Seeing him doing so well serves as an inspiration to us all</p>
