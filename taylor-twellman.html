  <p><b>[Taylor Twellman scored 100 MLS goals quicker than anyone else, but his 96th came at the expense of a concussion which would ultimately end his career]</b> I got concussion. A couple of team-mates looked at me and said: ‘What are you doing?’ and I was like: ‘I scored’. That’s when double vision and that kind of thing started to creep into my life.<br /><br />I spent two years of my life diligently trying to get rid of the symptoms, trying to figure out a way to continue my career. That’s when I had to walk away. I still have some symptoms. It’s hard to go through it. Everyday life wasn’t easy. Symptoms of post-concussion, I had them all but it varied. I was extremely limited in my life, not just my career. Working out is limited but going out and doing normal things that people take for granted, that was limited<br /><br />If we don’t think of head injuries and concussions as part of the game at the highest level, let alone the lowest level, then what are we doing? It’s completely ignorant and it’s actually putting players at harm. It makes no sense<br /><br />Christoph Kramer is the perfect example. You are putting a player’s life - not career - in danger. It’s not the first one; it’s what you do after you get a concussion<br /><br />What people need to realise is that you don’t need to be knocked out, you don’t need one awful blow, you can actually have those little blows and that’s why that discussion is to be had. Too often people think of boxing with people getting knocked out as the ugly sport, but it’s actually not just that. It’s also that the repetitive hitting of the head and collisions has more of an impact<br /><br />Way too often - particularly in the Premier League - I am watching games and asking why the manager is part of the decision. He should not be part of that decision, he should never be part of that decision and until our medical staff are properly equipped to make these decisions then you’re always going to have the issue. When an athlete is concussed they can’t properly assess themselves. One, you don’t know where you are, you don’t have your bearings. And two, you have so much adrenaline running in your body you can’t make an educated decision. If we have independent doctors at the professional level with the right to pull someone out due to a head injury then that sub doesn’t count and that player is not allowed to play for the next seven days. Will it be 100 percent proof? No, because they’ll take out a player who actually didn’t get a concussion<br /><br />Unfortunately I feel like it’s going to have to come to that before FIFA gets its head out of the sand and actually makes a real, proactive, educated decision<br /><br />So much has been made of banning headers for kids at a young age, but that’s being proactive. The game can still be played to a certain level without having it. You can teach heading properly with soft balls and underhanded throws and you can teach the technique so the neck muscles become strong. If the young players do make it to the elite level they can use that. What we don’t know yet if it’s heading the ball, if it’s collisions but it’s the act of heading <b>[that causes the damage]</b>. So whatever it is - eliminate that and give our kids the best opportunity to continue to play. I’m not sure we need to eliminate heading at the professional level because those are grown adults and they choose what they want. What we can’t honestly say is that an eight-year-old honestly knows the repercussions of potentially having multiple concussions and yet, as parents, as coaches, as adults we’re putting those kids in harm’s way. If our mentality is ‘well history shows us’ then we would all still be smoking cigarettes. We evolved over cigarettes and now - all of a sudden - if we evolve over head injuries, the pushback makes no sense to me. I don’t want to get rid of sports, I’m just saying evolve, change it.</p>

  <p><b>[Taylor Twellman praised the performances put in by Stars and Stripes youngster <a href="josh-sargent.html">Josh Sargent</a> at the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> U-20 World Cup]</b> I just think the composure in the final third, his ability to play with his back to goal, he’s scored with his right foot, left foot, scored with his head, he looks to me to be the complete player at this stage of his career. Only two games in, three goals. Not a bad start</p>

  <p><b>[Former U.S. national team striker Taylor Twellman has sounded off on the Americans’ stunning elimination from World Cup qualifying]</b> Every single one of those players? Nightmares for the rest of their lives because this is an utter embarrassment. With the amount of money that is in Major League Soccer and in this sport, you can’t get a draw, a tie against Trinidad? You don’t deserve to go to the World Cup, plain and simple.<br /><br />If this failure does not wake up everyone from U.S. Soccer to Major League Soccer, from ‘pay to play’ to broadcasters, to everything, then we’re all insane because the definition of insanity is doing the exact same thing knowing the result. If we don’t change, and I mean ‘we’ - everyone in U.S. Soccer - then what’s the point? Because that should have never happened with the billion dollars-plus that is going into U.S. Soccer and youth development<br /><br />The discussion after Brazil <b>[2014]</b> was, ‘Can we beat the Colombias and the Belgiums and the Argentinas of the world’. Are you kidding me? We can’t beat Trinidad on a field that’s too wet and too heavy? What are we doing?</p>

  <p><b>[Poised Michael Parkhurst has elusive MLS Cup title within reach]</b> He was always in the right spot at the right time defending. So, whether or not I physically could overpower him, could find a half a yard or whatever, he was always there. He was never really under pressure and he never gave you the impression he was under pressure. His demeanor, the way he carried himself his rookie year, is the same way he carries himself today.</p>

  <p><b>[Taylor Twellman had his career cut short due to the effects of repeated concussive blows during his playing days in MLS]</b> You got people slapping his face and splashing him with water. I thought I was watching a coloured video from 1948. It was one of the most barbaric things I’d ever seen. In 2014 I was flabbergasted. In 2018 I was sick. What is the point of having research and science and evidence if you’re just going to turn a blind eye? That’s ultimately what FIFA has done.<br /><br />As much criticism as the NFL and the NHL get in the United States, and rightfully so, they have brought more attention to it than FIFA ever has. There’s going to be research that comes out continuously, that’s going to change certain things. At least be proactive and not reactive. The sad thing is FIFA is not even reactive.<br /><br /><b>[SyncThink’s EYE-SYNC device uses virtual reality to conduct an ocular movement assessment on a person who may have suffered a concussive blow]</b> I’ve spoken to 30 or so athletes that have used this technology on the side line in an NFL game or a soccer game, and they all spoke very highly of it. When you look at the sport of soccer, which exponentially can change and give us data, it can only move the meter on how to really rehabilitate head injuries.<br /><br />Ultimately, that’s where the conversation needs to go. Often, we talk about prevention but concussions aren’t going anywhere. It’s what are you going to do when you get one. How do you treat it? I honestly believe that this EYE-SYNC technology is going to help us get to that point a little bit faster than the way we are going right now<br /><br />I run a foundation that over the last six or seven years has spoken to tens of thousands of athletes. Regarding concussions and post-concussion symptoms, all of us has a common denominator, there is something off with our vision. There is something off with our eye tracking<br /><br />For me the biggest issue in football is that you only have three subs. Until FIFA really addresses it and actually is proactive about the situation you are going to have to find a way to help all these medical professionals find answers.<br /><br />The problem with the injury is so many decisions are made which are subjective. This is an objective measurement. I tell people all the time, if you hurt your knee you get an MRI. This is a thermometer, so to speak, for your brain. The more medical professionals I’ve put this in front of, I haven’t heard anything negative from it yet.<br /><br />It shows you something is off here. We have to take you out of the game. The problem right now when it’s subjective and an athlete is concussed, he or she doesn’t really know what they are doing or what they are saying.<br /><br />Because they also have adrenaline running through their body and they are not making an educated decision, thus all the pressure is on the medical professional, but that’s still subjective. When you provide an objective measurement of something, it says to that athlete, and what I hear from all the athletes who have used the product in real time, it gave them objectivity. That’s what this needs to get to, and that’s where it needs to evolve<br /><br />I’ve probably been approached by 100 or so companies to represent them but this is the first time I will be on the advisory board for something involving concussions. I think the technology speaks for itself<br /><br />The NFL medical professionals and their board have seen it and are excited about it. The Golden State Warriors are actually using the product right now. There are so many things you can measure through the eyes, fatigue is one of those, they’ve implemented it. It’s a game changer<br /><br />It’s going to take someone dying on the field for FIFA to actually do something. Quite honestly, I’m not sure they’d even do something on that. The protocol is one thing. But the paper it’s written on is worth more than the protocol if you do nothing about that protocol. That is the biggest discussion that goes on in the world of soccer. If you’re finding instances all the time on the protocol not being followed - especially in the World Cup tournament - then what’s the point?<br /><br />If you had a head injury substitution rule, then you don’t need the independent doctor. You can take all that pressure away from the manager. This isn’t a substitute, this is an add on. It’s in order to enhance that medical professional’s diagnosis. That athletic trainer knows that player better than any device. It’s a necessary add on. It’s a very quick way to assess eye movement and that ocular movement of traumatic brain injury<br /><br />The awareness is finally hitting England. Alan Shearer did a wonderful documentary and he brought awareness to it. This tells me players have questions and they want answers. They are going to take matters into their hands to find those answers. No matter what the test is, the players can drive this motive, of finding answers, of changing the sport and evolving. You can evolve and still keep the sport. Right now, with the way the injury is handled within the sport, the evolution is at a snail’s pace and it should be a little bit faster</p>
