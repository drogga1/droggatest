  <p><b>[Taylor Twellman praised the performances put in by Stars and Stripes youngster <a href="josh-sargent.html">Josh Sargent</a> at the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> U-20 World Cup]</b> I just think the composure in the final third, his ability to play with his back to goal, he’s scored with his right foot, left foot, scored with his head, he looks to me to be the complete player at this stage of his career. Only two games in, three goals. Not a bad start</p>

  <p><b>[Poised Michael Parkhurst has elusive MLS Cup title within reach]</b> He was always in the right spot at the right time defending. So, whether or not I physically could overpower him, could find a half a yard or whatever, he was always there. He was never really under pressure and he never gave you the impression he was under pressure. His demeanor, the way he carried himself his rookie year, is the same way he carries himself today.</p>

  <p><b>[What is football’s concussion protocol?]</b> I’ve spoken to 30 or so athletes that have used this technology on the sideline in an NFL game or a soccer game, and they all spoke very highly of it<br /><br />For me the biggest issue in football is that you only have three subs. Until FIFA really addresses it and actually is proactive about the situation you are going to have to find a way to help all these medical professionals find answers<br /><br />It’s going to take someone dying on the field for FIFA to actually do something. Quite honestly, I’m not sure they’d even do something on that. The protocol is one thing. But the paper it’s written on is worth more than the protocol if you do nothing about that protocol. That is the biggest discussion that goes on in the world of soccer. If you’re finding instances all the time on the protocol not being followed - especially in the World Cup tournament - then what’s the point?</p>
