  <p><b>[Demi Stokes: Reflecting on the issue of racism in sport and society]</b> It’s always been there, it’s not like it just cropped up. We’re waking up to it and people are realising there is actually a problem. The more people speak about it, the more we can try and solve it. It’s about having difficult conversations and challenging people. We all need to be better and we all need to hold ourselves accountable. It’s a worldwide issue, it’s happening everywhere. Until we address the problem as a whole, we can’t just address it in football. Racism is racism wherever it happens. In the women’s game, there are not many black players. We can be better at giving young black girls an opportunity and it starts from grassroots. There are many different avenues we can take<br /><br /><b>[Stokes praised <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> for continuing to take the knee at the start of each game]</b> It’s good that <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> are doing that, all these little nuggets will help but it’s not going to change unless we keep the ball rolling. It’s about keeping that momentum and keep challenging. We don’t want it to be good and then just go<br /><br /><b>[Training return like ‘first day at school’]</b> It felt like the first day back at school when you get all your uniform ready. I had my bag ready and all my kit laid out. It was like being a little kid again. It almost gives you your identity back. I’ve always said you have to embrace change. Gaz <b>[Taylor]</b> has come in and we can learn from him and he can learn from us. It’s what the team needed. I think he’ll push us and we can push him</p>
