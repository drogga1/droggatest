  <p><b>[Juventus talks over Brazil starlet Kaio Jorge confirmed by Santos chief]</b> The market hasn’t stopped even a second. I receive calls normally. Football has stopped but the negotiations are still ongoing. It is not a secret that there is interest, but I don’t want to be caught off guard. If the right offers do not arrive within a deadline that we will establish, we will keep him until the end of the season. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> asked about him, but made no formal offer. I told them his release clause is €75m, but we are open to negotiation. We were discussing closer to €30m (£28m/$32m), but not just with <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>. Two other Italian teams are very active as well as a French one. However, since no news has come out in the press, I cannot reveal the names.<br /><br />Inter asked me for <a href="yeferson-soteldo.html">Soteldo</a>, specifically (director of sport Piero) <a href="piero-ausilio.html">Ausilio</a> himself, but he stopped when I requested €35m (€32/$38m). <a href="yeferson-soteldo.html">Soteldo</a> is a young player who has sensational skills, he is a player who decides games. All the big teams in Brazil asked me, <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> teams like <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> want him and he has many offers from Spain. Despite the disappointment we had with the story of <a href="gabriel-barbosa.html">Gabigol</a>, we wanted to give preferential treatment to Piero and made a counter offer of €20-25m. But we have not heard back from him. As for Lucas Verissimo, the defender had practically been sold to <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a> for €10m, a very low sum considering we wanted at least €12m. Then our coach at the time (Jorge Sampaoli) begged us not to sell him, so we had to withdraw him from the market. Verissimo still has a lot of offers, but the problem is that despite his name, he doesn’t have Italian citizenship. <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> also tried to take him on loan in January, but we were clear, he is only available on a permanent transfer</p>

  <p><b>[Santos president José Carlos Peres says the São Paulo native would have been happy to remain in his home city at time]</b> We caught <a href="gabriel-barbosa.html">Gabriel Barbosa</a> at the bottom of the well, after just playing on Inter’s bench, he was on loan to <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a>. He had already devalued, and the player had morale under his heels. We put it on and made it feel like home. He played a lot and scored many goals. He wanted to stay here: I called Inter and offered Lucas Veríssimo another R$4 million, but they preferred to give <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a> R$20 million in installments. A pity</p>
