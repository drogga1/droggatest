<blockquote>
  <p>[Andrea Ranocchia’s transition from Serie A to the Premier League has not been without problems] I do struggle with the language and driving on the wrong side of the road was a problem - on the first day alone I went into the wrong way down two crossings. I’ve already scraped the rims on my car wheels on the pavements! I’ve been here for a month and a half, but I am yet to see the sun. It rains practically every day. I really miss pasta, too. The first day I arrived in the locker room, they forced me to stand on a chair and sing a song. I had no idea what to sing, so I started with the Italian national anthem!<br /><br />I chose to challenge myself by accepting the proposal from Hull City, also to try for a return to the national team, but at this moment I am above all focused on living this experience to the max. Marco Silva called me to propose a project that I immediately liked, plus many of my Inter teammates spoke well of the Premier League. I can now say they were right. It is fun, although there are hardly any tactics at work here. It’s mainly instinct and physical strength. The players are so strong and fast, but I am settling in well, mainly because the Italian tactical school is the best in the world, so I’m prepared for anything</p>
