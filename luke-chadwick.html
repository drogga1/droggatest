<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Ex-Man Utd youngster Luke Chadwick says mockery of his looks affected his mental health and his career]</b> You get abuse as a footballer. It’s an issue when it was all people would talk about. It was always about my appearance and the way I looked. I didn’t realise it at the time but looking back it affected me more in terms of being really anxious. I didn’t like talking to people. I was quite a shy boy at the time anyway, so I wouldn’t go tell people what I was feeling. So it was a difficult time. It affected the way I lived my life off the pitch - not so much on it - but certainly off it. It was quite childish things. Spots on my face, teeth sticking out, that sort of thing. I think it was more the repetition of being said over and over again more than one specific thing. In the end it lowers your self-esteem and all I’m known for, or spoken about, is the way that I looked, which is definitely not right.<br /><br />Just being anxious, I wouldn’t want to go out. People knew who I was because I played for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> and I always assumed that they’d be saying horrible things about me. Potentially they weren’t all the time. But being a quiet, shy, nervous boy anyway, it intensified that. It stunted my growth as a person at the time to move forward. Getting past that, it’s given me more resilience, but at the time it probably wasn’t right for a young boy of 19 or 20, even though I’m an adult, to have to deal with that. I never would have asked for help because of the type of person I was. It was swept under the carpet. Looking back, I should have opened up</p>
