  <p><b>[Fernando Clavijo on his time in charge of Haiti]</b> In the year I was coach, I only spent seven days in Haiti because it was not a place you could go. I went to watch one game to look at players and boom, guns were being fired. I took the team to Miami for three months, I took the team to Brazil for two months, I took the team to my hometown in Uruguay. On those trips it was friends of mine who provided everything free for the players - kits, boots, food - they provided everything</p>

  <p><b>[FC Dallas dominates draft, LAFC didn’t rely on combine and more]</b> There’s a lot of <b>[TAM]</b> money and people don’t know what to do with it. They were throwing money all over the place. I knew there was going to be a lot of dealing, and that this might set up some new prices by teams trying to move up. At the end of the day, i think the teams that really did the work were the ones who drafted well.</p>

  <p><b>[FC Dallas has announced the acquisition of midfielder Santiago Mosquera as a young designated player. The 23-year-old joins from Colombian first division side Millonarios FC]</b> Mosquera has all the things we were looking for this offseason. He plays specifically how Oscar <b>[Pareja]</b> would like to play. It was not an easy signing because he is a very high-quality player. He will make us better, for sure. He allows us to open up space on the field for Mauro <b>[Diaz]</b> and have a strong offensive lineup.</p>
