<blockquote>
  <p>How did student protests - started five days ago by a skinny 17-year-old with a mobile phone - morph into one of the greatest mass demonstration the megacity has ever seen? After deploying riot police, tear gas and branding the protests ‘illegal’ earlier this week, Beijing’s leaders are mulling over how to control the tens of thousands of people that have blocked streets and closed public transport - demanding the right to free and fair elections in 2017<br /><br />To make things worse, the city is paralysed during Golden Week, the busiest time of the year for mainland Chinese to travel to Hong Kong to shop while almost everyone is on holiday<br /><br />Monash University’s emeritus professor of Asian languages and studies Bruce Jacobs said there’s a range of possibilities for how the situation could play out, with a Tiananmen Square style massacre certainly not beyond the realms of possibility. He said the main difference between Hong Kong’s current situation and the 1989 massacre - where the government ordered a brutal crackdown on thousands of pro-democracy protesters - is that Hong Kong is run as a special administrative district, rather than under direct control of Beijing<br /><br />So far, protesters have ignored calls from Hong Kong’s chief executive Leung Chun-ying to go home and the atmosphere has swung from violent to festive with people singing and playing Cantonese pop in the streets. Student leader Joshua Wong, who was detained by police but released, said Hong Kong’s leader was the ‘only one’ who could end the protest and they would hold out ‘for the bargaining chip with Beijing’.<br /><br />Overnight, Britain’s deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg summoned China’s ambassador to express ‘dismay and alarm’ about Beijing’s plans to pre-approve pro-Beijing candidates in the upcoming election. US Secretary of State John Kerry is also set to meet Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to discuss the growing movement. However Prof Jacobs said the arrogance of China’s leadership means it’s unlikely to give much credence to what other countries say about what they see as their internal affairs.<br /><br />But not everyone agrees it will end badly. Earlier this week the Lowy Institute’s director of East Asia program Dr Merriden Varrall wrote there’s unlikely to be another Tiananmen Square type event as China is not the same place it was in 1989</p>
