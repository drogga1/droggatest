<blockquote>
  <p>[Mariano Rajoy would not welcome the 25-year-old at his favourite team] No I wouldn’t like to see Neymar in the white shirt of Madrid. People will focus on the three players they have up front, who are great players, but they have a brilliant squad with players like Angel Di María, Marco Verratti, Adrien Rabiot, and the Argentine lad - Giovani Lo Celso. We’ll be in for two very keenly-fought games between two clubs with the best squads in the world.<br /><br />Looking at it rationally, you might think that they’ll give us a beating, but anything can happen in these kinds of games. Let’s not forget that this is Real Madrid and that the Champions League is their competition - especially now that they are out of the running for La Liga and they’re out of the Copa del Rey. It’s more or less the same team as last season and we’re talking about the defending champions - the side which has won three of the last four Champions Leagues. I think we can eliminate PSG</p>
