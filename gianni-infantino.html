I want to be the president of all of you, of all 209 National Associations. I traveled through the globe and will continue to do this. I want to work with all of you together, with all of you in order to restore and rebuild a new era in <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>, a new era where we can put again football in the centre of the stage</p>

  <p><b>[FIFA president Infantino on coronavirus reform]</b> An assessment of the global economic impact is needed. It’s difficult right now, we don’t know when it will return to normal. But we look at the opportunities. We can perhaps reform world football by taking a step back. With different formats. Less tournaments, but more interesting. Maybe fewer teams, but more balanced. Less games, to protect the health of the players, but more competitive. It’s not science fiction, let’s talk about it. We quantify the damages, let’s see how we can cover them, we have to make sacrifices. The ones who managed their ‘company’ in a healthy way, will benefit – then we start again. Not from scratch, we are privileged. But let’s all save football together, from a crisis that risks being irreversible<br /><br />It makes me laugh. And what else? From what I see, others are already planning and organising tournaments around the world, outside the institutional structures, and without respect for how domestic, continental and world football is organised. In the future we must have a least 50 national sides that can win the World Cup, not just eight in Europe and two in South America. We need 50 clubs that can win the Club World Cup, not just five or six European ones. And 20 of these 50 will be European, which seems better than today’s five or six. But it’s not the right time to talk about this now.<br /><br />Health comes first, then everything else. For the managers, the rest means hoping for the best but also preparing for the worst. Without panicking, let’s say it clearly: we will play again when we can do it without putting anyone’s health at risk. Federations and leagues are ready to follow the recommendations of the governments and WHO <b>[World Health Organisation]</b>. I thank the doctors, nurses and all those who risk their lives to save others. They are heroes</p>

  <p><b>[FIFA President Gianni Infantino on coronavirus quarantine]</b> We need teamwork to combat the coronavirus. <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> has teamed up with WHO because health comes first. I call upon the football community worldwide to join us in supporting this campaign to pass the message even further. Some of the greatest players to have played the beautiful game have put their names to the campaign and are united in their desire to pass the message to kick out Covid-19</p>

  <p><b>[FIFA propose extending expiring contracts and ‘flexible’ transfer windows as result of coronavirus]</b> The Covid-19 pandemic has clearly changed all the factual circumstances around football for this season. So, <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>, together with the stakeholders, has come up with some practical ideas and proposals to tackle these new circumstances. Whilst this will not solve each and every problem, it should serve to bring a measure of stability and clarity to football for the foreseeable future. We hope that this collaborative effort, under the leadership of <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>, can provide a positive example of how football can come together and show unity, solidarity and a spirit of compromise in order to face the challenging times ahead - but before these times come, one thing must be clear to everyone, especially now: health comes first, well before football</p>

  <p><b>[FIFA president Gianni Infantino said it would be ‘more than irresponsible’ to restart competitions too early amid the coronavirus pandemic]</b> As our main priority, our principles, the ones we employ in our competitions and also we invite to everyone to follow, is health comes first. As much as I emphasise it, it is not enough. It’s not worth to put at risk any human life for any game, any competition, nor any league. Everyone should have this clear in their minds. It would be more than irresponsible to restart the competitions if the situation is not safe 100 per cent. If you must wait a bit more time, we must do it. It is better to wait a bit more than taking risks</p>

It is better to wait a bit more than taking risks<br /><br /><b>[FIFA is said to have a $2.7 billion cash reserve it is set to use to create an emergency fund and Infantino said the governing body was planning to help]</b> Thanks to the work we have been doing together in <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> during the last four years, we find ourselves in a very solid financial situation. <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> have a good reputation in the financial markets. It helps us to consolidate a solid base of important reserves, but our reserves are not <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>’s money, it is the money of football. So, when football is in need, we have to think about a solution to help. It is our responsibility. This is how I see it as president of <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>. As football has stopped in the whole world, we are all facing economic issues in different levels, from the base to professional football. Given this, we are already collaborating with you to asses the financial impact to prepare the right answer</p>

  <p><b>[FIFA to make early $150m payment ‘to help safeguard football’ amid coronavirus crisis]</b> The pandemic has caused unprecedented challenges for the entire football community and, as the world governing body, it is <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>’s duty to be there and support the ones that are facing acute needs. This starts by providing immediate financial assistance to our member associations, many of which are experiencing severe financial distress. This is the first step of a far-reaching financial relief plan we are developing to respond to the emergency across the whole football community. Together with our stakeholders, we are assessing the losses and we are working on the most appropriate and effective tools to implement the other stages of this relief plan<br /><br />I would like to thank the chairpersons of the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Development Committee, Shaikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, and the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Finance Committee, Alejandro Dominguez, for their commitment and urgent approval of these measures by their committees. <b>[the financial relief plan is]</b> possible thanks to the strong financial position that <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> has been able to consolidate over the past four years. The next stages of the plan are currently being finalised and will be communicated in due course.</p>

  <p><b>[FIFA and WHO launch campaign to help domestic violence victims amid coronavirus lockdown]</b> Together with the World Health Organization and the European Commission, we are asking the football community to raise awareness to this intolerable situation that threatens particularly women and children in their own home, a place where they should feel happy, safe and secure. We cannot stay silent on this issue that negatively affects so many people. Violence has no place in homes, just as it has no place in sports. Football has the power to relay important social messages, and through the #SafeHome campaign, we want to ensure that those people experiencing violence have access to the necessary support services they need</p>
