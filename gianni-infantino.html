  <p><b>[What the future of the World Cup will look like we will have to wait and see]</b> No matter what happens, 2022 will leave a lasting legacy because it is the first World Cup to be organised in the Middle East. It is the first time an Arab country will have hosted the tournament and this is important as we live in a time when we need to highlight respect and inclusion. It will also take place during a different time of the year which is something else that will make the event very unique.<br /><br />What the future of the World Cup will look like we will have to wait and see. We still don’t know if there will be one host or two hosts, so time will tell. However, we are very much looking forward to this World Cup because it will be something really special<br /><br />We know everything will be located very closely together and to have the furthest stadiums situated no more than 60 kilometres apart is quite something. Normally a World Cup city would only have matches every three or four days. In 2022 there will be games in a World Cup country the size of a city every day and people will enjoy this concept</p>

That is obvious.<br /><br />Mr. Trump is the president of the United States of America and as such of course <b>[I have]</b> huge respect for what he does. He’s in charge, together with his government, to take decisions that are best for his country. That’s why he has been elected.

We saw was an incredible football match, whatever the result would have been at the end. This shows that football is really a fantastic game. When you feel you have seen everything, something else comes along. It’s just amazing and incredible. We have to really be careful in the International Football Association Board if we want to touch the rules, because football is such an incredible game. In this case, I don’t know if it was a clear mistake or not. But in future, when there are clear mistakes, this will be corrected by the video assistant referee so we can make sure decisive matches are not decided by mistakes made in good faith by the referee.</p>

  <p><b>[FIFA president Gianni Infantino has branded Italy’s failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup as a beautiful blow]</b> A World Cup without Italy? The fact that Italy didn’t qualify for the World Cup was a beautiful blow for all of Italian football. They must work hard and find the strengths and resources needed to start over. In Italy, there’s passion, talent, preparation and structure, so everyone must start by putting aside their own interests and focus on those of Italian football in order to re-establish its tradition. The Azzurri shirt moves not only Italians but also football in general. That jersey deserves to remain one of the best. Now they have competent people working and if they need FIFA, we’re here to help. It’s important for the world of football that Italy are strong.<br /><br />It’ll be an absolutely spectacular World Cup, the most beautiful in history. I’ve been to Russia a lot lately and realised the Russian people want to show that theirs is a country that knows how to welcome fans from all over the world. One and a half million people will arrive: they’ll be able to do so without a visa, there will be free transport in the host cities and free access to museums thanks to the match tickets. The stadiums are beautiful and for the whole country, it’ll be a matter of national pride, showing that they can organise a beautiful competition. It’ll be a beautiful and exciting party and we want people to come to Russia</p>

If, as we all hope, they are reunited with their families in the coming days and their health allows them to travel, FIFA would be delighted to invite them to attend the 2018 World Cup final in Moscow as our guests.

  <p><b>[FIFA chief Gianni Infantino has responded to the furore over allegations that the organisation’s code of ethics has been compromised]</b> Corruption out of the regulations? That’s what hit me, too, and nobody noticed that the word even appears in the French version. You can write in big, bold letters: I’ll demand at the next congress that this word be reintroduced. Because we do not tolerate corruption in FIFA.<br /><br />Look, that’s also something that can be portrayed either way. Our goal at UEFA has always been to keep the clubs with us. So you negotiate and seek solutions - that was my job as Secretary General. The fact is, in the history of financial fair play, 30 violations have been detected. With all but one club there were agreements. Agreements and negotiations are expressly allowed. And then it was approved by an independent body of professionals. They could have refused or made changes. Fifty top people from clubs, lawyers, and so on looked at the cases - I mean, could I put something like that together in the back room? Impossible<br /><br />PSG and Man City to a Super League? No, I do not think so. I also cannot imagine the Bundesliga without Bayern Munich. I’ve been in football for 20 years and the idea of a Super League has been around many times. It’s natural to want to get the most out of it. That’s why we want to make a Club World Cup, which is better than the possible Super League; everything stays together and no one wants to split. We must prevent that because we believe that football must remain within its structures</p>

A game which already has a huge rivalry couldn’t be played. Football must always carry on, to not play a game is always a defeat<br /><br /><b>[Infantino noted these incidents have taken place across the world and are not limited to Argentina]</b> The decision for the 2030 World Cup will be taken in around four years and there is a lot of time to work. It’s not the only game in the world where this has happened…..I remember a derby in Zurich where the match had to be stopped because of violence in the stadium.

It is feasible, provided certain conditions are met. So, to be very clear, today we have a World Cup in Qatar of 32 teams, and this is great like this. However, since we decided in January 2017 that we should increase the number of teams participating in the World Cup from 32 to 48 - this will happen as of 2026 - and following a request received by the 10 South American associations last year, we are looking into the matter and seeing whether it is possible, whether it is feasible to anticipate this in 2022. If it is feasible, if it is possible, great. If it is not feasible, if it is not possible, great<br /><br />With an additional 16 teams, there will be greater expenditure of course, but also more income. And we are firmly convinced of the fact that, roughly speaking, the expenditure will be covered by the income. So we will be receiving more money and 16 more countries in the world will have the opportunity to participate in the biggest football event in the world</p>

This is really not acceptable. Racism has no place in football, just as it has no place in society. FIFA stands together with Prince Gouano, Kalidou Koulibaly, Raheem Sterling, Danny Rose and any other player, coach, fan or participant in a football match who has suffered from racism, whether at the highest professional level or in a school playground. Racism needs to end, full stop.<br /><br />We introduced the so-called ‘three-step procedure’ at our tournaments: a mechanism that allows referees to abandon a match in case of discriminatory incidents<br /><br />FIFA urges all member associations, leagues, clubs and disciplinary bodies to adopt the same procedure, as well as a zero-tolerance approach to incidents of racism in football, and to apply harsh sanctions for any such kind of behaviour. We will continue to be at the forefront of the fight against racism and we guarantee to all our member associations that they have our full support in taking up this challenge. We will not hesitate to do everything in our power to eradicate racism and any other form of discrimination, from football, at any level and anywhere in the world</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> president Infantino on coronavirus reform]</b> An assessment of the global economic impact is needed. It’s difficult right now, we don’t know when it will return to normal. But we look at the opportunities. We can perhaps reform world football by taking a step back. With different formats. Less tournaments, but more interesting. Maybe fewer teams, but more balanced. Less games, to protect the health of the players, but more competitive. It’s not science fiction, let’s talk about it. We quantify the damages, let’s see how we can cover them, we have to make sacrifices. The ones who managed their ‘company’ in a healthy way, will benefit - then we start again. Not from scratch, we are privileged. But let’s all save football together, from a crisis that risks being irreversible<br /><br />It makes me laugh. And what else? From what I see, others are already planning and organising tournaments around the world, outside the institutional structures, and without respect for how domestic, continental and world football is organised. In the future we must have a least 50 national sides that can win the World Cup, not just eight in Europe and two in South America. We need 50 clubs that can win the Club World Cup, not just five or six European ones. And 20 of these 50 will be European, which seems better than today’s five or six. But it’s not the right time to talk about this now.<br /><br />Health comes first, then everything else. For the managers, the rest means hoping for the best but also preparing for the worst. Without panicking, let’s say it clearly: we will play again when we can do it without putting anyone’s health at risk. Federations and leagues are ready to follow the recommendations of the governments and WHO <b>[World Health Organisation]</b>. I thank the doctors, nurses and all those who risk their lives to save others. They are heroes</p>
