  <p><b>[Austria assistant manager Andreas Herzog eloquently respond about german s<strong>* their pants]&lt;/b&gt; They can shove that up their a</strong>*. When people first started talking about this tournament there were a lot of jokes about us and some of the people who were laughing even said we should not be taking part. Now it is all the more satisfying to show that we have a real chance of advancing beyond our group - and doing so with a final match against our arch-rivals.</b></p>

  <p><b>[Austria team manager Andreas Herzog has revealed the disappointment amongst the squad following their elimination from Euro 2008]</b> We’ve never had a situation like this before. The match was a bit strange, it was a normal game from the start but the second half wasn’t easy for us or for Germany - the coaches were gone and this caused some unrest. We challenged Germany but unfortunately we weren’t as dangerous as we’d have liked to be. We have a very young squad, they’re all disappointed in the dressing room of course, but we’ve worked hard for the last two years and have been able to show that people can play good football in Austria</p>

  <p><b>[Former Werder Bremen midfielder Andreas Herzog has voiced his belief that <a href="marko-arnautovic.html">Marko Arnautovic</a> can score up to 15 goals for the Weserstadion outfit this season]</b> Marko is now in his third year at Werder, he can score 15 goals this season. But he should not have so much pressure on him. He needs to stay calm. The fans cannot expect him to perform any miracles on his own. Last year, he showed some positive things, then came his red card against Hannover. After that he was injured. He must now show his true potential. Werder needs him after <a href="claudio-pizarro.html">Pizarro</a>’s departure<br /><br /><b>[After Werder Bremen finished in ninth position in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> last season, Herzog thinks that the time has come for a ‘new beginning at the club’]</b> With <a href="marko-arnautovic.html">Arnautovic</a> and Eljero Elia, that is possible. I hope it goes well. Nils Petersen may not have played that much at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, but he scored a lot of goals in the club’s B team. I would like to see Werder achieve great things. I hope that they can succeed. Qualifying for the Champions League may not be possible, but they should be able to finish in the European qualification zone<br /><br /><b>[Herzog is now working as an assistant to <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Jurgen Klinsmann</a> in the United States national team]</b> This is an interesting task, and it is fun to work with <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Klinsmann</a>. This is a new challenge. I cannot say that this is the best US team in history because I do not know much about the previous team. But we do not only want to qualify for the World Cup, we want to see how far we can go there</p>

  <p><b>[In December 2011, <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Klinsmann</a> placed a call through to former <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> teammate Andreas Herzog, the coach of the U-21 Austria team]</b> I had a good group but at this moment we lost one game. I was a little bit disappointed because the qualification was nearly over. I said, ‘Yeah, Jurgen.’<br /><br />Because of the language it’s easier for <b>[Vasquez]</b> to talk with the players. For me it’s easier to talk with a little group, from face to face, about the tactical thing.</p>

  <p><b>[The USA assistant believes that the mix of <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> and <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> players makes <a href="joachim-low.html">Joachim Low</a>’s side a formidable force ahead of the World Cup final]</b> They have up to seven players from <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> which leads to a team who very well understands each other. t is more like a club team. And they have the perfect age. Almost no very young players, and everybody already has lots of experience and has been successful in the Champions League. <a href="joachim-low.html">Joachim Low</a> managed to merge the style of <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> and <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. If they can put that on the pitch, their quality is oppressive. They don’t always play magical football, this depends on the opponent. Against well-organised and aggressive teams like Algeria or France they were in trouble. Brazil, on the other hand, could not cope with the huge pressure and Germany exploited it with no mercy. What I like most about them is their game in possession. They don’t fritter away anymore but are always determined. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and Spain were totally focused on passing, but they forgot where the goal was. You could not see this with the Germans<br /><br /><b>[Herzog also hailed the impact of <a href="toni-kroos.html">Toni Kroos</a>]</b> <a href="toni-kroos.html">Toni Kroos</a> is having an extraordinary tournament. His passing is amazing, he orchestrates the midfield. Every big club, especially <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> is interested in signing him and this pushes him. But it is hard to pick one player out. <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Manuel Neuer</a> is like a wall, he gives the other players safety.<br /><br /><b>[Herzog admitted that <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> could harm German chances]</b> Argentina’s tactics are completely focused on him. That is normal. But you can see he does not have that absolute desire to run. Some years ago when <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> was playing this great attacking pressing, he did it, too. Back then he was nearly invincible. He still can win matches on his own. You should not let your team be too dependent on him. But him and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> have been better. That is the benchmark he set. And I don’t like him at this tournament</p>
