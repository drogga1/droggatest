  <p><b>[Former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> player Lilian Thuram has criticised <a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Leonardo Bonucci</a>’s shameful comments and the lack of action from the authorities. <a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Bonucci</a>’s comments which said that <a href="moise-kean.html">Moise Kean</a> was 50-50 to blame for the racism he received from the <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> fans earlier in the week. Thuram believes that <a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Bonucci</a>’s reaction was shameful]</b> When you think about it, Kean’s own teammate says he deserves these cries of monkey, and that the fans can continue! <a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Bonucci</a>’s reaction is as violent as the monkey chants. <a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Bonucci</a> is not stupid. <a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Bonucci</a>’s comments are just shameful. We must agree on racism<br /><br /><b>[Lilian Thuram then went on to criticise football’s governing bodies for their lack of action]</b> Did the referre stop the match? Has anything been done? We are in full hypocrisy. This has been going on for years. Everyone says we’ll stop the game next time and it does not happen. The observation is that the football authorities do not care. If it really disturbed them, the match would have been stopped, believe me.
The teams would have left the field and we would have found a solution</p>

  <p><b>[Lilian Thuram demands meaningful action after racist abuse of Inter striker Romelu Lukaku]</b> For how many years have there been such reactions after such events? In the end everyone thinks it’s something serious, but a solution has yet to be found. If we talk about it for many years, but nothing can be done, it means there is tremendous hypocrisy and there is no will to solve the problem<br /><br />Everyone says, ‘Let’s do something’, but nobody really does anything. And the racists believe they are right. In France, for example, the referees interrupt the games in the event of homophobia in the stands: to suspend the game and send the two teams to the changing room can educate people. In Italy I don’t remember any such strong positions<br /><br />We need to be aware that the world of football is not racist, but that there is racism in Italian, French, European and more generally in white culture. Whites have decided they are superior to blacks and that they can do anything with them. It is something that has been going on for centuries unfortunately. And to change a culture is not easy</p>

  <p><b>[France legend Lilian Thuram believes <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> stand a better chance of winning the Champions League than ever]</b> I’ve got the impression that this year, they are better armed than ever to win the Champions League. But you know that it’s always very, very complicated. I have the feeling that there’s greater solidity in the squad. And you win with solidity<br /><br /><b>[Thuram said before considering the frosty welcome <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> received from the <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> fans on his return to action]</b> He’s one of the greatest players in the world currently. I think for <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> and <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a>, it’s a very good thing that he’s stayed. He’s a very, very great player. He’s one of those footballers who deeply loves the game. He has the strength to respond on the pitch and in the end he will help <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> perform better</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and France star Lilian Thuram says he was highly disappointed with <a href="verona-fc.html">Hellas Verona</a>’s reaction to the racist abuse aimed at <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Mario Balotelli</a>, calling manager <a href="ivan-juric.html">Ivan Juric</a> a very dangerous person who should be suspended]</b> We have to tell people that there is history behind racism and it’s not true that it comes from ignorance. History proves that racist people genuinely believe in these ideals, much like with sexism. If someone believes in the inferiority of another race or gender, he is not stupid, he genuinely believes in this. It is also very dangerous to think of monkey noises as banter. It is not a normal thing to do. We need everyone to point that out, that this is unacceptable. This is why I say the Verona coach is a very dangerous person who should be suspended for what he said. He said that he didn’t hear anything wrong, that is the danger. When someone is attacked, others have to come to their aid, not expect the person under attack to defend himself. When all the players walk off the pitch together, that is when things will change quickly. Racism is violence<br /><br /><b>[Thuram says that people need to understand that racial abuse is a real-world problem that is much bigger than football]</b> This gentleman says such things because there is history behind it, he believes nationality derives from the colour of your skin. Racism is in the stadium, but what about society? Many say they are not racist, but do nothing for equality. The world of football must understand this is not a joke, it has real-world consequences. I’ve known racism before, during and after my playing career. What white player went to his fans and told them to stop it? Nobody. The only coach that I know who openly said he would walk off is <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a>. It is white players and coaches who must stand up and have the courage to say, enough is enough</p>

In my office, I don’t have many football pictures, but I have one of Munitis. I think it’s important to cultivate humility. Munitis taught me humility</p>
