  <p><b>[Ross Wilson Explains his decision to turn down a move to Ibrox in 2017]</b> The people at Rangers, there was contact of course we had some discussions, they were fantastic. I had great conversations with Andrew Dickson, Stewart Robertson, Graeme Park, Dave King - the conversations were all really, really good<br /><br />Ultimately everything they said was hugely ambitious, great plans for what they’re trying to do at the club. But ultimately it was just wasn’t the right time for me to leave England and come back to Scotland and definitely not leave <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> at the moment in time</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a> signs Rangers contract extension until 2024]</b> Since I joined the club, I have thoroughly enjoyed the working relationship with Steven and the rest of his team. I am pleased that we were able to make swift progress on the contract discussions, which demonstrate how committed to Rangers everyone here is. The professionalism, high standards and dedication that Steven and all of the coaching and support staff have given to make this club successful is evident both on and off the pitch and I look forward to continuing on that path together as we all continue to drive the club forward on all fronts</p>

  <p><b>[Rangers sign <a href="ianis-hagi.html">Ianis Hagi</a> on permanent deal from Genk]</b> We are delighted that <a href="ianis-hagi.html">Ianis</a> has chosen to continue his career at Rangers. I have had numerous conversations with <a href="ianis-hagi.html">Ianis</a> and his representatives and he made it clear that continuing with Rangers was his absolute focus. He is not only a huge talent but also a top young professional who is determined to be successful. We are sure our investment in him will be an effective one as we believe in his ability now whilst also being excited that at 21 years old there is significantly more development to come from him. When <a href="ianis-hagi.html">Ianis</a> arrived in January we quickly developed a strong relationship with him and I know how much Steven and the coaches enjoy working with him every day</p>
