<blockquote>
  <p><a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappé</a> and <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Thomas Tuchel</a> have been working together for 15 months since the striker arrived from Monaco. Since then, reports of a relationship that has never truly got off the ground have emerged. It could be a determining factor in a potential <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappé</a> departure from Paris with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> making the youngster a priority in 2020<br /><br />After scoring a hat-trick against Brugge last Tuesday, he said: ‘I wanted to show how diffiucult it is to do without me’. It was a clear message to <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a>, who said days before that he would hate to have to do without the player like Mbappe<br /><br /><a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a> has always made it clear in press conferences that the key player is <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>. He said it early in his time at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> and keeps thinking so regardless of his failed attempt to manufacture a move to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> last summer. <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappé</a> wants to take on more responsibility. He said back in May that he would love to assume more of the burden and would do so ‘in Paris or somewhere else with a new project’, leaving the door open for a possible move away from the French club<br /><br /><a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappé</a> was punished for arriving late to a team meeting ahead of the Marseille game last year. That did not sit well with the player’s inner circle although <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a> did say that he needed to ‘protect the player and keep the big focus off his in order to develop to the maximum’</p>
