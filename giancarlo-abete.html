  <p><b>[Matches at Euro 2016 could be played behind closed doors due to the threat of terror attacks]</b> Euro 2016 is the kind of event we can’t delay or postpone. We can’t exclude the possibility of playing behind closed doors as we cannot exclude terrorism</p>

  <p><b>[Uefa says no plans to play Euro 2016 games behind closed doors]</b> Euro 2016 is the kind of event we can’t delay or postpone. We can’t exclude the possibility of playing behind closed doors as we cannot exclude terrorism. If we talked about potentially cancellable games such as a friendly or a competitive match that could be moved to another date, obviously this would not be the case.<br /><br />We are talking about events which have already had a negative impact on the Euros because the perception of risk is already there and there is less excitement about getting involved from those who wanted to join in a joyous mood. But we are talking about games which are staged for June, whereas today we are going through a very urgent emergency</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[French sports official vows Euro 2016 will go ahead]</b> I would like to remind you what the Prime Minister said yesterday. We shouldn’t back down, we shouldn’t surrender against people who have a different philosophy to ours, which is death. They want to attack our way of life. This is the reason why - while we respect the grief of all of the victims of the attacks - we must maintain all public events, including the Euros. Not organising the Euros would be to nurture those people, those cowards, those barbarians. We must show them that we are stronger than that.<br /><br />We decided to maintain the Euros with the organiser of the competition, Uefa, and the organisation committee of Euro 2016. Security is the priority of the organisation of the Euros. We should remember that a lot of stadiums, including Stade Velodrome, have got some major improvements. All CCTV has been upgraded and modernised with the latest technology. Inside the stadium, security will be at the maximum thanks to CCTV and the security guards. Outside the stadium, it will be the same.</p>
