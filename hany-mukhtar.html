  <p><b>[Nashville SC’s roster continues to take shape, with the 2020 <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> expansion franchise landing Brondby’s Hany Mukhtar as its first designated player]</b> I had a great feeling when I was talking with the club. I had the feeling it was the right step for me in my life. I think we can grow together, that’s the nice thing. They want to build something great and I’m not finished in my career. I want to develop as well. It fits perfect<br /><br />The league is growing a lot. The quality of the game is getting better and better, <b>[and]</b> I think I can develop in this league. That’s why I chose to come to America. They said I’d be a key player; that’s important for a player to get the feeling to be important. Everybody in life wants to be important in their job. That’s great. I want to give them something back. I’ll give my best on the pitch for sure<br /><br /><b>[The former German youth international also felt the time was right to leave his current club, having seen the manager who brought him in let go]</b> The coach who brought me to Brondby, (Alexander Zorniger), he got sacked last year. That was a key point for my decision. We had a special relationship and he brought me to the club. The new coach is great as well, but it’s always different when a specific coach wanted you and brought you to the club. He really wanted me to stay at Brondby, plus I had the feeling it could be good if I stayed one more year. They really needed me, they sold some players. They decided I had to stay and I was fine with that situation</p>

  <p><b>[Hany Mukhtar says It’s an honour to be Nashville’s first designated player]</b> No, it’s an honour for me to be the first designated player in the club’s history. The project totally convinced me. Something big is supposed to emerge here and in the first home game with 60,000 spectators, it was seen that <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> football would be accepted in Nashville. Unfortunately, our start with two defeats was not so great, although we actually dominated both games<br /><br />It is different whether you come to <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> Lisbon as an 18-year-old perspective player without many appearances from <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha</a> BSC, or as a regular player and playmaker with a lot of experience from Brondby Copenhagen to an ambitious team like here in Nashville. All in all, getting used to it was easy anyway, because everyone in the team is new and the situation is the same for everyone<br /><br />We are less than five minutes in the cabin and suddenly a horde of journalists is let in. Some players just stood around in their underpants, but some of them were already used to it. That’s how it works in the US. I always shower a little longer now. I’m also protected a bit by our media department. Our captain <a href="dax-mccarty.html">Dax McCarty</a> mostly takes over the main part</p>
