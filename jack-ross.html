<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Sunderland vs Newcastle U23]</b> That is a consequence of us having suffered relegations, that is the soreness when a fixture like this comes around. The drive for me is to take the club back into these fixtures properly. This isn’t a derby that is seen as the one that everybody would want it to be. It gives us the extra motivation that I will be able to manage Sunderland in a league game against Newcastle, ideally in the top league. Genuinely for me this is just another Checkatrade Trophy match. It falls in between two really busy league games. Players have treated every Checkatrade Trophy game in the same way and this will be no different.</p>

  <p><b>[Charlton Athletic vs Sunderland. Jack Ross has drawn his strength from the example set millennia before, by military tacticians of ancient times]</b> I am fascinated with leadership and have been for a number of years. <b>[I’ve been]</b> going back to some of the Roman generals and how they studied Alexander the Great. For me it is about knowing everything I do this week is done properly and thoroughly. Once I feel I have achieved that, the closer the game comes you get caught up in the emotion but you also have to understand that taking your team to Wembley in that kind of atmosphere and with that crowd you can’t affect that much from the sideline because nobody can hear you</p>
