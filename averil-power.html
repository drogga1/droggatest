<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t think anyone who was in college with Leo would be surprised at how well he has done since. His energy, his determination, and his straight-talking manner made him stand out even back then. He had the energy to do a tough medicine degree in Trinity while also being involved in young Fine Gael, both on campus and nationally. He had the guts to run in the local elections as a 20-year-old student. He was only in second year in college when he ran in the local elections. He had the character to pick himself up after he lost that election and work hard to top the poll next time out.<br /><br />He was always a straight talker. He always said it as it is. I think that is a quality that people admire to this day, whether you agree with his policies or not. As a Trinity graduate, I am delighted that we finally have equality with our first Trinity taoiseach in the history of the State</p>
