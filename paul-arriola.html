  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney’s quality shows through in winning debut for DC United]</b> He’s really able to bring the pressure to him, and with the quality that he has he can still hold it up and get the pass off and we run through. Lucho <b>[Acosta]</b> and I, I really think we can really thrive with him and us being in the middle because all we do is run off him.<br /><br /><b>[On Darren Mattocks]</b> Darren Mattocks is a wonderful player, scored a lot of goals this year, but he’s also a very different player in comparison to Wayne. The past year at Everton he played more as an 8, as a 10. He’s gotten away from the player who runs in behind. Now he likes to hold the ball up. Today he did it multiple times. I think that’s great because it will make defenses understand that the threat of not just Wayne, but the front four or five is a real problem</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Arriola is a natural fit to step into a wing role]</b> For us, obviously, when you miss some of your best players, it’s a bit of a different mentality, but it’s also a perfect time for others to step up. It’s a perfect time to explain why this is more than a team and more than just one game. We’re focused on a long journey with the staff and the players and I think it’s time for us to step up as a whole, collectively. It doesn’t matter who is in the attack. We know what we expect from each other and ourselves. We’re going to face a good team against Canada so we’ll need to bring our best</p>

  <p><b>[Ulysses Llanez scores in debut as U.S. men defeat Costa Rica in exhibition in Carson]</b> What am I gonna do? I’m a team player. It doesn’t matter who’s going to score it, as long as we scored that goal</p>
