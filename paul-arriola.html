  <p><b>[Paul Arriola seizing starting opportunity with Club Tijuana]</b> I thought that I had deserved more of a chance to be a regular player and contribute to the team. After the season, my contract was coming close to an end and I kind of had the power to say, ‘Look if I’m not playing I have to still grow, I have to become the player that I know I can be and I don’t think right here is the right spot for me.’ And they said, ‘No, no, no, Miguel believes in you a lot, he wants to give you an opportunity.<br /><br />I think so far in the beginning of the season I’ve taken that little leap and it feels good. In the end, like I said, personally, playing-wise nothing has really changed for me. I’m still the same player that I was last season or the season before where I get the ball and I have to try to create something, take my guy on, get down the line and get crosses in. The only difference is now so far in the season things have been going well where the ball has ended up in the net a couple times with me in the play.<br /><br />It was a nice goal, but I think the thing for me to take out of the goal was just a sigh of relief. Over the past three years, I only have three league goals. I think that’s something that kind of haunts me, consciously or unconsciously, I think about it. I kind of feel that weight on me like, ‘Hey. I got to really put something in, I’ve got to get rid of this’. Each game I go in, of course I want to score, I want to do well in, and a lot of times when I had my chances I wouldn’t finish them. To get that goal early on in the season it kind of let me loose<br /><br /><b>[On being superlider]</b> Of course it’s nice, but in the end it’s about getting hot at the right time. Our goal right now is to focus on the playoffs and get there, but the only way we can get there is week-in, week-out getting points and obviously the last week was a huge three points for us to get one in a tough environment, tough opponent against a tough team. For us to be able to grind out a game like that and get the three points, it was really nice and kind of showed the team that we can be at times where we kind of sit back and we take the pressure and take the hits. All we need is one chance to take advantage. That’s what we did. Now we face Cruz Azul at home and I think all of us are feeling pretty good coming off the last couple of weeks<br /><br />I question where I would be used if I were called in. I still hope as a winger if we’re in a 4-3-3 or a 4-4-2, outside right midfielder. I think still my best traits are attacking and taking people on and I still think my natural position would be a winger position, but I’ve been able to cope and adjust to all the positions on the right side, really. I would even go and say if they needed me I’d be able to perform as a right back, just one that would be a little bit more attacking-minded than the rest, but I would definitely be able to hold my ground down there. I think it will be interesting, but I’m excited. I’m excited to continue to help my game defensively and continue to provide in the attack and we’ll see. Hopefully in March I’ll be able to get a call, and we’ll see from there</p>

  <p><b>[Arriola said he was thrilled to score the winning goal but couldn’t celebrate for long with more matches approaching]</b> There’s now not much time to talk about it and think about it and we have to turn the page because Saturday we play Queretaro, so, tomorrow show up and that is what we are focused on. All you can ask for is for the competition from within the team. That has really helped us and I think that’s really pushed me to raise my level. We will see how Miguel decides to play us out on Saturday and then on Tuesday, but I hope to be there in both playing 90 minutes.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Arriola revealed in comments he made after an impressive showing in a surprise start]</b> We talked about it a couple days ago in breakfast. We just had a short meeting, each person, and I think that really helps a lot, everyone really understand what their role is and what the team role is.<br /><br />At halftime, we talked about a tactical switch. Their left back was coming up a lot, so how can we avoid him receiving the ball, or do we want to hold in and allow him to receive the ball? We kind of talked over that. And everything was pretty clear. Myself, I was never confused<br /><br /><b>[On Bruce Arena]</b> Getting everyone to buy into what he’s trying to do is an art form as well. You can have a guy that can articulate tactics to a tee, but if you’re not willing to fight for this guy, and you don’t believe in the message that he’s selling, it doesn’t matter how well he explains the tactics</p>

  <p><b>[Arriola’s performances in the Gold Cup group stage left a lot to be desired]</b> I think in the group stage I was very poor. Obviously the expectations for myself going into the Gold Cup were a lot higher, but look, sometimes things don’t happen the way that they’re supposed to or the way you plan them out.<br /><br /><b>[As the U.S. found itself locked in an ugly battle with El Salvador, Arriola’s defensive tenacity and attacking vigor proved useful]</b> Tonight I had a much better game. I was able to connect with Jozy and kind of make runs inside out, get physical with some players, and fitness-wise I felt great. I was a little bummed to be taken out in the 66th minute - I definitely had more to give. But in the end that’s Bruce’s decision, and it’s about the team<br /><br />I’m very comfortable playing wide, getting touches out wide, taking guys on, trying to combine one-twos out wide. On our team we have a lot of players that play in the middle, a lot of outside midfielders who like to tuck in, and sometimes we lack the width<br /><br />I’m not going to lie - it’s got to be a lot more effective in the final third from me. It’s great that I beat players and I have the speed to take guys on, and I have to finish the product. Today I had a couple balls to Jozy, a couple combination plays that if they had been taken care of it would have been a goal, and the same with my finishes. But I’m here to get better, and I’m grabbing everything that I can and listening to everyone. Eventually, I promise you guys, the end product will come</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Arriola says Bruce Arena’s blessing made move to D.C. United an easy decision]</b> I had talked to Bruce before the move had even happened and asked his opinion and he was very optimistic about the move. He believes it’s a great move for me, where I’m going to be on the field all the time and improving in the areas I need to work on. Not once did he ever say anything about worrying about my growth or my level dropping off. Any time you have a national team coach that can say that and give you the green light to do something it obviously makes your life easier. Not thinking about what he’s thinking and wondering if it’s the right move.<br /><br />You look at the situation I was in four years ago, working hard and having the right opportunities at Club Tijuana has helped launch me into the position I’m in now. It wasn’t always easy, and there were definitely some tough moments, but going through that made me stronger and helped me get to this point<br /><br /><b>[Arriola’s success at Club Tijuana has served as a model for young Americans to consider following as they search for opportunities abroad]</b> I feel like I can really help pave the way for more American players to not just come back, but maybe stay in MLS and have the confidence they can grow here. Watching the league grow over the past four years, and knowing it is heading in a good direction, makes me excited about this move<br /><br />DC United understands my aspirations, and one day if I want to go to Europe I know they’ll be open to that, which is very comforting<br /><br />Making the World Cup team is obviously a dream for everybody, and being able to become a regular, and play in some big games with the national team has really given me the confidence that the World Cup is in reach. Being able to play regularly with D.C. United and sharpen my game is going to help me keep building on this great year, and the great four years I had in Tijuana</p>

  <p><b>[DC United splashed the cash on Arriola]</b> People say it’s been a rough season, but look, in the past years they’ve been to the playoffs four out of five times. In Mexico, each season if it’s five games you lose then the coach is out and everyone’s freaking out about being relegated and things like that. Here I think no one should feel the pressure, especially with the new players that we have.</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney’s quality shows through in winning debut for DC United]</b> He’s really able to bring the pressure to him, and with the quality that he has he can still hold it up and get the pass off and we run through. Lucho <b>[Acosta]</b> and I, I really think we can really thrive with him and us being in the middle because all we do is run off him.<br /><br /><b>[On Darren Mattocks]</b> Darren Mattocks is a wonderful player, scored a lot of goals this year, but he’s also a very different player in comparison to Wayne. The past year at Everton he played more as an 8, as a 10. He’s gotten away from the player who runs in behind. Now he likes to hold the ball up. Today he did it multiple times. I think that’s great because it will make defenses understand that the threat of not just Wayne, but the front four or five is a real problem</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Arriola is a natural fit to step into a wing role]</b> For us, obviously, when you miss some of your best players, it’s a bit of a different mentality, but it’s also a perfect time for others to step up. It’s a perfect time to explain why this is more than a team and more than just one game. We’re focused on a long journey with the staff and the players and I think it’s time for us to step up as a whole, collectively. It doesn’t matter who is in the attack. We know what we expect from each other and ourselves. We’re going to face a good team against Canada so we’ll need to bring our best</p>
