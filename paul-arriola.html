<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Paul Arriola seizing starting opportunity with Club Tijuana]</b> I thought that I had deserved more of a chance to be a regular player and contribute to the team. After the season, my contract was coming close to an end and I kind of had the power to say, ‘Look if I’m not playing I have to still grow, I have to become the player that I know I can be and I don’t think right here is the right spot for me.’ And they said, ‘No, no, no, Miguel believes in you a lot, he wants to give you an opportunity.<br /><br />I think so far in the beginning of the season I’ve taken that little leap and it feels good. In the end, like I said, personally, playing-wise nothing has really changed for me. I’m still the same player that I was last season or the season before where I get the ball and I have to try to create something, take my guy on, get down the line and get crosses in. The only difference is now so far in the season things have been going well where the ball has ended up in the net a couple times with me in the play.<br /><br />It was a nice goal, but I think the thing for me to take out of the goal was just a sigh of relief. Over the past three years, I only have three league goals. I think that’s something that kind of haunts me, consciously or unconsciously, I think about it. I kind of feel that weight on me like, ‘Hey. I got to really put something in, I’ve got to get rid of this’. Each game I go in, of course I want to score, I want to do well in, and a lot of times when I had my chances I wouldn’t finish them. To get that goal early on in the season it kind of let me loose<br /><br /><b>[On being superlider]</b> Of course it’s nice, but in the end it’s about getting hot at the right time. Our goal right now is to focus on the playoffs and get there, but the only way we can get there is week-in, week-out getting points and obviously the last week was a huge three points for us to get one in a tough environment, tough opponent against a tough team. For us to be able to grind out a game like that and get the three points, it was really nice and kind of showed the team that we can be at times where we kind of sit back and we take the pressure and take the hits. All we need is one chance to take advantage. That’s what we did. Now we face Cruz Azul at home and I think all of us are feeling pretty good coming off the last couple of weeks<br /><br />I question where I would be used if I were called in. I still hope as a winger if we’re in a 4-3-3 or a 4-4-2, outside right midfielder. I think still my best traits are attacking and taking people on and I still think my natural position would be a winger position, but I’ve been able to cope and adjust to all the positions on the right side, really. I would even go and say if they needed me I’d be able to perform as a right back, just one that would be a little bit more attacking-minded than the rest, but I would definitely be able to hold my ground down there. I think it will be interesting, but I’m excited. I’m excited to continue to help my game defensively and continue to provide in the attack and we’ll see. Hopefully in March I’ll be able to get a call, and we’ll see from there</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney’s quality shows through in winning debut for DC United]</b> He’s really able to bring the pressure to him, and with the quality that he has he can still hold it up and get the pass off and we run through. Lucho <b>[Acosta]</b> and I, I really think we can really thrive with him and us being in the middle because all we do is run off him.<br /><br /><b>[On Darren Mattocks]</b> Darren Mattocks is a wonderful player, scored a lot of goals this year, but he’s also a very different player in comparison to Wayne. The past year at Everton he played more as an 8, as a 10. He’s gotten away from the player who runs in behind. Now he likes to hold the ball up. Today he did it multiple times. I think that’s great because it will make defenses understand that the threat of not just Wayne, but the front four or five is a real problem</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Arriola is a natural fit to step into a wing role]</b> For us, obviously, when you miss some of your best players, it’s a bit of a different mentality, but it’s also a perfect time for others to step up. It’s a perfect time to explain why this is more than a team and more than just one game. We’re focused on a long journey with the staff and the players and I think it’s time for us to step up as a whole, collectively. It doesn’t matter who is in the attack. We know what we expect from each other and ourselves. We’re going to face a good team against Canada so we’ll need to bring our best</p>
