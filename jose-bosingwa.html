  <p><b>[Jose Bosingwa says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> will do a great job at Tottenham]</b> I think football needs <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>. I’m happy he came back. I hope he will do a good job because he’s one of the best managers in the world, so for sure he will do a great job<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> could end that wait for silverware]</b> <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have a good squad, maybe one of the best squads in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. It’s not easy <b>[to win trophies]</b> but I hope he does<br /><br /><b>[Tottenham’s rivals <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are currently looking for a new head coach after sacking <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> last month. <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> boss <a href="nuno-espirito-santo.html">Nuno Espirito Santo</a> is one of those to have been linked with the vacancy]</b> I think he deserves <b>[this]</b>, the next two or three years.

  <p><b>[Jose Bosingwa says <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> will make <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> a real force in England and Europe]</b> Just like the moment we had in 2012 <b>[winning the Champions League]</b>, I am sure Frank will lead <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> on to moments like this and he will help them master those situations. Frank was maybe the best professional I ever played with in my life, so I had no doubts over his abilities as a coach and the commitment he would show. He will teach those young players what it is like to play for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, what it’s like to feel <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and what <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is as a club and as a home. He will give them the confidence and power to make <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> a real force not just in England again, but in Europe. The atmosphere at the Bridge was incredible, especially on European nights. Every player wants those moments in Europe and your focus suddenly goes up 200 per cent. But what Frank can add on top of that is to let them be free and embrace the pressure<br /><br /><b>[Bosingwa says he never had any doubts that <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> was the right man for the job]</b> He was always a very calm person. He never got too loud in the dressing room but the way he trained and the way he played, he could just do everything and anything. What I learnt from him came from his actions, not necessarily his words. He demanded respect. He was always and is the right man for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, and he is set up to do an incredible job</p>
