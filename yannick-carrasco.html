  <p><b>[Yannick Carrasco has revealed that he offered Dalian Yifang team-mate Jin Pengxiang €10,000 after breaking his nose in a training ground incident]</b> This incident was quite a while ago. It was in a training session, a collision caused a small injury. Jin Pengxiang’s nose was hurt. From my point of view, Jin Pengxiang is a very good player and a very good person. There is often some bad luck on the training field. I am very sorry about his injury. I solemnly apologise to Jin Pengxiang. I hope he will resume as soon as possible and continue to be my team-mate next season. I think Jin Pengxiang is a very professional player. In the process of recuperation, he has always supported the team.<br /><br />I have heard some rumours during this time. I want to clarify that at first I was willing to give him 10,000 euros as medical compensation, but my agent team did not handle it well. He did not receive the money. There are also rumours that he asked me to pay a huge amount of compensation. I have had direct communication with Jin Pengxiang and he never asked for that. He is a very good player. There are some things I hope to end in a better way as soon as possible, and I am willing to play with him in the team next year</p>

  <p><b>[Yannick Carrasco has revealed that he offered Dalian Yifang team-mate Jin Pengxiang €10,000 after breaking his nose in a training ground incident]</b> It happened in a training session after the home game with Shanghai SIPG. At a crucial moment in our relegation battle, people asked Jin Pengxiang to disclose the matter. He did not accept and did not speak about anything in any media. I apologised to him on behalf of the club.</p>

  <p><b>[Yannick Carrasco has opened the door to a potential summer switch to Arsenal]</b> I would love to return to Europe. A lot of clubs were interested in me. We tried to find a solution in January that would enable me to leave Dalian Yifang. But I can understand the club’s thinking. They wanted me to stay<br /><br />I still feel OK in China. But I have lost my starting place in the Belgian national side. This can happen with a team of their quality. With the level of competition there will always be times when you don’t get to play a lot</p>

  <p><b>[Yannick Carrasco has left the door open for Arsenal]</b> There was interest from Arsenal and I had a lot of teams in January giving me the chance to go back to Europe, but here the president said it was difficult to go then. Maybe this summer it is possible. If it is a good thing and I want to go, maybe I can speak with the president. I try to do my best because I am a professional for my team and after we can think about a solution. If I have a lot of teams who want me but the president decides I have to stay, I cannot do anything. All that you want is to be close to your family, and to go back to Europe is a good solution. I’m OK here, the club is good with me, the players and fans also are nice with me. But you know, when you are far from your family, and I think I can do good things in the European game, I am thinking it’s a solution if I can go back.<br /><br />All the people know England is one of the best championships in the world, it’s a big competition. The players who play in the Premier League tell me it is a physical league, strong, but you also have a lot of space. Sometimes when you play in other countries you do not have a lot of space but in England it is open, the play is up and down the pitch. That would suit me. I think I can play in a lot of competitions in the world, I can attack and also I can defend. With the national team I play as a winger, but also I can play in behind. England would be a good competition for me. I think I would be OK. If I have the opportunity to go to England, why not?<br /><br />I don’t think if you play in China you lose your quality. You see Paulinho when he went to Barcelona. He stayed a lot of years in China, but he went to Barca and did well, and he played the national team and he did well. Now you see Axel Witsel with Dortmund, he stayed for one year in China and he also did very well with Dortmund. Why not me? I need to have something. I try to find a solution to be nearer my family?</p>
