  <p><b>[Yannick Carrasco has issued a strong statement in reaction to him being suspended by Dalian Yifang, questioning the attitude of certain club chiefs and team-mates]</b> The attitude of some club’s leaders and team-mates towards me is incomprehensible to me given my commitment and performance with the team so far. The team needs me and I want to help the team. This problem need to be solved.</p>

  <p><b>[Yannick Carrasco is desperate to leave Chinese club Dalian Yifang for a more prestigious championship in Europe but is facing many obstacles]</b> The whole world knows that I want to return to Europe. Now, it depends on the president and I hope he finds a solution. I can’t speak about <b>[Arsenal]</b>. Now I am not the one who chooses, but my president. He decides if he lets me go or not, but I hope I can come back.<br /><br /><b>[The winger had earlier hit out at Dalian’s hierachy on social media after the club imposed a one-game suspension on him]</b> The attitude of some of the club’s leaders and team-mates towards me is incomprehensible given my commitment and performance with the team so far. This problem needs to be solved</p>

  <p><b>[Atletico Madrid winger Yannick Carrasco said it will be strange behind closed doors when <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> restarts following the Covid-19 crisis]</b> It is a bit strange behind closed doors, but we are professions and we will do things in the best way so that the fans can watch a beautiful game on TV. I’m very happy to see everyone and be able to train with everyone. The team is fine. We have worked hard to prepare for the first match. This stage is set to enter that match in a good state</p>
