  <p><b>[Germany Striker Miroslav Klose Aims To Break <a href="gerd-muller.html">Gerd Muller</a>’s Goalscoring Record]</b> I will try to have another good game against Azerbaijan. I would love to score a goal in every match I play. We already know that Azerbaijan will be a tough team to face. When we last played them, we were only 1-0 up at half-time, prior to winning 4-0. It is always nice to be in the top two German goalscorers, but my aim is to see my nation do well. As a team, we are missing at least three of four weeks’ worth of preparation before we will be at full capacity again</p>

  <p><b>[Miroslav Klose praised the home fans following die Mannschaft’s 3-0 victory over Turkey in Berlin]</b> We are all glad that we won the game. We must compliment the fans - we heard them. Why do I score for Germany and not <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> I ask myself every time. Here I have more luck, which is lacking when I play for Bayern. Although I have now overtaken <a href="franz-beckenbauer.html">Franz Beckenbauer</a> in terms of number of international caps, when you look at the names Klose and <a href="franz-beckenbauer.html">Beckenbauer</a>, you can tell the difference.</p>

  <p><b>[Germany’s Miroslav Klose Sets Sights On Gerd Mueller’s Goal Record &amp; 2014 World Cup Appearance]</b> It’s a great joy when I think back on it. It was a fascinating time and a huge experience. First match, first goal - it was like a dream, like a fairy tale. The record is my big goal. Maybe I’ll have it before Euro 2012. It is something special that my anniversary game takes place at the Betzenberg <b>[in Kaiserslautern]</b>. There I made it big. The club is close to my heart. The stadium will be full… I’m sure the atmosphere will be good<br /><br />I want to play in the national team as long as possible, and if I’m still healthy in 2012 after the European Championship, I would like to continue. The 2014 World Cup in Brazil is an attractive target<br /><br />I feel fit and just have to see from year to year how long my body will last<br /><br /><b>[With his Bayern contract set to expire at season’s end, Klose has revealed that he will first speak to his current club, but that he could imagine moving elsewhere]</b> I have always said that Bayern is my first contact, because although I am currently only a substitute, I cannot be completely blind. I could imagine anything, <b>[to]</b> renew, move within the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> or abroad.</p>

I want to break that. I have talked to Gerd, and he said he will not get angry</p>

But I do not want you to put me on the same level as Gerd. It’s an absolute joke to compare myself with him</p>

  <p><b>[All-time top scorer Miroslav Klose talks about what he thinks makes the complete forward in the modern game]</b> Personally, I always think that players like <a href="diego-forlan.html">Diego Forlan</a> are fantastic. He was the complete striker, and that’s extremely important these days. <b>[Robert]</b> <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a>, for example, has something special, a little bit of everything and a whole host of strengths. You constantly need to keep adapting, as you could be facing three, four or even five at the back. That means you always have to play a little differently, and having many different qualities makes you more unpredictable. Aerial ability and a solid right foot aren’t enough anymore</p>
