  <p><b>[Former USA international Earnie Stewart on himself]</b> I don’t like looking at myself. Once I see myself on TV, no matter it being an interview <b>[or playing]</b>, I just don’t like it because I see all the negative things. I don’t want to call myself a perfectionist because it sounds so stupid. But I find it very, very difficult to find the positive things in myself and I always see the negative things. It bugs me</p>

  <p><b>[Chicago Fire have dealt midfielder David Accam to the Philadelphia Union in a blockbuster trade]</b> Today’s acquisition of David Accam marks an exciting moment for our club, and we are thrilled to welcome him to the Philadelphia Union. David possesses electrifying speed and skill to go along with a nose for goal comparable to the very best in MLS. We believe him to be a perfect fit as we continue to build our attacking corps. He provides an instant boost on the wing and we look forward to integrating him with our team as soon as possible.</p>

  <p><b>[The USA national team still doesn’t have a coach]</b> We are at the beginning phase of building our identity. These games are obviously huge challenges, and for young players it’s an opportunity to see the benchmark of some of the top teams in the world. We can use these experiences to learn about ourselves and take the next steps towards developing into the team we want to become.</p>

  <p><b>[Earnie Stewart explains delay in hiring new USMNT manager]</b> The only thing I can say about that is I started on the first of August; that was it. Another part of that is they wanted to make sure that they put a general manager in place before, and I think that’s a normal way of going about it. You bring in your general manager or sporting director and that he then he makes the choice. I understand that from back then, when we did not qualify, that we are in a position right now where that is the case that it’s been almost a year that there hasn’t been the hired coach for the future, and Dave has been the interim. I want to make the right choice, and not a choice that is hasty. I don’t know what exactly I can say to <b>[fans]</b> more than the fact I’m putting a lot of thought, together with some other people, in making sure that we make the right choice for the future.<br /><br />It’s somebody that has to have a ‘we’ mentality. Somebody who wants to work together. I think that’s important because this day and age I don’t think one person can do a whole job, especially a county as big as we are. I think it’s important that you first have a set profile of what kind of characteristics he needs to have. That starts with the values of one, the American player, and what U.S. Soccer is about because it’s not about ‘Earnie’s coach’ or anything like that. It’s about having a coach that’s good for U.S. Soccer and where we stand and where we want to go to. It’s more style of play, principles of play. It’s an overarching view of soccer and what values we have in the United States. How we want to identify with our team that you see on the field<br /><br />When we talk about the profile, <b>[knowledge of the region, MLS and the American soccer culture]</b> is one of the things in our profile. Some things are requirements, and other things are desired. I would say that’s desired, a preference, but is it the ultimate thing that we’re going to base decisions on? No, I don’t necessarily think that, but I do think it’s important to know the American player, the culture of the American player. But the region itself, and CONCACAF, I’d say that’s a plus. Is it a must? That’s something else.<br /><br /><b>[When asked if the lengthy search for a U.S. coach could wind up costing the program ideal candidates, Stewart downplayed the suggestion]</b> I don’t look at it that way. We’re getting into a phase where we become very serious and we can start reaching out to those where we think that’s a right fit, and then they make their choices based on that. That’s just the way soccer works. I’m not going to get nervous that people are speaking to other people. It doesn’t work that way. I think it was important for U.S. Soccer, for myself, and the direction that we’re going that we make a good choice, and not a decision based on the fact that somebody might go somewhere else<br /><br />That is something that has been brought to my attention, that <b>[Berhalter]</b> is going to be <b>[head coach]</b> because he’s a friend of mine. Now that part I don’t understand. We played together, and we’ve communicated with each other, but ‘friends’ is a little overboard I’d want to say. I know Gregg from the past. He was a coach in Sweden and he’d call me for advice, and I would do the same, vice versa, but we have a professional relationship and we played with each other. Then again, I can say that about a lot of others at the same time. I haven’t had interviews. He’s not the coach that he’s the shoo-in. That’s not the case<br /><br />That’s the brilliant part that we have right now is that we have a very good runway towards those moments that it becomes very, very important and critical that we have to qualify for 2022. It’s as simple as that. But there’s a runway there where you can gain experience. <b>[Experience]</b> a plus if it’s there, but I don’t see that as a negative if it’s not because we have a pathway to go<br /><br />That’s the intention, that they’re based out of Chicago. One of the thing that’s very important is I think you have to communicate every single day. I realize that you can communicate through computers, and on the phone, but it’s not the same as sitting across from each other in a room and having a conversation<br /><br />I don’t think it’d be healthy that somebody sits down at a table and we find a discussion with ourselves and he says, ‘I want to live on the beach and be there most of my time’. Then I don’t think it’s the right choice. Apart from him not wanting it, I don’t think we’d want it either</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT announces Gregg Berhalter as new head coach]</b> After a very thorough process, I am absolutely convinced Gregg is the right man to lead the National Team program moving forward. He ticks all the boxes with his background as a person, a successful coach and an accomplished former international player. His willingness, work ethic and ideas about developing this player pool and influencing these players in and outside of camp and the thought process he has about that – constantly seeking new things – set him apart.</p>

In all of our discussions, Sergino expressed the comfort he feels within the group and his appreciation for the commitment the Federation has made along the way. As a dual national myself, I understand the choices that these young players face. Our job is to provide a clear pathway and maintain honest and open communication, and then ultimately it comes down to a personal decision</p>

  <p><b>[Earnie Stewart insists Greg Berhalter’s job is safe no matter how the U.S. men’s national team fares in an upcoming Nations League match against Canada]</b> We’re looking at the future, so yeah. When I evaluate Gregg and the coaching staff, and what I’ve seen today, I’m a pleased man. An individual result is not going to change that. I think that answers the question in itself<br /><br />I do think there’s been progress, I really do. What we’ve seen in the Gold Cup is that in <a href="concacaf.html">CONCACAF</a> we have a really good level, and that we can play the game we want to play. Getting to a place where we can do that over 90 minutes, that’s the place we need to get to. That progression is there, except against teams like a very good team in Mexico and a very good team like Uruguay, it becomes a little bit more difficult<br /><br /><b>[Stewart says he believes the players can adapt and that adapting will be necessary for the program to take a step forward]</b> Our players showed that they can perform at a really, really high level. The question is not so much, can these players do that, because they’ve already shown that they can. What I would say is we need to do that over 90 minutes, and that’s something that we’re constantly talking about. How can we get there? How can we progress to have enough players to keep that and maintain that for 90 minutes<br /><br /><b>[Stewart says he is not concerned with missing out on a spot on the biggest stage once again]</b> I have no fear that we’re not going to qualify for the World Cup. I’m very, very confident about that</p>

What happened in his youth national team career helped the conversations with Sergino, with his father, with his management in securing him for our U.S. national team, which is great for the program</p>

We’ve enjoyed great success with the U-20s over the last few cycles and the team has been instrumental in advancing players to our senior Men’s National Team.
