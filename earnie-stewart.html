  <p><b>[Former USA international Earnie Stewart on himself]</b> I don’t like looking at myself. Once I see myself on TV, no matter it being an interview <b>[or playing]</b>, I just don’t like it because I see all the negative things. I don’t want to call myself a perfectionist because it sounds so stupid. But I find it very, very difficult to find the positive things in myself and I always see the negative things. It bugs me</p>

We believe Borek has the quality to make everyone around him better</p>

Ensuring he will be here for years to come is an important step for our club. We’re delighted to sign him to a new multi-year contract and would like to thank him for his dedication and hard work.</p>

  <p><b>[US Soccer names Earnie Stewart USMNT general manager]</b> Having played for the U.S. men’s national team, I’m honored by the opportunity to return to help lead this rebuilding phase. We have a tremendous amount of young talent and passion in the U.S., and I’m ready to jump in, hire a new head coach and build a culture of success, with the ultimate goal of the U.S. men’s national team becoming a world champion</p>

  <p><b>[The USA national team still doesn’t have a coach]</b> We are at the beginning phase of building our identity. These games are obviously huge challenges, and for young players it’s an opportunity to see the benchmark of some of the top teams in the world. We can use these experiences to learn about ourselves and take the next steps towards developing into the team we want to become.</p>

  <p><b>[Gregg Berhalter hired as new USMNT head coach]</b> That is something that has been brought to my attention, that <b>[Berhalter]</b> is going to be <b>[head coach]</b> because he’s a friend of mine. Now that part I don’t understand. We played together, and we’ve communicated with each other, but ‘friends’ is a little overboard I’d want to say. I know Gregg from the past. He was a coach in Sweden and he’d call me for advice, and I would do the same, vice versa, but we have a professional relationship and we played with each other. Then again, I can say that about a lot of others at the same time.</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT announces Gregg Berhalter as new head coach]</b> After a very thorough process, I am absolutely convinced Gregg is the right man to lead the National Team program moving forward. He ticks all the boxes with his background as a person, a successful coach and an accomplished former international player. His willingness, work ethic and ideas about developing this player pool and influencing these players in and outside of camp and the thought process he has about that – constantly seeking new things – set him apart.</p>

  <p><b>[Earnie Stewart clearly handled <a href="sergino-dest.html">Sergino Dest</a> well. Stewart, a former Dutch-American dual national himself, had a remarkably similar story, and he admitted that the decisions are rarely straightforward]</b> We are excited that Sergino will continue with our program. In all of our discussions, Sergino expressed the comfort he feels within the group and his appreciation for the commitment the Federation has made along the way. As a dual national myself, I understand the choices that these young players face. Our job is to provide a clear pathway and maintain honest and open communication, and then ultimately it comes down to a personal decision</p>

  <p><b>[Earnie Stewart insists Greg Berhalter’s job is safe no matter how the U.S. men’s national team fares in an upcoming Nations League match against Canada]</b> We’re looking at the future, so yeah. When I evaluate Gregg and the coaching staff, and what I’ve seen today, I’m a pleased man. An individual result is not going to change that. I think that answers the question in itself<br /><br />I do think there’s been progress, I really do. What we’ve seen in the Gold Cup is that in <a href="concacaf.html">CONCACAF</a> we have a really good level, and that we can play the game we want to play. Getting to a place where we can do that over 90 minutes, that’s the place we need to get to. That progression is there, except against teams like a very good team in Mexico and a very good team like Uruguay, it becomes a little bit more difficult<br /><br /><b>[Stewart says he believes the players can adapt and that adapting will be necessary for the program to take a step forward]</b> Our players showed that they can perform at a really, really high level. The question is not so much, can these players do that, because they’ve already shown that they can. What I would say is we need to do that over 90 minutes, and that’s something that we’re constantly talking about. How can we get there? How can we progress to have enough players to keep that and maintain that for 90 minutes<br /><br /><b>[Stewart says he is not concerned with missing out on a spot on the biggest stage once again]</b> I have no fear that we’re not going to qualify for the World Cup. I’m very, very confident about that</p>

What happened in his youth national team career helped the conversations with Sergino, with his father, with his management in securing him for our U.S. national team, which is great for the program</p>

We’ve enjoyed great success with the U-20s over the last few cycles and the team has been instrumental in advancing players to our senior Men’s National Team. We believe that Anthony’s experience in the international game and at the club level make him a great choice to continue that success</p>

  <p><b>[Stewart worked alongside USWNT GM Kate Markgraf throughout the interviewing process, selecting <a href="brian-mcbride.html">McBride</a> after interview over 20 candidates from both the U.S. and abroad]</b> We are thrilled to have <a href="brian-mcbride.html">Brian McBride</a> assume the role as general manager of the U.S. Men’s National Team. Through his impressive career as a three-time World Cup veteran and at clubs in England, Germany and the United States, he has earned the respect of his peers around the world. The hard-earned reputation will allow him to forge important relationships both internationally and here at home, and his understanding of the game and what it takes to succeed at the highest levels will be invaluable to our player pool and our staff</p>
