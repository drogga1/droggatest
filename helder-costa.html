<blockquote>
  <p>[Leeds United have signed Portugal international Helder Costa on a one-year loan from Wolves that will become a permanent deal at the end of the 2019-20 season] It feels great to sign for Leeds United. I’ve spoken a lot to Barry Douglas and he told me how big the club is and how amazing the fans are, so it wasn’t a tough decision to come here and I’m very happy to be here. It’s good to know Barry, he can show me everything about how Leeds works and I’m really looking forward to start training with my new team-mates. I’ve heard a lot about the gaffer, he is a great manager and I know at the end of this year I will be a better player than I am today and I’m really looking forward to working with him.<br /><br />I can’t wait to play at Elland Road soon, it is a big stadium and I’m sure the atmosphere will be great and I am ready for the challenge. I’m fast and I like to dribble, I would like to show good football in this stadium which is my aim and of course to help Leeds to the Premier League. It’s almost the same squad as last season here, the quality is there and hopefully we can push even further and get promoted this year</p>
