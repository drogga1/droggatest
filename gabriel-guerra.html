  <p>[Gabriel Guerra returned to face his former side, PKNS FC on Wednesday night] The feeling is okay. I play now for JDT. I give my best for JDT now and I always want to win.<br /><br />[When asked if he’s happy with his performance since joining JDT] You ask coach [laughs]<br /><br />I can play in the middle, outside or striker. I’ll play wherever the coach want me to play. Good [partnership with Ghaddar]. With Cabrera, we give good pass for him to score. He miss but it’s okay. Maybe he needs a few games, there’s no problem. We need to rest and we need to prepare for next game in Philippines. We know it’s difficult but we are very confident</p>

  <p>[Gabriel Guerra knows that JDT will have to score in Philippines if they are to go through to the AFC Cup zonal final] We cannot rely on our one-goal advantage. We need to assume it is still 0-0 and we need to win and play more aggressively by constantly attacking. I admit I was disappointed not to score in the previous match despite getting several good chances. However, as players, my team-mates and I will give our best performance to match the strengths of our opponents who will be playing at home.</p>

  <p>[Gabriel Guerra only need another 6 more goals to overtake Luciano Figueroa’s best ever goals-haul for JDT] There are no secrets to how I produce an energetic performance every game. I just train every day and follow instructions from the coach. JDT have many great players, so it is easy for me to adapt in every game.<br /><br />As for Natxo Insa, to me he’s a really good player</p>
