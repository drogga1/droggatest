<blockquote>
  <p><b>[After six very special years, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> will bid farewell to <a href="nick-cushing.html">Nick Cushing</a> on Sunday - and New York City FC will prepare to say hello]</b> Nick was an obvious choice. That’s in terms of what he’s done at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> with the women’s team over the last six years, his development of players, winning titles, and he’s obviously steeped in how we work, the methodology that we have at City and how we want to play. The ability to be able to bring that into work and <b>[have him]</b> work alongside Ronny was a really big asset for us and we’re delighted that he wanted to <b>[come]</b> and he saw this as the next step in his journey as a coach as well<br /><br />It was really important that we tried to bring somebody in alongside <b>[Ronny]</b> who knew City, how we coach, how we develop players and the methodology we have.<br /><br />Ronny obviously plays a very, very similar style of football and has done over the last few years at his clubs, but this was just an opportunity to supplement that with really City-specific knowledge about the methodology and how we want to play.<br /><br />I think he’ll be a great fit alongside Ronny and with the other coaching staff we have. We’re trying to build a strong, cohesive staff with different skill sets and different knowledge bases and I think his knowledge and what he’ll be able to bring to NYCFC will be a really big advantage for us</p>
