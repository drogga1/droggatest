  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a>]</b> He’s kept developing constantly. Today he’s a much-improved player compared to when he started out at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, at Nacional, in the Netherlands and even at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. He was on fire at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, but today he’s a much more complete player. True, playing alongside two colossuses <b>[Leo <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>]</b> helps, but even so. Leaving aside how many goals he scores, these days he’s a guy who goes out there and makes the difference, who is the first name on the scoresheet. He’s the complete package. <b>[. . .]</b> Suarez is the standard-bearer for the national team and Uruguayan football because he plays for a side who are watched all over the world. <b>[. . .]</b> I told him to his face that he’s the best Uruguayan No9 I’ve ever seen</p>

  <p><b>[Gallardo to remain River Plate coach]</b> When I hugged him <b>[Gallardo]</b>, ‘We’re going for more’. This group of players and this coaching staff is incredible. The capacity and humility they have is tremendous. It was a very tough game because it was a superclasico. Everything that has happened over the last 40 days has been crazy for everyone</p>

It is possible for Palacios to go to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> but he is in no rush, nor are we, nor are Madrid. It is on track, but in the future</p>

  <p><b>[While Marcelo Gallardo is focused on the job at hand, River’s sporting director, Enzo Francescoli, admitted he must be ready for the possibility his coach could be signed by <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> We need to be prepared for any decision. This happened a few years ago when Ramon Diaz told us he had to leave, but I don’t think about this a lot. You <b>[the media]</b> make me think about this when I speak with you. I’m not thinking about what’ll happen in a couple of months because it’s not even my decision</p>
