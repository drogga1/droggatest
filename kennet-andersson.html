<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Sweden have a group of very talented players and are good enough to reach the last 16 of the World Cup]</b> I think it’s another good generation that’s coming up. There is a good team spirit in this selection. And there are also very good players. That said, I think there are not many expectations on this team. But, you never know what can happen in the World Cup.<br /><br />We can reach the second round. You have to be aware that the World Cup is only a small number of matches. It’s not an entire season. You do not have to be successful for a long time. There are only seven games, if you are successful. I think they can do well, but everything has to go well. If so, I think we can very well get to the last 16 and why not go further<br /><br />It goes in the direction of the evolution of football. Maybe this team has fewer spaces than we did. Even though they may also have possession. Almost all teams like to have control of the ball these days. That being the case, I am not really sure that there is a big difference between the time before and today. You must have a good balance. You have to be dangerous in front of goal, and I think this team is, but you have to build from the back. You need to have a solid foundation to be competitive. I think they will be ready in this area for the big matches of the World Cup</p>
