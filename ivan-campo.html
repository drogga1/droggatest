  <p><a href="hidetoshi-nakata.html">Nakata</a> was a fantastic player. I was very impressed with him when I played with him. Technically he was superb. Now after so many years, it’s great to see so many Asian players playing in Europe<br /><br /><b>[Ivan Campo pinpoint the area where <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>’s influence could be very beneficial to growing and developing football in Malaysia]</b> The best is maybe for some legends or coaches to come here to see the game or work in training grounds, particularly at grassroots level. The children can learn a lot of things from these kind of visits. The youth development is where we can come in and do some good work<br /><br />The most important thing is to enjoy playing football. After that, you can learn from videos, play with your friends or listen to the coach. But you must have tremendous mentality to learn. Now I’m 43, when I go and play with my friends, I look to enjoy the game. When you enjoy playing football, you have no problems</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> defender Ivan Campo launched a furious tirade at Spanish politicians for their response to the coronavirus pandemic]</b> After the balls of hearing so much falsehood and continuous lies from all the politicians of Spain, who put on their medals knowing that a global pandemic was coming, and they have not lifted a f<em>cking finger. Every day it gets worse because of their f</em>cking incoherence and incompetence. I also read now that the Prime Minister is extending the state of alarm for the coronavirus crisis by another 15 days from today. But did you not make a press conference yesterday and could you communicate it to the nation? What f*cking world do YOU live in?<br /><br /><b>[Campo also posted a tribute to former <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> president <a href="lorenzo-sanz.html">Lorenzo Sanz</a>, who died on Saturday after contracting coronavirus]</b> My condolences to the family after the death of <a href="lorenzo-sanz.html">Lorenzo Sanz</a>, former President of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. Thank you for taking care of me and helping me as if I were part of your family in those difficult days</p>
