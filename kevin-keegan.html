  <p><b>[Former England boss Kevin Keegan says He is a better manager than <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> legend <a href="bill-shankly.html">Bill Shankly</a>]</b> I checked his record, and I’ve got at least 0.5 per cent more wins than him - and he’s a great manager. Statistically I’m a better manager than him! I learned so much from Shanks. He used to say: ‘If I was a road-sweeper, my street would be the cleanest in the borough.’ I took that to heart. Everything I’ve done I’ve done with enthusiasm and passion. Everything I turn up to, I think I’m going to enjoy. I never look back, so I don’t have regrets<br /><br /><b>[Keegan also mused on the difference between the modern game and his heyday as a player]</b> In my day, players would smoke in the tunnel before the match. There were stoves in changing rooms and home teams would turn them up to choke opponents before the game. When I was playing, there were only three games on Match of the Day each week, so only 65 of my 100 goals have been filmed. The other 35 are lost for ever. Today all goals are filmed. You’ll never see some of the best things I ever did.</p>
