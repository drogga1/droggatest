  <p><b>[Former England boss Kevin Keegan says He is a better manager than <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> legend <a href="bill-shankly.html">Bill Shankly</a>]</b> I checked his record, and I’ve got at least 0.5 per cent more wins than him - and he’s a great manager. Statistically I’m a better manager than him! I learned so much from Shanks. He used to say: ‘If I was a road-sweeper, my street would be the cleanest in the borough.’ I took that to heart. Everything I’ve done I’ve done with enthusiasm and passion. Everything I turn up to, I think I’m going to enjoy. I never look back, so I don’t have regrets<br /><br /><b>[Keegan also mused on the difference between the modern game and his heyday as a player]</b> In my day, players would smoke in the tunnel before the match. There were stoves in changing rooms and home teams would turn them up to choke opponents before the game. When I was playing, there were only three games on Match of the Day each week, so only 65 of my 100 goals have been filmed. The other 35 are lost for ever. Today all goals are filmed. You’ll never see some of the best things I ever did.</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin Keegan believes criticism of Liverpool’s defensive woes is unfair]</b> There are a lot of teams in the Premier League struggling in defence. All the rules have been changed to suit attackers – yellow cards, red cards. It’s no fun being a defender. If a defender misses three tackles he’s off so it’s no wonder they are cautious. I don’t think Manchester City, Manchester United or Chelsea are great defensively. It’s not just a Liverpool problem. Nowadays everything is built for teams to go forward, which is great. Who shows highlights of defending? Yes they are conceding goals and they say it’s a bit like my <b>[Newcastle]</b> team, but at Liverpool fans want to see a good game of football and they want the team to have a go.</p>

  <p><b>[Class act Mohamed Salah can become Liverpool legend like Dalglish]</b> The only way you can get to that stage, if you like, is you have got to win things. You can’t get to be like Kenny, who came after me and replaced me - I think they saved about 50 grand in the transfer deal. Kenny was a bit cheaper than me amazingly. But Kenny is remembered there for the teams he played in and obviously for the other things he done at the club. But you can’t become really in the fabric of the club unless your team is successful. You’ve got to put honours like European cups or league titles in there as well. And yes I think he can, is the answer to your question because Liverpool are in with a chance of winning the league this year<br /><br />This guy deserves to be given a bit of a run in the first team. I mean, he didn’t single-handedly get them up there last year but he was the main reason - make no mistake about that. <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane, the other players, <b>[Philippe]</b> Coutinho when he was there, they played parts don’t get me wrong. But Salah was the one who made the difference. So you’ve got to be patient with players like that, make sure you keep them on board. If you start to leave him out, that will not make him play any better. I think they have got to just play him through it and he deserves that right. I wouldn’t leave him out, ever. You know it is only a matter of time - form is temporary, class is permanent and he is definitely a class player</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United had played Leeds the week before, winning 1-0, but Ferguson’s comments after the game, which suggested that the Leeds players had not tried hard enough]</b> When you do that with footballers like he said about Leeds, and when you do things like that about a man like Stuart Pearce… I’ve kept really quiet but I’ll tell you something, he went down in my estimations when he said that. We have not resorted to that. You can tell him now, we’re still fighting for this title and he’s got to go to Middlesbrough and get something. And I’ll tell you, honestly, I will love it if we beat them. Love it. But it really has got to me. I’ve voiced it live, not in front of the press or anywhere. I’m not even going to the press conference. But the battle is still on and Man United have not won this yet.</p>
