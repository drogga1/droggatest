  <p><b>[Inter Milan’s Nemanja Vidic picks his favourite stadium]</b> I have played in some really tough places in terms of the noise and the passion the fans create. Every game I have played in Turkey stands out for passion created by the fans. But the best has been at Celtic Park</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a> and Nemanja Vidic’s Partnership]</b> We have played for seven years together and we have had so much success. We understood each other from the first day. Sometimes you understand a player and see the game in the same way; if you have a player who likes to play a different way, sometimes it is difficult to play well together</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> defender Nemanja Vidic believes <a href="manchester-united.html">the Red Devils</a> can win the Champions League this season]</b> It’s Man United. I know <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is bigger, but I think the Champions League could happen. When the season started, I said that I thought United had more chance to win the Champions League than <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> because the players they signed didn’t have the time to fit in. Also, <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> is a tactical coach, knows Europe very well. He knows there are going to be scrappy games and how to get through them. That’s my belief. To win, you need a bit of luck, but there is a chance to get to the semi-final or final. You never know. And if you win a Champions League, the players start to believe. They think: ‘OK, speak about me now.’ <a href="phil-jones.html">Phil Jones</a>, <a href="chris-smalling.html">Chris Smalling</a>, they will look different than now.<br /><br /><b>[former Serbia international and United favourite Vidic again spoke about how he almost joined <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> before moving to Manchester in 2006]</b> In <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafael Benitez</a>’s time. I spoke to him about a few things, but my wife was the main one who spoke to him. He was interested in signing me, but I don’t know what was the problem at the time. I spoke to him before I signed for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, though. I didn’t meet, but we spoke over the phone, in my car in Moscow, with my wife translating<br /><br />I didn’t say no. They said just that they were interested, they want me. It was going to happen, going to happen. Then someone came and said: ‘Do you want to play for United?’ and I said yes. After two days, everything was done. Then <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> said they wanted to do the deal, but everything was done</p>

  <p><b>[Vidic puts himself forward to take charge at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>]</b> To be honest, in the future I would like to be the manager. I would like to think that I know things. For me to criticise <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>, as someone who may be in the future can become the manager, is not fair<br /><br />It’s not the Manchester we are used to watching. It’s <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>’s Manchester and, when he came to Manchester, you have to accept that he is the manager who is going to play this kind of football. It is the kind of football he played at Inter, at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> more or less, and <b>[Real]</b> Madrid maybe it was more open. At the end of the day, that’s <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>’s football</p>

  <p><b>[Nemanja Vidic faced some of the world’s leading strikers in his day, with the likes of <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a>, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> considered to be among the best]</b> <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> looks like he’s not interested in football on the pitch. He doesn’t look like a guy who will run 10 metres and then - bang - he makes the sprint. I’m convinced that <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> was born as a defender. He knows where the ball will come and where he can attack. But in the box, he has a low centre of gravity, which helps him change direction quickly - especially against the big English defenders. He shoots quickly, he can do the tap in and dribble and score outside the box. I played against him when they beat us 4-1 in the <b>[David]</b> <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a> season. That was my worst game for United. I know I’m supposed to choose those two <b>[Champions League]</b> final defeats to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and they were horrible to lose. That one in Rome, and Wembley was even tougher<br /><br /><a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> changed <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. He used to play on the right and had a tendency to cut inside. He was dangerous but predictable. <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> made him central and he became better. The whole team began to play for him. He runs at defenders with wingers running alongside him. I played against him twice and we lost both times. It’s hard to admit they were the better team, still hard to say and it’s still hard to take. We had a great team in 2009. We could’ve done better. We were the European and world champions, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> were more scared of us than we were of them. Beating us gave them more belief. Rome was a tipping point for <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>’s Barcelona<br /><br />Lusi Suarez’s an energetic player. He’s different from <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> who doesn’t run for 90 minutes; he’s a player who uses instinct. Everything is done in bursts. I don’t think he knows exactly what he’s doing but he succeeds. The ball will go through a defender’s legs and people will think it’s an accident, but he has this sheer force to do it. He chops and changes direction; he uses his knees, the defenders’ knees. He’s very direct and hungry to score. He runs for 90 minutes, he has a fire in him. We had that with some of the players at United</p>

  <p><b>[Nemanja Vidic says <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> will prove to be a good signing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> but <a href="manchester-united.html">the Red Devils</a> are considered to still be lacking in the defensive department]</b> I think he’s had a pretty good start. Obviously we have big expectations of him, he was a big signing. We need the defence to improve, we all know how important the defence is in winning trophies. If you want to win trophies, you need to have a strong defence, don’t lose many goals. Obviously he’s still new. He just came, he didn’t have a pre-season with the team. I think better games are coming from him and I think he’ll be a good signing<br /><br /><b>[The former <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> defender is still finding his feet in new surroundings]</b> He seems to have sured things up. He’s made <a href="victor-lindelof.html">Lindelof</a> a better player. I think the back four have been a lot better. He’s been a big signing for them and hopefully he can continue the form he’s been on</p>

  <p><b>[Vidic suggests alternative to <a href="toby-alderweireld.html">Alderweireld</a> as <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> transfer priority]</b> Of course, I would like to see him there. But I think the club has to have a priority. What I see is, if you want to be in the Champions League next season and challenge for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, you have to strengthen the midfield. You need that depth in the midfield area. In defence they already have five players, so they can rotate, and it seems like they’re doing well. Man United need a midfielder to go box-to-box. There has been a lot of criticism for the defenders but if they are compared to other <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> teams, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are not that bad<br /><br /><b>[Vidic said of <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a>]</b> We have to wait to see who will be the manager. The way he is at the moment, I don’t think Ole will have him for next season. But he’s a top player</p>
