  <p><b>[Former Manchester United centre-back Nemanja Vidic has written the Red Devils out of this season’s Premier League title chase]</b> Realistically we are out of the title race. That’s my opinion. But, in recent weeks, the way we have played is encouraging. If we keep playing like that then the top three is our target. After 1-0, you take the 1-1. In the first half, we played well. We had three or four good chances and didn’t take them. If you want to win the match, you have to take the chances we had. In the second half, we didn’t play as good as in the first one - but we scored a goal. Ibrahimovic showed his class again. One chance, one goal. Overall, 1-1 is a fair result.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic has defended Paul Pogba]</b> It depends on what the people expect from him. think the problem is the market is crazy at the moment - to buy the player you need you have to pay crazy money. Paul is a great player, his ability is not to score 25 goals a season. He is about creating situations all over the field and score maybe 10 goals, 15 goals. His potential and actual quality, he can change his game and can become a player that scores 20, 25 goals. I think it’s difficult when people see Pogba and expect him to do something which is not his game. I think he has done some good stuff this season, of course, he didn’t give his best but he played 40 matches which is important as well; his presence on the pitch.<br /><br />As a midfield player, you need someone who is powerful, tall and a presence in the middle of the park. I’m sure next season he will be even better</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United legend Nemaja Vidic thinks that Eric Bailly has the potential to be a great player in the Premier League]</b> Eric Bailly started really well with a steady two or three months. Then he was unlucky with injury and the African Cup of Nations. He’s aggressive, he has potential, he’s young and he likes to defend. He has the qualities to go even further. But I still think that Phil Jones and/or Chris Smalling could build a partnership with Bailly. Smalling has the mentality to defend, the physical size to do it. He likes to defend<br /><br />Communication is very important in defence and it doesn’t help when there has been a lot of changes in United’s defence, like this season. It’s important for central defenders to build partnerships. If you change too much then it’s difficult to understand each other. I was lucky to play for many years with Rio <b>[Ferdinand]</b>. Even though we were very different as players and personalities, I knew what he was going to do in any moment and he knew what I could do. That is absolutely vital for central defenders, but you also need a goalkeeper to communicate with you. David <b>[de Gea]</b> is brilliant and he’s doing really well. He can also tell the defenders to speak more, to be more active in the game</p>

  <p><b>[Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s persistent form and fitness is leaving an enormous impression on Manchester United icon Nemanja Vidic]</b> I always knew that he was a top player. I played a few times against him - he has played at different clubs, won many trophies and scored goals everywhere so it was not a surprise to me that he is scoring goals. But to be 35 years of age and fit to play every match … English football is different but he adapted fast and in general he has been consistent the whole season so I am really impressed by him especially the mentality that he still has and the hunger to play and score goals.<br /><br />At 35 years of age that is not easy because I am 35 and, to be fair, I am a bit tired of football and I need some time off to rest, but he seems like he is still enjoying playing football and that he feels good on the pitch. It’s good for the club and I hope that he will continue to be fit and will perform like he has been for most of the season. I admire his presence. He is good with the ball and he is good in the build ups and of course when he is in the box he is a threat. To be fair he was never counting on speed as a player and that is a positive sign that he can do well again next year.</p>

  <p><b>[Vidic reveals reason behind Smalling &amp; Jones struggles at Manchester United]</b> It didn’t help them <b>[Smalling and Jones]</b> because they didn’t have a more experienced player to pick their brain when they played. It’s not just about playing together with an experienced player. If Phil Jones is 24 and playing alongside someone who is 34, the player who is 34 years old is using his brain more than the 24-year-old. To rise, he needs to be encouraged a bit and made to feel comfortable in his shoes. If you lose that belief and think: ‘Should I be here, or here, or be here, then it’s difficult to play. So that didn’t help them. Even if they do something bad, you say: ‘OK, he’s 24 but where was I to help him?</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba cannot be blamed for his struggles at Manchester United]</b> I think the environment is important - who is around you, for example - to make you better. For the players of 22 and 23 to get so much money and publicity, he must feel like he is the most powerful person in the world. I was a football player, I felt like that: ‘Wow, I am feeling really good’. But I think you need to have someone in the dressing room - some of the players - who can help you come through these difficult situations. You need the right senior players, with the credibility to help you go through the situation. When I came to United I was 24 and the dressing room was strong. You had Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, these guys. You always look to them for what you are doing, what you should be doing. They have already established the path, so there was less pressure on me.</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> defender Nemanja Vidic believes <a href="manchester-united.html">the Red Devils</a> can win the Champions League this season]</b> It’s Man United. I know <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is bigger, but I think the Champions League could happen. When the season started, I said that I thought United had more chance to win the Champions League than <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> because the players they signed didn’t have the time to fit in. Also, <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> is a tactical coach, knows Europe very well. He knows there are going to be scrappy games and how to get through them. That’s my belief. To win, you need a bit of luck, but there is a chance to get to the semi-final or final. You never know. And if you win a Champions League, the players start to believe. They think: ‘OK, speak about me now.’ <a href="phil-jones.html">Phil Jones</a>, <a href="chris-smalling.html">Chris Smalling</a>, they will look different than now.<br /><br /><b>[former Serbia international and United favourite Vidic again spoke about how he almost joined <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> before moving to Manchester in 2006]</b> In <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafael Benitez</a>’s time. I spoke to him about a few things, but my wife was the main one who spoke to him. He was interested in signing me, but I don’t know what was the problem at the time. I spoke to him before I signed for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, though. I didn’t meet, but we spoke over the phone, in my car in Moscow, with my wife translating<br /><br />I didn’t say no. They said just that they were interested, they want me. It was going to happen, going to happen. Then someone came and said: ‘Do you want to play for United?’ and I said yes. After two days, everything was done. Then <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> said they wanted to do the deal, but everything was done</p>

  <p><b>[Nemanja Vidic has urged Manchester United to develop a winning mentality within the squad]</b> Today they didn’t show what we expected, the energy going forward, that burst or sprint. It was too slow, which was disappointing. That is my worry, I’d like to see United playing faster, quicker with the ball. It’s too many touches, that’s the problem, especially against smaller teams. They have a good team, good players, but sometimes I think the players have to show desire, show energy, run more than other teams. They didn’t move well without the ball, they didn’t move fast. The players didn’t perform the way they wanted. It’s sad to see Man United lose at home to West Brom, a team who have won just three games all season.<br /><br />It hurts <b>[losing to West Brom]</b>, because United need a good spirit ahead of the Tottenham match <b>[FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Saturday]</b>, an important match. It seems like he is saying there is a problem with mentality in the players. I think the Man United players know every game is important and they have to win. You play for Man United, it’s not acceptable to draw or lose, always you have a high expectancy. We won the Champions League and we didn’t celebrate. We had two hours of celebration, go on holiday, and the manager was thinking: ‘Who will we bring in next season to compete?</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United are starting embrace the attacking, attractive football for which they are famed]</b> As a player, as someone who played for the club, you want to see them much closer <b>[to the title]</b>. Manchester United in their history always played attacking, attractive football. I think in the last few games what I like about Manchester United is they’ve started to be more positive with Mourinho’s team selection. I think Martial, <b>[Marcus]</b> Rashford, <b>[Juan]</b> Mata up front… it has not happened many times playing together. I think the mentality is of not just defensively but also they are thinking more towards the goal. That’s pretty attacking football from Manchester United, particularly if you have Luke Shaw on the left hand side and Ashley Young on the right. That’s more attacking and I like to see that.</p>

  <p><b>[Nemanja Vidic faced some of the world’s leading strikers in his day, with the likes of <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a>, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> considered to be among the best]</b> <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> looks like he’s not interested in football on the pitch. He doesn’t look like a guy who will run 10 metres and then - bang - he makes the sprint. I’m convinced that <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> was born as a defender. He knows where the ball will come and where he can attack. But in the box, he has a low centre of gravity, which helps him change direction quickly - especially against the big English defenders. He shoots quickly, he can do the tap in and dribble and score outside the box. I played against him when they beat us 4-1 in the <b>[David]</b> <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a> season. That was my worst game for United. I know I’m supposed to choose those two <b>[Champions League]</b> final defeats to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and they were horrible to lose. That one in Rome, and Wembley was even tougher<br /><br /><a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> changed <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. He used to play on the right and had a tendency to cut inside. He was dangerous but predictable. <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> made him central and he became better. The whole team began to play for him. He runs at defenders with wingers running alongside him. I played against him twice and we lost both times. It’s hard to admit they were the better team, still hard to say and it’s still hard to take. We had a great team in 2009. We could’ve done better. We were the European and world champions, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> were more scared of us than we were of them. Beating us gave them more belief. Rome was a tipping point for <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>’s Barcelona<br /><br />Lusi Suarez’s an energetic player. He’s different from <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> who doesn’t run for 90 minutes; he’s a player who uses instinct. Everything is done in bursts. I don’t think he knows exactly what he’s doing but he succeeds. The ball will go through a defender’s legs and people will think it’s an accident, but he has this sheer force to do it. He chops and changes direction; he uses his knees, the defenders’ knees. He’s very direct and hungry to score. He runs for 90 minutes, he has a fire in him. We had that with some of the players at United</p>

Obviously we have big expectations of him, he was a big signing. We need the defence to improve, we all know how important the defence is in winning trophies. If you want to win trophies, you need to have a strong defence, don’t lose many goals. Obviously he’s still new. He just came, he didn’t have a pre-season with the team.
