  <p><b>[Interim manager of Felda United, Mohamad Nik admitted that they lost to a better team]</b> Despite the defeat, but I am very proud of my players because we lost to a better team tonight. After a week, I can see that we have improved our performance from game to game.<br /><br />I hope we can forget this disappointment, and improve ourselves to have a better position in the Super League</p>

  <p><b>[Gaston Cellerino may be given the sack by Felda United]</b> In my opinion, he does not fit the gameplan I employ, that is all. I’ve given him the chance, and now it’s up to me whether to select him for matches or to bench him. So far I still am not satisfied <b>[by Cellerino’s performance]</b> but what can I do? It’s what I’ve been left to work with. If a material is still dull even after it has been polished multiple times, you have to get rid of it and replace it!<br /><br /><b>[On Fakrul Aiman Sidid]</b> s a coach, I think he has a confidence issue. It has only been 10 days <b>[since taking over from previous boss Azmi Mohamed who resigned]</b> that we’ve applied the gameplan that I want. I have to keep working with him and the other players during training<br /><br /><b>[On the defeat itself]</b> The three goals scored by Selangor in the first half, we practically provided the assists. Our defence was careless. Those were all soft goals</p>
