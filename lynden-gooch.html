  <p><b>[Lynden Gooch stays grounded after impressing in Sunderland debut]</b> I didn’t see it coming, I didn’t think I’d be starting. At best I thought I’d be on the bench. He said my name and it was kind of funny, I was quite shocked. I just looked around and all the guys were like ‘Yeah, yeah, you’re starting.’ It was pretty exciting.<br /><br />That was my dream ever since I could remember. I used to watch <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> every Saturday and Sunday with my dad at our house when we woke up in the morning. sIt was always a dream for me and my brother to make it over here and play in England. Saturday was definitely a dream come true to play in the Prem, and have my family back at home watching just as we did when I was little kid<br /><br />It’s an exciting time for the club. I think we can really put all the relegation battles behind us and really push on to hopefully be a top 10 club, because we should be a top 10 club. We have amazing facilities, amazing fans, and that’s what the club deserves so hopefully under this manager we can do that<br /><br /><b>[Gooch’s career took a major step forward last season, when he excelled for the Sunderland reserve team and went on loan to then-League One side Doncaster Rovers]</b> It helped me a lot, it helped me mature more as a player. Playing against big, strong players who are experienced in that league as well. It’s a tough league. People don’t realize how tough it really is. These players are fighting for their lives, making sure they stay in that league, making sure they don’t take a pay cut. Being in that environment really helped. It was tough and gritty and definitely helped me<br /><br /><b>[Something else that helped push Gooch through last year’s breakout season was the disappointment of being left off the U.S. Under-20 team for the 2015 U-20 World Cup]</b> It left a sour taste because I think I deserved to be there, but it wasn’t to be. It definitely made me want to prove myself even more, because I always knew I was good enough, and always believed in my ability. That was very frustrating for me, but I’m sure that I’ve put that behind me now and I’ve reacted in the best way.<br /><br /><b>[And given his attributes as a speedy and skilled winger, Gooch should be hearing from U.S. coach <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Jurgen Klinsmann</a> soon, although he insists he isn’t spending much time worrying about a national team call-up now]</b> If it happens it happens, but I’m not thinking about it. I just want to focus on my club career and doing the best I can for Sunderland. I don’t want to get too ahead of myself. I’ve only played one game, but hopefully I can keep going in the right direction.<br /><br />That’s who I’ve said I want to play for, but at the same time anything can happen. It’d be an honor to play for any of the three. That’s my family, and who I’m a part of, but I’m proud to be from California, and would still want to play for the U.S.</p>

  <p><b>[Lynden Gooch embracing first USMNT call-up]</b> My mom, she’s always saying ‘Ireland, Ireland!’. But no, she’s happy - she always calls me her American boy<br /><br /><b>[After sitting out a 2-0 win over Cuba in Havana on Friday, the 20-year-old Sunderland midfielder hopes to make his full U.S. debut against New Zealand on Tuesday at RFK Stadium]</b> I’m definitely committed - I’m here. I don’t want to just play in this friendly, I want to play next month in qualifiers hopefully if I do well.<br /><br />I think you always have to consider everything. I’ve got an Irish mother and an English dad, but I was born and raised in California and obviously I’ve played for the youth national teams a lot as well<br /><br />It’s been a really good start to the season - an unexpected one, that’s for sure, but I’ve worked hard to get my chance. Hopefully I took it, and hopefully I can take it again on Tuesday if I play</p>

  <p><b>[USA midfielder Lynden Gooch talks about his love for his adopted city]</b> A lot of people say bad things about Sunderland to me but I don’t understand why; the north-east’s very underrated. For a start, it’s so beautiful - you’ve got great countryside and great beaches. And great shops in <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. I’d love to stay a Sunderland player for a very long time. I’ve been here since I was ten and this club has given me an awful lot. I’ve made friendships I’ll have forever</p>

  <p><b>[Lynden Gooch took advantage of a mid-week substitute appearance in the League Cup to bag his first Sunderland goal]</b> I’ve dreamt about this moment since I was a 10-year-old boy when I came over here on trial, so to finally get that goal was amazing. When the gaffer told me I was playing my main focus was to impress him so I can break into the team, and hopefully I’ve done that.</p>

  <p><b>[Gooch overcomes Sunderland freefall to earn USMNT return]</b> I want to try to solidify more of a spot on the national team because sometimes I’ll get called in and then I won’t be in for a camp or two. I want nail down a place if I can to try and get called up on a regular basis<br /><br /><b>[Despite having endured multiple injuries and Sunderland’s precipitous fall over the past two seasons, Gooch still felt confident that his strong play earlier in 2018 was enough to show he deserved another look]</b> At the time when I was playing really well I thought it would be pretty difficult for them not to call me because of the form I was in. Then I had the injury, and when that happened I just started thinking that I need to get fit to have a chance for a call-up and I was able to do that<br /><br /><b>[A knee injury cost Gooch the final four matches of Sunderland’s season]</b> It’s a little weird because I feel like one of the older players and I’m only 22 so it’s kind of funny. I’m proud to be back. It’s going to be a good week.<br /><br />All the players are in limbo, it’s kind of a waiting game now. That’s my home, it’s been my home the past six years. It’s a good place to play football, even if the past two years haven’t gone well, but hopefully we can bring the team back to where it belongs<br /><br />I’m committed to Europe, I want to stay in Europe as long as I can. <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is something I’ll think about maybe a bit later, but I’m 22 years old and I really want to try and make a great career, whether it’s England or elsewhere in Europe<br /><br />I’ve grown up in an English household, and have lived in England for six years, so I’d like to see them do well and will be supporting them since (the USA) is not involved. I came through the (Sunderland) academy with <a href="jordan-pickford.html">Jordan Pickford</a>, so hopefully he’s the number one. He’s a good friend of mine so I’m hoping he does well</p>

  <p><b>[Lynden Gooch has committed his future to Sunderland until 2022]</b> The club has completely changed since the summer and the manager <b>[Jack Ross]</b> was a big reason for me wanting to stay. He has had a big impact on me this season and given me the license to do what I do best. Hopefully I can continue to show the form I have done in the first-half of the season and help us get promoted</p>
