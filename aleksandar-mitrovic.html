  <p><b>[How Newcastle outcast Aleksandar Mitrovic morphed into Fulham’s star striker in promotion push]</b> This season, this team, we always try to score more goals than the opponent. Newcastle was more tactically <b>[set up]</b>. We didn’t play as much attacking football as I play now.</p>

  <p><b>[Aleksandar Mitrovic has admitted that he would happily leave Newcastle United to move to Fulham permanently]</b> We have players who give good balls and it makes it much easier to score and I have to thank my team mates. We have to see what happens first but I would be happy to stay. We will see what happens, I will speak with my agent, I will speak with the club and we will see. Of course, for this short time I have so much memories. I lost just two games and Fulham went 23 games unbeaten. I had an unbelievable time here. I enjoyed it and I say, I would like to stay but I am still a Newcastle United player. I have to go back there and see what happens.<br /><br />I have played the best football of my career here. It is a credit and thanks to the staff and players, everyone at Fulham for that. They supported me a lot and from the first moment I felt like I was here for years. It has been an unbelievable journey, for sure. Maybe <b>[it is a better fit than Newcastle]</b>. I had maybe more game time too, just on the pitch more. I am really happy that I have had a really good four months. <b>[Fulham manager Slavisa]</b> Jokanovic got the best out of me and the best out of this team.<br /><br />I am not bothered what people say, you have always different opinions. I am not bothered. I try to give everything I have, both in training and the games. To give the best I can, sometimes you will be brilliant or not. Sometimes I score, sometimes I don’t, so people are here to judge but I know my qualities and I try to give everything to win and help my team-mates. I tried to breathe on the pitch but I couldn’t because I was so tired. We were down to 10 men after 70 minutes, that last 20 minutes felt like hours. You can make a mistake <b>[like Denis Odoi who got sent off]</b>, but he was a hero in the last game. This is why we are here because we fight for each other and in the end we won together</p>

  <p><b>[Aleksandar Mitrovic says his loan spell at Fulham was responsible for him getting into Serbia’s World Cup squad]</b> I will try to make them proud. I just wanted to play football and enjoy on the pitch. I came into a team that played football that is really good for me and my abilities. I had a lot of balls and crosses. If the team plays well and gives me the ball then the goals will come. So credit to my team-mates, staff and club. They gave me great support from the first minute I came here. They trusted me and I feel like I’ve been here for a few years, not a few months. It is a big thing for me, my family, the country and all people in Serbia. I tried to give my best, play the best I can and do my job. I think that the main target is to try and pass our group, then after it is just knockout football and anything can happen, but we aim to pass our group.</p>

  <p><b>[Fulham have announced the permanent signing of former Newcastle United forward Aleksandar Mitrovic]</b> I’m very glad and happy and proud to finally be here and officially become a Fulham player. I’m happy to the moon and back. I have love for the fans. They’re amazing fans and I have a really good connection with them. This is a big club and last year we made history, we did big things, and I want to continue this. We want to keep making big things, and with all the fans behind us I think we can go far.</p>

  <p><b>[Aleksandar Mitrovic has signed a new five-year contract at Fulham to put an end to rumours suggesting he was on his way out of Craven Cottage]</b> I’m really happy and I’m looking forward to playing here next season. There were a lot of clubs interested but in the end I decided to stay here because I’m really happy and settled at Fulham. My kids, wife, all my family are happy here. This is my home and I am really happy to sign a new deal. Since the first day I came here I have received a great reception from everyone in the club and the fans. I feel motivated and every morning when I come here to work I am happy. I have found my happiness and passion here</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="luka-jovic.html">Jovic</a> in a bit of a crisis at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> but the goals will come]</b> Luka is in a bit of a crisis. When you are a striker, the most important thing is that you’re on the pitch. That’s my view. I don’t think he was on the field that much and didn’t get that much of a chance. I was in such a situation at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. You just get a chance for five, 10, 15, 20 minutes, and during that time you literally try to do what you should do and shouldn’t do, to show everyone that you are worth it, especially when you play in such a big club. You want to do everything and you burn out in that desire. I think he just needs time to be on the pitch more. I’m convinced that with two or three 90-minute games the goals will come, but he is in that situation now and he has to continue work, believe in himself, train, and everything else will come. Goals are like ketchup. When you shake it, it won’t come out, and then when it comes, more comes out than expected. The most important thing is that he works and continues to train, be persistent and not give up. I have told him a couple of times that he really has everything required to be a great attacker. Playing at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> also carries a lot of pressure, responsibility and all that stuff, but again I say, he is young, has many seasons and a lot of football ahead</p>

  <p><b>[It has been a disastrous season for <a href="luka-jovic.html">Luka Jovic</a>]</b> He’s in a sort of crisis. When you are a striker, the most important thing is to be on the pitch. I don’t think he has had many opportunities. I was in that situation at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. You only have five, 10, 15 minutes, and in the time you try and do what you can to prove your worth, especially when you have cost a lot of money. You want to do everything and it burns you out</p>
