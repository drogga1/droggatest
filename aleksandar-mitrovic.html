  <p><b>[Aleksandar Mitrovic has signed a new five-year contract at Fulham to put an end to rumours suggesting he was on his way out of Craven Cottage]</b> I’m really happy and I’m looking forward to playing here next season. There were a lot of clubs interested but in the end I decided to stay here because I’m really happy and settled at Fulham. My kids, wife, all my family are happy here. This is my home and I am really happy to sign a new deal. Since the first day I came here I have received a great reception from everyone in the club and the fans. I feel motivated and every morning when I come here to work I am happy. I have found my happiness and passion here</p>

  <p><b>[Jovic in a bit of a crisis at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> but the goals will come]</b> Luka is in a bit of a crisis. When you are a striker, the most important thing is that you’re on the pitch. That’s my view. I don’t think he was on the field that much and didn’t get that much of a chance. I was in such a situation at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. You just get a chance for five, 10, 15, 20 minutes, and during that time you literally try to do what you should do and shouldn’t do, to show everyone that you are worth it, especially when you play in such a big club. You want to do everything and you burn out in that desire. I think he just needs time to be on the pitch more. I’m convinced that with two or three 90-minute games the goals will come, but he is in that situation now and he has to continue work, believe in himself, train, and everything else will come. Goals are like ketchup. When you shake it, it won’t come out, and then when it comes, more comes out than expected. The most important thing is that he works and continues to train, be persistent and not give up. I have told him a couple of times that he really has everything required to be a great attacker. Playing at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> also carries a lot of pressure, responsibility and all that stuff, but again I say, he is young, has many seasons and a lot of football ahead</p>

  <p><b>[It has been a disastrous season for Luka Jovic]</b> He’s in a sort of crisis. When you are a striker, the most important thing is to be on the pitch. I don’t think he has had many opportunities. I was in that situation at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. You only have five, 10, 15 minutes, and in the time you try and do what you can to prove your worth, especially when you have cost a lot of money. You want to do everything and it burns you out</p>
