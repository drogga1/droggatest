Steve Bruce has held talks with Newcastle United over their vacant managerial position, the Sheffield Wednesday boss confirmed</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Newcastle United have named former Manchester United captain Steve Bruce as their new manager]</b> I’m delighted and incredibly proud to be appointed as head coach of Newcastle United. This is my boyhood club and it was my dad’s club, so this is a very special moment for me and my family. There is a huge challenge ahead of us, but it’s one that my staff and I are ready for. We’ll roll our sleeves up and we’ll be giving it everything from the off to ensure supporters have a successful team that they can be proud of</p>

  <p><b>[Sheffield Wednesday have hit out at Newcastle United for announcing Steve Bruce as their new head coach]</b> The club is disappointed to learn via public statement issued by Newcastle United that it has appointed former Sheffield Wednesday staff Steve Bruce, Steve Agnew and Steve Clemence. Regardless of the fact that the staff resigned from their positions with the club on Monday, there remains outstanding legal issues to be resolved between the club and the staff and Newcastle United. The club is currently considering its position and taking the appropriate legal advice</p>

  <p><b>[Sheffield Wednesday striker Fernando Forestieri has been handed a six-game ban by the FA for using racist language against an opponent during a friendly game against Mansfield last July]</b> It was further alleged that the words constituted an ‘Aggravated Breach’, which is defined in Rule E3(2), as they included reference to ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race. The striker has also been warned as to his future conduct and must attend face to face education but the sanction is currently set aside pending appeal</p>

  <p><b>[Sheffield Wednesday striker Fernando Forestieri has been handed a six-game ban by the FA for using racist language against an opponent during a friendly game against Mansfield last July. The striker signed for Wednesday from Watford in 2015 and has scored 38 goals in 111 Championship games]</b> I am devastated and disappointed with the decision of the Regulatory Commission. Throughout that period of time, throughout both the criminal proceedings and the FA’s disciplinary proceedings, I have consistently and strenuously denied the allegations that have been made against me.<br /><br />Whilst I was shocked and saddened to face criminal charges regarding this matter, I was equally happy to be found not guilty of those charges in March 2019 by the criminal court and considered that to be the end of a very distressing time. As I said at the time, I felt vindicated by the decision of the judge. The decision goes against everything about the person I am and the person I was brought up to be. It is absolutely no comfort to me that, when charging me with misconduct, the FA were very clear that they did not consider me to be racist but instead believed that I had acted in the ‘heat of the moment</p>

  <p><b>[Former Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest and Ghana striker Manuel ‘Junior’ Agogo has passed away in a London hospital at the age of 40. The cause of Agogo’s death is currently unknown]</b> Sheffield Wednesday are saddened to learn of the passing of our former player Junior Agogo. Our thoughts are with Junior’s family and friends at this very difficult time. RIP</p>
