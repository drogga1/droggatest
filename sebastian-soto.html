  <p>[Beating Mexico the ultimate prize for USMNT U-20s] My Mexican grandparents will be wearing all U.S. gear. It’ll mean a lot because you have roots, I still have family living in Mexico, cousins, and even then they’re rooting on the U.S. because I play for them, and that’s a good feeling.</p>

  <p>[Who is Sebastian Soto? The Hannover striker who could be the USA goal machine at the U-20 World Cup] Everything’s worked out so good so far, it was the best move for me. I’ve always had that dream of Europe, that was always my goal. We didn’t have so many guys to look up to. We had <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a> and <a href="weston-mckennie.html">Weston McKennie</a> and those guys, so when you make that move people look at you like you’re crazy.<br /><br />[Playing in Europe was always a dream for Soto, but leaving Real Salt Lake wasn’t exactly an easy decision for a variety of reasons] It was still super tough. Not just the distance or anything, but you’re still just taking a chance. Nothing’s guaranteed, but I was willing to take the risk. It was a bigger risk, but with bigger benefits. You have to admit it’s a super tough decision to make but in my head I wanted to do that since I was little. It didn’t make it any easier to leave RSL because you have the path to the first team there<br /><br />[Soto was originally a winger, but then-RSL academy director Martin Vasquez saw Soto as a striker] If you’re playing a position your whole life you kind of get complacent and not learn so much. But I was put in this adverse environment and for a solid eight months I wasn’t playing, so I had to do anything and everything I could to become a better forward<br /><br />I’m all about working for what you want. In Europe you have to work and if I achieve what I want in Europe it’s going to be the biggest dream come true. Obviously playing professional for Real Salt Lake would have been a dream come true too, but I saw a path with Hannover. They speak to you like they want you to be with the first team. For me that’s the biggest thing, I wasn’t going to Germany to play U-19 <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> forever, I wanted to be with the first team as fast as possible, and the fact they had that vision for me, and it’s already shown, it was 100 percent the right choice for me</p>

  <p>[USA heads into Under-20 World Cup with high expectations, and the swagger to go with it] We’re good. We’re really good. We know that we’re good, but we don’t let that take away from the work ethic because we know if we work hard we can be so much better. The talent we have in this team at every position is special</p>

  <dd>Sebastian Soto’s brace was the difference as the United States secured an important victory over Nigeria in the Under-20 World Cup. The USA entered the contest off a 2-1 defeat to Ukraine in their opening game in Group D.</dd>

  <p>[US sights set on deep U-20 World Cup run after toppling France] It was honestly basics at that point. You think you’re playing a world class team like France. Yeah, you think you’re scared or intimidated. It’s like ‘No, it’s basics. it’s football.’ That’s kind of what we showed, but also with fight. It was awesome.</p>
