<blockquote>
  <p>[When asked about appointing Teddy Sheringham and Ashley Westwood] Both the coaches are proved winners and are used to winning. We want to associate ourselves with proven winners and successful people. We want people who are not overawed by success.<br /><br />We had a conversation with Teddy and were highly impressed by how he wanted to go about ahead with the forthcoming season. It took us a little while to finalise the formalities. But now he is on board. Teddy is enthusiastic and committed to his work. Ashley has been a part of Indian football for 3 years. He led Bengaluru FC to 3 titles [2 I-Leagues and 1 Federation Cup.<br /><br />[Speaking about Bagan and East Bengal’s competition] Both Mohun Bagan and East Bengal are great clubs with great legacies. I have grown up idolising these two sides. We don’t want to compete with anyone. They’re Dadas and we are bacchas. We have our own fan base. They will help us to win more</p>
