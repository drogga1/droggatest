  <p>[When asked about appointing Teddy Sheringham and Ashley Westwood] Both the coaches are proved winners and are used to winning. We want to associate ourselves with proven winners and successful people. We want people who are not overawed by success.<br /><br />We had a conversation with Teddy and were highly impressed by how he wanted to go about ahead with the forthcoming season. It took us a little while to finalise the formalities. But now he is on board. Teddy is enthusiastic and committed to his work. Ashley has been a part of Indian football for 3 years. He led Bengaluru FC to 3 titles [2 I-Leagues and 1 Federation Cup.<br /><br />[Speaking about Bagan and East Bengal’s competition] Both Mohun Bagan and East Bengal are great clubs with great legacies. I have grown up idolising these two sides. We don’t want to compete with anyone. They’re Dadas and we are bacchas. We have our own fan base. They will help us to win more</p>

  <p>[ATK sign ex-Bolton Wanderers goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen] I welcome the boys into the ATK family. We believe that this year our team is comprised of really dynamic Indian and foreign recruits and I am happy with three more exciting talented players who are all set to exhibit their skills. We look forward to an exciting season ahead. [Nallapan] Mohanraj had been a part of the ATK family and we welcome him back.</p>

  <p>[ATK rope in former Portsmouth midfielder Carl Baker] We welcome Carl Baker to be a part of the ATK family. I am sure his experience of playing top tier leagues in England will help ATK in the forthcoming season of the ISL. We are already on our way to consolidate our team and the coaching staff is making some worthy choices to form a strong side.</p>
