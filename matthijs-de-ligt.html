  <p><b>[Matthijs de Ligt has revealed that a fascination with Italian football contributed to him opting for a €75 million move to Juventus over a switch to England or Spain]</b> I have been fascinated by the Italian way of defending from an early age. Many of my idols from the past are also Italians. Such as Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Alessandro Nesta, Fabio Cannavaro and Gaetano Scirea. When you talk about defenders, then you soon talk about those names. I actually fell in love with the Italian way of defending and I made a choice based on that<br /><br /><b>[He admits that the decision to leave his homeland has not been an easy one]</b> It was a difficult choice. There were several options, but you always have to look what’s the best for you. Various factors play a role. For me it’s very important to know how much you are going to play and how much trust the club has in me. They also mentioned that they really wanted me. They saw a future for me and the they could improve me in certain areas</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Matthijs de Ligt insists his €75 million move to Juventus was driven by personal ambition, with Cristiano Ronaldo having no influence on his decision to head for Italy]</b> After the Nations League final I was already sure that I wanted to join Juventus, but it was still a big compliment to have Cristiano ask me to join here but it didn’t make the difference. I came here because Italy is one of the most traditional countries for defenders. Juventus is a great forwards step for me. I spoke to <b>[Maurizio]</b> Sarri on the phone before coming just to get to know each other. He was one of the reasons that I wanted to join here, I’ve heard a lot of good things about him and I like his footballing philosophy and how he prepares his defence. The photo of me in a Juventus shirt was taken when I was about six or seven, at that time Fabio Cannavaro was a defender that I admired. I always had a good feeling about Juventus and I’ve always been a fan.<br /><br /><b>[He said of his ambition]</b> There are four competitions and we want to win them all. This is the mentality of Juventus. It’s a big step, my first outside of my home country. I was really honoured with how the Juventus fans welcomed me and I hope that I can give a lot back. I’m still young but I feel like I’ve got a lot of experience for a 19-year-old, that’s why I made this move to gain more experience and to learn from the players here. I’m 19, I can still improve and I want to do that. It’s important to work hard every day and to learn and I hope to become a better player<br /><br /><b>[De Ligt will be taking the No. 4 shirt at Juventus and is determined to prove himself worthy of it]</b> The number four for me has always been special, I wore it since the youth teams of Ajax. It has an important legacy here too at Juventus, so I hope to live up to this number</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus new boy Matthijs de Ligt has laughed off claims that he chose to move to Turin for the money]</b> I tried to shut myself off <b>[from speculation]</b> as much as possible but you always get something with it. The most insane message I read was that I wouldn’t go to PSG because I wanted to earn more money than Mbappe. What nonsense. <b>[Money]</b> played no role for me. Everyone who knows me knows that too. Mino is my agent, he deals with the business side of things, but that came only after my my sporting choice was made. Money has never been leading<br /><br />Don’t worry, <b>[pressure is]</b> always there at clubs like this. And a transfer fee is just a given. At such large clubs as Juventus those price tags do not play a role. Of course, it is nice to come in after the season with Ajax, including the match here in Turin. But that is in the past and will no longer count when I stand here on the field. Juventus has many good defenders, we will all have to work</p>

  <p><b>[New Juventus centre-back Matthijs de Ligt has refuted claims that money played a big part in his high-profile move to Italy this month]</b> Money played no role at all in my choice for a new club. Everyone who knows me, knows that. Money has never been ‘leading’. Everyone is entitled to their opinion and I will respect that, but some people were saying things like that very easily. Every day there was something new. Suddenly, even my father was too fat and that’s why one of the clubs <b>[Manchester United]</b> didn’t want me. That makes you go: ‘come on man’.<br /><br /><b>[He was also quick to defend the part played by his agent Mino Raiola, who was instrumental in constructing his eventual move to the Italian champions]</b> He has a lot of experience. I think there may be a certain negative image of him in Holland, but I certainly don’t experience it that way. I think if you ask all of his players if Mino does a good job for them, everyone would say yes. That’s the most important thing. It’s not about what other people say about him, it’s about what he can do for me</p>

My reserve role just fits into the process of a young boy going to a top European club. <br /><br /><b>[De Ligt is not naive, he knows he can improve in all aspects of his game; technically, tactically and physically.

The most interesting thing for me was that they could also see how much potential I have physically. The outcome of that was a positive surprise, because there is a lot of unfulfilled potential still. I would rather hear that I still have 60 per cent room for growth than to find out I am already at 90% of my potential. There is still a lot of room for improvement. It’s now all about fulfilling that potential. If you look at <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and some of the other stars, they are perfect role models. They show me how much I can still gain by looking after my body even better</p>

I am learning Italian. Both the language and the football, very different, compared to the Dutch one. I am very happy to be here.

It doesn’t surprise me anymore. Sometimes I think I had a decent game, but apparently there’s something wrong after all. But those are only opinions. It’s important to know what I do well and what went wrong - and I know that well.<br /><br />Every new player should get the time to adapt to the team. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> had two great defenders already with <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Chiellini</a> and <a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Bonucci</a>. The plan was to let me enter the team slowly, but it worked out differently. Obviously it’s great that I get to play already, but you get thrown in at the deep end right away. That’s a great challenge for me.<br /><br />The most important lesson I have learned so far at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> is that you need self-confidence. In the beginning, I noticed I was way too concerned about not making mistakes and that’s exactly what you shouldn’t do. I never played that way and in my first weeks I was too focused on that. After that game against <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> I called myself to order, in a way. I wanted to play with confidence again. Maybe still some things will go wrong, but at least I know for sure things are better than before. Since then I have an upward trend. The critiques you get after the game are part of the deal. Unfortunately that’s the life of a defender. You’re balancing on such a thin line of playing good or bad. Of course I’d rather not give away a penalty kick, but in the end we won <b>[against Inter]</b> and that’s what matters</p>

  <p><b>[De Ligt urged against <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> exit by Stam as talk of interest from <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> resurfaces]</b> In my opinion, it is essential that you stay because only in this way can you improve, compare yourself with the best, learn to manage the pressure in important matches in the Champions League and <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>. My opinion towards him is positive, in the last few months he has expressed himself really well. He has been criticised a bit, but the initial difficulties were due to the fact that he had to understand how to adapt to a different type of football, and he’s still very young. Matthijs plays in a great club that has great players and the pressures he is facing are much greater. Furthermore, you have to consider that the opponents faced in Italy are very different from those encountered in the Netherlands. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> invested a substantial amount to get him, many think it has been too much, but in my opinion you just have to think about the continuous growth this boy has had up to now. For me he has been very good so far.<br /><br /> In my opinion it is normal for such a young player to have difficulties. He started playing in a new league and in a top club. In the Netherlands it was simpler as the teams he faced were of a lower level. But it is really where he grew up, <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> was a challenge for him. This experience provided the self-confidence necessary to face stronger teams. The current result is this: <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> believes in him in the same way that Matthijs has trust in his own qualities. He is an intelligent boy on and off the field, he wants to learn and you can see that he always wants to do better. This is a good individual quality. He must also learn Italian as it is important to know how to communicate with his team-mates</p>

  <p><b>[De Ligt didn’t want to be a €75m defender but <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> star is now learning from Van Dijk &amp; Bonucci]</b> I played a lot in midfield, scored some goals, provided assists, and then suddenly they told me it would be better for my career to go one position back, to centre-back. At the beginning, I was thinking, ‘I don’t like being a defender,’ but now I’m starting to realise that the way I was brought up as a midfielder is helping me. So, I’m really happy that this was the development I had to go through. Since the emergence of that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> team, the ‘tiki-taka’ team, everybody has wanted to play from the back. And to play from the back, you need defenders who are good with the ball. That’s why technical ability is really important in my role. It is important to know for yourself if you’re mentally right; if you’re ready, nobody can stop you. That is the thing that I started to realise and that is good also: to take a step back and see things that maybe you can improve. That is what I do. What I am saying is that mental ability is really important for defenders<br /><br /><b>[De Ligt said of his development, which includes partnering <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> star <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> with the Netherlands]</b> It’s great to play with one of the best players in the world. And I guess we are a good duo. And now at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> with <b>[Leonardo]</b> <a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Bonucci</a> and <b>[Giorgio]</b> <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Chiellini</a>, they are defenders with a lot of experience who know what it’s all about. I try to learn from them</p>

  <p><b>[Matthijs de Ligt says <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> star <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> is the greatest player of his generation]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is the best of his generation and a huge example for young players. I always try to improve the way I play by watching him because even in training he has a crazy intensity and you wonder if he really is 35 years old. We really have a good team, a lot of good guys. The most fun are the South Americans. Beside <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, I was impressed by <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Paulo Dybala</a> and Rodrigo Bentancur: both players with an amazing technique. Rodrigo in particular is underestimated, he will have a great future ahead of him<br /><br />Gigi could literally be my father… he is 42! Can you imagine it! The point is that if you see him playing you would say he is 30. He is a top guy and always available with me. I’m learning a lot from him<br /><br /><b>[De Ligt says he is going nowhere, despite rumours circulating as to his future]</b> They invented many things about me: the truth is that I’m really happy in Turin and to be able to train every day with extraordinary players. I have the feeling of improving day by day. So, yes, I’m very happy.</p>
