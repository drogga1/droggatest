  <p><b>[Ajax’s wonderkid defender Matthijs de Ligt admits he is flattered to be linked with some of Europe’s biggest clubs]</b> It’s difficult to answer, at the moment I’m an Ajax player. But I can say that I don’t have a favourite club. Ready for a different experience? Maybe, yes. I don’t know. I like to play at high levels. Ajax are a big team, now the season is over, I’m on vacation and I can think about my future.<br /><br /><b>[He denied knowledge of any negotiations reportedly taking place between Juve and Ajax]</b> Honestly I don’t know, at the moment I’m focused on the national team. Sure, it’s a great honor to be linked to such a big team but now I’m just thinking about playing well</p>

It’s nice to see your name linked with those kinds of clubs, but if I didn’t hear anything, it doesn’t matter.<br /><br />He’s really nice, but when he goes on the pitch he’s like an animal.

Real gives away space and they are not used to this. We wanted to play attacking football, we discussed that beforehand. We have shown that we can do something. What was missing was the scoring more in Amsterdam. We fought for each other and were perhaps at our best. Otherwise, you will not win here.<br /><br />This <b>[Real]</b> is the title holder.

  <p><b>[Matthijs de Ligt claimed they were unlucky to lose against Germany]</b> The first half wasn’t good. We didn’t put on the pressure and they had a lot of space. Germany has very skilful players. Maybe we were somehow scared to attack Germany. In the second half we showed we’re a good team, but that was too late. It’s the Dutch mentality to try to score a third goal. You could keep pressing or defend and we did the first thing, but you should remain focussed and we lacked in the end.</p>

I really admire Chiellini, he’s a very strong centre-back and one of the best ever. I also appreciate Bonucci. They are two of the best centre-backs in Europe and two examples to follow for a young player like me.<br /><br /><b>[Being compared to Alessandro Nesta and Jaap Stam]</b> makes me happy because they were two top centre-backs, but I still have a lot to do to reach their level. Nesta was a fabulous defender; I also watch videos of <b>[Paolo]</b> Maldini and <b>[Franco]</b> Baresi. The Italian school of defenders has always been the most important<br /><br />Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the best in the world and with him Juventus are stronger. However, it will be a fascinating challenge to play against him. Juventus are a great team but we believe we can go through because we are younger and there’s less pressure on us. Also, we have our own CR7: Dusan Tadic!</p>

In the second half David <b>[Neres]</b> hit the post. Had the ball gone in, you would be sitting better. But we must be satisfied. You knew beforehand that it would be hard fought. We Dutch sometimes pretend Tottenham is some kind of B-team that we will walk over. Maybe it’s better to go into a game as an underdog. We played well against Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Juventus. Now you saw that Tottenham are good too. Then you have to fight and we have done that.<br /><br />You know they are going to show something. With the long ball to <b>[Fernando]</b> Llorente, it was difficult to put pressure on them. We played well in the first half, they didn’t touch it. After a while they started with the long ball, then we found it more difficult. We fought. It became a fight, but we stand here with the win</p>

We barely gave anything away in first half, but we’re out anyway. Incredible. It’s a dream getting crushed. I would have loved to play the final, but it’s not happening. I’m getting goosebumps from the way our fans cheered for us <b>[after the final whistle]</b>. It’s hard to say right now, but we have to move on. We still have to play two matches to win the title. That’s most important now.<br /><br />In the second half we were no longer capable of putting on pressure, so Alderweireld could step forward and Trippier had too much time to bring the ball in. We had no answer to that. We survived for a very long time, but we gave away the goals very clumsily. That’s what made the difference. The fans gave me chills, but unfortunately it’s not our night</p>

  <p><b>[De Ligt didn’t want to be a €75m defender but <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> star is now learning from <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a> &amp; <a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Bonucci</a>]</b> I played a lot in midfield, scored some goals, provided assists, and then suddenly they told me it would be better for my career to go one position back, to centre-back. At the beginning, I was thinking, ‘I don’t like being a defender,’ but now I’m starting to realise that the way I was brought up as a midfielder is helping me. So, I’m really happy that this was the development I had to go through. Since the emergence of that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> team, the ‘tiki-taka’ team, everybody has wanted to play from the back. And to play from the back, you need defenders who are good with the ball. That’s why technical ability is really important in my role. It is important to know for yourself if you’re mentally right; if you’re ready, nobody can stop you. That is the thing that I started to realise and that is good also: to take a step back and see things that maybe you can improve. That is what I do. What I am saying is that mental ability is really important for defenders<br /><br /><b>[De Ligt said of his development, which includes partnering <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> star <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> with the Netherlands]</b> It’s great to play with one of the best players in the world. And I guess we are a good duo. And now at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> with <b>[<a href="leonardo.html">Leonardo</a>]</b> <a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Bonucci</a> and <b>[Giorgio]</b> <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Chiellini</a>, they are defenders with a lot of experience who know what it’s all about. I try to learn from them</p>

  <p><b>[Matthijs de Ligt says <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> star <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> is the greatest player of his generation]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is the best of his generation and a huge example for young players. I always try to improve the way I play by watching him because even in training he has a crazy intensity and you wonder if he really is 35 years old. We really have a good team, a lot of good guys. The most fun are the South Americans. Beside <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, I was impressed by <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Paulo Dybala</a> and Rodrigo Bentancur: both players with an amazing technique. Rodrigo in particular is underestimated, he will have a great future ahead of him<br /><br />Gigi could literally be my father… he is 42! Can you imagine it! The point is that if you see him playing you would say he is 30. He is a top guy and always available with me. I’m learning a lot from him<br /><br /><b>[De Ligt says he is going nowhere, despite rumours circulating as to his future]</b> They invented many things about me: the truth is that I’m really happy in <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a> and to be able to train every day with extraordinary players. I have the feeling of improving day by day. So, yes, I’m very happy.</p>
