  <p><b>[Ireland legend Damien Duff announces retirement from football]</b> After much deliberation, I have today decided to bring my professional football career to an end. My heart wants me to continue playing but my body has finally won the battle and told me to stop. I’ve lived every young boy’s dream and I know I am a very lucky man<br /><br />I would like to thank everyone who has helped me along the journey from schoolboy football in Dublin and moving to England as a teenager right up to today. I am extremely proud to have won 100 caps for my country - it was always my greatest pleasure to represent Ireland and I have many magical memories from my international career.<br /><br />While I have finished playing, I am progressing with my coaching badges and will stay involved in the game for many years to come. I am grateful to Pat Fenlon and Shamrock Rovers FC for giving me the opportunity to finish my career back home - they have some exciting plans for the club for the future and I wish them well. I had hoped to play for one more year but it was not to be<br /><br />Thank you to all the many fans for your support over the years. I would like to especially thank my wife Elaine, my children, my parents Gerard &amp; Mary and my family for being, and continuing to be, my biggest supporters</p>

  <p><b>[Damien Duff on passing on knowledge to the next generation after recently announcing his retirement from the game]</b> Everyone keeps saying we don’t have coaches; I think it’s absolute nonsense. Just go out on the street and kick a ball, that’s what I did. It’s just hours. Practice. But nowadays they’re on Facebook, taking photos, chatting up girls or whatever. I hadn’t even kissed a girl when I was going to England at 16. It’s sad I know. I tell the lads out of <b>[Shamrock]</b> Rovers this every week. It’s just love of the game. I’d love to maybe give something back to the youth of Ireland, underage teams or whatever. But we’ll see where the <b>[coaching]</b> badges take me</p>

  <p><b>[Damien Duff explains why he twice rejected Liverpool]</b> I came close <b>[to joining Liverpool]</b> two or three times. The first was a year or two before I signed for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> <b>[in 2003]</b>. I would have gone there, but <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> wanted a big fee so not too many clubs could afford to buy me back then!<br /><br /><b>[When he was leaving <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, Duff explained, the same move nearly happened again]</b> I remember getting a message from <a href="martin-jol.html">Martin Jol</a>, but I was a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fan after winning titles there so it was something I never really looked at. I had friends at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> – <a href="scott-parker.html">Scott Parker</a>, <a href="shay-given.html">Shay Given</a> – and I wanted to give that a real go, but I had a disaster. I gave them everything but sometimes moves don’t work out</p>

  <p><b>[Damien Duff is disgusted by the GAA’s resolute stance over the movement of the Liam Miller charity match to Páirc Uí Chaoimh]</b> It’s a load of crap. It’s archaic. It’s just dinosaurs making decisions. A young man has passed away… It makes my blood boil. Listen, even if they open the doors now and the game is played there (Páirc Uí Chaoimh), I still think they come out of it looking awful. So it’s a lose-lose for them now, and it serves them right. It makes my blood boil. I can only imagine how everyone on the committee feels about it as well. An absolute disgrace, but <b>[I’m]</b> not really surprised<br /><br />I think it’s Gaelic people, and whoever makes the decisions, saying that it’s rule books and that they don’t have their AGMs until next February – it’s a load of crap. It’s just dinosaurs making decisions. A young man has passed away who has left a young family behind, and all they are looking to do is play a game that will bring people together, firstly. A lovely occasion and will help Liam Miller’s family</p>

  <p><b>[Damien Duff says coaching at Celtic is next best thing to playing for club]</b> Damien Duff: Coaching at Celtic is next best thing to playing for club. I had the kits all the way through, Celtic and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> were my teams. I don’t think it ever got close but yeah, I would have come up here <b>[to play]</b>.<br /><br />I have loved every minute of it. I’ve been here 10 days, I went through the interview process six to eight weeks ago. I’ve brought the family, taken the kids out of school. If anyone else came calling - not that they did - it was the only club I would have left for<br /><br /><b>[Duff, who becomes reserve team coach as Stephen McManus takes over as Under-18s coach, worked with Celtic manager <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> when he was a coach at Chelsea]</b> Duff, who becomes reserve team coach as Stephen McManus takes over as Under-18s coach, worked with Celtic manager <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> when he was a coach at Chelsea<br /><br />I’m not claiming to know everything. I feel like I’m learning the game all over again. When you stand on the touchline it’s a totally different viewpoint. I’m only a baby, I’m a year-and-a-half, two years in. So it’s a massive road but I’m going to embrace it.<br /><br />Even away from the pitch, just getting into the lads’ heads what it takes to be a footballer. Across the board - not at Celtic - but in England, Ireland, Scotland, lads just do enough and think just doing enough is going to get you to be a footballer but it’s not.<br /><br />You’ve got to do more than enough every day and empty the tank. It’s just that obsession.<br /><br />On the pitch I’ll help them all I can. I’m on them 24/7 out there, I’m full-on, I’m passionate, I’m emotional. Once they realise it’s not me just being a pain, it’s because I care and I want to help</p>

  <p><b>[Damien Duff says I would have run over my granny to make it as a footballer]</b> I am not claiming to know everything, I feel like I am learning the game all over again on the touchlines. It is a massive role and I am going to embrace it. I think across the board, not just Celtic, in England, Ireland, Scotland, lads just do enough. They think that will get you to be a footballer, but it is not, you have to do more than enough every day and empty the tank. It’s just that obsession I would have done anything when I was a kid, 16 being a footballer, I would have run over my granny, it’s just what it is being that mongrel. I will help them all I can.<br /><br /><b>[The former Ireland winger says it was a no brainer to join a club as special as Celtic]</b> Obviously, the club is massive and I think you know the Irish connection anyway, no one has to teach you that back home. It is in your blood from the day you are born, the next best thing when you finish is obviously coaching. The next best thing for me, I didn’t play for Celtic, but to come and coach here is top class<br /><br /><b>[Duff’s working relationship with <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> stretches as far back as his days at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. Rodgers worked there as a coach]</b> He was brilliant with me there. We would talk about Celtic when were there. It is obviously my dream club and it was his dream club then, he was always a Celtic fan and we would have a bit of craic and banter back then, 15, 16 years ago. He is definitely an inspiration and influence, he is one of the best in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Ireland’s street footballer making waves at Spurs]</b> Street football is dead in this country.

  <p><b>[What to expect from Damien Duff as Ireland’s latest assistant coach]</b> I was always told how shit I was or I needed to do something better:that was the way I was brought up so that’s the way I’m doing it<br /><br />A few parents have tried the ‘My little Johnny is this or that’. <b>[…]</b> piss off really. I try to treat them like adults. I put on adult sessions that I got in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> for 20 years and that’s the way I treat them. I’m probably too tough on them, they probably hate me, but that’s the way I was brought up, in home life, at <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a>. I was scared of Alan Irvine! He was our youth-team manager but was probably the best coach I’ve ever worked under</p>
