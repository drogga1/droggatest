  <p><b>[Asked about rumours that Miami will be the venue for the chosen Liga fixture, and that either Real Madrid or Barcelona will be involved]</b> Obviously we want to have a recognisable team, you know? If this were two or three years from now, it becomes less important. But I think it’s critical that we have one of the top five or six teams that’s recognisable. Obviously, everyone knows Barca and Real Madrid, but equally people know Atletico Madrid, Sevilla, Valencia. I think that it’s got to be one of the bigger teams.<br /><br />It’s not really a big part of our deal at this point. We have TV rights, we have games, we have sponsor rights - we’re doing a lot of things for the league over a 15-year period and the idea is to build the brand so that we can bring more money to the league. But this specific game won’t be a huge money game. This would be more of a brand-building, promotional exercise<br /><br />Most likely <b>[the US game]</b> will be <b>[taken from]</b> a smaller team’s stadium; it’ll be a small team’s home match. We’ll figure out different ways to accommodate the fans. We haven’t decided yet. The other part is that we want it to be so that there’s not a cup game in between so that there’s a little bit of rest for the players. We’re trying to respect the game. We’re trying to respect the players</p>

  <p><b>[2020 Men’s International Champions Cup cancelled due to coronavirus pandemic]</b> We want to make sure that whatever we put on is respectful to the clubs and respectful to the fans. It will be a smaller tournament for sure. We want to make sure that teams bring over their <b>[big-name]</b> players</p>
