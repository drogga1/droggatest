  <p><b>[Manchester City and Manchester United will face off at the International Champions Cup]</b> This year’s International Champions Cup will feature two of the most iconic derbies in sports: El Clasico and the Manchester Derby. The line-up of teams participating in this year’s tournament is world-class from top to bottom, highlighted by current champions of three top domestic leagues as well as the reigning Champions League titleholder. Hosting this calibre of soccer competition in the U.S. is only feasible through the ICC, where these teams can compete in a highly competitive tournament in preparation for their upcoming domestic campaign.</p>

  <p><b>[Only reckless action by US president Donald Trump could prevent the country from hosting the 2026 World Cup]</b> Every day I wake up and I see our president has made a new tweet. The only thing that could possibly derail it is some crazy action on the part of our government but I can’t even imagine that. It’s ours to lose. I can’t imagine we don’t have the World Cup. I saw Sunil Gulati - our president - was almost gleeful in talking about how this was going to be by far the most profitable World Cup.<br /><br />All the stadia are done already, all the highways are done, the train stations are done. The hotels are there in the cities.<br /><br />I talked to contacts within FIFA, UEFA, CONCACAF and CONMEBOL and I think it’s almost a given that it’s going to be in the USA. I’d be shocked if they lost.</p>

  <p><b>[Charlie Stillitano, chief architect of the International Champions Cup, has moved to allay fears of European football fans by declaring that he has no intention of organising a breakaway Super League]</b> We don’t want a closed league, we don’t want a European Super League. We want to build the ICC and we’d love to make it as authentic and competitive as possible.<br /><br />We never have an intention of starting some runaway league. This has never been our intention nor is it now our intention. What we have said is we’d love if and when teams and leagues decide to do something official, we think we’re uniquely qualified to handle that. That doesn’t mean we’ll even be considered because it’s clearly up to the teams or the confederations to make the decisions. But we think we do a good job with that, we’re very respectful of the game and we’d be happy to be a part of it. We’re not forming some runaway league<br /><br />The way it was reported I completely understand the fans’ concerns. The question was really asked ‘Can a closed league work?’ and the answer is ‘Yes’ if you look at the NFL and even MLS is a closed league. But it’s anathema to what we have here in Europe.<br /><br />The guys in the NFL would argue it should be closed, you build the product, you can have consistent teams, you’ve consistent brands and you can build this together. What they’re missing is we don’t have that in Europe and it’s not part of our culture. Move on. When people read some of the things I was purposed to say I understand why they were concerned but it’s not accurate</p>

  <p><b>[We built Mourinho a swimming pool but we offered it to Zidane first]</b> The only thing that separated these two camps was the pool. So I basically said: ‘Who wants me to build them a pool?’. So we built them a pool. And Jose was really happy with what he had. To be fair we offered it to Zizou first. It was a funny situation because in the States the weather is quite different in the summer time. It more or less comes down to humidity versus no humidity. And of course everyone wants no humidity. So they all want to base themselves in southern California and places like this which is maybe a little further away but the climate’s better for them.<br /><br />This is a classic example where Jose had used UCLA from the time he was with Chelsea, to the time he was with Real Madrid, to the time he was back with Chelsea again, to now he’s with United. And he’s like ‘I want my place’ so we basically said we had to even it out.<br /><br />There is great competition among these clubs, I wouldn’t even say a friendly way. They want to be treated like they’re No.1 and I had a great statement from Umberto Gandini when he was at AC Milan.<br /><br />He said it’s OK if you pay them more than us if they’re drawing more people, we can live with that. What we can’t live with is being treated differently on the ground. So we treat everyone identically</p>

  <p><b>[Charlie Stillitano is the man who wants to steal the Champions League]</b> The way it was reported, I completely understand the fans’ concerns. We never have an intention of starting some breakaway league. This was never our intention, nor is it our intention now. The question was really asked ‘can a closed league work?’ and the answer is ‘yes’ if you look at the NFL. Even MLS is a closed league.<br /><br />The real problem we have is France and England start here, Italy and Spain start here, Germany starts in between, qualifiers and everything else. So, the challenge is the calendar. Between World Cup, Euros, play-offs, everything, it’s really hard to find a format that works. If all the really big leagues in Europe had a consistent schedule, that would be great for us. Even if it’s only 10 days, we know it’s 10 days where nobody has to go back to a Community Shield or a Super Cup.<br /><br />The World Cup this year is a great example. It ends on July 15 and we’re hearing that a lot of leagues are starting the first week in August. If you have to give players three or four weeks off, in a technical sense, there is no pre-season. Something has to give. You’re asking players to play 12 months a year and they’re human beings. We think they’re unbelievable machines but, at the end of the day, they’re human beings and they can’t play 12 months a year. The guys will burn out at some point<br /><br />Teams would come over in the old days and it was very, very different. Dilapidated stadiums and you’re just playing to the ethnic crowds. It was just strictly the Italians in the area or the English in the area and they’d come and see the games. There really weren’t many Americans<br /><br />I was used to taking care of managers like Arrigo Sacchi, Roy Hodgson, who was with Switzerland at the time, Jack Charlton and all these other guys that were around<br /><br />You learn your trade. Then, it’s just a matter of trust year after year. I think the most important thing is a little humility. If you got to carry the towels, you carry the towels. In the beginning, you do everything for people and I think that’s served us well. They know we’re willing to roll our sleeves up and do things<br /><br />I remember sitting at a table with Sir Alex Ferguson, when he was retired already, and with Mr Stephen Ross. We were sitting there and Sir Alex said: ‘Big versus Big - you’ll never go wrong’. I think that went away in our owner’s head and he said, ‘Let’s do that; let’s not fool around’.<br /><br />Mr Ross and Matt Higgins have put millions of dollars into this. I don’t think we could be here without them. We’ve done different versions of this along the years but what we’re able to do with them is buy the TV rights, buy the sponsor rights back from the team and create a platform. We can go out and sell sponsorship, we can go out and sell TV. We can do things much more than an orphan product where it’s one game here and there<br /><br />I’d love to say I’m catching lightning in a bottle, that I’m the rooster that takes credit for the sun coming up, but the reality is that they take it seriously. Because their season is starting in such a short period of time, they have to do it. The clubs need this pre-season. The beauty of our tournament is that it’s preparation and the managers have figured out to prepare<br /><br />If there are new people at their club, I’ll have a much deeper relationship with the manager than they will. It’s all about trust at the end of the day. They trust me that I’m not going to do anything silly. I trust them that they’re not going to ask me to do anything silly. Within reason, we’ll do almost anything a club asks<br /><br />I don’t think it’s collaborative in a sense we’re sitting in meetings with them but I believe it’s very friendly and we’re trying to look out for each others’ interests. The clubs go into their meetings and say ‘hey we need some time here to do our preparation’<br /><br />If and when teams and leagues decide to do something official, we think we’re uniquely qualified to handle that. That doesn’t mean we’ll even be considered because it’s clearly up to the teams or the confederations to make the decisions. But we think we do a good job with that. We’re very respectful of the game and we’d be happy to be a part of it</p>

  <p><b>[Asked about rumours that Miami will be the venue for the chosen Liga fixture, and that either Real Madrid or Barcelona will be involved]</b> Obviously we want to have a recognisable team, you know? If this were two or three years from now, it becomes less important. But I think it’s critical that we have one of the top five or six teams that’s recognisable. Obviously, everyone knows Barca and Real Madrid, but equally people know Atletico Madrid, Sevilla, Valencia. I think that it’s got to be one of the bigger teams.<br /><br />It’s not really a big part of our deal at this point. We have TV rights, we have games, we have sponsor rights - we’re doing a lot of things for the league over a 15-year period and the idea is to build the brand so that we can bring more money to the league. But this specific game won’t be a huge money game. This would be more of a brand-building, promotional exercise<br /><br />Most likely <b>[the US game]</b> will be <b>[taken from]</b> a smaller team’s stadium; it’ll be a small team’s home match. We’ll figure out different ways to accommodate the fans. We haven’t decided yet. The other part is that we want it to be so that there’s not a cup game in between so that there’s a little bit of rest for the players. We’re trying to respect the game. We’re trying to respect the players</p>

  <p><b>[On La Liga]</b> We are working with <b>[La Liga]</b> right now and nothing’s been decided. We just have to find the right game in the calendar and we want to do it this season. The other part will be that we want it to be that there’s not a cup game <b>[in the week between]</b> so there’s a little bit of rest for the players. We’re trying to respect the game, we are trying to respect the players. We know it’s a new thing and obviously in Europe, outside of the Champions League, you are not travelling great distances and this would be a big trip without question.</p>

  <p><b>[ICC organiser Charlie Stillitano admits that Jose Mourinho can be difficult to deal with]</b> Yeah we had a few cheeky words together. He’s a good man and he’s been really good to us and I understand him better than most I’d say. I think managers that I know see us as the guys who take them abroad. And for them the reality is that they take it very seriously. The managers take it very seriously. And the commercial people take it very serious for their business to grow their brand. But the managers take it more than anybody, want the right atmosphere, want the right training environment. They want to prepare their team and our tournament has become the best tournament of its kind, and its kind is really to prepare the team, so they take it very seriously. And Jose, he’s a pain in the butt when it comes to making sure everything is perfect at his training facility. And I would expect whatever teams come over from La Liga are going to torture me too in the same way to make sure that everything is perfect.</p>
