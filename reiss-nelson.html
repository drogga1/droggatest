  <p><b>[His ability is unquestioned but it remains to be seen whether <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> will look to blood him in the first team or send him out loan for further experience, as he’s previously done with the likes of <a href="kelechi-nwakali.html">Nwakali</a> and Dan Crowley]</b> I trained with the first-team during pre-season, which helped me a lot. I’ve trained a few more times with the first team since then and it’s both harder and easier at the same time. It’s harder because you have to work on concentrating for every second and thinking ahead, because the tempo and speed of play and movement is faster, but it’s easier because when you play with top-class players the accuracy and movement is better, so more of your runs and passes count</p>

  <p><b>[Reiss Nelson reveals he is already eyeing up a potential career change]</b> In some ways, I look up to <b>[Conor McGregor]</b> as a sportsman. His work rate and the effort he puts in is immense. MMA is something that I may want to get into after football. I spent some time over the summer doing a lot of kickboxing and I just felt that it was something I enjoyed doing a lot</p>

  <p><b>[Reiss Nelson says Arsenal are his ‘main goal’ again]</b> Arsenal is my main goal. After the Euros I’ll look to go back to pre-season, do that very strong and hopefully play for the team I love. I haven’t spoken to <b>[Emery]</b> yet. The recruitment team said I need to concentrate on the Euros and then we’ll get back into Arsenal later on.<br /><br /><b>[Nelson believes his time with Hoffenheim has benefited him]</b> It’s a different style the way the German players play. I think the English players like to play a lot of one and two touch and we can find each other in the pockets. In Germany it’s more physical. It’s a lot of aggressive runs in behind and getting into the box. I was happy I got that experience out there and I’m happy to be back. I learnt a lot on the pitch and I’ve had to deal with a lot off the pitch as well - the culture, the German <b>[language]</b> barrier, but I thought all in it has been a good experience and I’m ready to come back<br /><br /><b>[Nelson chasing down international glory as part of an England U21 squad]</b> We have a great team - a lot of players that are playing regularly for first teams, a lot of older lads and I think everyone has got high expectations. I think it’s good going into such a big tournament and there’s a lot of big teams so I think we need to have confidence going into it. There’s a great atmosphere and I think we’re ready for the tournament. We want to go out to win but we want to play our style and bring the trophy back to England</p>

  <p><b>[Reiss Nelson determined to take his chance at Arsenal as part of all-star Gunners attack]</b> I just want to take things as they come. It felt great <b>[to start]</b>. It was a great gesture from the boss and I’m just happy to be playing back in Arsenal colours. I went away to Germany and I think I did well. But the main goal for me has always been playing in an Arsenal shirt. I know it’s not guaranteed I’m going to be starting week in, week out with the team-mates we have. I need to be prepared all the time for whenever I get the call-up. We have Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Nicolas Pepe, Alexandre Lacazette. They are great stars and I’m still only young so I need to sit back and when I get my chance, take it<br /><br />We’re so happy to have Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. He’s been such a great addition <b>[to Arsenal]</b>. He’s always scoring or creating goals but off the ball he’s also working very hard for the team and as a striker that really helps people like me and everyone else alongside him<br /><br />The win was our main target <b>[at Newcastle]</b>. To go out there and get the three points and we did that. We had to be compact as a team and play as a team, but when we got our chances we had to execute very well and we did that. We got the goal, after that it was hard but we kept our shape and played very well. Now bring on Burnley at the weekend<br /><br /><b>[Arsenal’s head coach believes it could be several weeks before the 24-year-old is fully up to speed, but Nelson has already seen enough in training to be confident that Nicolas Pepe will be a success]</b> He’s settled in good and he looks a really good addition. We saw little glimpses at Newcastle on the pitch, you could see he has the flair we need on the right-hand side. He can cut inside and shoot. I think he will get a lot of goals for us and also assists. I’m happy to have him in the team. He’s a great addition<br /><br /><b>[The fact that the bench at Newcastle contained Nicolas Pepe, David Luiz, Lacazette, Dani Ceballos and Lucas Torreira shows the strength of depth at the club, especially when you consider Kieran Tierney, Hector Bellerin and Rob Holding are all out injured and both Mesut Ozil and Sead Kolasinac were unavailable]</b> I think this season can be very exciting for the Arsenal fans and for the team. We have all the new additions and that can only help us in the long run</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal winger Reiss Nelson is confident that he can be a hit at the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Emirates Stadium</a> this season]</b> I think this could be my time. I need to just keep training hard and getting all the information from the coaches and the players. If I do that, I’m going to have a big, big shout this season. It’s about taking those steps, doing the easy thing and getting the basics right first. Once I do that, I think I will get chances. Then it’s up to me to perform and do well for the team<br /><br /><b>[Nelson explained why the former <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> coach is such an important influence on the club’s academy graduates]</b> Unai’s very positive and always telling you to express yourself, but also he’s got that thing where he’ll tell you if you do something wrong. I think that’s good for a coach to have two sides: the jokey side and the fiery side. For me, especially, it helps me a lot to continue to improve and keep going. He helps a lot of the young players because there were a lot of them who came on the pre-season tour. He told them to be themselves, if they made a mistake just carry on. He helps them grow and gives them a great chance</p>

  <p><b>[Reiss Nelson is thankful for the advice and support he has received from <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s big characters since returning to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Emirates Stadium</a> after a loan spell in Germany]</b> It’s a great feeling to have a lot of big characters in the team who are willing to help the younger players come through and help them do well. You see the likes of <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Laca</a>, <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Auba</a> and Granit who are all big players in the team. <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> is a new addition and he’s always talking to me, always talking about the mental side of football. You can have a bad pass or a bad shot, but you need to do this to take the risk. You need to shoot to score the goal. If it goes wide, you just need to keep going and keep your head up. I think that helps you a lot<br /><br /><b>[Nelson is delighted to have been given the opportunity to show what he can do at the Emirates, but he is also eager to fight again after a setback at Burnley]</b> To be starting in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is a big achievement because I didn’t think I would start the first two games of the season. I think that’s a very big statement from the manager as well, to play me in the first two games with the likes of Pepe and <b>[Henrikh]</b> Mkhitaryan, world-class players, on the bench. I thought the manager would have eased me into it, but I did well against <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and in a couple of other pre-season games, so when the chance came, I took it well. <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> was a very tough game because they’re a very physical side and I think I did well, but I didn’t create as much as I wanted to. Against <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a>, I struggled because they are very physical, and I think I got caught on the ball a couple of times too. That’s the thing with football: you have some good games, you have some bad games but the main thing is that you go back, you recap and next week you’re ready to fight again. That’s the main thing</p>

  <p><b>[Raised in South London, Reiss Nelson details what made him the footballer he is today]</b> Aylesbury Estate was a tough, tough place. But it helped raised me. It influences my game and my life even now. I’m not the only one, either. <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> is from right nearby. That boy knows his way around the cages, I can tell you that much. Same thing with <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a>. He can play, that boy. That’s why they’ve got all that skill on the ball - that little area, it creates more talent than you could ever imagine</p>

  <p><b>[Goalscorer Reiss Nelson also praised <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a>’s rousing half-time teamtalk]</b> I think <b>[shouting a lot]</b> is good - as a coach you always need to have the aggressive side and obviously the side where he’s loving as well. In training he’s always asking us to press with passion and play with purpose. Sometimes we played out wide, sometimes we played down the middle and it’s all paying off. It gives us confidence to go forward on the Crystal Palace game <b>[on Saturday]</b>, we want to go there and we want to do well. Getting two wins at the Emirates is good and we’re just going to carry on going forward</p>

  <p><b>[Nelson: <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> can make me another Sterling or <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a> after bringing <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> knowledge to Arsenal]</b> It is crazy because you look at Sterling and Sane and you see them before at their previous teams, they weren’t doing what they do now. I think that is credit to Pep, of course, but Mikel as well because they said he did a lot of one-to-one work with them. You can see it because Mikel’s drive is different. I haven’t seen a manager with that much determination to make individuals into better players. I have all my belief in Mikel and I think he is going to make me into a top player<br /><br />There were times when I was 15 and he was doing his coaching badges that I used to get the ball and just run past everyone. That was one of my biggest traits. He used to manage that team, so he has probably seen glimpses of that. I wouldn’t say it was too easy back then, but now is a great time to have him as a manager because he understands what I am good at. Of course, he is going to give me the encouragement when I need it and if I am not doing the right stuff he is going to tell me. That’s what I really love, someone who gives me confidence, but then when I am doing the wrong thing, they tell me. I am working closely with Mikel and hopefully nailing down my spot in the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> first team</p>
