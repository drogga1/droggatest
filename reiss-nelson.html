I’ve trained a few more times with the first team since then and it’s both harder and easier at the same time. It’s harder because you have to work on concentrating for every second and thinking ahead, because the tempo and speed of play and movement is faster, but it’s easier because when you play with top-class players the accuracy and movement is better, so more of your runs and passes count</p>

  <p><b>[Reiss Nelson admits it is still my dream to play for Arsenal]</b> A loan wasn’t always my first option, but when I heard the Bundesliga and Hoffenheim was an option for me and working with the manager there, it was something I wanted to do. Julian’s a great manager and he’s got belief in young players so it’s a good place for me to go and play. He’s <b>[Nagelsmann]</b> very young, he’s only 31 and I think it’s important to go to a team and a coach who believes in you, so he was the main reason because he is willing to play us. It was hard to leave my boyhood club Arsenal, it’s still my dream to play for Arsenal, but I know I have to put that on hold and go and play abroad to get some experience in Germany. So, I’m trying to do my stuff there, get stronger and come back ready to play for Arsenal’s first team, so I had to take the opportunity to go there. I’ve settled in well and I’m enjoying it. My dad is German too, from near Munich, so I knew what to expect and I’m learning the language with an app called Babbel and it’s going well.</p>

  <p><b>[Goalscorer Reiss Nelson also praised <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a>’s rousing half-time teamtalk]</b> I think <b>[shouting a lot]</b> is good - as a coach you always need to have the aggressive side and obviously the side where he’s loving as well. In training he’s always asking us to press with passion and play with purpose. Sometimes we played out wide, sometimes we played down the middle and it’s all paying off. It gives us confidence to go forward on the <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> game <b>[on Saturday]</b>, we want to go there and we want to do well. Getting two wins at the Emirates is good and we’re just going to carry on going forward</p>

  <p><b>[Nelson: <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> can make me another Sterling or <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a> after bringing <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> knowledge to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> It is crazy because you look at Sterling and Sane and you see them before at their previous teams, they weren’t doing what they do now. I think that is credit to Pep, of course, but Mikel as well because they said he did a lot of one-to-one work with them. You can see it because Mikel’s drive is different. I haven’t seen a manager with that much determination to make individuals into better players. I have all my belief in Mikel and I think he is going to make me into a top player<br /><br />There were times when I was 15 and he was doing his coaching badges that I used to get the ball and just run past everyone. That was one of my biggest traits. He used to manage that team, so he has probably seen glimpses of that. I wouldn’t say it was too easy back then, but now is a great time to have him as a manager because he understands what I am good at. Of course, he is going to give me the encouragement when I need it and if I am not doing the right stuff he is going to tell me. That’s what I really love, someone who gives me confidence, but then when I am doing the wrong thing, they tell me. I am working closely with Mikel and hopefully nailing down my spot in the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> first team</p>
