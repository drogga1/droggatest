  <p><b>[The day <a href="mark-hughes.html">Mark Hughes</a> managed <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> despite having been sacked and replaced by Roberto Mancini]</b> I was living in Solihull at the time and I was on my way to the game with my wife and kids in the car when I got a call from the journalist saying he’d been told it was our last game today<br /><br />I got to the stadium and Mark was already in his room, he’d had the same news. It was really surreal. Mark was professional and said let’s get on with the job in hand and win the game but we knew there was no smoke without fire<br /><br />Despite all that personally I would never hear a bad word said about the club because it’s a fantastic club, it’s well run, decisions have to be made in football but our personal circumstances were sorted out very quickly and properly so you move on in football.<br /><br />Mark understood fully that when a new owner comes in they will want their own man. Everyone will say the right things but we understood that they wanted the choice. I like to think, rightly or wrongly, that the decision wasn’t made because of results, it was simply because Khaldoon and Sheikh Mansour wanted their own man in</p>

  <p><b>[Reading manager Mark Bowen has urged his players not to get carried away after Reading’s recent run of form]</b> Communication has got to be right, all of the time. We’ve got to be constantly talking to them <b>[the players]</b> and remind them of what is expected from them. If you don’t have that communication, players and staff can perhaps listen to the media side of things too much and you do get ahead of yourselves quickly. We’ve done fantastically well, but all we’ve done is put ourselves in the race for one of those promotion spots<br /><br /><b>[Mark Bowen addressed the speculation surrounding full back Tyler Blackett, with two Turkish sides, Trabzonspor and Fenerbache, reportedly vying for his signature]</b> I know he’s out of contract at the start of the season and the club has started talking to him. I see bits in the papers about this club and that club, I would say to that ‘why wouldn’t they be?’ At the same time, personally nobody has told me anything. I’ve heard nothing from the chief executive saying that there’s been contact - I’m happy about that! It does gee us up a little bit to get a move on and get a conclusion to it <b>[Blackett’s contract situation]</b><br /><br /><b>[Bowen confirmed that Laurent is on his radar as the side look to strengthen in the January window]</b> All I’ll say on that one is that I know the boy, I know he’s a talented player and he is one that a number of clubs could be interested in. Yeah, he’s on our radar, but no more than that. There’s a number of players who we look at and think that he could be a possibility for us and we will keep an eye on that situation</p>

  <p><b>[Derby maintained their late charge for the Championship play-offs with a 2-1 victory against Reading at Pride Park]</b> I’ve not had chance to talk to him yet, but it sounds like he’s reacted. I’ve been told he’s been head-butted and he’s swung a punch reacting. It’s two red cards, there’s no complaints. He’s let himself down and his team-mates as he will miss games. Whether I will take action, I don’t know until I see it properly. It’s a disappointing end to a frustrating afternoon</p>

  <p><b>[Brentford moved to within two points of the Championship’s automatic promotion places with a comfortable 3-0 victory at Reading]</b> I’ll have to choose my words carefully. In every department, I thought that Brentford were much stronger than us. They looked more brighter than us, they had more intelligence on the ball and made more right decisions than us. Brentford took their confidence, after two fantastic results, into this game<br /><br />They looked a yard quicker than us and they were a yard quicker. And that was right from the off. We’ve got to look at how we may have to freshen things up in the team. We’ve got to get back to the training ground and work on it all. And get back to doing the things that we’re good at. I expected much more from my side. You expect them to put in a good performance. Yes, that’s one point from three games - that’s the bottom line. Did we lack fight and character? We’ve just got to address that</p>

  <p><b>[Yakou Meite scored four goals, including a first-half hat-trick, as Reading heaped further pressure on struggling Luton with a thumping 5-0 win at Kenilworth Road]</b> <b>[Meite]</b> actually came to see me yesterday (Friday) and was trying to put a case forward as he wanted to play as a number nine. I was telling him, ‘sometimes you play from a wider area, yes it’s harder work as you’ve got to track full-backs, but you can find more space coming in that channel between a full-back and a centre-back’<br /><br />I walked in the dressing room and he looked at me with a wry smile on his face, so I think maybe for today I’ve won that argument. Five-nil is fantastic, but for me the most pleasing thing at five-nil was that we switched off, they went clean through and Rafa (Cabral) came out to keep a clean sheet with a point-blank save, which was huge</p>

  <p><b>[Huddersfield gained what could prove a vital point in their battle against Championship relegation with a 0-0 draw at Reading]</b> We’ll take a clean sheet, obviously. You’ll always be happy with that, whoever you’re playing and wherever you are. We were a little bit nervous tonight and little bit lacking in the final third. We showed a lack of quality in that area. Sure, our form at home is something that we have to be mindful of. We’re aware of it and, in our own backyard, we’d like to get it sorted out</p>

  <p><b>[George Puscas’ early penalty handed Reading a battling 1-0 Championship win at Charlton]</b> I felt a bit sorry for <a href="lee-bowyer.html">Lee Bowyer</a>, it was one of those days when they were screaming for everything, and got nothing. There were decisions that I raised my eyebrows at too. Maybe on another day you get a few decisions that they didn’t today<br /><br />You hope that these things even out over the season but obviously it’s tough for teams down at the bottom of the table. These things have happened to us in the past, and we have to take what we can get</p>

  <p><b>[Middlesbrough boosted their chances of avoiding relegation from the Championship with a hard-earned 2-1 win at mid-table Reading]</b> I’m obviously very disappointed. We set our stall out and started well against, as always, a <a href="neil-warnock.html">Neil Warnock</a> side that is always going to ask you questions. We went in front and then I thought that we should have had a penalty - and John Swift has also hit a post<br /><br />If one or both of those had gone in our favour, we could have gone on and possibly won the game comfortably. But we let Boro back in the game with poor defending. We then had to step up with more quality in our forward areas. Our ball retention and pass selection should have been better</p>
