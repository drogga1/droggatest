  <p><b>[The Englishman, who has been a top-flight referee for 12 years, said of his impending move to the Middle East]</b> This is an important move forward. We have professional referees in the country that I am leaving, which has been a big positive. One thing I’d like to do is work with the refereeing team and the president to make this happen so that it will be successful for many, many years to come</p>

  <p><b>[Wílmar Barrios’s headbutt on England midfielder Jordan Henderson should have seen the Colombia man sent off for violent conduct]</b> Clearly England aren’t getting any justice with the VAR system. Clearly the referee hasn’t seen it. The defender puts his head into Henderson’s chest which is a yellow card. But then he moves his head up which is violent conduct. I’d rather see the referee go to the video review area and make the correct decision which was a red card.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg believes Ronaldo’s red card was harsh]</b> The contact looked very slight and I cannot see how the additional assistant, standing some 20 yards away, could deem it violent conduct. If I had been officiating this game, I would have given Valencia a free-kick and shown a yellow card to each player. Ronaldo will serve a one-match ban but anything more would be harsh</p>

  <p><b>[Longtime referee Mark Clattenburg says Bjorn Kuipers was spot on in awarding Manchester City an early penalty against Tottenham]</b> In keeping with UEFA instruction, referee Bjorn Kuipers was right to award Manchester City a penalty when Danny Rose handled as he slid to block Raheem Sterling’s shot. Rose’s arm was outside his body and that, say UEFA, means the Spurs defender is making himself bigger. UEFA issued this instruction after similar incidents in the Champions League earlier in the season. It was always going to be a penalty once it was referred to VAR and Rose knew it, you could tell by the way his body slumped.<br /><br />This is important, a referee should always make the final call. If not, you spend the next five minutes worrying about whether the decision was right</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> referee Mark Clattenburg has agreed with the VAR call that allowed <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s opening goal against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> to stand, but says <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> explanation was incorrect]</b> VAR and Michael Oliver made the correct call in allowing <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a>’s early goal to stand, although I disagree with the reasoning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> have provided. There were strong suggestions at the time that the effort should be disallowed and a penalty awarded to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> because <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> had handled at the other end moments before the goal. However, it is the arm of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> forward <a href="bernardo-silva.html">Bernardo Silva</a> that deflects the ball onto <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a> and that is why, for me, play should not be brought back. If Silva’s arm does not divert the ball, then yes, I believe a penalty should have been awarded as <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a>’s arm is in an unnatural position and he is using it to make himself bigger. That is why I do not understand <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> explanation that it was not a deliberate handball</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> referee Mark Clattenburg says ex-Arsenal goalkeeper <a href="jens-lehmann.html">Jens Lehmann</a> was ‘miserable’ and complained about everything]</b> He was just so irritable and never stopped, one of those miserable blokes who would whinge about everything and everyone. If the ball was round, he would whinge. If the ball was white, he would whinge. You would think, ‘Just give it a rest’. He was a great goalkeeper but I honestly think this was a weakness in him and other teams identified that. They would stand on his toes at corners and he would react by pushing them<br /><br />I knew players were provoking him but he was probably lucky to avoid being sent off and giving away penalties, as would happen now - but he would do snidey, little things himself that made it difficult and I didn’t enjoy refereeing him at all. He was erratic and his antics were not easy to deal with.</p>

  <p><b>[Clattenburg is still bitter about the claim as he has not received an apology from <a href="john-obi-mikel.html">John Obi Mikel</a>]</b> I have picked <a href="john-obi-mikel.html">Mikel</a> because of the incident during a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> v <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> match in 2012 when he accused me of making a racist comment, which was not right and I was later cleared by the FA<br /><br />He has never apologised and that is disappointing because it could have ruined my life. I fell out of love with refereeing for a while after that but couldn’t quit because I had a family to support and no other career to pursue. It all left a bad feeling that still lingers today<br /><br /><a href="john-obi-mikel.html">Mikel</a> only heard the allegation from his team-mate Ramires, who did not speak English. Other <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> players have since apologised but nothing from Mikel<br /><br />He had the chance to say sorry and speak to me about it during a Nigeria friendly in the United States before the World Cup in 2014, and I would have welcomed that, but nothing, sadly</p>

  <p><b>[Former referee Mark Clattenburg has revealed what he said to silence ex-Real Madrid defender Pepe during the 2016 Champions League final]</b> Everyone always asks about the incident in the 2016 Champions League final when I did that thing with my tongue as he was rolling around on the floor, play-acting. In my head I was thinking: ‘How soft are you for a big man?’. He did it twice in that game, trying to get an <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> player sent off. Another referee might have fallen for it but I’d done my homework and, while you should try not to pre-judge, I knew exactly what his mentality was like and I needed that knowledge to handle him. He was another player you just couldn’t trust. A game could be easy and straightforward then he would do something sly<br /><br />In that final <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> went 1-0 up in the first half but the goal was slightly offside and we realised at half-time - it was a hard call and my assistant missed it. I gave Atletico a penalty early in the second half when Pepe fouled <a href="fernando-torres.html">Fernando Torres</a>. Pepe was furious and said to me in perfect English: ‘Never a penalty, Mark.’ I said to him: ‘Your first goal shouldn’t have stood.’ It shut him up. People might think that sounds odd, because two wrongs don’t make a right and referees don’t think like that, but players do. I knew by saying that to him it would make him more accepting of the situation, but he was a wind-up merchant and not fun to referee one bit, you had to be on your guard constantly</p>
