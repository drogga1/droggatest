<blockquote>
  <p><b>[John Askey shared a glass of wine with opposite number Pep Guardiola]</b> They have really looked after us. They invited the players in after the game and they have been having a bit of a laugh, especially about Popey and <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a> as you can imagine. I was waiting for someone to pinch me and wake me up <b>[when Pope scored]</b>. No, I thought I was dreaming. It wasn’t just that it was a goal, it was the way it was scored as well. I am just a bit disappointed with the goals that we conceded - two were VAR decisions which were within a whisker of being offside - and the first one was a deflected shot that was going wide. I couldn’t have really have asked much more from my players</p>
