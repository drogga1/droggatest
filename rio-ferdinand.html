All of a sudden almost the entire Dutch team turn up in this bar. sat down next to Wesley Sneijder and said ‘What’s going on? Are you allowed in here?’ He was like, ‘Yeah, the manager said to go. As long as we’re back in the hotel by 11, it’s fine’.<br /><br />Our players are treated like complete babies. It doesn’t really matter whether that’s because people have made mistakes in the past, or the manager doesn’t trust the players or he doesn’t trust the media who would make a story of it.

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand believes Michael Carrick is crucial to the Manchester United cause]</b> What <b>[Mourinho]</b> needed to do was find a formation and find the personnel to fit it. He’s come across it, and the real crux of that was within the football club when he got there, and that’s Michael Carrick. I said it under Louis van Gaal and David Moyes: Michael is so crucial to the football team. It’s obvious how good he is on the ball, but I think more important is how he is defensively. The roving eye just looking for an entertaining football match probably won’t see it, but in terms of defensive positions and shielding the back four, he’s one of the best I’ve played with. I think he’s the best around at the moment.<br /><br />Another key to United’s improvement has been the form and the star quality of the summer signings. Pogba, Mkhitaryan and Ibrahimovic are world-class superstars. We’re now back into signing world-class players<br /><br />With Mourinho, I just think it’s a case of how long it’s going to take him to get things how he wants them. I think, looking at the run we’re on now, finishing in the top four is definitely something we can look at. Anything beyond that would be great but I’m not looking any further than getting back into the Champions League, consolidating and moving on from there</p>

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand says he saw the penny dropping for Cristiano Ronaldo early into his Manchester United career]</b> He liked taking liberties when he first came, taking people on, making people look silly and doing skills before coming back to beat them again. His whole thing when he first signed was about showmanship, he’d listen to the fans when he’d do that bit of skill, when he’d do that step-over. Whereas then there was that turning point around that time when it was about goals, assists. Then he became the game-changer, rather than the showman. That’s that maturity and the penny dropping.</p>

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand believes Wayne Rooney’s willingness to do a job for the good of the collective cause has prevented him from reaching the levels achieved by Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> Cristiano had an absolute desire to be the best individual in the world. Wayne would say: ‘I want to be the world’s best but I’ll do it by being a team player’.<br /><br />That has not allowed him to be a 40-goals-a-season man he could have been. You have got to remember he was playing left-wing-half the time when Ronaldo was there for the last couple of years to cover full-backs who had started to attack more. He would do that with no questions asked. There are not a lot of players with Wayne Rooney’s profile who would have accepted that type of decision<br /><br />The big thing for Wayne Rooney has been to get through that barrier of 250. That was a lot of pressure. People were always talking about it. Every time he was asked about it and was thinking about it in the back of his mind. Getting there might just release a fresher Wayne Rooney. But you cannot get away from when your body is telling you one thing. I think Wayne is the only person who will know it is over. I don’t think he is at that point yet. He can contribute in many ways</p>

He’d be effective anywhere - from the right to the left, central. Griezmann obviously <b>[would play]</b> as the number nine, but right now might be too early. Ibrahimovic is banging in goals. If they became available, Manchester United have to be in that.</p>

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand believes Liverpool’s struggles since Sadio Mane’s departure to the Africa Cup of Nations proves that they lack the depth to win the Premier League]</b> Liverpool are missing Sadio Mane, his vital unpredictability, running in behind and with pace, and haven’t won since he went to the Africa Cup of Nations. It’s shown where their problem lies, the difference between Liverpool’s squad and the title winners I played for: a lack of depth. When your main men aren’t there, or aren’t firing, you need others to pick up the mantle. Chelsea? When Diego Costa missed a game their left-back even stepped forward and scored. Liverpool haven’t had that. Now is the time for the likes of Divock Origi and Daniel Sturridge to grab the bull by the horns, come to the fore and say: ‘This is what I can do.’ Mane’s absence was a big moment for both those players and so far they’ve disappointed.<br /><br />We’ve been talking about Sturridge for a long time in terms of talent and he’s come in for some stick in recent weeks, so now is the time to show his mettle, show his heart, and go out and show what he’s made of. I see another flaw in their squad - there’s not much experience in terms of winning. Only James Milner, Sturridge and Emre Can have won big leagues - and Sturridge and Can were youngsters who made just a few appearances for Chelsea and Bayern Munich’s title- winning teams respectively<br /><br />They have a lot of youth and vibrant talents but … they need to start investing in winners. I totally believe in Jurgen Klopp. He is a manager I would love to have played for. Defensively, I see weakness. Dejan Lovren makes mistakes and Milner is not a natural full-back. They are not sure about the goalkeeper, and I don’t see much protection: if Liverpool don’t win the ball early you can get onto their back four quite easily<br /><br />There are ways of getting at Chelsea. There’s space behind their wing-backs. But they have the know-how to get a result at Anfield. If Liverpool don’t win, they’re out of the title race - though in reality I see Arsenal and Tottenham as the only clubs capable of overhauling Chelsea</p>

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand feels he has identified the perfect role model for Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge in the form of Chelsea star Pedro]</b> He’ll stand there, as he did a few days ago, and say his goal ratio is great, but teams need players they can rely on every week. I look at him, sitting there as Liverpool’s third-choice striker, not even coming on as substitute half the time, and his abilities are so much greater than that. This is his moment, his time to grab it. Top players don’t want to tell you about their stats. I hate it. Don’t talk, I don’t care. Just go and do it. ‘My goal ratio is … ‘ I’m afraid talk can sound like weakness, like you’re making excuses. The top forwards I played with - Ronaldo, Rooney, Van Nistelrooy - just spoke in performances and goals. Sturridge needs look no further than across the tunnel at the Chelsea side to see an example he should follow: Pedro.<br /><br />People were hammering Pedro at the start of the season and now he’s one of Antonio Conte’s most important players and he has turned it round on the pitch, not by talking. Pedro’s a winner. He was integral to Barcelona’s great team; the first person to trigger their press in forward areas. He was a nightmare to play against. The way he has stood up to be counted at Chelsea is what Liverpool need not just from Sturridge but several other players in Mane’s absence</p>

They finish in the top four and he <b>[Wenger]</b> gets a new contract. So, the priority of the people that run Arsenal is obviously to finish in the top four and not necessarily winning. That is how it seems. They’ll be happy. That’s been the way it has been. History tells you that’s the way it goes.<br /><br />You don’t even have to write the article. If you just say Robin van Persie, that’s it. He left Arsenal football club to go somewhere to win And he came to Manchester United. It’s as simple as that. Tells you everything. Cesc Fabregas done the same. The best players in the world want to win things. It’s not about money. The best players want to win<br /><br />In the days of Manchester United and Arsenal rivalry, they were unbelievable games. When we went to Highbury and then we went to The Emirates, you would have to fight. You would have to win the fight first and then you could play your football. But it was never a given that you were going to go there and win. That mentality has not been there for a long time and this team is no different to the team six years ago in terms of mentality. You’re in a good position to strike and really make a go of it in the league and you have a week or two off<br /><br />The best teams, like Chelsea, they get beat <b>[by Tottenham]</b> and come back straightaway. Everyone is saying, they might have a wobble but they haven’t lost since then. The reason I always get the hump with Arsenal is that they frustrate the life out of me. They’ve got so much talent but it’s never channelled the right way. It’s never consistently put out there, week in, week out and that’s their problem</p>

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand believes Michael Keane is capable of making a similar impact to Paul Pogba]</b> He likes to ask questions, he likes constructive criticism and that’s a great attribute to have, to be there, to look at your game in detail and try and improve. He’s always wanting to improve, whether it’s nutrition, whether it’s physical, whether it’s actual working on your game after training. He was always wanting to learn and understand more.<br /><br />I think the moment he found out he was going to leave Manchester United - every kid’s dream in that area is to play for Manchester United - so to leave the club was a huge wrench for him. But it allowed him to go and spread his wings and bloom really and become the player he is now. At Manchester United he wasn’t afforded that opportunity, for whatever reason. You look at the likes of Pogba; he’s gone away and come back now and become a huge star. Michael Keane, he could do that himself</p>

If he has an option now to go from Arsenal to Manchester City or Manchester United, as a footballer who wanted to win trophies and be judged on trophies, Manchester City looks like the place to go. They are top of the league and going to win the league this season. They are in the Champions League, they look like they will be in the final of the League Cup and the FA Cup as well potentially. So he’s got more opportunities to win trophies there.<br /><br />He knows Pep. He’s been with Pep and has more of an idea. If Pep wants him again now, I’m sure he’s thinking: ‘I’m going to go there second time round and do it properly this time’. As a professional, you’d have to say that the balance of power is starting to come back to an even keel almost and then going City’s way. You look at Manchester City and they’re so far ahead of everybody else, not just in points but in the way and style they play. They’re taking teams out before they even get on to the pitch.</p>

That very picture would almost certainly have gone through their minds at some point leading up to that game. So to see the way the Manchester United team came back from two goals down, and it could have been more had City finished their chances, signifies to me that these guys really do care about playing for the shirt and how desperate they were not to allow that nightmare to become a reality! That is the type of pressure these games bring on - can you as an individual get rid of those terrible images and concentrate on the job in hand, or will you allow yourself to be drowned in such negativity that you can hardly warm up without it being on your mind constantly, and your warm-up is 25 minutes of bad touches and anxiety! uuThis, can I add, all before the actual game begins - mental warfare!

He surpassed them a while ago. They were great players, but Figo knows he is not on the same page.<br /><br />A defeat on the first day puts you in a bad way for the rest of the tournament so it’s important to start well.

I’m a United fan, and I want to see them win the title, but I fear it’s going to be very difficult for that to happen this season.

But it will take more than a quality defender to galvanise them, and this is where you have to respect Mourinho’s track record and his history of winning trophies. Do I think he will still be manager of Manchester United this time next year? Put it this way: I hope so, because if he is still there, it means they have been successful and won something. I wouldn’t write him off. He has won 20 trophies as a manager. He knows how to galvanise teams by instilling a siege mentality sometimes and he is going to need all his dark arts to create that atmosphere of ‘Manchester United against the world’ to make them formidable again. But it’s not just new signings that is going to be the catalyst. It’s the manager who sets the tone, and he’s got a few big issues to address.<br /><br />He’s got to get Paul Pogba to play for United the way he did for France at the World Cup. The talent at Mourinho’s disposal is undeniable. But can he get the best out of them, and play in a way that maximises their ability?

But it’s not the Man Utd of 10 years ago where they were dominating and that was the given every single time we went into the Champions League they were minimum semi-finalists. So it’s different now and this is a process of building still, Man Utd aren’t where they want to be as a team yet and they’re building towards that so I don’t think anyone can sit there and say Man Utd should be semi-finalists or finalists because even in their own league they’ve not won it yet, they’re still building<br /><br />It wasn’t the ideal scenario seeing them go out like that, against a team that you would probably have expected them to beat on paper, but that’s football. I think looking forward to this season it’s a tough group but it’s an exciting group. You’ve got Juventus coming to town as well with Ronaldo which is a great factor added to it. I think they’ll qualify from that group. I think Mourinho tactically knows how to play in the Champions League<br /><br />I don’t think they’re going to be as potent. We saw it last year, whenever he’s there when the chips are down and something needs doing, Ronaldo would step up and get them out of a hole. I don’t know if they’ve got that player anymore. The pressure’s now on Gareth Bale, can Bale step up and be that man? We all know he’s got the ability and potential to do it, the stage is there for him now so I’d love to see him be that guy.

There’s other parts of his game that I saw glimpses of in the World Cup for Belgium where it looked like he’s adding to his game, and we want to see that in a Man Utd shirt as well. But as an out-and-out goalscorer, his record stands up against anyone’s at the moment. He’s scoring goals, it doesn’t matter who he scores against really, does it? He’s still scoring goals. Are all the other strikers around the Premier League like Harry Kane and that scoring that many more goals against the bigger teams? I don’t know. So people keep hitting him with that one but I don’t see other people really being dominant against the top six.</p>

Chelsea came here last week and had 70 per cent of the possession, one player <b>[Jorginho]</b> got 180 passes. Man Untied might not have had 180 passes between all of the players on the pitch, especially in the opponent’s half. I don’t see them having two or three passes in succession. That’s criminal almost. You’ve got to work hard. You have that shirt on your back, you’ve got to keep it from anyone else. I don’t see enough players working hard to say to the manager ‘this is my place in the team and I’m going to stay here’. Before we talk about what happened in the week, about formations, you’ve got to work hard and they didn’t. That’s the most disappointing thing for me</p>

You can’t let a situation like this continue throughout the season - wars in the press, leaks, players on one side of the dressing room, Mourinho and his staff on the other.

Where you could see for example, <b>[Robert]</b> Snodgrass coming to the pitch with an incredible attitude that he wants to eat the ball and eat everyone around him. You need that humility. You have always to try. That’s my nature as a football professional. There are certain qualities that you have or you don’t have. I think a team that comes with that mental fragility, after the bad result <b>[against Derby]</b> and to come here and in five minutes to be 1-0 down, is not good. No VAR and obviously a linesman <b>[makes a]</b> mistake and a goal. Then in the first half we had a good reaction but an own goal makes it 2-0.

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand admitted that he didn’t believe that Manchester United could overcome Paris Saint-Germain]</b> I didn’t have the confidence in these boys to do it, with 10 boys out, I didn’t see this result coming after the way PSG played in the first leg. <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> was brave with his team selection, he had three teenagers on the pitch, the character of these players after the starvation of moments like this. The confidence this will give them. Ole has brought belief back to this team. People were doubting Lukaku - he’s one of many who has been given a new lease of life. I don’t think it’s a penalty but turning your back, as a defender, you get punished for things like that.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk remains behind Real Madrid skipper Sergio Ramos]</b> I’d still put Sergio Ramos there. Ramos, when the big games come up, the trophies are there to be won, he’s normally standing there with his sleeves rolled up. He is not being shifted at the moment. To be considered the best in the world, you have got to win stuff as well. You cannot just play well for your team and sit there as runner-up or coming third or fourth. That’s why, when people talk about Player of the Year and you see they haven’t won anything but they are the best player, I am thinking: ‘How? You haven’t influenced a team to win things.’<br /><br />You need to be part of a team that is winning to be considered like that. Virgil is a fantastic player, potentially the best in the world but, right now, no. And I’d think he would agree. Winning is an essential part of winning personal accolades. You have to win. If Liverpool win the league it’s legit, but it would feel odd if he is the best player and they have come second or third.<br /><br /><b>[Asked if Van Dijk should take the award]</b> Virgil? No, no. There’s Raheem Sterling. Heung-min Son, though Tottenham have not won anything yet, Sergio Aguero, David Silva. Bernardo Silva, by the way … It’s difficult if they win the league</p>

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand has called Cristiano Ronaldo a living football god]</b> He is a living football god, it is ridiculous what he is doing. In the Champions League he has every record you could imagine. He’s the joint-hat-trick man with Messi. The first goal is like Duncan Ferguson in his prime, attacking the ball, leaving the full-back in a heap and saying: ‘This is me’. That is called desire. This is against an Atletico Madrid team which is known for having an unbelievable defence. And they’ve gone and scored three goals and he’s got a hat-trick</p>

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand believes Liverpool are playing with the handbrake on]</b> They’ve been great this season but they need to take advantage of this opportunity. They don’t come around all the time. What I’ve been seeing from Liverpool in the big matches is a bit of nervousness creep into their game - they’re playing with a handbrake on at times. They’re playing a little bit uptight, and it’s understandable because they’ve not won anything for years. What has excited everyone about this Liverpool team under <b>[Jurgen]</b> Klopp is the freedom they play with, and at the moment it’s a bit too stop-start for my liking. The Premier League is the hardest title to win, at United we were fortunate to win as many times as we did during my spell there. You’re competing against some of the biggest and best teams in world football at the end of the day.<br /><br />I think Liverpool will be the happier of the two teams going into this leg. Bayern are going through a transition phase and their best players are still <b>[Arjen]</b> Robben and <b>[Franck]</b> Ribery. They aren’t the side they once were, so I’d be very surprised if Liverpool didn’t go through. If they get an away goal they can shut up shop, so I’m pretty sure they’ll go through. You look at the experience they had last year and I’m sure that will stand them in good stead this time around. If they don’t pick up any injuries I think they’ll have a decent chance of winning it</p>

He’s the best kid, better than you Wayne when you were a kid, better than Rio, better than Ryan Giggs when he was a kid. This is the best kid you’ll ever see.’ He used to take liberties with players in training, even as a 16-year-old. But the concentration levels that you need to be on it every day, he could never get that all married together. The team he played in with Pogba, Lingard, Adnan Januzaj, who was a bit younger, they looked at this guy like he was a superhero because of what he could do with a football. I tried to reach out to him but sometimes some people are in a position where they distance themselves from people once they leave the football club, and what they do outside the football club can, in the end, affect what they do out there on the pitch. If you’ve got bad habits as a young kid, as an adult, then it will affect your performances on the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd defeats don’t hurt <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>’s job hopes]</b> hese two defeats were a setback, but it changes nothing for me. He has done more than enough to deserve a chance to have the job and I believe the club have only one decision to make when they appoint their next manager. When he came in the door, if someone said to the United owners that they would be knocking on the door of the top four in the Premier League and in the Champions League quarter-finals, they would have jumped at that. He won all those games at the beginning and it is inevitable that his team will slip up at some point. Look at where they were when the previous manager left and compare it to the mood around the club now. You have to give a lot of the credit for that revival to <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> and that’s why I believe he has to get the job.<br /><br />We have tried different managers, tried different philosophies and finally we have gone back to what worked in the past and what will work in the future. I just hope the club’s owners realise that the way they have run the club and the managerial changes they have made at a rapid rate is not how United works. You need people in charge of the team that understand this club and that is what we have got now. I didn’t think United had a chance against PSG when the draw was made and they had an even slimmer chance after losing the first leg 2-0 at Old Trafford, but they got through and they did it after producing a top-class performance in Paris. That display alone shows why <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> has earned the right to have a chance to be the club’s next permanent manager and I’m sure he will get that opportunity</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United should move for rising England star Jadon Sancho]</b> I would take him <b>[at Manchester United]</b> all day. English, young, hungry and talented, that’s all I need to know. I have known Jadon since he was a kid, knew him through friends. I have known his family since he was a kid, before he was even born. He has got the mentality. The mentality is a big part of it all, whether he has the physical attributes or not. The kid’s mentality, to leave Manchester City, who wanted him to stay, to just say ‘My ability deserves it and I think I can do it straight away, right now. I am not waiting’. And he has gone and done that. You have to respect that. So if someone asked me whether I would take Jadon Sancho, with all due respect to Borussia Dortmund, I would say yes, 100 per cent<br /><br />I think English youngsters moving abroad is good, it is good. I don’t see it as a negative, so long as not all of them are going! I think in the long run it will be great for the national team. They are learning a different style of play and different cultures. They can bring that back into the melting pot of England and I think it is beneficial for Gareth Southgate’s squad. England will continue to improve, because we have got the underbelly of talent coming through at every level<br /><br /><b>[Ferdinand also believes the arrival of young blood such as Sancho at Old Trafford can help United back to the top]</b> They are going to be challenging the older ones and you need that within football and within Manchester United’s squad. You need the younger players to come in and push the others on. History has shown that. The Class of ‘92, Sir Alex Ferguson invested in young players after that as well, replenishing the squad, always bringing in young and hungry players</p>

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand believes cold, hard cash helped to break down barriers for black players in the English game]</b> I am around scouts all the time and the days of them picking white players over black players are long gone. To be blunt, it’s all about the pound note now. Scouts, agents and clubs will take anyone who will make everyone a lot of money and that is why we have seen more and more black players at the top clubs now. It’s just reflective of society. We see black players in every Premier League team now and no one thinks twice about it. That’s how it should be. A good player is a good player no matter what the colour of his skin might be, but there are still some prejudices out there and we see them come to the surface at times.<br /><br />For example, I think Raheem Sterling has been judged by the colour of his skin at times. He has alluded to that himself and it is not far from the truth. What we are seeing with Sterling now is a young man who has spoken out, put himself out there to be criticised and he has taken it and gained so much respect. It is not easy to speak out at times, but he has done it in an articulate manner and we can all see that attitudes have changed towards him. Clearly that open-minded mentality is not the same when it comes to black managers, and there is one big reason for that. Black players have 30, 40, 50 years of proven success at the highest level, but black managers don’t have that. Black managers have not been given their chance to prove they can be successful, and that creates a fear factor for club chairmen when they consider employing people of colour.<br /><br /><b>[On new football movie ‘90 Minutes’]</b> This movie is real life, this is what football is all about for most of the people who play it. We see the glitz and the glamour of the Premier League on TV every week and hear about all the money the top players earn, but this is what football is like for most people. Raw passion, a desperation to win and a desire to get away from your life for an hour and a half with your mates on a Sunday. What I think people will take away from this is the feeling between the players, their friends and what it means to be a Sunday league player. What you see on this film was not set up. This is how it was, it was pure. It was a very organic process and what you see on the screen is reflective of how a football match looks on Hackney Marshes every weekend.<br /><br />The idea behind this film was to show the relationships between the people and not to focus on football. You look at the screen and there are plenty of people of colour there. We didn’t say we wanted a set number of black players or Asian players because the point of this was to have a film that was a glimpse of what you see on Hackney Marshes every Sunday. We need to see more black faces on TV. Films and television programmes that are based in the UK should be more reflective of the society we live in here. This country is a mix of so many cultures now and sometimes that isn’t in evidence on TV. There is work to do in that sense for sure. What we have done with this film is produce a piece of work that shows life in every colour imaginable, and even though it is quite low budget, I’m happy with the final project. I used to play on Hackney Marshes, I played some school matches there. There were thugs everywhere in those matches, or at least it felt like that, so you were just happy to get off the pitch in one piece. There was some talk about whether we should celebrate at the end of the game because you might end up getting jumped by the opposition and their mates, but they were good days, happy days. That is why I think ‘90 Minutes’ will appeal to football fans. It might have been filmed in London, but this is a film that could be have been made on any Sunday league pitch because the vibe is the same up and down the country. Sunday football is where it starts for everyone. Whether they have made it or they were not good enough to take up a career in the game, everyone has done it and that is why it is so easy to relate to this movie</p>

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand believes the next big challenge facing <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> at Manchester United is getting Alexis Sanchez back to his best]</b> He will be aiming to get the best out of Sanchez. Ole has gotten the best out of every other player in the squad since he has come. One of them is not going to do it. At the moment, Sanchez isn’t playing at the level that we have seen him play at Arsenal. He will want to get back to that for personal pride. Ole and his coaching staff will be aiming to get him back into that rhythm and producing that quality he had at Arsenal consistently at United.<br /><br />Since Ole has come you would say <b>[Marcus]</b> Rashford, <b>[Paul]</b> Pogba and <b>[Victor]</b> Lindelof have been the most improved. Those three have been standouts for me. David de Gea is the best keeper in the league by a mile<br /><br />My opinion hasn’t changed. If you said to the owners when Ole took over that, fast-forward to now, United would be fighting for fourth place and be in the Champions League they would have bitten your arm off. So, I think that Man United’s players are mentally in a much better space. It is up to Ole to keep driving that and keep improving with that. I think the result they got in Paris is a springboard for this team because everything was against them. Ten players out injured and suspended. We went there and beat a team that was fancied by many people to win it. That will do them a world of good so they won’t go into this game <b>[with Barcelona]</b> with fear I don’t think<br /><br />Whether you have made it to the top of football or you haven’t, at some point you have played in Sunday football. For people to get up on a Sunday, not getting paid to do it, but because it is something that they love it is a great thing. That’s the beauty of it. That’s what was good about doing the walk-on cameo in Hackney Marshes where I played as a kid a few times. You just see everyone out there playing for the love of the game. All shapes and sizes, all ages. Half-time cigarette, they love it. <b>[I remember being]</b> cold. Getting changed on the sidelines and being cold. Mud everywhere. Half-time oranges chopped up. Just having fun, I enjoyed it. Some of my best memories and most vivid memories are of playing Sunday football as a kid. So, I love it. The film is not necessarily around the 90 minutes of the game but everything that shoots off around that. His friends, the different characters and the different goings-on around football. It is funny, it is light-hearted, it is a low-budget film. I think it has turned out well. I have never wanted to be pigeonholed or put in a box and be told that’s what you are. That’s what you will stay as. I think I have always had that since I was a kid. That’s why I have done gymnastics or ballet. I have always been interested in doing lots of different things. So, as I have grown older and got my football right and I was playing consistently, playing well, winning things, I was able to branch out. I allowed myself to think about things outside and think what’s going on outside and business wise. When I was 27 or 28, I started to feel confident enough so that I could look outside of just being a footballer and get involved in a different business. I never wanted to do it and allow people the excuse to say ‘oh, he has taken his eye off the ball’. As long as I kept doing well football-wise then no one could say anything negative towards me, because I am getting my football right. So, I have a restaurant, clothing range, foundation, movies, documentaries and doing any content. Video content especially. All sorts of forms; long, short and medium. I love all that, and in the digital age, there’s so much, and it moves so fast</p>

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand believes the endless debate over who should be hailed as the greatest between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo needs to end]</b> We are blessed that we are in the presence of these two amazing footballers and it doesn’t matter if you think one is better than the other at this stage. They are both just ridiculous talents and what puts them so far ahead of everyone else is their mental strength. That area of their game never ceases to amaze me and separates them from everyone else. It is something I marvel at, definitely. To consistently want to do what they have done at that level for so long is not something many people have and, when you throw in their talent, it’s an incredible combination. The joy for us as viewers is watching this incredible battle between two great players who are clearly being driven on by the fact they are playing in the same era of the game.<br /><br />If Ronaldo scores a hat-trick one night in the Champions League, you just know Messi will follow up the next night with a hat-trick of his own or some kind of crazy goal that only he can score. It’s great TV and we should relish it. I think these two have definitely been driven on by each other and we have seen examples of how this works in other sports as well.<br /><br />Rodger Federer and Rafael Nadal are examples of two incredible sporting talents that have had to go to the next level and the next level because they are pushing each other on. It was the same when (John) McEnroe and (Bjorn) Borg were at the top of tennis. They have always had someone to compete with. Muhammad Ali with Joe Frazer and George Foreman pushing him is another example.<br /><br />What Ronaldo and Messi are doing is just amazing, but I’m not surprised to see Cristiano at this level. From the moment we saw him at United, all of us in the dressing room said he was going to be the best player in the world and that is what he became. What’s amazing with these two is they have not just been the best player in the world for one or two years, which was the norm up to this point. They have been the best players in the world for 10 and 12 years, which is ridiculous.</p>

To shift blame on him from a game like today, I think no one’s come out of this with any flying colours. It’s going to be over the time that Ole’s been here and Ole will have to judge: ‘Do I build the team around him and the ability that he’s got and the attributes that he has?’ or if Paul wants to leave.

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> defender Rio Ferdinand says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> new boy Maguire a leader of men]</b> Most expensive defender of all time <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> signs for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> for £80m. Funny enough we’ve both been there! Is there pressure? Yes. Is there expectation from across the world? Definitely. Are all eyes on me? 100%. Will your teammates be expecting big things? Of course. Will people be expecting a massive change in the team’s fortune? Most definitely. These were the feelings, questions that were surrounding me when signing for the great club Manchester United<br /><br />Being a centre-back, I have took a keen interest in <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a>’s game since being linked with <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> under <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a>. He has made huge strides in the right direction and improved in all areas of his game. He’s grown into someone who can lead and be a leader of men and shown at both ends of the pitch he can be effective. He has composure, willingness on the ball as well as the ability to drive out from the defence which I feel is as good as anyone in the game right now.<br /><br />Does he have things to work on? Of course, like everyone else! After speaking to numerous people that know him, they all say what a level-headed, hard-working lad he is who will give 110% for his team, which he echoed when signing. I think something <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> have needed defensively in recent years is a big character who can take on the responsibility of leading from the back and from what I’ve heard from people who know him well, they are confident that he will bring that to this football club. I would like to wish him well in the No. 5 shirt of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and hope he can help bring back success to our club. Good luck <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a>!</p>

They’ve come for all the right reasons, which are to help the football club improve, to improve themselves as players, and that’s a great step in the right direction obviously. I don’t think it’s necessarily about where the players are from, I think it’s a case of, are they the right people? Have they got the right work ethic? Have they got the right philosophies? Have they got the right beliefs? And are they hard-working? I think if you get those things in a dressing room and that overrides backgrounds and where they’re from<br /><br /><b>[Ferdinand adds that United supporters are savvy enough not to expect too much too soon from their evolving senior squad]</b> I don’t think this is something we can call an overnight turnaround, it’s going to take time and I think <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> fans are not silly. They’re good football people who understand the game and if they can see that the club is going in the right direction and their philosophies are right for the club, I think they’ll back the manager in charge and they’ll back the team. In recent years there have been moments when they’ve probably thought, ‘Where are we going here?’ There’s not been a clear picture</p>

I remember when it happened to me, none of my mates spoke about the price, it was more about the players I was going to playing with. I think the big difference is that I went into a changing room that was full of winners, consistent winners. It is not an easier scenario for Maguire but a different pressure. I was expected to come in and know how to win, to come in and win straight away. I was expected to come straight in and hit the top level because that’s where they were playing at.

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand says <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> is the number one role model for his two sons, Tate and Lorenz, as they track the <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> star’s career]</b> <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> is number one for them because he has scored so many goals, big goals and he has played in World Cups. They see that as success and something that they want to be able to do. Yes, he is a superstar but he is a nice and humble guy. They love his vibe. I like him being a role model for them because he says all the right things. His endorsements even are with the right companies. More importantly, when he signs a new deal, he has his family all around him. As a superstar, he is one I like my kids to follow. They also like <b>[Virgil]</b> <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a> and my older one is a goalkeeper. His favourites are <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a>, <a href="ederson.html">Ederson</a> and Marc-Andre ter Stegen<br /><br /><b>[It was at Man United where he saw <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> innovate to get to the top of the sport and he has advised youngsters like <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> to emulate him and <a href="lebron-james.html">LeBron James</a> by building a support staff around them]</b> With the amount of money in the game, these guys need to take a page out of either <a href="lebron-james.html">LeBron James</a> or <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>’s book. 17 seasons in the NBA at the top, that’s absolutely ridiculous. For <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, <b>[he is]</b> 34 now and he is still at the top and he has been in the top two players in the world for more than a decade. He was the first person I saw invest in a team. I went around his house and I saw about 10 people in his front room. I said, who are these people? What’s going on?<br /><br />He said, that’s my chef, that’s my physio, that’s the doctor and that’s my personal trainer. He left Man United as the best player in the world. He was on the right track. They have both invested huge money in having the right team around them for their body and mind to perform at the highest level consistently. I think if you give young players advice, then I would say if you have the resources then invest in yourself like that<br /><br /><b>[Ferdinand proceeded to pick a best eleven of the next generation of footballers that are exciting him as he looks at possible role models for people to follow]</b><br /><br /><a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> is the standout as we wait for <a href="vinicius-junior.html">Vinicius</a> to blow but <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> is a different level to the others. Him and <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Hudson-Odoi</a> are way up there and will be England’s wingers for a while. <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> is ahead of <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Hudson-Odoi</a> who has been injured for a while and he has played more games but both will get to the top. De Jong is awesome. What he did at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> last season was a joke. He played like a veteran player. He has poise, tactical nouse, composure. All the attributes you need to be in a top team. He can take games by control or the scruff of the neck. He is the best young midfielder around.<br /><br />Maddison is doing really well this season and I think he should get to make his England debut. If <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> is deserving, then he is equally deserving. <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> is like a winger at full back with his creativity. <a href="ben-chilwell.html">Ben Chilwell</a> is great at left-back. I love him and I think someone will buy him. He is top. He can go forward or defend. His final third distribution and crossing is great. I like both <a href="fikayo-tomori.html">Fikayo Tomori</a> and Ben Godfrey. From a mental perspective, if I look at a strong player to follow, I think of Matthijs De Ligt. He looks like a strong leader. He was a captain at 18-19 at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. He made a big move to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> to compete with <a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Leonardo Bonucci</a> and <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Giorgio Chiellini</a> who are mainstays and stalwarts of defenders. He could have gone anywhere in the world and he has gone somewhere where he has a good chance of winning the Champions League but he also has a hard task of getting into a back-two pairing that has been successful. Mentally, he is the one I look to and go he is amazing. <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>’s goalkeeper <a href="gianluigi-donnarumma.html">Gianluigi Donnarumma</a>, they talk about him like <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Gianluigi Buffon</a>. He has had years at the top<br /><br />I have kids now and my two boys love football, I spoke to them and asked them where do you get your training stuff from apart from me? They don’t listen to me much anyway. They said YouTube. I said, where do you go, how do you know it is the right thing? They just said if it looks good we use it. That triggered me to think this is what my kids need. They can use this without me there. This spoke to me in that way. It is a tool and an app that’s beneficial to kids to inspire them to be elite footballers</p>

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand has questioned why <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> decided to go public in his punishment of <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> for a throat grab on England colleague <a href="joe-gomez.html">Joe Gomez</a>]</b> Gareth has handled being England manager brilliantly - up to this point. He has conducted himself in an admirable, eloquent &amp; engaging way. Helping to make a nation feel like they can have some sort of confidence &amp; respect for the national team. However, I feel this incident could have been handled better.<br /><br />Keep it behind closed doors &amp; deal with it internally surely?! Come international week, it’s meet up time between Sterling &amp; Gomez… <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> was still upset with Gomez about the result on Sunday &amp; their little pushing/words said during the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> vs <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> game. So he has obviously gone into the England camp heated and gone for Gomez, <b>[and]</b> in doing so grabbed Gomez by the throat. Obviously as a manager I’m sure having a harmonious squad is the best scenario - handshakes and hugs on sight not confrontations. But let’s be honest now this kind of stuff isn’t uncommon in squads full of testosterone.<br /><br />In the various squads I have been a part of I have seen players get punched in the face, ribs broken, nose busted, head kicked like a football…..a throat grab was the equivalent of the intricate handshake embraces that are all too familiar today! The main question is: Why this couldn’t be handled internally? I suppose the management have felt it would be better to nip it in the bud prior to the press, agents, family friends leaking the news. However, the worst case on this instance would have been someone asking in a press conference ‘what happened between Raheem &amp; Gomez, we heard there was a fight’. Easy answer and we have a game to concentrate on. Incident done and dusted. No player looks any worse, we move on.<br /><br />Now Raheem is left to defend himself from all of the haters that had had their keyboards turned off due to him becoming a very worthy ambassador for the English game, and rightly so. If this was a terrible incident then I would be all for public shaming &amp; discipline. But for this ‘throat grab’ that we are told it’s for I can’t understand it. Gareth would no doubt have seen worse many times during his time as a player and manager. I just feel this could and should have been handled better to support the player and not hang him out to dry.<br /><br />One of our world class players who has conducted himself wonderfully through racism and unwarranted criticism in an England shirt will now come under more scrutiny and be vilified in the media no doubt - when this could have been dealt with internally. Hindsight is a great thing though. It seems to me, Raheem felt embarrassed by all that went on at the weekend…. a sign of winning mentality….. however channelled wrongly. Help educate him!</p>

He’s started ever so well. He’s hit the ground running. One of the main question marks about him was he’s played in China, the level’s not the same. Is he going to be fit enough? So there were so many questions marks over it, but Ole saw something and said I want to go for him. I think the fact that he’s a Man United fan is big and his heart and soul will be put into this move.<br /><br />It’s not a monetary signing at all. It’s about wanting to play for the shirt and the badge and he wants to get back to that because I think because there have been far too many people that have come in and played probably for the money and the exposure over what it means to play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> so he’s a bit of a throwback, he’s here for the right reasons and you’ve seen that in his performances.<br /><br />He gives <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> something different.

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand is doing his best to get the season voided]</b> I just think <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> should just be voided. Just void it. I know there are going to be a lot of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans going ‘Oh Rio, it’s just because you support <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and it’s Liverpool’. It’s not that, it’s just that I don’t see a way that it can be done, where health isn’t compromised. Simple as that. All this behind closed doors business - you’re still going to have players there, are the players not part of society?<br /><br />There are players who are going to go down with the illness who might not have recovered, or catch it from someone then it spreads to other players. It won’t be fair, it’s not a level playing field. I just don’t feel it’s right<br /><br />There are going to be people in the stadium, security, it puts everyone at risk. All this ‘oh we’re going to win this’ or ‘so-and-so might go down’ <b>[…]</b> you’ve got to put those type of things to one side<br /><br />This is about life and death situations, about society in the wider grand scheme of things. Football it ain’t that serious in that sense<br /><br />Listen, we all love it but it ain’t life or death, when it comes to matters like this, you’ve got to put people’s heath before anything<br /><br />Start the season, clean slate, once all this health situation has been sorted out we can start the new season but I don’t see it happening in that time<br /><br />Now if we wake up one morning in the next month and it’s all gone and the country can get back to normal immediately then we can have a conversation about that but I don’t see that happening, not from what we’re being told, and the experiences that other countries who are two or three weeks in front of us, we’re not going to be in a place to do that<br /><br /><a href="psg.html">PSG</a> vs <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> the other day, behind closed doors but outside there were thousands of fans out there. Imagine <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> win the league, which they would, do you think those fans after 30 years of hurt will sit at home and say, ‘Well done, guys’?</p>

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand has jumped to the defence of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> superstar <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> in his public feud with <a href="graeme-souness.html">Graeme Souness</a>]</b> He hasn’t even played football this year! I don’t know how his name is in people’s mouths, he hasn’t even played football. I don’t understand it, like why are you chatting about <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>? He hasn’t played really this season so he shouldn’t be in the conversation. I don’t understand. Yeah, he’s a great player, huge profile, I understand all that. But he’s being judged or made the villain in this season which he’s played really no part in, so I don’t get it. Obviously <a href="graeme-souness.html">Graeme Souness</a> made a statement about putting your medals on the table. Boy, listen, my man’s got a World Cup winners’ medal. Like, it’s hard to chat to someone when they’ve got a World Cup. He won four Scudetti in Italy or something. He’s won stuff. Listen, <a href="graeme-souness.html">Graeme Souness</a> was a great player and he’s won a lot of stuff.<br /><br />Listen, my generation, and even worse for <a href="graeme-souness.html">Graeme Souness</a> and all the guys in that generation, they’ve got to understand that these guys don’t look at them sometimes. They don’t know who they are. For <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> to say he doesn’t know who he is, or wouldn’t know him as a footballer, I believe that. It’s not disrespectful, he doesn’t know him! As great a player as <a href="graeme-souness.html">Souness</a> was - he was a top player, one of the best, if you’re talking about the best British midfielders we’ve ever produced, he’s in the conversation - but <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> doesn’t know him. Simple as that. And that’s just a difference of generations. So I don’t think it’s disrespectful. Listen, if I was <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> I would have said the same thing, but I would have been saying it from a disrespectful standpoint, because I’d be saying, ‘You’ve been disrespecting me this whole time and I’ve not kicked a ball! Why are you talking about me for?’<br /><br />Listen, I’m honest about Paul, and I love Paul because I’ve known him since he was a young kid and I still chat to him now, but the only problem I have with Paul is he should chat instead of his agent chatting. If he’d done that there’d be more clarity on the whole situation. But Paul is his own man, he’s going to deal with it his own way and I respect that. So that’s the only thing I’d say. Would Paul have wanted to do more in a Man United shirt in terms of performances? I’m sure he would. Listen this kid is an absolute professional, desperate to be the best player in the world, he wants to be that. Don’t ever get that twisted. But these guys are talking about him like he’s some kind of fairground player</p>

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand is baffled how <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> is still being blamed for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s issues]</b> A lot of it is from social media - a lot of what they say stems from his social media presence and a lot of those guys are old school. <b>[Ex-pros]</b> want people to follow suit of those before them, they want people to be serious about the game, not broadcasting stuff on social media. He’s injured, going to a wedding and dancing, in the changing room and dancing - this is <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, that’s his life, the way he is. You can’t beat him with a stick because that’s his personality, he’s different. This generation of player is different to my generation and even more different to the likes of Keane and <a href="graeme-souness.html">Souness</a>. The landscape has changed so much that we can’t expect them to behave the way we did. <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> doesn’t drink, he’s not a nightclub merchant, but he goes on social media. What’s worse? Because the people we were talking about before, like myself, would be in a nightclub, or drinking at times, but he doesn’t do that. But he’s still being vilified for being present, happy. And that’s a big thing - he’s being happy while injured. I don’t agree with that <b>[criticism]</b> - mental health is a big issue, if you can’t be yourself in your downtime while injured <b>[…]</b> What do people expect? You to sit around and be depressed? To keep on absolutely pounding him with blame and bringing his name into the conversation right now in such a negative way. He’s played seven <b>[<a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>]</b> games this season, and he’s the focal point as to why United aren’t doing so well. How does that happen, how is he to blame?<br /><br /><b>[Ferdinand feels <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> might have expected more from himself since re-joining]</b> I’ve said on multiple occasions, he’s a very honest guy and he will have expected more in himself. But when you actually look at his stats in the squad in the last four seasons played, he’s at the top in terms of passing, chances created, assists, ball retention - he’s the catalyst pushing the team on when fully fit. Has he been the <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> we come to expect on a consistent basis when he’s a £90m transfer? I’d argue he probably hasn’t been as consistent as you’d like, but this has been a squad in absolute transition and has had multiple managers. If you spend £90m in a certain part of your business, you’d probably make that the jewel in your crown, but I don’t think that’s happened with Pogba</p>
