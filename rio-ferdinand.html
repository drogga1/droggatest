  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand believes Frank Lampard can be Chelsea’s answer to Pep Guardiola]</b> He is the perfect choice. I will actually be surprised if they look elsewhere. They have tried with all these great managers. No disrespect to Allegri, he’s done unbelievable things at Juventus, but they have had Carlo Ancelotti, they have had Conte, Sarri, Mourinho - all managers who have done great things - and never stuck with them. So are you going to continue doing that, and keep blowing money away with these managers who you have to pay up after two years? Or are you going to go with someone who the fans are going to love to have back?.<br /><br />If Chelsea are going to get a ban transfer-wise, I don’t think they can look anywhere but Frank if I am honest. Chelsea have had the best young kids in the country for a while now - Manchester City are coming around to that but for a good few years Chelsea have had the best kids and none of them get in the first team. As a football club, you would think they would like to change that. If they want to change that, there is no one but Frank. He is someone who their young players are going to look at every day and say ‘wow! Frank is gonna play us’.<br /><br />He invigorates not only the first team and the fans but the kids coming through. At a time when managers are scared and under pressure not to play kids, I think it will be refreshing. People talk about experience and what-not, but what experience did Pep have when he went into Barcelona’s first team? He trained the younger kids at the club. Would Lampard wilt under the pressure when big players throw a wobbly in training? I don’t think he would. Frank knows Chelsea, he knows the players and the players will respect him</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand is not ruling out a return to the club in a director of football capacity]</b> It all depends on the shape of the job. I don’t think it’s all been outlined at Man United in terms of ‘that’s the job and this is the description’. I think there’s a lot to talk about within that. To be fair to Man United, in that kind of role, the responsibility that comes with that, you can’t lie and say that that’s not a turn-on. Because you are helping to shape the fortunes of a club of that stature. That’s a huge job. All the boxes would have to be ticked that you’ve got in your head before considering something like that. I think decisions made at a football club - not all (but) some of them - should come with a football thought process in the background somewhere, (someone) that understands that side of it and can make that kind of decision.<br /><br /><b>[Ferdinand feels his old club need to rediscover their identity in order to start moving forward again]</b> Man United are looking for their ideology still. They went away from it after Sir Alex Ferguson, they tried to take it on under different managers and it didn’t work, so they are still searching. There needs to be some sort of story at a football club for the stars and the staff to believe in. Liverpool have got that, Jurgen Klopp has created that. Man City have got that - Pep (Guardiola) has created that. But they have been allowed to create it. They have had time. Do I think Man United can do that? I think time will tell - Ole has a window to work in and then he has to put that jigsaw in place. It is a big gap between Man City, Liverpool and Spurs. They will build again, they will recruit again</p>

  <p><b>[According to former Red Devils defender Rio Ferdinand ‘Manchester United DNA’ is basically a winning mentality and a refusal to rest on one’s laurels]</b> Ole gets a blank canvas now to go into the club, do what he wants to do and move it forward. It doesn’t matter how many players because the turnover has been so great over the last seven or eight years. It’s what players you get - because you have to get the right players. Players who are fit to play for Manchester United, players who play off the front foot, players who are brave. There’s a DNA there that should be going through a player who goes to Man United. Hunger needs to be brought into that squad. I look at the squads I was in, there were hungry people in there. Forget abilities sometimes. Are you hungry enough? Have you got a desire to come in and improve yourself and try to improve this team with respect to what has gone on before you?</p>

He has composure, willingness on the ball as well as the ability to drive out from the defence which I feel is as good as anyone in the game right now.<br /><br />Does he have things to work on? Of course, like everyone else! After speaking to numerous people that know him, they all say what a level-headed, hard-working lad he is who will give 110% for his team, which he echoed when signing. I think something Manchester United have needed defensively in recent years is a big character who can take on the responsibility of leading from the back and from what I’ve heard from people who know him well, they are confident that he will bring that to this football club. I would like to wish him well in the No. 5 shirt of Manchester United and hope he can help bring back success to our club. Good luck Harry Maguire!</p>

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand believes Manchester United are moving in the right direction]</b> I think it’s a step in the right direction. They’ve got young, hungry players, people who are looking to prove themselves, not coming for the wrong reasons. They’ve come for all the right reasons, which are to help the football club improve, to improve themselves as players, and that’s a great step in the right direction obviously. I don’t think it’s necessarily about where the players are from, I think it’s a case of, are they the right people? Have they got the right work ethic? Have they got the right philosophies? Have they got the right beliefs? And are they hard-working? I think if you get those things in a dressing room and that overrides backgrounds and where they’re from<br /><br /><b>[Ferdinand adds that United supporters are savvy enough not to expect too much too soon from their evolving senior squad]</b> I don’t think this is something we can call an overnight turnaround, it’s going to take time and I think Man Utd fans are not silly. They’re good football people who understand the game and if they can see that the club is going in the right direction and their philosophies are right for the club, I think they’ll back the manager in charge and they’ll back the team. In recent years there have been moments when they’ve probably thought, ‘Where are we going here?’ There’s not been a clear picture</p>

It’s a fact. If he tells you any different, he’s lying. He will want to do that. Only time will tell if he’s going to be the man to be able to do that.

He can be hard to read sometimes, which I think is something that’s good to have in a manager as well. I think he’s got a good understanding of today’s player. He’s that age. He’s still connected to the younger generation. He can talk the language. There are a lot of managers out there now who are a bit detached from the next generation. It’s so different now</p>

I remember when I went to United and every training session you are thinking about the price tag. That’s what he would have been brought in for that <b>[the captaincy]</b>. Initially though he has enough pressure just to perform, let alone to be captain. He needs to perform first. Every day in training people will be wondering if £80m is worth it. From people I’ve spoken to he will handle the pressure and has broad shoulders<br /><br /><b>[Daniel James and Aaron Wan-Bissaka have also joined the ranks]</b> I really hope this season is a step in the right direction. From what I have been seeing in the media, from the manager, from some of the players, is the team look fitter, they look stronger, and they are understand what the needs are now from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Our era wouldn’t understand not being fit. That was part and parcel - you have to be fit from day one - but certain managers have a certain style of play and that has all been upped since he has been in there. I think the philosophy in terms of their transfer signings has been a good step in the right direction. They are younger, fresher, hungrier players. All British boys as well, which has always been a mainstay at Manchester United. Part of the fabric has been having young British hungry players who understand the club and the DNA and these boys will be shown that straight away</p>

They’ve chosen somewhere else. But I don’t know how <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> had the audacity to turn them down when he’s on the bench at Juventus. He needs to start playing some football. Maybe he’s thinking: ‘I want to be Champions League or I’ll sit on the bench. I’d rather do that than play at Man United’. Well, I’m happy he didn’t come then because you haven’t got the right minerals that I want in a Man United player! I want someone who wants to come and thinks: ‘Man United need to get back to being a top team, I want to be the catalyst’. That’s the type of person you want to come through the door.<br /><br />Ole <b>[Gunnar Solskjaer]</b> has gone with younger players. Daniel James and Aaron Wan-Bissaka are two young, young, young players with huge potential. They’re projects. Wan-Bissaka a little bit less because he’s played in the Premier League, but James is a nice project for the long-term because he has that youth, that pace that can excite people. If he can work on that on the training field, give him a few games, then hopefully he can keep on flourishing.<br /><br />Jose Mourinho didn’t say: ‘I’m going to go down that route’. He might have wanted Harry Maguire, but he’s still 26. We’re talking young English players. He bought Nemanja Matic, Fred, established players. I just hope Ole gets the time and the team shows some signs early on this season that they are going in the right direction. United fans are loyal fans and understanding fans. If they see an idea that is being nurtured in the right direction for the future of the club, they’ll get behind it. It’s important they see that early</p>

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand says Comparing Manchester United new boy Harry Maguire to Liverpool talisman Virgil van Dijk is unfair]</b> Inevitably he is going to be judged against someone like Virgil van Dijk because he has gone for more money. He’ll be judged against what he’s done and they’ve now won the Champions League. But I think it’s an unfair comparison because what Virgil came in to was a team that was closer to the top, closer to winning and a lot of the jigsaw was already pieced together<br /><br />It can be daunting, it’s big pressure and the price tag can play on your mind. I remember when it happened to me, none of my mates spoke about the price, it was more about the players I was going to playing with. I think the big difference is that I went into a changing room that was full of winners, consistent winners. It is not an easier scenario for Maguire but a different pressure. I was expected to come in and know how to win, to come in and win straight away. I was expected to come straight in and hit the top level because that’s where they were playing at. Now, he has come into a team that, confidence-wise and position-wise is at a lower level. There’s a lot of ground to make up and that’s a pressure in itself</p>

De Jong is awesome. What he did at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> last season was a joke. He played like a veteran player. He has poise, tactical nouse, composure. All the attributes you need to be in a top team. He can take games by control or the scruff of the neck. He is the best young midfielder around.<br /><br />Maddison is doing really well this season and I think he should get to make his England debut. If <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> is deserving, then he is equally deserving. <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> is like a winger at full back with his creativity. <a href="ben-chilwell.html">Ben Chilwell</a> is great at left-back. I love him and I think someone will buy him. He is top. He can go forward or defend. His final third distribution and crossing is great. I like both <a href="fikayo-tomori.html">Fikayo Tomori</a> and Ben Godfrey. From a mental perspective, if I look at a strong player to follow, I think of Matthijs De Ligt. He looks like a strong leader. He was a captain at 18-19 at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. He made a big move to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> to compete with <a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Leonardo Bonucci</a> and <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Giorgio Chiellini</a> who are mainstays and stalwarts of defenders.

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand has questioned why <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> decided to go public in his punishment of <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> for a throat grab on England colleague Joe Gomez]</b> Gareth has handled being England manager brilliantly - up to this point. He has conducted himself in an admirable, eloquent &amp; engaging way. Helping to make a nation feel like they can have some sort of confidence &amp; respect for the national team. However, I feel this incident could have been handled better.<br /><br />Keep it behind closed doors &amp; deal with it internally surely?! Come international week, it’s meet up time between Sterling &amp; Gomez… <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> was still upset with Gomez about the result on Sunday &amp; their little pushing/words said during the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> vs <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> game. So he has obviously gone into the England camp heated and gone for Gomez, <b>[and]</b> in doing so grabbed Gomez by the throat. Obviously as a manager I’m sure having a harmonious squad is the best scenario - handshakes and hugs on sight not confrontations. But let’s be honest now this kind of stuff isn’t uncommon in squads full of testosterone.<br /><br />In the various squads I have been a part of I have seen players get punched in the face, ribs broken, nose busted, head kicked like a football…..a throat grab was the equivalent of the intricate handshake embraces that are all too familiar today! The main question is: Why this couldn’t be handled internally? I suppose the management have felt it would be better to nip it in the bud prior to the press, agents, family friends leaking the news. However, the worst case on this instance would have been someone asking in a press conference ‘what happened between Raheem &amp; Gomez, we heard there was a fight’. Easy answer and we have a game to concentrate on. Incident done and dusted. No player looks any worse, we move on.<br /><br />Now Raheem is left to defend himself from all of the haters that had had their keyboards turned off due to him becoming a very worthy ambassador for the English game, and rightly so. If this was a terrible incident then I would be all for public shaming &amp; discipline. But for this ‘throat grab’ that we are told it’s for I can’t understand it. Gareth would no doubt have seen worse many times during his time as a player and manager. I just feel this could and should have been handled better to support the player and not hang him out to dry.<br /><br />One of our world class players who has conducted himself wonderfully through racism and unwarranted criticism in an England shirt will now come under more scrutiny and be vilified in the media no doubt - when this could have been dealt with internally. Hindsight is a great thing though. It seems to me, Raheem felt embarrassed by all that went on at the weekend…. a sign of winning mentality….. however channelled wrongly. Help educate him!</p>

Says he’s got all the tools, all the right attributes. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> said he’s fantastic, creates chances for him.

Man United have not found it difficult when they’ve had to counter-attack teams, when teams have come on to them and they’ve had a little bit less possession they’ve been able to counter-attack with the speed and pace they’ve got up front. But where they’ve found it hard and difficult is when they’ve played against teams who sit there and wait, especially at Old Trafford.

But we have to take into consideration football is just a game. As seriously as we all take it, the bigger picture is what is going on out in society. I’m sure in my own mind that if it’s not going to be an immediate fix in the next few weeks then the season needs to be voided and started again next season afresh. A lot of people like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans will always say, ‘Oh that’s because you don’t want <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to win the league’. Listen, if my team was in that situation I would think about people’s health and the wider society rather than my own gain. And this is a situation where I think exactly the same no matter who’s going to go up, who’s potentially going to go down, who could have won the league and who could have finished in the Champions League positions<br /><br />I think across the board, it’s much more clearer, black and white, and just void the season and start again afresh.

He hasn’t played really this season so he shouldn’t be in the conversation. I don’t understand. Yeah, he’s a great player, huge profile, I understand all that. But he’s being judged or made the villain in this season which he’s played really no part in, so I don’t get it. Obviously <a href="graeme-souness.html">Graeme Souness</a> made a statement about putting your medals on the table. Boy, listen, my man’s got a World Cup winners’ medal. Like, it’s hard to chat to someone when they’ve got a World Cup. He won four Scudetti in Italy or something. He’s won stuff. Listen, <a href="graeme-souness.html">Graeme Souness</a> was a great player and he’s won a lot of stuff.<br /><br />Listen, my generation, and even worse for <a href="graeme-souness.html">Graeme Souness</a> and all the guys in that generation, they’ve got to understand that these guys don’t look at them sometimes. They don’t know who they are. For <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> to say he doesn’t know who he is, or wouldn’t know him as a footballer, I believe that. It’s not disrespectful, he doesn’t know him! As great a player as <a href="graeme-souness.html">Souness</a> was - he was a top player, one of the best, if you’re talking about the best British midfielders we’ve ever produced, he’s in the conversation - but <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> doesn’t know him. Simple as that. And that’s just a difference of generations. So I don’t think it’s disrespectful. Listen, if I was <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> I would have said the same thing, but I would have been saying it from a disrespectful standpoint, because I’d be saying, ‘You’ve been disrespecting me this whole time and I’ve not kicked a ball! Why are you talking about me for?’<br /><br />Listen, I’m honest about Paul, and I love Paul because I’ve known him since he was a young kid and I still chat to him now, but the only problem I have with Paul is he should chat instead of his agent chatting. If he’d done that there’d be more clarity on the whole situation. But Paul is his own man, he’s going to deal with it his own way and I respect that. So that’s the only thing I’d say. Would Paul have wanted to do more in a Man United shirt in terms of performances? I’m sure he would. Listen this kid is an absolute professional, desperate to be the best player in the world, he wants to be that. Don’t ever get that twisted. But these guys are talking about him like he’s some kind of fairground player</p>

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand is baffled how <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> is still being blamed for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s issues]</b> A lot of it is from social media - a lot of what they say stems from his social media presence and a lot of those guys are old school. <b>[Ex-pros]</b> want people to follow suit of those before them, they want people to be serious about the game, not broadcasting stuff on social media. He’s injured, going to a wedding and dancing, in the changing room and dancing - this is <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, that’s his life, the way he is. You can’t beat him with a stick because that’s his personality, he’s different. This generation of player is different to my generation and even more different to the likes of Keane and <a href="graeme-souness.html">Souness</a>. The landscape has changed so much that we can’t expect them to behave the way we did. <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> doesn’t drink, he’s not a nightclub merchant, but he goes on social media. What’s worse? Because the people we were talking about before, like myself, would be in a nightclub, or drinking at times, but he doesn’t do that. But he’s still being vilified for being present, happy. And that’s a big thing - he’s being happy while injured. I don’t agree with that <b>[criticism]</b> - mental health is a big issue, if you can’t be yourself in your downtime while injured <b>[…]</b> What do people expect? You to sit around and be depressed? To keep on absolutely pounding him with blame and bringing his name into the conversation right now in such a negative way. He’s played seven <b>[Premier League]</b> games this season, and he’s the focal point as to why United aren’t doing so well. How does that happen, how is he to blame?<br /><br /><b>[Ferdinand feels <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> might have expected more from himself since re-joining]</b> I’ve said on multiple occasions, he’s a very honest guy and he will have expected more in himself. But when you actually look at his stats in the squad in the last four seasons played, he’s at the top in terms of passing, chances created, assists, ball retention - he’s the catalyst pushing the team on when fully fit. Has he been the <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> we come to expect on a consistent basis when he’s a £90m transfer? I’d argue he probably hasn’t been as consistent as you’d like, but this has been a squad in absolute transition and has had multiple managers. If you spend £90m in a certain part of your business, you’d probably make that the jewel in your crown, but I don’t think that’s happened with Pogba</p>

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> will have ‘mouthwatering’ attack if they sign <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> and keep Pogba]</b> If I was looking at the team now and you have <a href="scott-mctominay.html">McTominay</a> with Bruno <b>[Fernandes]</b> on one side of the three and <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> on the other. You can’t tell me other midfielders aren’t going to be thinking, ‘if these lot are on fire today we’re going to have to be on a game, it’s going to be a hard day work for us’. There’s ability there, it’s ridiculous. If they can find that cohesion, the team set-up for them to flourish, it’s mouthwatering what could happen<br /><br />It’s if, buts and maybes. We need <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> fit, we need him in that team and to see what he’s like to see if the relationship can be built with the players and the players ole is acquiring now.

  <p><b>[Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has given his backing to the club to move for <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>’s Jadon Sancho]</b> I hope they do, man. He’s got that imagination, that carefree spirit - almost like that playground footballer vibe that I love. And he’s bringing it all to the big stage<br /><br />He’s a dream. He reminds me of a young <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>. The cool thing is, for the young kids watching him, they see that you can play in a creative way, even though football has become so structured. He brings his own style, that street football, to the game. That’s what makes him so priceless</p>

  <p><b>[Rio Ferdinand says the story of <a href="david-moyes.html">David Moyes</a> showing him videos of Phil Jagielka as an example of how he wanted him to defend was made up]</b> I don’t know where that came from to be honest, that’s something that never happened. Listen, Phil Jagielka was a very good player. I’m sure he wouldn’t have shown us videos of Phil of how we should be doing this and that, but I don’t know where that came from. That’s just some mad tale that’s come out of nowhere. Someone has dreamed that up and it’s become a great meme<br /><br />To be fair, we did have some heated discussions if I’m being honest. There were a few heated meetings between myself, Vida and <a href="david-moyes.html">David Moyes</a>. We didn’t agree with certain things and the certain ways things were being done. Set-ups from a defensive perspective etc. He wanted certain things, we didn’t really agree with certain things he was saying, but that’s football and I think <a href="david-moyes.html">David Moyes</a> will probably have had that before with many different players so we weren’t the first and I’m sure we won’t be the last</p>

The world had bigger things to worry about and the fate of the title, the European qualifying places and relegation didn’t seem very important. I thought the season would be null and void but the fact we are ready to go again is testament to the players, the clubs and the owners</p>
