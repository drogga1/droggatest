  <p><b>[Dynamo Kyiv winger Andriy Yarmolenko responded sharply to reporters when asked if he knew why Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was in the stands to watch Ukraine’s 1-0 defeat to Spain]</b> Mourinho was at this game? I don’t know what to say, when would I know why he came. I didn’t know that he was at the match, I was thinking about other stuff - like the important game with Spain. Ask him who he watched.</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham have completed the signing of Andriy Yarmolenko from Borussia Dortmund]</b> Of course, I am very happy to sign for West Ham United. West Ham is a big club with good fans and I am happy to come to play in the Premier League. The Premier League is the best league in the world and I know that an interesting project is being built here at West Ham. The team wants to achieve high things and I am excited for this challenge.</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham’s Andriy Yarmolenko is planning to write to the Premier League requesting that he be awarded an effort against Manchester United which went down as a Victor Lindelof own goal]</b> I don’t know why it’s not my goal, so I’ll write later to the Premier League! I think it was a beautiful day for us, for the team and for the fans. It was a great win and we’re happy. We played well. We played a more attacking game than we did against Chelsea and I thought it was a good game for us. We have many good players and we must think about the three points and not draws. Football is not only about defence. We must play on the front foot and play for three points.<br /><br />We must take things step by step. Of course, today we must enjoy, but on Monday we must concentrate on the next one and we must we win that too!</p>

  <p><b>[Andriy Yarmolenko is tired of the criticism he has received from a Ukrainian pundit]</b> In my youth, I fought a lot. There were wins and there were losses. It’s normal for a boy, for a man. I want to announce my next fight. I don’t want to listen to that Kobelkov any longer. I want to call him out for a fight and get my revenge on all those things he’s said on air. I’m waiting for an answer</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> winger Andriy Yarmolenko has admitted that he didn’t like the manner in which <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> parted ways with him after only a year]</b> I’m not the type of guy to be offended, but I didn’t like the way they parted with me. I believe that <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> is a great club and should be given great respect by the players on the team. I did not like a lot of things in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. If you compare it with England, the players have a much better attitude. Any game, even a defeat, was an experience, though. I had both good and bad matches at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. I believe I got a lot of experience there. I discovered what German football really is. I didn’t expect that I would leave <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> so quickly, but now I am very happy that I moved to England. At <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>, I’m happy<br /><br /><b>[Asked if there is a better atmosphere in the dressing room]</b> In England, it’s 100 per cent better. I like the British because we have a similar mentality in terms of humour and jokes. The main thing is to understand the league. Sometimes English humour is tough but in general it’s fine<br /><br /><b>[Keeping things light is something Yarmolenko clearly appreciates and he shared a story that left <a href="west-ham-united.html">the Hammers</a> squad in stitches during a training session]</b> Our new goalkeeper, Roberto, came in one day wearing shoes that, at a glance, seemed normal, but <b>[Robert]</b> Snodgrass thought that they were amusing. When the whole team was in the gym, Snodgrass put on Roberto’s shoes and started exercising in front of him. Roberto was on the bike, suspecting nothing, and then he noticed Snodgrass was wearing his shoes. It was funny</p>
