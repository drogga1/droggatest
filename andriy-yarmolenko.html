  <p><b>[West Ham winger Andriy Yarmolenko has admitted that he didn’t like the manner in which <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> parted ways with him after only a year]</b> I’m not the type of guy to be offended, but I didn’t like the way they parted with me. I believe that <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> is a great club and should be given great respect by the players on the team. I did not like a lot of things in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. If you compare it with England, the players have a much better attitude. Any game, even a defeat, was an experience, though. I had both good and bad matches at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. I believe I got a lot of experience there. I discovered what German football really is. I didn’t expect that I would leave <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> so quickly, but now I am very happy that I moved to England. At <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>, I’m happy<br /><br /><b>[Asked if there is a better atmosphere in the dressing room]</b> In England, it’s 100 per cent better. I like the British because we have a similar mentality in terms of humour and jokes. The main thing is to understand the league. Sometimes English humour is tough but in general it’s fine<br /><br /><b>[Keeping things light is something Yarmolenko clearly appreciates and he shared a story that left the Hammers squad in stitches during a training session]</b> Our new goalkeeper, Roberto, came in one day wearing shoes that, at a glance, seemed normal, but <b>[Robert]</b> Snodgrass thought that they were amusing. When the whole team was in the gym, Snodgrass put on Roberto’s shoes and started exercising in front of him. Roberto was on the bike, suspecting nothing, and then he noticed Snodgrass was wearing his shoes. It was funny</p>
