He’s one of the best characters I’ve played with. We’re going to miss him. He had a very good season last year and scored a lot of goals for us. Not only was he an important player on the pitch, he was also an important person in the dressing room. I wish him good luck. He’s had a fantastic career.</p>

  <p><b>[Alexis Sanchez will be determined to get one over former club Arsenal on Sunday]</b> I think, if it was away at the Emirates, it might be a bit different. Going back to a place where he’s very fond of, knows the pitch well and the fans well. At home it’s a little bit different but he will still have that added incentive to get one over on them.<br /><br /><b>[On Arsene Wenger]</b> He’s been a fantastic manager. I’ve seen a lot of things in the press at the moment and it’s true. He changed the game of football and the way teams play. He’s managed some great Arsenal teams over the years that I’ve grown up watching. He should be respected and get the send-off he deserves</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Jones believes Manchester United are moving in the right direction]</b> Success for Manchester United is winning the Premier League, adding another trophy and having another good cup run is another one. I think finishing second and winning the FA Cup would probably be satisfactory for Manchester United, but we always want to win more. It means we are moving in the right direction. We will always have our critics because we are Manchester United. It has been like that since I have been here.<br /><br />The <b>[FA Cup final]</b> under Van Gaal, I wasn’t playing, so that was OK - not OK, but reasonable. The Europa League final, I got a daft, silly injury at a stupid time. I thought I wouldn’t be fit for the final, then it came and I was, but the manager is probably thinking I had only just come back, could he trust my fitness in a game of that magnitude? You are disappointed but at the same time, you understand. Hopefully I have a chance of starting in the final. I don’t know. It is the manager’s decision. But hopefully I have put my name forward and will be one of the names on the team sheet</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Jones believes Manchester United need to focus on ourselves a bit more]</b> Yes, of course <b>[we want to win the Premier League]</b>. It’s the most difficult to win out of the competitions in England. The level of the players and their fitness and ability is improving. I remember when I joined in 2011; the Premier League has come on leaps and bounds since then - the pace of the Premier League and the games we’re playing in are so quick nowadays. You have to adjust and adapt to that, but it’s great to be a part of. The top six look very good and are going to be very competitive, so it’s going to be tough for us again this season - we know that - but I think we just need to focus on us a bit more and concentrate on how we’re going to approach games and let’s see where it takes us</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Jones is hoping to earn a new contract at Manchester United]</b> I’m very settled - I’ve been settled for a long time here. Ever since I walked through the door I was made to feel very welcome. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time - it’s been great and long may it continue. Of course I do <b>[want to stay]</b> - it’s Man United. This club has been part of my life for many years now. I love the club, the fans, the players. We’ll see what happens. It’s not down to me what happens.<br /><br /><b>[Jones said of Solskjaer’s impact]</b> He’s brought a freshness about the place. He’s come in and wanted to move us forward and bring those happy times back, and I think he’s done that. His man-management skills are very good. He’ll let players know what’s happening, and as players that’s all you can ask for. You just want a manager to be honest with you, and that’s exactly what he gives you<br /><br />We’ve achieved nothing. We might have gone on a little run and everyone’s talking about us, but it means nothing. We’re outside the top four which is obviously not where we want to be, and we have to make sure we finish in the top four. Come the end of the season, if we do - OK we’ve not had a successful season - but we’ve made the best out of it that we can</p>

I am excited about the challenges that lie ahead of us as we prepare for a very busy period in the season. I would like to thank Ole and the coaching staff for their continued support in my development</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United defender Phil Jones has admitted that he is looking forward to three acid tests for the rejuvenated Red Devils]</b> Football’s football, it can change very quickly. I know that, I’ve experienced that many times. One moment you can be on a high, the next you can be low. It’s a cliché, but we’re keeping our feet on the ground, taking one game at a time. Consistency is key in any sport and it’s no different here. We’re putting a run together, we need to keep momentum going. We’re looking forward to PSG on Tuesday. It’s a tough period but these are the games you want to play in, the games you want to be available for.<br /><br /><b>[Saturday’s 3-0 victory over Fulham]</b> It was a big game for us, as we knew we could get into the top four. It’s a big statement from where we were. Everyone’s got to take us seriously now, you know. We’ve proved that in the last ten or twelve games. We’ve worked on every position, all over the pitch we’re getting better. We can still improve and we will do.</p>

I’m going to get criticism in the future, I’ve had criticism in the past. Honestly, I genuinely don’t care. I have a wonderful family and wonderful friends. I play football for Man United, I’ve been given an extra contract and I’m grateful for that.<br /><br />Since I’ve come to this club we’ve signed players left, right and centre: forwards, defenders, goalkeepers. We’re Man United, of course, we’re going to be interested in the best players in the world, I’d be pretty amazed if we weren’t</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Jones says his Manchester United team-mate Paul Pogba can be as good as he wants to be]</b> He does the talking on the pitch. Maybe people do that outside of football but don’t really do it on the pitch. He’s earned that right from what he’s done and he can do whatever he wants as long as he performs like he’s doing at the moment.<br /><br />Paul’s Paul. When he was at United before he left to go to Juventus I remember how he used to come into training and take the mick out of … well not take the mick but used to run rings around Scholesy and all the players and everyone used to be wowed by him. He’s come back and Paul’s Paul, he’s an unbelievably talented player. The things he can do with the ball are incredible, he can see a pass, he’s got a left foot, right foot, his shot, he’s a strong boy, and he can be as good as he wants to be</p>

  <p><b>[Defiant Phil Jones defends his career]</b> I wouldn’t go that far, there’d be only my mum and dad who would turn up<br /><br />Ever since I was at Blackburn, when you talk about getting pro contracts I was never the guy that was talked about as, ‘This guy is going to be the best player, the next best thing’. I was always the guy who just managed to get one and went under the radar a bit, and the next minute I was playing in the first team and the lads who were tipped to be the next best thing are working in an office, and that’s how it goes. I enjoy that, I enjoy the way I go about it. I feel like I’m improving, I’ve still got a lot to improve, a lot to learn, and I’m excited for the challenge<br /><br />Bar that one. Bar that one. Not really, because when I was younger I used to take a lot of things for granted, you hear that and it’s great at the time but you don’t dwell on it, you don’t look back on it. It’s only in time that’s gone by and you look back on what people have said about you that, yeah, you do realise that it was such a good comment, maybe it did put me under a bit of pressure but at the time I don’t feel like I did<br /><br />I’m lucky, I’m lucky enough that I am strong mentally. I know a lot of players will come out and say in the press that it doesn’t bother them and then two minutes later they’ll be on the Daily Mail on their phones, but it genuinely doesn’t bother me. I have a wonderful family, wonderful friends and I have a little girl now and I don’t care what people say. People can make their own opinions up, ultimately I’ve got another contract at United, I’ve been here for eight or nine years now and I’ve won the Premier League, been to two World Cups, been to a Euros, played in the Champions League, won the Europa League, the FA Cup, so people can talk but ultimately they’re the stats and that’s what I’ve done<br /><br />It’s banter, my mates banter me all the time about it. It is what it is. I’m not too fussed about that either. My mates send me pictures every single night on the Whatsapp group taking the mick out of me. It’s banter, it is what it is. It doesn’t bother me<br /><br />When I’ve been asked that question in the past and we were going through a transition phase I always used to say, ‘I don’t think we’re far’, but I genuinely don’t think we’re far away. I think we’ve got a really good squad, we’ve got exciting players coming through, we’ve got a good mix of youth and experience and you can see, the way we’re playing, teams fear us again, don’t want to play us again and slowly but surely we’re getting back to our best. We’re still learning, we’re still improving but we’ll get there<br /><br />I think we are out of that. Well, we’re not out of it completely, we’re probably going to add a few more players in the summer, but we’re looking good, we’re looking sharp, we look a threat every time we go forward and like I said, teams fear us again<br /><br />The way I see it is it’s just like when I signed; we’re Man United, of course we’re going to be attracted to the best players in the world and I’d be disappointed if we weren’t, I want to win things as well. It might sound very clichéd but it’s great. You want to win things, you want the best players to come to Manchester United and if we’re playing better and we’re winning things and we’re challenging for things then we’re going to attract the best players. We’re always going to attract the best players because everybody wants to play for Man United. It’s like when I signed, that’s how the club works and the club runs, but I embrace the challenge and I look forward to it.</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Jones believes Manchester United will be Premier League title contenders in 2019-20]</b> I don’t think we’re far away. I think obviously we had a poor start to the season. It’s sort of like a story of two halves of the season, really. That <b>[challenging for major trophies]</b> is the vision for the players, for the staff, for the fans, everyone involved in this football club. It’s a wonderful place to play football and that’s where we want to get back to. We need to knuckle down. We need to play better than we did <b>[against Watford]</b>, but we need to keep improving as a team. We’ve not got long left of the season now but let’s see where we can go. Then we can recover well in the summer and have a good start to next season. I think the fans, the media, everyone can see what he <b>[<a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>]</b> has done and how he wants to play since he came, and I think we’ve shown that in quite a few games. It’s positive and we’re looking forward</p>

It’s a busy period when all the games come thick and fast, when you need a big squad with everyone ready to fight. But it’s a period we relish. Since I came to this club - when I walked through the door - I knew I wasn’t just going to walk into the team and expect to play. Today’s no different. Of course I want to play, but we’ve got some quality players in that position. I’ll wait for my chance and hopefully I’ll get a chance sooner rather than later</p>

You don’t care who he is and what he’s done. You just go out to win a game of football, no matter who you’re up against. That’s always how I’ve looked at football. I don’t care who I’m up against. We’re just human beings and it’s just a game of football<br /><br /><b>[A man with 27 England caps to his name added on a meeting with Real from eight years ago]</b> It was a really big game for me.

There was a lot of hype about <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> in that game, but we limited him to a few chances and we got a good 1-1 result at the Bernabeu, before we lost in the home leg. It was incredible: the stadium, the atmosphere. It was a mad game and one that flashes by at the time. You only really take note of it a few years down the line. I think I got back the day after and the next night I had a catch up with my mates and they’re saying ‘you played in the Bernabeu last night, against Ronaldo’. But when you’re that young, you just take it all in your stride and take it all for granted. It’s only when you look back and think ‘wow, what an occasion’</p>
