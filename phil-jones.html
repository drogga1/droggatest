  <p><b>[on <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Nemanja Vidic</a> of Manchester United]</b> You learn off him every day in training, even if he doesn’t say anything, you just watch and learn. He’s been a huge influence on my career at United and has really helped me along the way. I owe him a lot and I am grateful for everything he’s done</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United defender Phil Jones views the Europa League as an opportunity to work his way into <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>’s first-team plans]</b> There are players like myself who’ve not been involved as much, but it’s a chance for everyone to get games. It’s a busy period when all the games come thick and fast, when you need a big squad with everyone ready to fight. But it’s a period we relish. Since I came to this club - when I walked through the door - I knew I wasn’t just going to walk into the team and expect to play. Today’s no different. Of course I want to play, but we’ve got some quality players in that position. I’ll wait for my chance and hopefully I’ll get a chance sooner rather than later</p>

Following a specialist’s opinion, <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> requires a period of further rest and conservative treatment for the foot injury he sustained during the game against Southampton in August. Updates will follow in due course</p>

  <p><b>[Centre-back Phil Jones, one of the more experienced players on the field for United at 27 years old, was full of praise for James Garner and Brandon Williams - the younger members of United’s squad]</b> I thought the pair of them were absolutely terrific. It’s a hostile environment and the pitch wasn’t the best - the pair of them can be really proud of themselves. They were a big reason why we came away with a clean sheet</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Jones claims to have had no fear lining up against Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> Yeah, it’s <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, and he’s such an iconic figure and he’s done so much for the sport, but you’re that young, you don’t care. You don’t care who he is and what he’s done. You just go out to win a game of football, no matter who you’re up against. That’s always how I’ve looked at football. I don’t care who I’m up against. We’re just human beings and it’s just a game of football<br /><br /><b>[A man with 27 England caps to his name added on a meeting with Real from eight years ago]</b> It was a really big game for me. Playing against Madrid, in the Bernabeu. I played centre-midfield alongside <a href="michael-carrick.html">Michael Carrick</a>. There was a lot of hype about <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> in that game, but we limited him to a few chances and we got a good 1-1 result at the Bernabeu, before we lost in the home leg. It was incredible: the stadium, the atmosphere. It was a mad game and one that flashes by at the time. You only really take note of it a few years down the line. I think I got back the day after and the next night I had a catch up with my mates and they’re saying ‘you played in the Bernabeu last night, against Ronaldo’. But when you’re that young, you just take it all in your stride and take it all for granted. It’s only when you look back and think ‘wow, what an occasion’</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Jones has revealed that he snubbed advances from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in order to join <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in 2011]</b> He was there for my first two years and he was the one who brought me from <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> - I’m forever grateful to him for doing that. I had offers from other clubs. I could have gone to a host of clubs: <b>[Manchester]</b> City, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. He was the last person I’d spoke to and I remember walking back out with my agent and saying: ‘I want to sign for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>.’ That was it. We hadn’t even discussed any personal terms, but I knew that was the club I wanted to sign for<br /><br />His understanding of every player <b>[set him apart]</b>. His understanding and level of communications with those players was the best I’ve ever been involved with. He understood everyone in terms of: ‘Do I need to give them a rest? Do I need to play him? Give him an arm around the shoulder? Do I need to go full hairdryer treatment? Do I need to give him some time off?’ He knew exactly how to handle every situation. For me, that’s what’s made him the best. People know he was a wonderful manager - he’s one of the greatest managers ever - but people don’t know what he was like away from the pitch with players’ families. It was very important.</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Jones says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> great <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> didn’t get recognition he deserves]</b> He’s a sporting great, not just for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, but for football itself. I think his achievements were overshadowed and under-appreciated a bit. I don’t think he got the recognition he should have got considering he was England’s record goalscorer, all the goals he scored for United, and the trophies he won. He was unbelievable and when he was doing this for England and United people still questioned him. But I think now people really do appreciate what he did for United and football<br /><br />I had a really good relationship with Wayne. When I first signed he helped me a lot and we became good friends. Now, if I’ve got something to speak about, he’s someone who I’d like to think I could pick up the phone and speak to. I’m sure he’s going to go into management as well. He’s a great guy and he’s just a normal, hard-working family guy</p>
