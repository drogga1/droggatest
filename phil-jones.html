  <p><b>[Phil Jones is ready to put his injury nightmare behind him]</b> It was great, personally, for me. It’s been a difficult period for me. It is good to be back in the fold and playing again. <b>[Being injured]</b> is awful but as a footballer you can’t feel sorry for yourself, go into a little hole and never come out of your home. You have got to go about your day as you would normally, work hard in training and I have worked to get back to where I am now. I want to stay here and I want to play more games. I have worked hard on my fitness. It has been tough mentally for me and it has been so frustrating. I can’t put into words how frustrating it has been but that is behind me and I want to move forward to play as many games as I can<br /><br />I wanted to make sure that I was 100 per cent right going into the first game. I was fit for a good few weeks before the Swansea game with training and it was the training that I needed but you can never replicate the game. Training and games are two different things.<br /><br />The Premier League is so quick and sharp these days. It is games that I need and hopefully I can keep getting them. I am ready to play but I think I have also got to look after myself as well and think right. If I do feel something then I am honest but I am ready, I am fit and ready to play. I am just focusing on game to game, playing football, doing what I love doing and I will go from there.</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Jones made his third successive appearance for United and the centre-back explained how the team’s pressing game was key to their impressive victory]</b> It was a tough game, especially in the first half. They pressed us well and created a good chance that they could have scored from. But I think we played better in the second half, we were more aggressive in our pressing and we got the four goals. It was a good performance in the end. I think it was just a matter of time and not allowing them to play out from the back. Once we did that, you saw in the second half in the chances we created we caused them all sorts of problems.</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Jones acknowledges Manchester United have a problem with conceding late goals after Everton salvaged a dramatic 1-1 draw at Goodison Park]</b> I think we controlled game from start to maybe the 60th minute. They played long balls and had a few half chances with Kevin Mirallas - other than that we defended well and did not allow as many chances as the last games. But we are losing too many points, <b>[late goals are]</b> a common trend and we have to put it right<br /><br /><b>[Asked for the reasons behind United’s late collapses]</b> Maybe lack of concentration, fatigue - it is too many times, four or five times we have completely dominated and not won. It has happened again. You are away at Everton, it’s a difficult place to come, they play direct and it is difficult to defend, but we were resilient until we gave the penalty away. It is a points-based game and we are not getting enough.</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Jones is revelling in his role as an unsung hero at Manchester United]</b> As defenders, we don’t care. I just love to defend! I want to stop goals going in the net. I want to give David De Gea fewer saves to make, or have him not need to make any in the whole game. I think we’re getting better. When we’re defending as a team, we’re doing better and ultimately we need to keep improving. If we make an important block, it can be like a goal. It’s the striker’s job to put the ball in the net and it’s up to us to make important tackles and blocks.<br /><br /><b>[On Jose Mourinho]</b> It’s been brilliant. He’s shown a lot of confidence and belief in me and hopefully I’m repaying that. It’s always nice to share comments from the manager and other people that you’re doing well. I’m not under any illusions, though. In this game you can be up there one minute and down the next, so I need to keep going and keep improving</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United defender Phil Jones believes that he is thriving under Jose Mourinho]</b> I feel there have been only three managers who have every truly believed in me and understood me as a player. That’s not being critical of other managers but the only three were Sam Allardyce, Sir Alex Ferguson and now Jose Mourinho. They have all given me belief and confidence. I am not one who needs to be patted on the back every single day and told I am brilliant. Some players need that, I don’t. But those three certainly gave me confidence.<br /><br />I was on the bench at Wembley in the FA Cup final and during the last two months of the final season of Van Gaal last year I was fit and playing. I was just made to play reserve games. For whatever reason he thought I needed to be fitter. I had no problem with that, I just played the games. I did what I could do to get back in the team and unfortunately it didn’t really work out under him<br /><br />No question there were thoughts about my future. It was in the back of my mind. If you are not playing games that speaks volumes. I said to myself at the start of the season that if someone believes in me and gives me the chance I know I am more than capable of delivering for the manager. Jose has done that. Hopefully if I stay fit and keep playing well the it well be at Manchester United because there is no better club to be at. The manager has given me the confidence to go to the next stage. I have always said from day dot if somebody comes in and they give me a chance to play and play regularly then they will get the best out of me</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Jones admits there was a time when he was happy to be Manchester United’s Mr Versatile]</b> I always used to say it was nice to play in different positions. I was young and playing anywhere was a bonus for me then. When you are at Manchester United you play anywhere. But this has definitely been one of the best seasons for me in terms of playing in a set role, getting in and staying in that one position.<br /><br />I am not the kind of person who can come in and play one game, be out for a couple of games then come back in and everyone expects you to be all singing and dancing with no flaws or mistakes. I have always been a player, and always will be the kind who needs to be playing regularly. That is how you get the best out of me. Hopefully I have proved that this season. I think my days as Mr Versatile are long gone now. I don’t think the manager would see me as playing right back or centre midfield any more. There was a time when I had it do it and I would be more than capable of adapting, but centre-back will always be my position now.<br /><br />He <b>[Mourinho]</b> hasn’t told me that but you always get vibes and I think that is obvious now. I knew it had to end but it has happened gradually and I always knew it would be like that. I have not played right-back or centre midfield for a long time</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Jones is confident that Manchester United boast the strength in depth required to cover the absence of key men such as Paul Pogba and Zlatan Ibrahimovic]</b> Maybe it wasn’t a sparkling performance the other night <b>[aginst Rostov in Europe]</b>, but it was one that was pleasing and positive and we’re through to the next round. Middlesbrough have just sacked the manager as well so it will probably be even tougher than what it would have been. But we’ve got more than enough to cope with that. We have strength in depth in this squad and that’s why we need everyone. There is always an added incentive for everyone playing Manchester United as it is, but when you sack the manager it’s even more of a boost for them. Especially for the ones who have not been playing in the squad who can force their way into the team and impress. It will be a tough game, but we need to be ready for it.</p>

We will always have our critics because we are Manchester United. It has been like that since I have been here.<br /><br />The <b>[FA Cup final]</b> under Van Gaal, I wasn’t playing, so that was OK - not OK, but reasonable. The Europa League final, I got a daft, silly injury at a stupid time. I thought I wouldn’t be fit for the final, then it came and I was, but the manager is probably thinking I had only just come back, could he trust my fitness in a game of that magnitude? You are disappointed but at the same time, you understand. Hopefully I have a chance of starting in the final. I don’t know. It is the manager’s decision. But hopefully I have put my name forward and will be one of the names on the team sheet</p>

It’s the most difficult to win out of the competitions in England. The level of the players and their fitness and ability is improving. I remember when I joined in 2011; the Premier League has come on leaps and bounds since then - the pace of the Premier League and the games we’re playing in are so quick nowadays. You have to adjust and adapt to that, but it’s great to be a part of. The top six look very good and are going to be very competitive, so it’s going to be tough for us again this season - we know that - but I think we just need to focus on us a bit more and concentrate on how we’re going to approach games and let’s see where it takes us</p>

It’s not down to me what happens.<br /><br /><b>[Jones said of Solskjaer’s impact]</b> He’s brought a freshness about the place. He’s come in and wanted to move us forward and bring those happy times back, and I think he’s done that. His man-management skills are very good. He’ll let players know what’s happening, and as players that’s all you can ask for. You just want a manager to be honest with you, and that’s exactly what he gives you<br /><br />We’ve achieved nothing. We might have gone on a little run and everyone’s talking about us, but it means nothing. We’re outside the top four which is obviously not where we want to be, and we have to make sure we finish in the top four.

Consistency is key in any sport and it’s no different here. We’re putting a run together, we need to keep momentum going. We’re looking forward to PSG on Tuesday. It’s a tough period but these are the games you want to play in, the games you want to be available for.<br /><br /><b>[Saturday’s 3-0 victory over Fulham]</b> It was a big game for us, as we knew we could get into the top four.

  <p><b>[Defiant Phil Jones defends his career]</b> I wouldn’t go that far, there’d be only my mum and dad who would turn up<br /><br />Ever since I was at Blackburn, when you talk about getting pro contracts I was never the guy that was talked about as, ‘This guy is going to be the best player, the next best thing’. I was always the guy who just managed to get one and went under the radar a bit, and the next minute I was playing in the first team and the lads who were tipped to be the next best thing are working in an office, and that’s how it goes. I enjoy that, I enjoy the way I go about it. I feel like I’m improving, I’ve still got a lot to improve, a lot to learn, and I’m excited for the challenge<br /><br />Bar that one. Bar that one. Not really, because when I was younger I used to take a lot of things for granted, you hear that and it’s great at the time but you don’t dwell on it, you don’t look back on it. It’s only in time that’s gone by and you look back on what people have said about you that, yeah, you do realise that it was such a good comment, maybe it did put me under a bit of pressure but at the time I don’t feel like I did<br /><br />I’m lucky, I’m lucky enough that I am strong mentally. I know a lot of players will come out and say in the press that it doesn’t bother them and then two minutes later they’ll be on the Daily Mail on their phones, but it genuinely doesn’t bother me. I have a wonderful family, wonderful friends and I have a little girl now and I don’t care what people say. People can make their own opinions up, ultimately I’ve got another contract at United, I’ve been here for eight or nine years now and I’ve won the Premier League, been to two World Cups, been to a Euros, played in the Champions League, won the Europa League, the FA Cup, so people can talk but ultimately they’re the stats and that’s what I’ve done<br /><br />It’s banter, my mates banter me all the time about it. It is what it is. I’m not too fussed about that either. My mates send me pictures every single night on the Whatsapp group taking the mick out of me. It’s banter, it is what it is. It doesn’t bother me<br /><br />When I’ve been asked that question in the past and we were going through a transition phase I always used to say, ‘I don’t think we’re far’, but I genuinely don’t think we’re far away. I think we’ve got a really good squad, we’ve got exciting players coming through, we’ve got a good mix of youth and experience and you can see, the way we’re playing, teams fear us again, don’t want to play us again and slowly but surely we’re getting back to our best. We’re still learning, we’re still improving but we’ll get there<br /><br />I think we are out of that. Well, we’re not out of it completely, we’re probably going to add a few more players in the summer, but we’re looking good, we’re looking sharp, we look a threat every time we go forward and like I said, teams fear us again<br /><br />The way I see it is it’s just like when I signed; we’re Man United, of course we’re going to be attracted to the best players in the world and I’d be disappointed if we weren’t, I want to win things as well. It might sound very clichéd but it’s great. You want to win things, you want the best players to come to Manchester United and if we’re playing better and we’re winning things and we’re challenging for things then we’re going to attract the best players. We’re always going to attract the best players because everybody wants to play for Man United. It’s like when I signed, that’s how the club works and the club runs, but I embrace the challenge and I look forward to it.</p>

We need to play better than we did <b>[against Watford]</b>, but we need to keep improving as a team. We’ve not got long left of the season now but let’s see where we can go. Then we can recover well in the summer and have a good start to next season. I think the fans, the media, everyone can see what he <b>[<a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>]</b> has done and how he wants to play since he came, and I think we’ve shown that in quite a few games. It’s positive and we’re looking forward</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> defender Phil Jones views the Europa League as an opportunity to work his way into <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>’s first-team plans]</b> There are players like myself who’ve not been involved as much, but it’s a chance for everyone to get games. It’s a busy period when all the games come thick and fast, when you need a big squad with everyone ready to fight. But it’s a period we relish. Since I came to this club - when I walked through the door - I knew I wasn’t just going to walk into the team and expect to play. Today’s no different. Of course I want to play, but we’ve got some quality players in that position. I’ll wait for my chance and hopefully I’ll get a chance sooner rather than later</p>

  <p><b>[Centre-back Phil Jones, one of the more experienced players on the field for United at 27 years old, was full of praise for James Garner and Brandon Williams - the younger members of United’s squad]</b> I thought the pair of them were absolutely terrific. It’s a hostile environment and the pitch wasn’t the best - the pair of them can be really proud of themselves. They were a big reason why we came away with a clean sheet</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Jones claims to have had no fear lining up against <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>]</b> Yeah, it’s <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, and he’s such an iconic figure and he’s done so much for the sport, but you’re that young, you don’t care. You don’t care who he is and what he’s done. You just go out to win a game of football, no matter who you’re up against. That’s always how I’ve looked at football. I don’t care who I’m up against. We’re just human beings and it’s just a game of football<br /><br /><b>[A man with 27 England caps to his name added on a meeting with Real from eight years ago]</b> It was a really big game for me. Playing against Madrid, in the Bernabeu. I played centre-midfield alongside <a href="michael-carrick.html">Michael Carrick</a>. There was a lot of hype about <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> in that game, but we limited him to a few chances and we got a good 1-1 result at the Bernabeu, before we lost in the home leg. It was incredible: the stadium, the atmosphere. It was a mad game and one that flashes by at the time. You only really take note of it a few years down the line. I think I got back the day after and the next night I had a catch up with my mates and they’re saying ‘you played in the Bernabeu last night, against Ronaldo’. But when you’re that young, you just take it all in your stride and take it all for granted. It’s only when you look back and think ‘wow, what an occasion’</p>

I had offers from other clubs. I could have gone to a host of clubs: <b>[Manchester]</b> City, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. He was the last person I’d spoke to and I remember walking back out with my agent and saying: ‘I want to sign for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>.’ That was it. We hadn’t even discussed any personal terms, but I knew that was the club I wanted to sign for<br /><br />His understanding of every player <b>[set him apart]</b>. His understanding and level of communications with those players was the best I’ve ever been involved with. He understood everyone in terms of: ‘Do I need to give them a rest? Do I need to play him? Give him an arm around the shoulder? Do I need to go full hairdryer treatment? Do I need to give him some time off?’ He knew exactly how to handle every situation. For me, that’s what’s made him the best. People know he was a wonderful manager - he’s one of the greatest managers ever - but people don’t know what he was like away from the pitch with players’ families. It was very important.</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Jones says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> great <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> didn’t get recognition he deserves]</b> He’s a sporting great, not just for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, but for football itself. I think his achievements were overshadowed and under-appreciated a bit. I don’t think he got the recognition he should have got considering he was England’s record goalscorer, all the goals he scored for United, and the trophies he won. He was unbelievable and when he was doing this for England and United people still questioned him. But I think now people really do appreciate what he did for United and football<br /><br />I had a really good relationship with Wayne. When I first signed he helped me a lot and we became good friends. Now, if I’ve got something to speak about, he’s someone who I’d like to think I could pick up the phone and speak to. I’m sure he’s going to go into management as well. He’s a great guy and he’s just a normal, hard-working family guy</p>
