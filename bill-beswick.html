  <p><b>[Ex-Man Utd psychologist warns over coronavirus postponement]</b> It’s more dangerous for footballers than most sports. Most of the Olympic athletes I work with and the rugby players are very much self-management athletes. They’re encouraged by their clubs to self-manage. So, they have that mindset and character to get on with it. Football players traditionally have been managed exclusively and told not to think<br /><br />It’s similar to being on the bench during the game. You don’t know if, or when, you’re coming on but you need to be ready. The current United manager, <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>, was famous for being ready to come on at any stage of the game, even the 87th minute, because he kept himself ready for 86 minutes waiting for the moment<br /><br /><a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> was one I worked with closely and I was very impressed with his mindset, he’s an impressive man who is doing a good job<br /><br />This situation is a challenge and usually challenges bring the best and the worst out of people. You either sink as a victim or you respond as a fighter</p>
