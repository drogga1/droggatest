  <p><b>[Russia coach Leonid Slutsky has admitted to a lack of knowledge about Euro 2016 group stage opponents Slovakia and Wales]</b> We’ve got a very interesting group. Of course, England are favourites in the group, but I think every team has a chance of making it through to the next round. So I think the matches in our group will be very interesting. There are no weak teams at the European Championships. In terms of our preparations, some of the teams’ playing styles are more similar than others. We don’t know a huge amount about Slovakia or Wales because we’ve not come across them in official matches or friendlies. Now we will start actively gathering information.</p>

  <p><b>[Leonid Slutsky says <a href="martin-odegaard.html">Martin Odegaard</a> snubbed <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> when linking up with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> His time at Vitesse has been very important. He became one of the best players in the Eredivisie and had many offers in his pocket. Not only from <a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a>, but also from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. It is an honour to have had a share in Martin’s growth as a footballer<br /><br />It was a big challenge for me to kind of resurrect his career. Martin, his agent and I reach an agreement quickly. He had to take a step forward because Vitesse were a stronger team than Heerenveen. It’s clear that <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> will decide his future with him by the end of the season. Could he stay with <a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a> for another year? I don’t know. I’m sure that Odegaard is ready to play for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> now. When I saw him play for <a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a> at the Bernabeu I realised that he definitely has the quality to play for Real Madrid</p>
