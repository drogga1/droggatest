  <p><b>[Russia coach Leonid Slutsky has admitted to a lack of knowledge about Euro 2016 group stage opponents Slovakia and Wales]</b> We’ve got a very interesting group. Of course, England are favourites in the group, but I think every team has a chance of making it through to the next round. So I think the matches in our group will be very interesting. There are no weak teams at the European Championships. In terms of our preparations, some of the teams’ playing styles are more similar than others. We don’t know a huge amount about Slovakia or Wales because we’ve not come across them in official matches or friendlies. Now we will start actively gathering information.</p>

  <p><b>[Leonid Slutsky has revealed he stayed up all night with his Russia players after their 3-0 defeat to Wales before concluding: ‘We’re shit’]</b> Up to nine in the morning <b>[after the Wales defeat]</b>, we discussed what happened. We all in unison uttered the phrase: ‘We shit’. This reality must be accepted, because it is an important point of reference.<br /><br />Like alcoholics. Acknowledge: ‘Yes, I’m an alcoholic’ - it is the most basic step to begin treatment. In all the American films, when someone says, ‘Hello, I’m an alcoholic’ it seems trivial to us. But in fact it is the most difficult thing to do</p>

  <p><b>[Leonid Slutsky will step down as CSKA Moscow coach]</b> CSKA thank Leonid Slutsky after seven years of fruitful co-operation, yielding three league titles, two Russian Cups and two Super Cups, as well as the incredible emotion that the team gave to our huge army of fans under his leadership over all these years.<br /><br />Our doors are always open to you, Leonid!</p>

  <p><b>[Outgoing CSKA Moscow coach Leonid Slutsky has said he would not be surprised to see Alan Dzagoev secure a move to the Premier League]</b> It’s obvious Alan Dzagoev is one of the top players in the Russian league. It’s not surprising that scouts were watching him and it will not be surprising if he continues his career in one of the top British clubs. <b>[But]</b> even though he scored a goal, he still has a lot of things to work on.<br /><br />It was very hard. We had lots of players missing and, even though we scored the first goal, I can blame the absence of the missing players. I would say that it was very uncomfortable to play with the missing players we had. And we had a very tough opponent to play against. Because of the missing players it’s very difficult to compete in the Champions League. The only thing I can say is that I feel disappointment.</p>

  <p><b>[Stricter rules is something that has been tried in Russia, with only six foreign players allowed on the pitch at once in domestic league games]</b> The limit on foreigners harms the level and strength of Russian football. Players do not have the incentive to play abroad, and they’re not good enough to attract top European clubs.</p>

  <p><b>[Leonid Slutsky says <a href="martin-odegaard.html">Martin Odegaard</a> snubbed <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> when linking up with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> His time at Vitesse has been very important. He became one of the best players in the Eredivisie and had many offers in his pocket. Not only from <a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a>, but also from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. It is an honour to have had a share in Martin’s growth as a footballer<br /><br />It was a big challenge for me to kind of resurrect his career. Martin, his agent and I reach an agreement quickly. He had to take a step forward because Vitesse were a stronger team than Heerenveen. It’s clear that <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> will decide his future with him by the end of the season. Could he stay with <a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a> for another year? I don’t know. I’m sure that Odegaard is ready to play for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> now. When I saw him play for <a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a> at the Bernabeu I realised that he definitely has the quality to play for Real Madrid</p>
