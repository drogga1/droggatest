  <p><b>[Lionel Messi will sign a new contract with Barcelona in the near future]</b> The renewal is very close and we hope to announce it soon, without further pressure. We are not rushing to announce a coach. We are at a crucial moment of the season and we have to be focused on the team to feel our support. There is no hurry or urgency to establish a date.<br /><br />Since the season 2003-04, we have won 29 titles of a possible 57, which is 50.8%. We have won eight leagues and four Champions League crowns. In this same period, Real Madrid won 13 trophies, including two Champions Leagues and three La Liga titles. It would be a mistake to carry out an analysis based on comparing us with other teams, we will take stock in all areas, we will not do it against Real Madrid or another club</p>

  <p><b>[Lionel Messi remains the best player in history regardless of what Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo may say or do]</b> Respect to the Ballon d’Or and to Cristiano Ronaldo. We have always considered him a great player and a great competitor. But here at the Camp Nou, we can see the best player in history every 15 days, which is Messi.<br /><br /><b>[Javier Mascherano is tied to a deal until 2019]</b> Mascherano has earned respect. As the coach said, after the January window, the club should come out stronger and not weaker. The general interest of the club is above the individual wishes of any of us, including the player. The player is listened to and taken into account</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona have denied reports that Neymar’s father has called club president Josep Maria Bartomeu to guage interest in a return for his son]</b> That’s not correct. But we don’t speak about calls or conversations made in the private aspect. Neymar is a great player but he has a contract with PSG and there’s not anything else to add. We never speak about players with a contract with other clubs and Neymar is one of them. He took a legitimate decision to leave, a decision which we didn’t share, and there’s not much more to say. He has a contract and many obligations with PSG; we are only thinking about the great players we have right now.<br /><br /><b>[On Ernesto Valverde]</b> We are very happy with Valverde, he is a great coach and he is doing a great job. He has a contract and we are very calm, we have to let him work.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> spokesman Josep Vives wanted to avoid falling into a trap by discussing a possible return to the club for <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>]</b> It’s something we’re not going to get into. Now, he is a <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> player and we do not have to talk. We will not say anything because we will fall into a trap.<br /><br /><b>[Vives refused to say whether the Brazil international would be welcomed back]</b> We don’t leave the door open or closed. The facts are known. We explained them. He’s a <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> player and from there we don’t talk about <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> or anyone. It’s <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. We will not do it here</p>
