  <p><b>[All 20 <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> clubs, the Italian FA (FIGC), and <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> itself have signed their names to an open letter admitting Italian football has a serious problem with racism]</b> We have to publicly recognise that we have a serious problem with racism. It’s a problem that we have not done enough to combat over the years. Images of players being racially abused in Italian football have been viewed and discussed all around the world this season and that shames us all.<br /><br />No individual should ever be subjected to racist abuse – inside or outside of football – and we can no longer stay silent on this issue or wait for it to magically disappear. Driven by the clubs, positive conversations have been held in recent weeks with Lega <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>, FIGC and international experts on how to tackle and eradicate this issue from the game.<br /><br />We, the undersigned clubs, are united by our desire for serious change and Lega <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> has stated its intention to lead the way by delivering a comprehensive and robust <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> anti-racism policy, stricter new laws and regulations and a plan for educating those within the game about the scourge of racism. We don’t have any more time to waste. We must now act with speed, with purpose and with unity and we call on you, the fans, to support us in this vitally important endeavour. Yours sincerely</p>
