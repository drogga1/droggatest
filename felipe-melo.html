  <p><b>[Felipe Melo has revealed that Brazil used to tactically kick out at <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> to disturb the Argentina star’s rhythm]</b> He’s a unique player. When Brazil played against him we used to say ‘we have to kick him once each, we have to rotate’. If we didn’t, it was too difficult to mark him. We didn’t want to break him, just to cut his rhythm and to disturb him - it was tactical<br /><br /><a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is incredible, more so than <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> can score five goals for you, but <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> can score those five and then make his team-mates score as well. He’s more complete<br /><br />Referees break your balls everywhere, but they’re different. In England, if you kick someone the fans say ‘ooooh’ but the referee doesn’t change his mind. But the same kick in Spain gets you sent off. In Brazil, some leave you and some send you off and that’s why I love the Copa Libertadores. If you get a Brazilian referee, you can get sent off but with an Argentinian, not necessarily</p>

  <p><b>[Felipe Melo after <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Chiellini</a>’s comment]</b> First of all, it would be interesting to know which episodes he is referring to. When I was in Turin, I never disrespected anyone: my team-mates, the managers, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> in general. At this point, however, I have no respect for him and I never will. He says that <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Balotelli</a> is to be slapped and that I am the worst of the worst because he always risked a fight because of me? Well, he always p*ssed himself with fear. Sorry, but it’s too easy to speak ill of others with a book. Maybe ‘this defender’ is still mad at me because when I went to <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a>, we slapped them out of the Champions League. Maybe it’s because Inter won everything and I’m an Interista. And another thing comes to mind: we beat Italy 3-0 in the 2009 Confederations Cup and we won it. Maybe that’s why he’s torturing himself. Furthermore, at international level, he hasn’t won anything. In conclusion, saying certain things is unprofessional. This is disrespect. I’ll stop here and won’t add anything else - certain things must remain in the changing rooms.</p>

  <p><b>[Felipe Melo has once again hit out at Georgio <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Chiellini</a> following the <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> star’s criticism in his new book]</b> He just has a problem with me because I headbutted him when we were playing against Siena. I haven’t spoken to him since and he wrote this book. I said what I needed to say. A thousand things happened at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> and I could write a thousand books about it, far more important stuff than this. <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Chiellini</a> never apologised to me, but that’s fine, as long as he takes responsibility for what he said. He just stirred up this controversy to sell his book. He should’ve followed the example set by the great <a href="javier-zanetti.html">Javier Zanetti</a>, vice-president of Inter, who never even spoke about <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> in his book. Besides which, this is really not the time to be publishing a book, when people are dying<br /><br />Inter had been my dream since childhood. I made history at <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a> and it was really too comfortable for me to remain there, because I was an idol for those fans. I’d just signed a new three-year contract, but went to Inter and took a 50 per cent pay cut, a decision made with the heart. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> and others had already tried to get me to Inter when I was at <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a>, but unfortunately I went to <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>. I never spoke badly about <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, but walking out at San Siro in the Milan derby wearing the Inter jersey was the ultimate thrill for me. We won 1-0.</p>

  <p><b>[Felipe Melo says Trying to kick <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> out of a game doesn’t work]</b> I played a lot against <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. He is special because if you kick him, he gets up and comes for another kick. He is not afraid. He is in the top three players in history, it is crazy. I remember when we played in Rosario, in a very important match for Argentina. We won 3-1 and played very well; it was an Argentina team with <a href="juan-sebastian-veron.html">Veron</a>, one of my greatest idols, who I loved. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> did not do much. I am going to tell that story to my children, my grandson - at least in that game, we stopped Messi<br /><br />There are players who make the difference. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> … then Felipe Melo with the kicking, which I do very well. But I’m not just about kicking people, am I? I was also able to assist Robinho, for me with one of the best assists in the history of the World Cup, against the Netherlands <b>[in 2010]</b>. When people think of Felipe Melo, they think of kicking, but I wasn’t just about kicking. I did not play at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, Inter, <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> and <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a> just by kicking people. I won 15 trophies, I have a little bit of quality too</p>

  <p><b>[Felipe Melo says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> can lure Lautaro to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> attracted De Ligt to Juventus]</b> It would be difficult <b>[for Inter to keep him]</b> but not because of money. Inter have the money, the Chinese owner has the money. It depends on what Inter want to do. If they want to be great again, and they are doing well as they fight <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and Lazio for the Scudetto, they have to throw money at Lautaro to stay. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> too, take him to Inter. If I am the owner, I say, ‘have whatever money you want’ because they are in the Champions League and they can be great again. But it is difficult because <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is there at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, and people love to play with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. If <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> called me to go and play with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, I would go back. The <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> defender <b>[De Ligt]</b> was wanted by <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> but <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> called him and now he is at Juve<br /><br />I know him, I see him play because I’m an Interista. My dream come true was to play at Inter. I had been at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> and it was difficult for Inter but I went when I was 32 years old, after being at <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a>. He is a player who, apart from working so hard, reminds me of <a href="gabriel-jesus.html">Gabriel Jesus</a> - he works a lot without the ball, wants to steal it from defenders, throws himself around the pitch, fights everywhere, and scores lots of goals. For me, he is the attacker of the future in world football. He is 22 years old. He will gain more power, more strength and he scores goals. I love him as a player</p>
