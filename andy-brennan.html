<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Green Gully attacker Andy Brennan has become the first professional male footballer in Australia to reveal he is gay]</b> It’s taken me years to get comfortable saying this - I’m gay. I was scared it would affect my friendships, my teammates, and my family. But the support of the people around me has been so great and helped me get to the final step; being completely open. Being open is the best way for me to feel most comfortable and be myself.<br /><br /><b>[He believes homosexuality is still shamed in football]</b> Statistically speaking, people playing sport, whether it would be football or AFL or any sport, you’d think there were more who would be gay. There is a bit of stigma within the sport and if people are going through what I went through, (they may think) it’s not okay because of not being accepted. This isn’t a call for those people to come out and tell everyone who they are. They shouldn’t have to, shouldn’t need to. If there’s people out who’ve had that burden, especially playing sport, and feel like they can’t be who they are in a professional or amateur environment, it’s vital they see others accepted</p>
