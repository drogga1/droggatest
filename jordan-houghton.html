  <p><b>[Jordan Houghton on his time at Chelsea]</b> Everyone asks me: ‘Is it disappointing not to get your shot at the first team?’. Especially now with <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> there. They ask me if I would have got my chance, but I don’t look at it like that. I had an amazing 15 years of grounding and schooling which has trained me to have a job in football. It would have been lovely to make a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> appearance but I look back at amazing memories - of coming from a little introverted kid who kicked a ball about at a local side to be in one of the best academies in the world and excel. As a kid, I wasn’t very confident in situations where I was going into new groups with people I didn’t know. It was a gradual thing of getting used to it getting older. That’s probably why I played the majority of my youth career as a centre-half. I didn’t mind playing it but I am sure the other boys spoke up for themselves and asked to be a striker or winger. It helped me in the long run as a defensive midfielder now. I eventually went back into midfield at Under-16 level. Maybe even now I take my traits for granted a little bit. I play in teams lower down the leagues with good players but I am seen as a technical player. It is down to me to take that confidence back<br /><br />I got Terry’s signed shirt in the U9s as he was my idol at the time but I was nervous because I thought I wasn’t supposed to do it. It was surreal that I trained and played with him. I see him as a friend now which is more surreal. We played together against Wycombe and AFC Wimbledon and it was under <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>. Against Wimbledon, I remember <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> absolutely hammering <a href="nemanja-matic.html">Matic</a> and threatening to get rid of him so that was an eye-opener! I then went on tour with the first team. I took what I could from training with these guys and the first player who stuck out was <a href="deco.html">Deco</a>. He was just a class player with his touches. <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a>, <a href="diego-costa.html">Diego Costa</a>, <a href="cesc-fabregas.html">Cesc Fabregas</a>, <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> and <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a>. But I think <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> was the best first-team player that I played with. He was incredible but he didn’t train so hard to be fresh for big games in the difficult periods. He was unplayable when he turned it on in training. I remember really enjoying training under <a href="roberto-di-matteo.html">Di Matteo</a>, <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>, <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> and Rafa Benitez<br /><br />Ruben had all the attributes so you knew that he could be a top player. He was an absolute beast. Me and him started from U9s. We got to the U16s youth team and it was only me and him left from our group. He was always a big guy but he struggled with his back in the U16s but he came back the next season and he was an absolute beast. He grew into a man; he was big, strong and quick. Still, he had the technical ability to glide past players. I remember he was up against <a href="yaya-toure.html">Yaya Toure</a> in a post-season tour in America. I imagine Toure was mentally on his holidays but he came up against Ruben and he ran him off the pitch and bullied him. That’s what he can do. Now, he is still going and going strong. I am sure when he is back, he is going to hit the ground running because he is a top player. He will be a top player for England. I am sure he will go down in the history books as one of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and England’s best players. He has absolutely everything and he deserves his success<br /><br />I am close to reaching 200 games in my career. It has been good to knuckle down and get those games consistently. I have a manager in Russell Martin that trusts me and wants me to do well. I am in defensive midfield as a pivot which is a position that I feel suits me best. We’re fluid, play out from the back and are a passing team. I am really enjoying it. I feel I have done well but there’s more to come from me. The next goal is to play in the Championship. That’s the minimum I want to get to. If I haven’t got to the Championship, it would be an underachievement in what I see from myself as a player. That’s my next goal to get there, hopefully with MK Dons. We have still got work this season to make sure we are safe but we can look up next season. There’s a lot of us success stories who have come from that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> academy scene who are now outside the club. The academy gets the plaudits it deserves</p>
