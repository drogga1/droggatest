  <p><b>[Mamelodi Sundowns have released a letter in which Keagan Dolly was invited to the Manchester City academy last year]</b> Mamelodi Sundowns has decided to release the email that it received on 25 August 2016 from Brian Marwood, Managing Director of City Football Services inviting Keagan Dolly and Mamelodi Sundowns to the Manchester City Football Academy.<br /><br />This email was part of the ongoing communications and exploratory discussions that Mamelodi Sundowns initiated with City Football Group in 2015 and representitives from City Football Group visited Mamelodi Sundowns and attended some of its games. It is clear from the email that City Football Group and its scouts had been following Keagan Dolly ‘for quite some time’. Part of the discussions between Mamelodi Sundowns and City Football Group were to ‘park’ Keagan Dolly in the short term, at one of the European Clubs that had a partnership with City Football Group.<br /><br />We are disappointed and concerned by the continuous lies and misrepresentation which is spread by Paul Mitchell, Keagan Dolly’s agent, which makes any cooperation difficult. Mamelodi Sundowns does not want to be seen as a Club that can be blackmailed to sell players because of misrepresentations and pressure in the media. Mamelodi Sundowns remains committed, as stated by its President Patrice Motsepe, to immediately release Keagan Dolly to any Club which comply’s with the buy-out clause which was upheld by the PSL Dispute Resolution Chamber.</p>

  <p><b>[RB Leipzig head of recruitment and development Paul Mitchell has refused to rule out the possibility of him taking up a similar role at Manchester United]</b> Manchester United are recognised for being one of the biggest clubs in the world. So any link with a club of that size, history and status is very flattering and I am a Manchester boy. There hasn’t been any contact with United at this moment, for me it’s always about focusing on the job in hand. I’m more than aware I work for a great organisation, but then like always you never know in football what can happen in the future.</p>

  <p><b>[RB Leipzig are monitoring Ademola Lookman’s future at Everton]</b> It’s clear how much affection we have for Ademola and I think from the way he performed here, the environment we created for him and the platform we gave him, he also enjoyed his time here. And with a situation like that, we would always be open to revisiting, but you never know. At this moment he is an Everton player and he’s working with some really good people there. We know him and we will always keep a very close eye on his development because we see him as a Red Bull guy from his time here. But at the moment we just have to hope that he continues his progression as a footballer and let’s see what the future brings.</p>
