  <p><b>[RB Leipzig head of recruitment and development Paul Mitchell has refused to rule out the possibility of him taking up a similar role at Manchester United]</b> Manchester United are recognised for being one of the biggest clubs in the world. So any link with a club of that size, history and status is very flattering and I am a Manchester boy. There hasn’t been any contact with United at this moment, for me it’s always about focusing on the job in hand. I’m more than aware I work for a great organisation, but then like always you never know in football what can happen in the future.</p>

  <p><b>[RB Leipzig are monitoring Ademola Lookman’s future at Everton]</b> It’s clear how much affection we have for Ademola and I think from the way he performed here, the environment we created for him and the platform we gave him, he also enjoyed his time here. And with a situation like that, we would always be open to revisiting, but you never know. At this moment he is an Everton player and he’s working with some really good people there. We know him and we will always keep a very close eye on his development because we see him as a Red Bull guy from his time here. But at the moment we just have to hope that he continues his progression as a footballer and let’s see what the future brings.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Mitchell joins <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> as sporting director]</b> I am looking forward to coming to <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a>. I would like to thank Mr. <a href="oleg-petrov.html">Oleg Petrov</a> and the club for their trust. I would also like to thank Red Bull for the years I spent at their side. I am looking forward to taking up my position, meeting the teams and starting to work together to develop the project and establish a sustainable philosophy for the club<br /><br />It is a great satisfaction to welcome Paul Mitchell to <a href="monaco-fc.html">AS Monaco</a> after several successful years with Red Bull and I would like to thank Red Bull for making his appointment possible in a very professional manner. Paul will bring his skills in the detection, recruitment and development of our players, from the academy to the first team.
