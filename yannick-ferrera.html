<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Yannick Ferrera, who is now in charge of Saudi Arabian outfit Al-Fateh, worked with Musonda at under-age level at Anderlecht and despite having also mentored the likes of <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a>, <a href="michy-batshuayi.html">Michy Batshuayi</a> and <a href="adnan-januzaj.html">Adnan Januzaj</a>, he is adamant that the Brussels native was the best of the lot]</b> When we played in European tournaments and stuff everyone was crazy about him. He almost won the best player trophy at every tournament that he went to. The whole of Europe knew him already.<br /><br />A lot of teams wanted him and kept speaking to his family to sign him. We couldn’t hide him. He was too good to hide. He has always been my favourite. He was the player I liked the most and the most talented I have ever coached.<br /><br />Honestly, when I saw him when he was 10 or 11 years old, I thought, ‘This is a player who will be among the top five in the world. He is going to be like <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> or something’. I rated him that highly and I never thought that about anyone else I trained.<br /><br />First of all, he was really gifted technically. The most impressive thing with him was his vision and maturity. At 10 years old, he played like a 30-year-old guy who was already a professional. He had calm, experience and leadership that you just don’t see in a kid.<br /><br />I have never seen this ever since. At some point, he made a choice with his family to move to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. After that, he did well at <a href="real-betis.html">Betis</a>. Then, he went to Vitesse and Celtic and he has been injured. He is injured again now. But I keep believing in him. I still believe he can be one of the game’s biggest players. Just because he is 23, it isn’t too late. His talent is still there. His vision is still there. He needs some luck with injuries, the right team and coach. He needs one or two years of football. Then people will see that he was not only a rising star that never made it. I am sure he will still make it. I believe that</p>
