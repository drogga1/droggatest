  <p><b>[Brighton star Laura Rafferty using injury lay-off to aid good causes]</b> I’ve tried to see it as an opportunity instead of time wasted. When I found out, my body went numb and everything just switched off. I didn’t have any thoughts or feelings. I felt nothing. It was the worst thing ever. I had done my meniscus and my ACL. My agent gave me two days to grieve and then asked me how I was going to use the time off to improve as a player<br /><br /><b>[Rafferty has joined ‘Common Goal’]</b> I want to be helping people, that’s what makes me happy and I believe if you’re happy off the pitch, you perform better on it. There’s lots of things I want to help with and work on. The whole equality side of things, LGBT awareness and one project I specifically want to work on is to help women who have ambitions to get jobs but maybe feel they haven’t got the opportunity to get that interview. I’m lucky enough to have people around me who have helped me get to where I am, so if I can help people do what they want to do and help them achieve their goals, then I will do so.<br /><br /><b>[She was working at a bank but was also on the books at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> when she reached a crossroads in her life]</b> It paid off for me because I got the contract. But it was a challenge and I had to borrow money to get the bus to training every day because I had given up my job. Luckily, I had support but some people don’t have that. I want to be able to have conversations with people on how they can prepare themselves for such situations, whether that be financially or mentally. I want to give them a kick-start that they might not have necessarily got otherwise. It’s so important to me to be able to help other people <br /><br />I read something on social media and it said: ‘just because you’re not racist, doesn’t mean that you’re helping’, and that really hit me. I think everyone is equal but then I thought what am I doing now that’s going to help? I don’t feel like I’ve done enough but SARI has given me the chance to dig in and help even more<br /><br />I was so lucky with the treatment I received and the constant support. I feel bad because when I suffered the injury, it was at a time when six other girls had done the same thing, and while some of us could get an operation, some couldn’t. It just depended on the situation you and your club were in as to whether you would get constant help. I’m nearly back fit now but some players still haven’t had an operation and that’s mad and sad to think about. So, I constantly keep in touch with some of the girls because I’ve been there and done that. I ask myself how I can help them get through it. We keep in close contact.<br /><br />The support from the club has been better than I can ask for. I was never worried about it (furloughing) because the club is so good with every person and every employee, whether you’re a footballer, a chef, or whatever you do. They’re very good at communication<br /><br />I think we have to use it as an opportunity to increase awareness. All these teams have worked so hard and put in so much money to make it happen, it would be awful if it went underground now. I think there are things that can be done, whether that’s interacting with fans on social media to build the fan base or just generally trying to raise the profile of the game. On a personal level, it’s surreal I will get a chance to play in the Olympics and the next Euro qualifiers because they’ve moved to next year, as I thought they were games that I would miss. But the delay has given me a bit of time to get back on my feet and sharpen up. I’m excited and hopefully it will make it all more worthwhile<br /><br />This isolation doesn’t hinder my motivation to be back. I’m using all the hunger I can ready to go again at the start of the season. I’ve learned a lot during this rehab time. I know I’m a lot stronger than I give myself credit for. I know I can help a lot more people than I thought I could. I’m very happy with myself and how I’ve dealt with everything. I’m ready to go and make more of myself. And help as many other people as I can</p>
