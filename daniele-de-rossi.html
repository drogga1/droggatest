I’m calm, because I’m not thinking whether or not it will be my last year of the contract. These are conversations that I must have with my family, sooner or later I’ll have to think about it, but not now. But it could also be the last season, so why not make it the most beautiful of my career? Now I have to forget about it. My goal is to have a great season. I do not think now about what I will do, a mature player must be in step with his physique and every decision we’ll take will be taken with clear thought</p>

At the time I was already playing for Roma, but not with the national team. I made my debut for the national youth teams at 16. It was a dream, something very difficult to achieve, but fortunately I’ve been able to achieve it for many years. It seems to me that I’ve done something incredible, never mind Gigi who’s been doing it for 20 years. The national was and is something unique for a player, and what Gigi has done will remain unrepeatable forever</p>

  <p><b>[Daniele De Rossi is bidding an emotional farewell to Roma after 18 years at his home-town club]</b> Please, let me say thank you to everyone at Roma that I came to know: The Sensi family, and President <a href="james-pallotta.html">Pallotta</a>. All the women and men that have worked, and continue to work, at Trigoria. The coaches that shaped me; all of them - without exception - taught me something important. The medical staff that always took care of me; and Damiano, without whom I would certainly have made fewer appearances for this club. My teammates, the part of the job I always enjoyed the most - they are my family. That daily routine, those times in the changing room at Trigoria, will be the thing I miss most of all.<br /><br />Bruno, who saw something special in me and brought me into this club’s fantastic academy. It was there, one morning in August, that I first met Simone and Mancio - we have been friends ever since, and will be for the rest of our lives. Thank you Davide, I know you will be alongside me for the rest of my life too. Thank you to Francesco. The captain’s armband I wore was inherited from the arm of a brother, a great captain and the most incredible footballer I have ever seen wear this shirt. Not everyone gets to play alongside their idol for 16 years. Now, with respect, I will pass this armband on to Alessandro. Another brother, one that I know is equally worthy of the honour.<br /><br />Thank you to mum and dad, for instilling in me two values that I have carried with me every single day: to never do to someone else something you would not want them to do to you, and to always offer a hand to those in trouble. Thank you to Ostia; to its people and its coast. You helped raise me as a child, you spurred me on as a teenager, and you welcomed me back as an adult. Thank you also to those who supported me - and suffered with me - within the walls of our home: without Gaia, Olivia, Noah and especially Sarah I would be half the man I am today.<br /><br />Thank you to every Roma fan, my fans. Today, at least, I’ll allow myself to call you ‘my fans’ - because I was one of you, out there on the pitch, and the love you have always shown me helped me to keep on doing that. You are all the reason why I chose this city, this life, time and time again. Sunday will be the 616th time I make that choice, the right choice. No-one will ever love you more than I do</p>

It is a unique place, very similar to Italy - more than we think, also because half of them are of Italian origin. They live on passion for anything, from food to music, to a passion for football. It’s a championship that can be technically and tactically discussed, but in six months I haven’t seen a player pulling back his leg or not giving 200 per cent.<br /><br /><b>[It was the atmosphere at La <a href="boca-juniors.html">Bombonera</a> that De Rossi said he would treasure above all else]</b> It is not about being a ruffian, which I don’t like.

  <p><b>[De Rossi: I want to coach Roma, even if it takes me 20 years to get the job]</b> I followed a path that is not unique but is rare. Playing 20 years for one team doesn’t happen every day. That can’t happen if I become a coach, especially at Roma. One day I would like to coach Roma, but first I have to become a coach. As well as the courses, there is a development path that all young coaches need. In a few days I went from being an old footballer to a young coach, so I start by seeing things with tranquillity and calm. I am not in a hurry to make it happen tomorrow: it could happen in five, 10 or 20 years. But it will happen only because I will have become good, not because I was an important player for this team. I have always been recognised as a leader, so maybe I will take advantage of this, but the coach is much more than this.<br /><br />I will go to see a thousand coaches, because I need it. A child on his feet cannot see how an elderly man is sitting. I am a child right now. They will be professional trips but also fun because I really like this world</p>
