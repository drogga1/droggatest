I’m calm, because I’m not thinking whether or not it will be my last year of the contract. These are conversations that I must have with my family, sooner or later I’ll have to think about it, but not now. But it could also be the last season, so why not make it the most beautiful of my career? Now I have to forget about it. My goal is to have a great season. I do not think now about what I will do, a mature player must be in step with his physique and every decision we’ll take will be taken with clear thought</p>

  <p><b>[Asked whether he now hopes to retire at Roma]</b> I don’t know. I always thought it’d be great if I could, with all due respect and the correct proportions, experience a day like the one Totti had on May 28 when he retired. It’d be wonderful to experience such an intense salute with the fans. I don’t know when and I don’t know how.<br /><br />At the same time, I do feel the strong desire to have an experience elsewhere. Frankly, 16 years at Roma is like 32 elsewhere, because they really weigh on you and are a tough slog. Thank God, I am physically having the best seasons of my career, but the pressure is often excessive here.<br /><br />I think I would, and ought to, have an experience elsewhere. I had already decided to do it last year, as for long periods there was no contact with the club over my renewal. It wasn’t too bad in my view: I was playing well, so would leave a happy memory. For a while, it was my plan to leave. The biggest offer on the table was from another Italian club.<br /><br />However, my heart and love won out: I couldn’t betray the city and the fans. If a big European or American club had come in - and it’s no secret one of my dreams is to go to America for a lifestyle and football experience - I probably wouldn’t be here today</p>

At the time I was already playing for Roma, but not with the national team. I made my debut for the national youth teams at 16. It was a dream, something very difficult to achieve, but fortunately I’ve been able to achieve it for many years. It seems to me that I’ve done something incredible, never mind Gigi who’s been doing it for 20 years. The national was and is something unique for a player, and what Gigi has done will remain unrepeatable forever</p>

  <p><b>[Daniele de Rossi is glad Italy no longer have to worry about Zlatan Ibrahimovic]</b> The fact there there’s no Ibrahimovic is an advantage for anyone who has to face them. Even at 40 with a broken leg I’d never want Ibra against me. It could be an advantage <b>[for Sweden]</b>, it’s certainly better that he’s not there. It’s not that the rest of them are strangers though, we know them because some of them play in Italy and others play in important European leagues. They’re no mugs.<br /><br />If the World Cup is important for me, when I’ve already played three, let’s think how important it is for those who have never been there. Going to the World Cup is everything. San Siro will be sold out, so it’ll be a great stage and we’ll have to prove we belong there and stand up to it. To ask for faith from the fans would be inappropriate right now, it’s not the right time. We have to win this game<br /><br />We’re strong, maybe better than Sweden, but there’s a little bit of fear that right now is almost necessary. Football is a lot more open now, the great players aren’t just in the big European countries, or Brazil and Argentina. There’s a lot of confidence in the dressing room though</p>

  <p><b>[Daniele De Rossi and Andrea Barzagli have joined Gianluigi Buffon in announcing their retirement from international play]</b> We will begin again, just as we did after other desperately disappointing moments. I don’t believe we deserved to go out considering the 180 minutes. Sweden deserve credit for their performance, but it was fairly even. Now the next generation is ready to take flight and we must begin again from them. It was almost an absurd moment to associate with a football match. There was a funeral atmosphere in the locker room, yet nobody died. I’ve been wandering around Coverciano and all over the world with this jersey for over a decade, so to take it off for the last time is a strange feeling.</p>

I just said we were near the end and had to win, so send the strikers to warm up. I pointed to Insigne too. It wasn’t up to me whether it was a tactical issue. I’m sorry if I offended anyone. At the time I just thought perhaps it was better that Insigne come on instead.</p>

Buying one of the top two players in the world means aiming even higher, but he’ll have to adapt and the team will have to adapt to him. Not everything is written, even if they’re a team who already had the advantage of being better than everyone else. Now, with him, the objective is the Champions League, but it’s not written that they’ll win in Europe, just as it isn’t that they’ll win another league.</p>

  <p><b>[Daniele De Rossi is ‘not over the moon’ to be ending his career-long association with Roma at the end of the season]</b> Roma and I chose each other. There is a lot of love between us, both now and in the future - even if it will be in another form. Don’t bet against seeing me in with the fans at a few away games, having a sandwich and a beer and cheering on my friends. Looking back, some specific moments I would change. But overall, I wouldn’t change anything about staying loyal to this team. If I had a magic wand, I would have put a few more trophies on the mantelpiece.<br /><br />I realised the decision the club was going to take regarding myself. I’m almost 36 and I know how football is, but I didn’t want to distract from our European race. I thank the directors for their offer - I respect it and appreciate it, but I still feel like a player. I don’t agree that the decision should have been mine alone. The club exists to make these sort of decisions, alongside the coaches. Someone has to make that ultimate call.<br /><br />Eventually I would like to be a coach. At this point I don’t see myself becoming a director, but at Roma a role like that would have some meaning. I need to go away and study, to learn - it will be a long journey. I’m not over the moon, but I accept the decision of the club. I have no resentment towards that. We never spoke about money: that was not the crux of the matter.</p>

  <p><b>[Daniele De Rossi is bidding an emotional farewell to Roma after 18 years at his home-town club]</b> Please, let me say thank you to everyone at Roma that I came to know: The Sensi family, and President <a href="james-pallotta.html">Pallotta</a>. All the women and men that have worked, and continue to work, at Trigoria. The coaches that shaped me; all of them - without exception - taught me something important. The medical staff that always took care of me; and Damiano, without whom I would certainly have made fewer appearances for this club. My teammates, the part of the job I always enjoyed the most - they are my family. That daily routine, those times in the changing room at Trigoria, will be the thing I miss most of all.<br /><br />Bruno, who saw something special in me and brought me into this club’s fantastic academy. It was there, one morning in August, that I first met Simone and Mancio - we have been friends ever since, and will be for the rest of our lives. Thank you Davide, I know you will be alongside me for the rest of my life too. Thank you to Francesco. The captain’s armband I wore was inherited from the arm of a brother, a great captain and the most incredible footballer I have ever seen wear this shirt. Not everyone gets to play alongside their idol for 16 years. Now, with respect, I will pass this armband on to Alessandro. Another brother, one that I know is equally worthy of the honour.<br /><br />Thank you to mum and dad, for instilling in me two values that I have carried with me every single day: to never do to someone else something you would not want them to do to you, and to always offer a hand to those in trouble. Thank you to Ostia; to its people and its coast. You helped raise me as a child, you spurred me on as a teenager, and you welcomed me back as an adult. Thank you also to those who supported me - and suffered with me - within the walls of our home: without Gaia, Olivia, Noah and especially Sarah I would be half the man I am today.<br /><br />Thank you to every Roma fan, my fans. Today, at least, I’ll allow myself to call you ‘my fans’ - because I was one of you, out there on the pitch, and the love you have always shown me helped me to keep on doing that. You are all the reason why I chose this city, this life, time and time again. Sunday will be the 616th time I make that choice, the right choice. No-one will ever love you more than I do</p>

The people I’ve met here have been magical, I will never forget this experience. This decision wasn’t made from one day to the next, this decision was made a while ago<br /><br /><b>[despite bringing the curtain down on his playing career, De Rossi is unlikely to be leaving football for good after admitting he hopes to move into management]</b> I have the dream of becoming a head coach. I want to study for that. I’ll always be close to football, football is my life</p>

  <p><b>[His time at <a href="boca-juniors.html">Boca Juniors</a> lasted barely six months as he announced his retirement at the beginning of 2020]</b> I don’t have any health-related issues, I have the need to be with my daughter. They miss me, and I miss them. The board offered me their help. But I don’t need help. I need to go back home. I’m not only saying goodbye to a club that’s in my heart, I’m saying goodbye to football, it’s my world. I don’t want to get into details. I’ve already explained it well. My oldest daughter was the only one to stay in Italy. She’s living well, she’s not in danger, she just needs her father</p>

  <p><b>[Daniele De Rossi said playing for <a href="boca-juniors.html">Boca Juniors</a> showed him Argentina has a passion for football that Italy cannot match]</b> I would need a whole quarantine to describe the emotions I experienced in those six months. It is a unique place, very similar to Italy - more than we think, also because half of them are of Italian origin. They live on passion for anything, from food to music, to a passion for football. It’s a championship that can be technically and tactically discussed, but in six months I haven’t seen a player pulling back his leg or not giving 200 per cent.<br /><br /><b>[It was the atmosphere at La <a href="boca-juniors.html">Bombonera</a> that De Rossi said he would treasure above all else]</b> It is not about being a ruffian, which I don’t like. But the most beautiful thing is what you see in the stands. It is a warmth that we no longer have in Italy: it is pure and selfless passion. La <a href="boca-juniors.html">Bombonera</a> is the most absurd and sensational stadium in the world. I wish all fans to be able to visit it during a Boca match. I feel privileged to have played there, even if it didn’t last long</p>

  <p><b>[De Rossi reveals why he turned down <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>]</b> Since I was a child I have loved United. It was the right choice that I didn’t go to Manchester because there was Keane and <a href="paul-scholes.html">Scholes</a>, incredible players. It was really my desire to go to <a href="boca-juniors.html">Boca Juniors</a>. I never chose to leave Roma, but I felt like a god at Boca.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Bonucci</a> has earned a reputation for being a difficult character]</b> We’re talking about a guy who all the people I know tell me is irritating and unlikable. There is this perception of Leo and a reputation, but it’s totally wrong. He’s an incredible professional and it’s sad that people think he’s unlikable. He can be a bit annoying at times on the pitch, but that’s because of the jersey he wears, as that club gives you a certain attitude and it’s one of the reasons why they win so much<br /><br /><b>[Despite their friendship, De Rossi recalls one incident in which tempers did flare between the pair]</b> He threw a boot at me in training once, it slipped and caught me with a stud. It was a little less of a joke for a moment, but it was all water under the bridge a minute later. <a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Bonucci</a> is one of the lads I remember with most fondness. That dinner table was chaos, great times</p>

  <p><b>[De Rossi: I want to coach Roma, even if it takes me 20 years to get the job]</b> I followed a path that is not unique but is rare. Playing 20 years for one team doesn’t happen every day. That can’t happen if I become a coach, especially at Roma. One day I would like to coach Roma, but first I have to become a coach. As well as the courses, there is a development path that all young coaches need. In a few days I went from being an old footballer to a young coach, so I start by seeing things with tranquillity and calm. I am not in a hurry to make it happen tomorrow: it could happen in five, 10 or 20 years. But it will happen only because I will have become good, not because I was an important player for this team. I have always been recognised as a leader, so maybe I will take advantage of this, but the coach is much more than this.<br /><br />I will go to see a thousand coaches, because I need it. A child on his feet cannot see how an elderly man is sitting. I am a child right now. They will be professional trips but also fun because I really like this world</p>
