  <p><b>[Andre Villas-Boas has questioned the logic behind Real Madrid’s decision to sell Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> I’m not in a hurry and will wait to see what’s going to happen during the season. For me, choosing well means also understanding why a club wants me. The latter is a key aspect: teams change coaches with great speed and often do not look at the technical philosophy of a technician, but his percentage of career victories. So they end up being disappointed when quality is lacking in the game and the public loses interest<br /><br />Italy obviously interests me. From a tactical point of view it is one of the most difficult championships. In the future who knows?<br /><br />It totally surprised me. How do you sell Cristiano for 100 million? It does not make sense from any point of view: neither sport nor economic. Congratulations to Juventus for the blow they were able to make<br /><br /><b>[Villas-Boas believes that Ronaldo should be handed another Ballon d’Or in 2018]</b> Absolutely, yes.

  <p><b>[Andre Villas-Boas claims he rejected an approach from Paris Saint-Germain while manager of Tottenham]</b> The first season was magnificent in all aspects. We had a ‘short’ squad in terms of depth, but a great spirit and so much will. We picked up the most points in Spurs’ history with an incredible Bale who played behind Adebayor where he was free to move, but also with Lennon and Walker who allowed us to have a good counter-attacking 4-4-2. I got an offer from Paris Saint-Germain, who wanted me, but I said no out of love for Tottenham. Maybe that was a mistake.<br /><br />In April, we started planning for the next season. I offered some names to buy and sell, but during the transfer window, the board didn’t listen and quickly destroyed everything we’d created</p>

  <p><b>[What an extraordinary feat!’ - Villas-Boas savours <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a>’s <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> finish]</b> Runners-up of France! What to say? Which words to choose? Where to start? What an extraordinary feat! So many moments of joy, so many explosions of feelings! Summarising this season between brilliance and exceptional moments is too easy because it has been so for several consecutive games. What has marked and often marks the teams of choice is the ability to reinvent themselves in the face of adversity, whether it is when it hits bottom or when dreams escape us. We were a group! We were a team. We knew we were consistent and had the right word and the right reaction to each other. This state of mind is felt on a daily basis in communion with everyone. The other’s problem is my problem. It was like that every step of the way. Thank you all without exception. To my brilliant and unrivalled players who, with a lot of effort and selflessness, gave everything in every game. To Frank McCourt and Jacques Henri-Eyraud. To <a href="andoni-zubizarreta.html">Andoni Zubizarreta</a> and Albert Valentin who brought me to this wonderful city of <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> and allowed me to know the strength of the Velodrome and the unique passion of its inhabitants. To my staff, travel friends, my kings of skills. To the decisive and tolerant medical staff who have achieved unique results this season. Administrative and logistics staff attentive to every detail. To Rani who is always everywhere to solve problems. To Elodie who has a crazy Portuguese by her side. To everyone who participated in this wonderful trip, thank you. In this sensation and this desire to burst out in joy, we are called to reason which alerts us to the sad moment we are living. We would trade all victories and trophies for each of the lives lost. To the fans who are currently overwhelmed by these same sensations, who want to cry out with joy but where the tear persists in retaining passion, thank you! Thank you from the heart! Your strength and your sense of demand forced us to respond. This victory is also yours. I would like to finish by dedicating this second place to the former <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> president Pape Diouf</p>

  <p><b>[Ambitious Villas-Boas eager to remain at <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> but wants transfer assurances]</b> In the world of football there are several good coaches, it is not with this second-place finish that I will become the best coach in the world, nor the worst. I remain as I am. I already said at a press conference that you could find me <b>[in a few months]</b> closer to the Dakar desert <b>[competing in the Dakar Rally]</b> than to a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> club or elsewhere. I have ambitions that are limitless geographically - I still have to do Japan, I want to discover Japanese culture and Japanese football. I say it sincerely, I’m fine in <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a>, I don’t want to look for other clubs or other options. I want to play the Champions League with <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a>, but I want to know how much we are economically dependent on our project. That means, if we don’t have the conditions to do a good job, it is not worth it, I think. It’s normal for a coach to seek such assurances. I think <a href="jacques-henri-eyraud.html">Jacques-Henri Eyraud</a> <b>[<a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> president]</b> will have answers, like Andoni <b>[<a href="andoni-zubizarreta.html">Zubizarreta</a>, sporting director]</b> and Frank McCourt <b>[club owner]</b> will, obviously. Then, if there are differences between us, Jacques-Henri and I are honest enough to say. On my side, I am open, but it is necessary that we have the opportunity with Andoni to have a quality transfer window, in conditions that will not be the best, but that will allow us to be competitive. We are not so naive as to forget the economic situation of the club. <b>[I just want to]</b> understand where we are going, understand how much we can make in investments, if the club wants me, or if it does not want me, and in this case no problem.</p>
