  <p><b>[Andy Robertson’s performances for Liverpool have altered the opinion of John Arne Riise]</b> To be honest, I didn’t see it coming. I didn’t understand why Liverpool bought him in the beginning. People were talking about getting a big name player at left-back. He only played a few games early on in the season with Alberto Moreno the preferred left-back at that time. When Moreno got injured, that gave Robertson his chance and he did extremely well. I have been really impressed by him. He’s aggressive, he’s offensive, he’s quick and he never stops running. Hopefully now he starts getting more assists and a goal or two. That’s what is maybe missing from his game so far.<br /><br />This year it’s been hard to achieve things because City are playing football that we’ve never been before in the Premier League. But I feel like the club is really taking steps forward. We have a tough tie against City but you never know what can happen. If you want to win the Champions League, you have to beat the best. We could have got an easier game but at the same time it’s an all English game. City’s players will know that coming to Anfield on a European night will be something big. I had my best moments in a Liverpool shirt on Champions League nights. I know that the players and the fans will be up for it. City maybe the small favourites but my money is on Liverpool</p>

  <p><b>[John Arne Riise expects ‘amazing’ Liverpool-Man City Champions League tie]</b> It is going to be amazing. I am going to make sure I am there!<br /><br />There is more to lose to these teams because they are from the same league. That can make it a little more tense going into the game. Everyone enjoys travelling away, seeing new stadiums and meeting new players from different countries, that is always exciting about the Champions League. But at the same time we know all the players, the stadiums and there is not far to travel, so that can be helpful. But for me the pressure is more on City; they are playing amazing football and are expected to go all the way. They are playing football like I’ve never seen, but if you want to win the Champions League you have to beat the best teams any way. Obviously we could have got an easier draw but it may be helpful. Liverpool players know what Anfield can do on Champions League nights, the City players know what Anfield can do<br /><br />It is going to be two games of offensive football with a lot of chances and a lot of goals hopefully. Probably it is the quarter-final everyone wants to watch because of the styles both teams are playing. What Guardiola has done is just magnificent: he is an amazing coach. Yes he’s had money but you still need to get the players to do the job and he’s done that in great fashion. But Jurgen is doing the same too. It will be two games of high intensity and I can’t wait for it. It is going to be amazing. City are probably favourites, but I am thinking the Champions League is something special for Liverpool and it’s a big chance for them to go all the way. Hopefully Salah, Firmino and Mane up front can do some damage!<br /><br />When you come to a club like Liverpool you are expected to win trophies and Mr Klopp knows that. But at the same time he needs to play the kind of football fans want to see. If the fans turn against you then you are in trouble but the fans love Mr Klopp. Then again he needs to win trophies to show they are progressing, which they have done this season. The style of play now is amazing and they are doing well in the Champions League. Hopefully next season they can get a better start in the Premier League so they can fight from the beginning. If the fans love the way you play then you are looking good. Certain teams would rather win games than play good football, but Liverpool want to do both: play good football but at the same time win. I think the way Jurgen is playing his football wins the fans over. He has a lot of fans around the world and he will win trophies, I am sure of that. And as soon as you start winning trophies there is no looking back. If he does that, he is just going to keep going and going</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool can see off Man City and win the Champions League]</b> This year, although it’s going to be very tight, they have a good chance of going all the way. You have the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid and Bayern still there, and they have to go through against City. There’s some great teams left but if they play like they did at Anfield on Wednesday there’s not many teams who could stop them. All the other teams left will have seen that performance, it was amazing. The high pressure, the intensity in the game was unbelievable, they almost did it for 90 minutes. Liverpool proved if they are at the top of their game, they can beat anyone. A club like Liverpool should always be in the quarter-finals, semi-finals of the Champions League and competing with the best clubs in the world. I think the fans have been waiting for it, the players the same, it’s the best competition for a player to be involved in and you want to try to give something back to the fans when you get there. I’m happy for Klopp. They expect a lot, and now he’s proven he can bring the club back to the Champions League.<br /><br />City lost against Liverpool, they lost against United, Liverpool have a habit of always scoring. It’s important for City not to concede, because they will have to score five then. I think Liverpool will go through, because they’ve got that 3-0 lead, but the game is not over. We’ve seen what City can do. If they start playing as they have most of the season, keeping the ball and scoring goals, it could be a close game. They’re good at counter attacks, which is going to be very important, and I think the main thing is not to concede a goal in the first 15-20 minutes. The players and the club have to go into the game like any other. Probably more compact than usual, but if they get too comfortable, and City score a goal they will get nervous again</p>

  <p><b>[Former Liverpool star John Arne Riise has identified Andy Robertson as one of the top left-sided defenders in the game]</b> To be honest, the way football is played now Andy Robertson is up there because of his energy and his way of going forward. Robertson is more <b>[an example of]</b> today’s modern football full-back. You need to be able to run up and down, make crosses, make assists, shoot, and also be good defensively. He’s like the perfect modern left-back. I’m a big fan. I was probably one of the first who started the modern full-back thing, being very offensive, up and down all the time, making passes, shooting, scoring goals. It was quite new when I started doing it. Now, every full-back has to be able to go up and down, and I love that style of play.<br /><br />His energy. He never stops. He rarely has a bad game, and he always gives 100 per cent. The way he runs forward brings excitement. The only thing with Robertson is I want him to be more of a goal-scoring threat. Score more goals, that’s the only thing I want. He has everything else<br /><br />The Champions League is difficult to win because those two games can change everything,” he added. “What I saw against Bayern, especially away from home, was unbelievable. So they’re good enough to go back to the final<br /><br />I’ve thought so many times over the last few years what it would be like to play under Mr. Klopp, because his style of play would have suited my game. I was lucky to play for some great managers. Obviously Benitez because he gave me the chance to win the Champions League, but I also loved playing for <b>[Claudio]</b> Ranieri when I was at Roma. It’s hard <b>[picking a favourite]</b> because I loved all my managers. Mainly because I always played!</p>

  <p><b>[John Arne Riise played in those games, including a memorable 2-1 win for the Reds at Camp Nou]</b> It was the only goal I ever scored in my career with my right foot! It was one of the great moments for me<br /><br /><b>[How Liverpool can prevent Messi wreaking havoc]</b> Arbeloa was brilliant. He was so good at reading the game and getting tight to his winger to shut down the space, and he did it all night. I think it helped that we had basically two left-backs playing. He knew I would run and cover him, and I knew that if I went forward, he would be there behind me to defend<br /><br /><b>[So, how do you stop him?]</b> For me, everything depends on how compact Liverpool can be. We know that Messi is the key to everything. What did we see against Manchester United in the last round? He only needs one chance to get the ball and turn, and suddenly things will happen. He was quiet at Old Trafford until he got one opportunity and he created a goal. Then, in the Nou Camp, he took the tie away in the space of a few minutes. So, you have to be compact and make the pitch as small as possible<br /><br />You cannot defend Messi 1v1. That just doesn’t work. So, if Robertson goes out to him, he needs to be covered, either by Van Dijk behind him, Mane in front of him, or one of the midfielders next to him. They have to get bodies around him, every single time. You saw what Messi did to Phil Jones when he got him 1v1. People laughed at Jones, but he does it to everybody! You have to keep the lines tight, make it hard for Barcelona to play the ball into his feet and find him in space. It means a lot of discipline, a lot of hard work and a lot of running, but it could be the key to everything</p>
