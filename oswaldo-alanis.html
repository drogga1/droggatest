  <p><b>[Mexico defense overwhelmed as Confederations Cup dream ends]</b> It hurt us and I think more than the pressure there were moments of inattentiveness that they found and took advantage of what they had. It changes the whole game for you, all the planning. We tried to play our soccer but it’s not the same when you’re 2-0 down after just a few minutes.</p>

  <p><b>[America vs. Chivas]</b> A Clasico always is special, whether it be in the league, cup, Liguilla, with one team doing well and the other poorly, it’s a different game. You’re playing for more things besides the points. That’s how we have to focus ourselves, thinking about winning and knowing it will be a good game against a good opponent and we have to rally.<br /><br />Clasicos are played to the death. We’re giving it the importance it deserves, thinking about closing out the tournament well and getting as many points as possible. It’s football, there are 90 minutes, the results depend on a lot of things. We know they’re good, but we also have the ability to top them. We’re going to give everything</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico center-back Oswaldo Alanis has been released from his contract with Getafe in the same transfer window during which he signed with the La Liga side]</b> Oswaldo Alanis Pantoja and Getafe FC have arrived at an agreement allowing the footballer to no longer belong to the Azulona entity. From Getafe, we wish him the best in his new sporting path.</p>

  <p><b>[Oswaldo Alanis: I pushed for Chivas exit to follow my dreams]</b> They make you a bit submissive with all that. I decided that I wanted to follow my dream, what I was focused on<br /><br />Hopefully it may have helped. I did it to follow my dreams, for what I believed I could achieve. We all should think in this same way, whether its a Mexican player or anyone else - especially Mexicans. If it works, good. If not, at the end it’ll be another case. I’m happy with how it got worked out, that I can continue on and not sit on my hands, in a certain way, deciding to stick with something that my heart didn’t want or that didn’t make me happy. If it helps more people to get the courage or decide to chase after what they really want or follow their dreams, I say go for it.<br /><br />It’s difficult to go through things like that. What I wanted was to have the chance to play football, to show I wanted to keep growing and advancing. It was tough. I always try to look for the positive or find the way I can benefit from something. Of course there were some fears, things that made it tough. Fear comes into your mind, uncertainty, doubts. At the end, it got resolved in a way where we have the chance to keep growing, thinking in doing well and helping the team.<br /><br />That would be generalizing a lot. Every one has to have their own way of seeing things. More than support, it would be a plus for everyone, not only looking for only one side to benefit or wanting to have everything and get a lot of money. They’re really personal questions. Every director behaves in a different way. Hopefully that changes and the league and regulations keep getting better<br /><br />Now, I’m enjoying a new stage, a new club, a new way of playing. While it’s still soccer, there are different details from Mexican soccer. As a person, I’m adapting, getting to know a new culture. It’s the same language, although the way of living is different. It’s something else to live in Europe. I’m happy, calm, we’re getting to know and do things well on this side<br /><br />It was a really good moment. It helped to have motivation to keep going forward. With everything that happened in the summer and the few matches I was able to play with the little injury I had, scoring a goal was sort of being able to say, ‘I’m here. I’m ready for what’s coming’. I took that moment as getting back on the map, being seen again by everyone<br /><br /><b>[Alanis endorsed the arrival of Gerardo Martino]</b> It’s going to be something positive, all being on the same wavelength and working in the same way, believing in ourselves and that things are going to go well. What we’re looking for is for Mexican soccer to grow. We’re at a strong level and we have to keep advancing. It’s going to be good. There’s a good process coming. It’s going to be a really good change<br /><br />We’re hoping so. It’s football. There are still four years, so you have to see how it develops. There are different studies that say you have to last several years at a team to have success<br /><br />Really, I wish them the best. I hope it goes well for them. Hopefully they have a good showing for Mexico, for Chivas, for what the team represents. It’s what we want as Mexicans, whether Chivas fans or not</p>
