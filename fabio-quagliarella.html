  <p><b>[Fabio Quagliarella has revealed he was forced to quit Napoli in 2010 because he and his family were being stalked during his time at the club]</b> This week marked the end of an off the pitch issue that had turned into a nightmare for me. I have this huge weight taken off my shoulders and this is the real reason I had to leave Napoli and Naples. I was very happy there, but I was affected by this situation that turned into a genuine nightmare. I wouldn’t wish it upon anyone. I couldn’t leave my house, neither could my family. I thank the courts for ensuring the truth came out. It was even more painful because as the investigation was on-going, I couldn’t tell people about it, I couldn’t express what was happening to me..</p>

  <p><b>[How Fabio Quagliarella endured years of being terrorised by a stalker to make history]</b> I’m sorry. I get emotional because just to be able to imagine something like that…It’s unthinkable. Just naming Batistuta gives me goosebumps! This is my life. All that happened in the past and all these sacrifices led to this; something I never thought could happen<br /><br /><b>[Quagliarella had a seemingly innocuous password problem with his PC and his best friend, Giulio, introduced him to Raffaelle Piccolo]</b> From there, a friendship was born.<br /><br /><b>[Not long after their meeting, though, the forward began to receive hundreds and hundreds of anonymous letters and messages]</b> Anything from photos of naked girls, where he said underneath that I was a paedophile, or that I was involved with the Camorra, or that I was doing drugs, or guilty of illegal football betting. Also, whenever I was in Naples, my Dad received messages saying, ‘Your son is around Castellammare and now we are going to break his legs.’ Or ‘Now we will kill him’.<br /><br />Obviously he was a person who had become a part of the family. There was a relationship there. He always repeated: ‘We are almost there, we are about to catch the guy, just a little more time.’ And he told us ‘Do not tell anyone, not even your children’. So, you’re afraid, you don’t talk to anyone. I only spoke to my mother and father. Not even my brothers knew about it<br /><br /><b>[Club president]</b> Aurelio De Laurentiis used to call me every day, but after those letters he advised to me to leave my hometown Castellammare di Stabia to go live in a hotel, to be calmer and relaxed. But after that conversation that took place in Napoli’s headquarters, he had never called me again<br /><br /><b>[Quagliarella was informed just before a pre-season fixture in the summer of 2010 that he had been sold to Juventus]</b> It was a moment of shock. I always had imagined myself as captain of Napoli; of winning something with them because they were becoming as good a team as they are now. If none of this had happened, I am certain I would still be playing there now<br /><br />I knew what was behind <b>[their fury]</b>. And I knew that this affair could be closed from one moment to the next<br /><br /><b>[When Quagliarella went to the police to see where they were at with the investigation]</b> Piccolo had them all! I wouldn’t wish it upon anyone. I couldn’t leave my house, neither could my family. I thank the courts for ensuring the truth came out<br /><br />Being a policeman, he should’ve been punished even harder. Instead, not a day in prison or even under house arrest. He keeps walking around as if nothing happened. He’s been transferred but continues to work. It’s a joke. If tomorrow he should come here on his hands and knees to beg forgiveness, I couldn’t care less. He asked for this, it’s only right he pay the price. Except he’s not. It’s not enough to call him a stalker, nor that he persecuted me: he tried to ruin my life. Seeing as nine years of a life are not crumbs and nobody can give that time back to me, nor fix the damage he did to my family, I cannot forgive</p>

  <p><b>[Fabio Quagliarella speaks about his <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Puskás Award-nominated goal]</b> I tried to keep it all in but I have to be honest and say that even the <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> fans were congratulating me afterwards. And the fact they said that despite being on the wrong end of the goal made it even more special. They often say to me: ‘If anyone had to score that goal, then we’re glad it was you’</p>
