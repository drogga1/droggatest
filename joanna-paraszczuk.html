  <p>The Russian sports fans that I talk to say that in Russia, popular athletes are those who win in popular sports, and that ethnicity is not an issue. But in reality this is only true on the surface. North Caucasian athletes are only popular or even acceptable as long as they present themselves as Russians rather than as Dagestanis or Chechens<br /><br />The Russian sports fans that I talk to say that in Russia, popular athletes are those who win in popular sports, and that ethnicity is not an issue. But in reality this is only true on the surface. North Caucasian athletes are only popular or even acceptable as long as they present themselves as Russians rather than as Dagestanis or Chechens.<br />Their North Caucasian identities were largely erased: e.g. Abdulrashid Sadulaev is nicknamed the ‘Avar tank’ but was dubbed the ‘Russian tank’ by most of the Russian media. North Caucasians are extremely cynical about this issue: memes which shows Beslan Mudranov winning at the Olympics and the caption ‘The Olympics: the only time that Russia loves North Caucasians’ were widely shared on Facebook and VKontakte in August 2016<br /><br /><b>[<a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>’s tenure with the UFC has been riddled with misconception that all Russians share a relatively homogenous ethnicity]</b> North Caucasians complain that MMA fans outside of Russia don’t understand that MMA fighters from the North Caucasus aren’t Russians. North Caucasians feel that despite his popularity <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>’s religion and ethnicity are still issues for some Russian MMA fans. A Chechen MMA fan told me that he feels nervous whenever North Caucasians fight internationally and represent Russia, since he thinks Russians don’t really support North Caucasian fighters, and because Russian fans think North Caucasians like Khabib are humiliating Russian fighters (by stealing the spotlight from them)<br /><br /><b>[<a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> was a counter to jihadi recruitment in the region, and the Islamic State was well aware of it]</b> Khabib’s appeal to Muslims could have a very positive effect in the fight against radicalization, in that his success and popularity give him a platform to counter radical voices who say that Muslims are forbidden from fighting MMA (and should turn to jihad instead). The degree to which Khabib can be a role model in the North Caucasus depends also on the extent to which his success is seen as something he has achieved for himself, without connection to the pro-Kremlin regimes in his home region. If Khabib is presented by Russia and the local regimes in the North Caucasus as a ‘Russian’ fighter who is a willing part of this pro-Moscow establishment then this could contribute to the alienation of young men who are unhappy with the regime, who could then be targets for radicalization<br /><br />North Caucasian radical Islamists have already capitalized on the Russian media’s presentation of Olympic athletes like Beslan Mudranov as Russians, for example, by criticizing them not only as ‘bad’ Muslims who fight for money but also as puppets in the service of the ‘infidel’ Russian regime. So it’s easy to see how radical Islamists in the North Caucasus and elsewhere could use <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>’s success in the same way</p>
