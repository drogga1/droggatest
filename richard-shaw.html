I used him as a winger on either side, and even then, at 16, he had wonderful defensive responsibility - it was just his end product we were trying to work on. He was a great defensive midfield player too. He had these long legs, so when you think you’ve got past him, he’d tackle you when you thought you’d gotten away. It was absolutely incredible. These go-go-gadget legs come from nowhere, just when you think you’ve got past him. Bang. He’s got you.<br /><br />Like any club, we’d send the boys up to train with the first team, so Azza had been training in and around the seniors for about a year before what turned out to be a pivotal day in his career. He was up against <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilf Zaha</a> and Andros Townsend, two horribly tricky, fast, tough opponents, but he did absolutely brilliantly. People have spoken publicly about how impressive Azza was in that session. Afterwards, Kevin Keen, who had been taking training, came up to me and Dave to chat about Aaron and suggested that we try playing him at full-back. We had a cup of tea and a discussion, and we played Aaron at right-back against Charlton in our next game</p>
