  <p><b>[Mamelodi Sundowns have released a letter in which Keagan Dolly was invited to the Manchester City academy last year]</b> Mamelodi Sundowns has decided to release the email that it received on 25 August 2016 from Brian Marwood, Managing Director of City Football Services inviting Keagan Dolly and Mamelodi Sundowns to the Manchester City Football Academy.<br /><br />This email was part of the ongoing communications and exploratory discussions that Mamelodi Sundowns initiated with City Football Group in 2015 and representitives from City Football Group visited Mamelodi Sundowns and attended some of its games. It is clear from the email that City Football Group and its scouts had been following Keagan Dolly ‘for quite some time’. Part of the discussions between Mamelodi Sundowns and City Football Group were to ‘park’ Keagan Dolly in the short term, at one of the European Clubs that had a partnership with City Football Group.<br /><br />We are disappointed and concerned by the continuous lies and misrepresentation which is spread by Paul Mitchell, Keagan Dolly’s agent, which makes any cooperation difficult. Mamelodi Sundowns does not want to be seen as a Club that can be blackmailed to sell players because of misrepresentations and pressure in the media. Mamelodi Sundowns remains committed, as stated by its President Patrice Motsepe, to immediately release Keagan Dolly to any Club which comply’s with the buy-out clause which was upheld by the PSL Dispute Resolution Chamber.</p>
