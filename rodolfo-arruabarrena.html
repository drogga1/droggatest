<blockquote>
  <p>[Rodolfo Arruabarrena, Al Wasl’s manager, insists the game against city rivals, Al Nasr, will be very important] The beginning of 2017 was not as we hoped in terms of results or performance. Both teams had many changes since their last encounter; our goal is to get the win in this very important match. In such matches, the mental readiness is critical. The players have the motivation to give their best. The coach doesn’t need to work too hard to explain the importance of a derby match to his players; they already know that from the atmosphere around them.<br /><br />We need to be smart in this match and to know that small details can decide the winners. We still have 11 matches to go, the road is still long. Now we are not getting the results we want, that’s why we need to start winning again. We are not concerned with other teams’ results; we only need to focus on our performance. We need to work a lot to fix the mistakes we are doing, and strengthen the good things we are doing. I always say the good beginning is not as important as the good endings. We need to fight our way back to stay on top of the table.</p>

  <p>[Al Wasl boss Rodolfo Arruabarrena refuses to give up hope of winning the Arabian Gulf League title] It was a match where we could win the three points and lose the three points. We made too many mistakes in defence and, from one of those, they scored and drew the match. It’s true, Al Jazira have a significant gap, but there are seven matches still to play and 21 points available. Never we say this is the end</p>
