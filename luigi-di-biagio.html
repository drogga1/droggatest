  <p>[The <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> winger Federico Chiesa scored twice as the Azzurrini came from behind to beat Spain 3-1 in an absorbing European Championship clash in <a href="bologna-fc.html">Bologna</a>] There’s nothing more I can say about him.

  <p>[Italy Under-21 manager Luigi Di Biagio has hinted that <a href="moise-kean.html">Moise Kean</a> was dropped for Saturday night’s victory against Belgium for disciplinary reasons] I train a team and there are rules for that team. And if someone does do not comply by the rules, not once, but several times, the coach must intervene. Because I am a coach and also an educator.<br /><br />[Di Biagio said when asked if the <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> star would be brought back in] I’ll tell you if we go through</p>

  <p>[Luigi Di Biagio insisted that his side’s failure to reach the knockout stage at a Euros they were hosting hadn’t influenced his decision to walk away] I would have left anyway. I no longer felt 100 per cent motivated to continue. Maybe there would have been a small chance of staying, just for the Olympics. But clubs from <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> and Serie B have looked for me before. Out of respect for the <a href="figc.html">FIGC</a> (Italian Football Federation), I always said no. But thanks to my growth here over these years, I feel ready for new challenges</p>
