  <p><b>[Italy Under-21 boss Luigi Di Biagio has been installed as interim head coach of his country’s national team]</b> Following the meeting held today at the headquarters of the Italian Football Federation in Rome, in the presence of the Extraordinary Commissioner Roberto Fabbricini and his deputy Alessandro Costacurta, it was decided to entrust to Luigi Di Biagio the position of national technical commissioner in view of the two international commitments next March.</p>

  <p><b>[Italy legend Gianluigi Buffon has confirmed he is available for selection in the Azzurri’s upcoming friendly clashes against Argentina and England]</b> I had some meetings with the veterans because I understood some of them wanted to quit. I talked to Buffon to find out if he wanted to continue. It’s not fair that his last game should be the one against Sweden. I proposed he should come back for one, two or three games. Gigi will probably be there in March. With the other players, without going into detail, I spoke with many of them. <b>[Andrea]</b> Barzagli and <b>[Daniele]</b> De Rossi will not be there, <b>[Giorgio]</b> Chiellini yes. We want to relaunch the team with enthusiasm</p>

  <p><b>[On Gianluigi Buffon]</b> Buffon and I are in total harmony. He wanted to reflect upon some decision and we’ll talk again next week.</p>

  <p><b>[Italy’s continued exclusion of Mario Balotelli is scandalous]</b> I’ve already explained that numbers are very clear for strikers, but they must be seasoned with certain performances. I’ve watched, evaluated and decided players, and I think I picked the best team possible. That’s how it is right now, but I won’t close the door on anyone.</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Balotelli says he expected to be included in the Italy national team squad]</b> I’ll keep following him and we’ll see what happens in the next few months. Scoring goals is very important for forwards but this must be complemented by their performances. I made my evaluations and took a decision for the good of the team.</p>

He dragged us through. He provided the spark that turned the game</p>

  <p><b>[Italy Under-21 manager Luigi Di Biagio has hinted that <a href="moise-kean.html">Moise Kean</a> was dropped for Saturday night’s victory against Belgium for disciplinary reasons]</b> I train a team and there are rules for that team. And if someone does do not comply by the rules, not once, but several times, the coach must intervene. Because I am a coach and also an educator.<br /><br /><b>[Di Biagio said when asked if the <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> star would be brought back in]</b> I’ll tell you if we go through</p>

  <p><b>[Luigi Di Biagio insisted that his side’s failure to reach the knockout stage at a Euros they were hosting hadn’t influenced his decision to walk away]</b> I would have left anyway. I no longer felt 100 per cent motivated to continue. Maybe there would have been a small chance of staying, just for the Olympics. But clubs from <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> and Serie B have looked for me before. Out of respect for the <a href="figc.html">FIGC</a> (Italian Football Federation), I always said no. But thanks to my growth here over these years, I feel ready for new challenges</p>
