  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> have announced the signing of Netherlands Under-18 international Nathangelo Markelo from Dutch second division club FC Volendam]</b> It feels great to be an <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> player. It’s a nice opportunity for me and I love it here already. I heard something about two weeks ago after a tournament I played in and I was very happy. I decided immediately that I wanted to come to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. I’m looking forward to the season now. I have three years here and I hope to get plenty of playing time, develop as a player and then just keep making steps forward towards the first team</p>
