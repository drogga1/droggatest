  <p><b>[Winger Jakub Blaszczykowski could win his 100th cap on Tuesday but is focused solely on helping Poland off to a winning start]</b> Each game for Poland is an honour and every player thinks the same way. My individual achievement is not the most important, what is most important is the team. I don’t know if I will start, it will depend on the coach’s decision and I respect that. We will do everything we can to win</p>

  <p><b>[The Pole lost their opening two Group H games to Senegal and Colombia and cannot advance - even if they beat Japan in their final game on Thursday]</b> It’s not an easy moment for the team psychologically speaking. But life goes on and the match tomorrow will be of great significance, particularly from a mental perspective. We need to show that we never give up as a team<br /><br /><b>[Blaszczykowski denied reports of a rift between Poland’s star striker <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a>, who has yet to score in Russia, and other players]</b> When the results are negative, when we don’t win and there are problems, then you get fake news</p>

  <p><b>[Jakub Blaszczykowski and Grzegorz Krychowiak have lead a splinter group who are firmly against Lewandowski staying on as the national team’s captain]</b> When negative results appear and when we lose matches, there are problems. Then some fake information is available. We don’t have a lot of arguments. Personally I believe, as a player who has spent some time in the national team, that the atmosphere has not changed. What has changed is that we lost.</p>
