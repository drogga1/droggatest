  <p><b>[Arsenal have hit out at the ‘unacceptable racial abuse’ that Jordi Osei-Tutu suffered during his debut for German side VfL Bochum]</b> Last night Jordi Osei-Tutu received unacceptable racial abuse playing for VfL Bochum during a pre-season friendly match against Swiss club St Gallen. We are working closely with Bochum and Jordi and we are giving him our full support. Racism has no place in our game and we do not tolerate any form of discrimination</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal have hit out at the ‘unacceptable racial abuse’ that Jordi Osei-Tutu suffered during his debut for German side VfL Bochum]</b> Jordi Osei-Tutu was unfortunately the victim of a racist incident during a pre-season friendly between FC St. Gallen and VfL Bochum 1848. VfL Bochum 1848, Jordi Osei-Tutu and his parent club, Arsenal, are in close coordination to deal with this incident. Both clubs, VfL and Arsenal, stand by Jordi Osei-Tutu and assure him of their full support. We do not tolerate any form of discrimination. Racism has no place in our game</p>

  <p><b>[Jordi Osei-Tutu admits he was left stunned at the treatment he received from a fellow player]</b> I am very disappointed about what happened. No one should ever be subject to any discrimination and it is really hard to understand how a fellow professional footballer could do this. Arsenal and Bochum have provided great support to me and I hope that if nothing else, we can show that racism has no place within football</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal defender Osei-Tutu opens up on racist abuse]</b> It had never happened to me before so I didn’t really know how to react to it. It’s the first time I’ve experienced anything like that<br /><br />The support was crazy from everyone. Everyone at Bochum and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> were all extremely helpful and it wasn’t just people I knew who were supporting me, but people from around the world. A lot of players reached out. My <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> team-mates, <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a>, <a href="henrikh-mkhitaryan.html">Henrikh Mkhitaryan</a> and <a href="alex-iwobi.html">Alex Iwobi</a>. Then there was <a href="moise-kean.html">Moise Kean</a> and <a href="rabbi-matondo.html">Rabbi Matondo</a> from Schalke. Players from all over the place. It was nice to see<br /><br /><b>[Despite receiving floods of messages from fans on social media telling him to come home]</b> I was seeing a lot of comments saying ‘come back to Arsenal’, but that was never in my mind. I just saw it as something that happened and that I had to move on from. Afterwards I got on the phone to my dad and he said it’s something you experience in life. It’s happened to him before and he said ‘you’ve just got to laugh it off, continue playing your game and don’t let anything upset you’. So I just tried to forget about it so it didn’t play on my mind afterwards, which I think I did well</p>

  <p><b>[Gunners defender Jordi Osei-Tutu, who is on loan at VfL Bochum, explains the process behind a temporary move and the key figures involved]</b> I’m pretty much in touch with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> every single day to be honest. They also fly out quite a lot to watch my games. I’m always in contact with them<br /><br /><b>[Ben Knapper was appointed the club’s first ever loan manager in February 2018 and he is certainly making his mark]</b> Ben Knapper’s been magnificent to be fair. For someone who has just come into the role he’s been perfect. He calls me, I call him. He always messages me as well to see how training is going. When I play a match, he’ll sit down and watch the game and call me afterwards to give me a summary of how he thought I played, which helps me a lot. Previously I heard a lot of players were forgotten about when they went on loan. That’s why they’ve brought Ben into place and I think the system now is working better<br /><br />I’ve spoken to <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Freddie Ljungberg</a> quite a bit. I spoke to him the other week actually, he watched my game against Nuremberg and gave me a call to speak about it. Even <a href="per-mertesacker.html">Per Mertesacker</a> has been in touch quite a lot as well. It’s good to see<br /><br /><b>[When <a href="eddie-nketiah.html">Eddie Nketiah</a> moved to <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> in the summer, the deal only came about after a stringent process which saw several potential suitors whittled down to just three. Representatives from those clubs were all then invited to London Colney and asked to produce a presentation detailing exactly how they planned to use the striker. It was only then that <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> won the race. And the process behind Osei-Tutu’s move to Bochum was similar]</b> My agent went to meet the clubs and then the clubs had to meet up with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and talk to them. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> had to see what they had in place for me and then it was just about picking who the right one was. I had clubs from England, France and Germany interested, but I wanted to be at a place where I would play consistently so I thought Bochum was the right club for that<br /><br /><b>[Osei-Tutu featuring in Bochum’s last four games]</b> Obviously I started off playing and then I was out of the team for a bit under the new manager. But now I’m back and I think I’ve done well in the games I’ve played. I had to prove to him <b>[Reis]</b> that I was good enough to get into the team. So it was all about working hard in training to get back into the side and, when I got my chance, to make sure I played well so I would stay there<br /><br /><b>[He also does his best to make sure he keeps fully up to date with what is going on back at Arsenal]</b> I watch the matches on my phone or laptop. <a href="joe-willock.html">Joe Willock</a>, <a href="bukayo-saka.html">Bukayo Saka</a>, <a href="emile-smith-rowe.html">Emile Smith Rowe</a> and <a href="reiss-nelson.html">Reiss Nelson</a> are my team-mates so it makes me really happy to see them doing so well and playing in the first-team. I think the way <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have built their youth system has been incredible and now the hard work they have done is paying off. My plan is to break into the first-team as well. Hopefully this loan move will help me mature as a player on and off the pitch and I can show the boss how good I am and show him that he can trust me to play<br /><br /><b>[Before his promotion in the summer, the Swede was Osei-Tutu’s manager with the Under-23s and the pair have formed a strong bond]</b> <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Freddie Ljungberg</a> is a fantastic coach and more so a fantastic person. You can talk to him about anything and that helps me a lot. After training he will come and talk to you, he helps you develop on the pitch. I was injured for a while last season and he helped me a lot. It’s good to see him with the first-team now helping all the young players who have broken through</p>
