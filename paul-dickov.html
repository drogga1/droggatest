  <p><b>[Paul Dickov on ordering his Doncaster side to allow Bury to walk the ball into the net and equalise in injury time in their English third-flight opener. The visitors had put the ball out when Nathan Cameron went down injured, but Harry Forrester’s attempt to return possession to Bury, aided by the wind, gave Doncaster a 90th-minute lead]</b> It was surreal, it was as if it was in slow motion. As I could see the ball going over the goalkeeper’s head I was thinking, ‘Oh, no, don’t do this’. As soon as it went in I was thinking, ‘Can the referee give a foul throw and disallow the goal?’ It was apparent that they weren’t going to be able to do that. I just felt the right thing for us to do was to go and let Bury score. The one thing I wanted to do was to keep the good name of Doncaster Rovers and football intact</p>

  <p><b>[As the players were desperate to get promotion anyway, then-chairman David Bernstein and manager Joe Royle kept the full significance of failure from the squad]</b> We knew how important it was to get the club out of that division for the fans, for the club and maybe for the finances. But I don’t think it was until after the play-off final that it hit us what would have happened if we hadn’t been promoted. If we were fully aware of it, it may well have had a negative effect on us. I don’t know the full ins and outs but if you believe what people say, the club could have gone into administration – if not worse. I’ve been told that a lot of the talks over moving into the new stadium were based on us getting promoted. If we hadn’t, there was a big chance that wouldn’t have happened. But it was weeks after we started hearing about these things<br /><br /><b>[Dickov, though, was fully focused on rewarding the loyalty of the City fans, who had stuck by the team through their low points. Indeed, City’s average attendance at home games while in the third tier was actually higher than half the clubs in the Premier League]</b> I don’t know about the other lads but I couldn’t give a sh*t about United because they were way far ahead of us – we weren’t even in the division below. We couldn’t let that affect us as players. We were more worried about trying to get out of that division at the first attempt and trying to give a little something back to the fans. A majority of that group was the reason why we were down there in the first place and it was down to us to get out of there<br /><br /><b>[Both sides had chances and Gillingham opened the scoring on 82 minutes through Carl Asaba. Worse was to come five minutes when Bob Taylor’s low shot put City 2-0 down]</b> When Gillingham scored the second, I went down on my haunches thinking we’ve blown it. People had been surrounding Maine Road trying to get tickets and there was a huge buzz from the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> side and we felt really, really confident. We felt we had better players than them and a better team. So, to find ourselves two down and looking like it was all over, was devastating<br /><br /><b>[After United’s remarkable comeback at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a>, City needed a miracle of their own at Wembley. Just before the clocked over to 90 minutes, Kevin Horlock scrambled a goal back]</b> I won’t name names because I know quite a lot of the Gillingham players, but even though it was 2-1 and they had just conceded a goal, they were still congratulating each other. I just felt that they’d switched off and I just kept telling myself that there was one more chance left in the game, whether it was for me or somebody elsed. Nerves kicked in for the Gillingham players as well and I just had a feeling of this is going to happen. In my younger days when I was at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, I was fortunate enough to play with <a href="ian-wright.html">Ian Wright</a> and he used to talk to himself constantly about getting one more chance and I took that with me all the way through my career<br /><br /><b>[There was indeed more chance. In the 94th minute, the ball dropped to Dickov on the edge of the box. He took one touch and slammed the ball past Gills keeper Vince Bartram – his former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> team-mate and the best man at his wedding]</b> I can’t remember a thing about it, I’m not going to lie. I’ll give a lot of credit to Joe and <b>[first-team coach]</b> Willie Donachie. Every day after training they would work on my first touch and my finishing; it was all repetition. So, I can only imagine that when the ball came in to me that it was just a natural thing to do from the repetition and the hard work we’d been putting in training.<br /><br />Without Dickov’s goal, there would have been no <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> moment. The forward, though, remains modest about the strike that forever changed the club’s destiny and maybe that of English football</p>
