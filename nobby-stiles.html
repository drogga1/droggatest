<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Whatever criticism he took from the media, Ramsey’s loyalty to his players was always returned]</b> It worked both ways. Because he was loyal to you, you’d run through brick walls for him. And it wasn’t just the players. Everyone concerned with England was doing it for Alf. Before the Argentina game I was in the bathroom putting my contacts in when Harold Shepherdson <b>[Ramsey’s assistant]</b> came in. He grabs me by the throat, pushes me against the wall and says, ‘Don’t you let Alf down’<br /><br /><b>[on <a href="alf-ramsey.html">Alf Ramsey</a>]</b> Alf’s preparations for Mexico were incredible. They’d be reckoned obsolete by today’s standards but in those days they were revolutionary. No stone was left unturned. He even took HP Sauce to Mexico. I’ll always remember that - HP Sauce on the tables</p>
