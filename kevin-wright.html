<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Made in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> but thriving in Sweden: The former Blues starlets taking a different route to top]</b> I got rejected countless times on countless trials; I would guess about 25 times at least. I have always maintained confidence in my ability. When a manager tells me I am not for them, I get disappointed but I knew that I had the quality and ability to make it elsewhere. I never took it to heart or got too down. I just thought that’s their business. It’s their opinion, they can have an opinion on me but it doesn’t have to be the end for me. That helped my mentality because I went abroad to Norway and I wasn’t playing as much, so I dropped a level to a Swedish second division team. Because of my past experience, that allowed me to block out what people are saying and focus on my football. Some people might have thought at that time that I wasn’t doing well, going from <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> to the Swedish second division, but that time just made me a stronger person mentally. I just focused on improving and what I needed to do. I have always been strong-willed and focused on my mission regardless of the bumps in the road.</p>
