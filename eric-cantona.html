  <p><b>[Manchester United legend Eric Cantona has become the latest star to sign up to Juan Mata’s Common Goal initiative]</b> There are many more people in the world who can’t even afford to buy a football than there are people who can afford to pay 200 Euros to attend a Premier League match, or 400 Euros a year to watch it on TV. Football is one of life’s great teachers. It is one of life’s great inspirations. But the current business model of football ignores so much of the world. Poor neighbourhoods need football as much as football needs poor neighbourhoods. We need to support a more sustainable, positive and inclusive football, and I will do anything that I can to help. That is why I am joining the Common Goal movement as their first mentor. Common Goal’s mission is to unlock 1% of the entire football industry’s revenues for grassroots football charities, and more than 60 footballers have already pledged 1% of their salaries.<br /><br />The beautiful thing is that they are players from big clubs, players from small clubs, men and women, from leagues all over the world. Football should be for the people. This does not have to be a utopian idea. There is no reason why the major actors in the game today cannot come together and support the social aspect of football. All of us, whether we are rich or poor, whether we are immigrants or 10th-generation citizens, find the same simple joy in the game of football. We speak the same language. We feel the same emotion.<br /><br />Please, allow me to ask this same simple question to those who run the global game - the footballers, the agents, the sponsors and the committees - what is football if it is not about freedom? What is life if it is not about freedom? What is the meaning of life? I think we can all agree that we can do more for humanity?</p>

When you lose to Juve and they had 70 per cent possession of the ball at Old Trafford. Can you imagine that with Sir Alex Ferguson on the bench? I suffer, and I suffer even more when I see Manchester City playing wonderfully well<br /><br />We saw Zinedine Zidane, who was a former Real Madrid player and had never coached a team before, become Real Madrid head coach. They gave him a chance. United never gave an opportunity to a player who knows the inside of the club, its identity and its philosophy.

Maybe he made Pogba understand that the priority is to play football. First you have to be good on the pitch, and then you can do something else. If you lose your concentration because you’re thinking more about your haircut than your football, that’s not good. People love players because they are good or not, they either love them or not, because of what they do on the pitch. If after they score goals and win things, they can change their haircut - that’s not a problem. But first, concentration: Think about winning and football.<br /><br />Before Ole, there was no player of the year for me. It was obvious they were not enjoying the game. Since he arrived, you can see everybody wants the ball, everybody moves, they enjoy the game and want to score - they play with pleasure and enjoyment now. Paul Pogba is great, now. Ole has found the right position for him, he has a great vision and pass, he can score and assist goals, organise the game and defend. He organises the game, and every time he has the ball he’s dangerous - anything can happen</p>

Finally, the club made the right decision, a decision I think they should have made a long time ago<br /><br />He has got the soul of the club, and you feel that he has been inspired by Alex Ferguson. It’s like Johan Cruyff and Pep Guardiola in Barcelona - Ole Gunnar is the spiritual son of Alex Ferguson. Not all players can become managers, but some of them can, and for me it’s important that at a club like Manchester United you have somebody who has the soul of the club, who understands the club from inside. So, today, seeing United, I am so happy<br /><br /><b>[Cantona admits it has pained him to see the emergence of City and Liverpool over recent years]</b> It hurts a lot. But they play wonderful football. But now, if United had started the season 10 games ago, they would be top of the league. It was hard, but all big clubs sometimes have bad times. They will be back, but the worst thing was that the identity of the club was missing. Because you can lose, so long as you do it with the right identity and philosophy. Even when they could win, fans were not happy, they want to win but enjoy the game - it’s entertainment. Now it seems to be back<br /><br /><b>[Cantona said when asked if he would ever consider a position with the Red Devils]</b> I do many things, but if I come back to football it will be at Manchester United. Nowhere else - I’m not interested. It’s important that whoever is involved has the soul of the club</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Cantona quotes King Lear at the Uefa Champions League draw]</b> As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods, they kill us for their sport. Soon the science will not only be able to slow down the ageing of the cells, soon the science will fix the cells to the state and so we will become eternal. Only accidents, crimes, wars, will still kill us but unfortunately, crimes, wars, will multiply. I love football. Thank you</p>

  <p><b>[In 2007 a suitcase was discovered in Mexico City, where it had been hidden for almost 70 years. Inside they found 126 old rolls of film containing 4,500 negatives; they also found a part of Cantona. Most of the pictures, smuggled out of France when the Nazis arrived, were taken by photojournalist Robert Capa during the final months of the Spanish civil war. Capa had also been in Argelès-sur-Mer, where 100,000 people fleeing Spain were held in a refugee camp, among them <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a> Raurich, 28, and his 18-year-old girlfriend, Paquita Farnòs. <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a> was Cantona’s grandfather and when the missing photographs were first exhibited in New York, he went looking for him]</b> It was something … emotional. It is the story of my family, mine. It was a Capa exhibition about the civil war, so I came and I saw a lot of pictures. There were negatives, some bigger <b>[PRINTS]</b>: two, three metres. Some were very small, you had to look with a loupe, a magnifying glass. And I say to Rachida <b>[MY WIFE]</b>: ‘I will try and I am sure we will find a picture of my grandparents’<br /><br />And I saw one<br /><br />I felt, er … My grandparents didn’t speak much about this, they didn’t want <b>[TO]</b>, so we didn’t ask questions. When I see the photograph, I thought about my mother, so I brought the book of the exhibition to my mother. It was small in the book. And then this exhibition travelled to Arles <b>[in southern France]</b> and I took my mother and her sister. He was young <b>[in the picture]</b>, and I didn’t know him when he was young. ‘Is it him?’ My mother hadn’t seen this kind of picture <b>[OF HIM]</b>. I wanted them to see if it was him, and also to see him. He didn’t speak a word to my mother too. And they said: ‘Yes, it’s him’. And they were very emotional<br /><br />Human being. What kind? Ah, well … I don’t know, one with all kind of paradoxes, contradictions. Some of it you cannot explain. There’s an energy sometimes. Sometimes you have an explanation and sometimes no. It’s better when you have. But you try to understand and that’s why life is a big adventure; even trying to understand ourselves is a big adventure<br /><br /><b>[Although it is hard to explain, he believes his grandfather’s experience, preserved in Capa’s photograph, is also preserved in him. It is a photo he wants to buy, bring home]</b> It’s in our DNA, my brothers and me. I did a movie once where I was on a horse. There was a dog attacking the horse and this man said 200 years ago these dogs attacked horses for work. They don’t know why, or need to, but it’s there. It’s in us<br /><br /><b>[My grandparents]</b> didn’t speak much but sometimes silence for kids is more important, in a good or bad way. When they don’t say things, you imagine, you create your own story. We always felt very close to them. That’s my mother’s side: my father’s side come from Sardinia <b>[Which is why, when Cantona retired, he went to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b>. I was born in 1966 and they were not allowed back for 25 years. I wanted to go to their place. And now I have land in Sardinia and I have the same feeling<br /><br />We feel a pull to our origins, I think, and the more they want to take us away from our origins, the more we want to go back. In France sometimes they want us to forget our origins, and I think it is a mistake. It’s not because you are close to your origin, or speak the language, that you don’t love the country where you are or will not learn French<br /><br /><b>[Cantona points at his wife, sitting a few metres away with his brother, Jean-Marie, and son, Raphael]</b> My wife, she is of origin Algerian, she speaks French perfectly and Arabic too. And it’s good. I ask her to speak to our son, our daughter, in Arabic. It’s transmission<br /><br />My grandparents are from Spain and Sardinia. And us? We are just lucky. I am French from two generations. But I don’t want people to think they are <b>[ONLY]</b> from this country or that one. I am a human being, I respect everybody. We are lucky to have different cultures, to speak to people, travel, respect their culture<br /><br /><b>[The problem, he fears, is that there is a shift away from that view; a rise in nationalism, an anti-immigration agenda]</b> The big democracies go to where there are thousands of years of traditions and cultures and they want them to live like they want. They have their own vision. For me that is a kind of terrorism. An economic terrorism. And big democracies inside are, in a way, dictatorships because they want to impose their vision. It’s just my own view but I think we are lucky to have different cultures, thousands of cultures<br /><br />It’s an economic problem, no? It seems we don’t use history to understand better today. In 1929 you had the crisis and then Italy and Germany and the war. It seems there is a repetition. See what is happening in the world, how the extreme right wing grew. I hope not but in some countries it is already like this. It is the same story but we don’t care: it’s like we need it. Put the counter to zero, start again. Millions of people killed but it doesn’t matter. Economically we will be at zero, start again<br /><br /><b>[How, then to stop it?]</b>Say things, move. But you have players who support the extreme right in Brazil. Now more and more and more you have racist fans all over the world using football. And we let it go<br /><br />When he is trying to define himself, Cantona says]&lt;/b&gt; I had a good education: respect myself, respect people, even if I don’t like it. I try to be free. But not completely. If I say everything I think … <b>[Smile]</b> But I think I am free enough. Sometimes I think what I say. And I think I say much more than the majority of people<br /><br /><b>[Eric Cantona wants footballers to use their power and find their voice]</b> I don’t know why. We ask the footballer to play well but it is important that, even if they don’t speak, they keep an eye on society, what happens around them. Football is our passion since we were kids, a dream, and maybe some don’t have another. But a lot of footballers are curious. I don’t think it’s <b>[A LACK OF]</b> intelligence. Who are we to say we are more intelligent than others? And what is intelligence? To play at the highest level you need to have this kind of intelligence, which is not less important than the one of a philosopher<br /><br />There should be more people using football, like Common Goal do. I was in Cartagena <b>[COLOMBIA]</b> and I went to a very poor, poor, poor area, where there are people displaced by the Farc <b>[leftist rebel group]</b>, 50,000 people. There are no houses but they created a football pitch because they love football. To play they had to go to school and work. Maybe none will become professional but they will have been to school - and that will help the rest of their lives<br /><br />Because everyone loves football, you can do all sorts of things. More footballers and ex-footballers should use their position. It’s important to encourage them to look around. If they don’t want to speak, if they want to concentrate on their game, no problem. But at least know. And then at the end, maybe we will do something because you will know. But there’s ignorance and it is a shame because players come from these kind of areas, and some forget. We have to make them understand. But, then, who are we to say we are right and they are wrong? I mean, I think I am right, but … I don’t know</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Cantona talks about Matthew Simmons]</b> I did not punch him strong enough. I should have punched him harder. I didn’t watch it after on television. Because I knew.

  <p><b>[Cantona decry prospect of football without fans amid coronavirus]</b> I’d be delighted if we could restart football as it was before. If we start on June 17 because there’s no more problems for anyone, that’s great. But to resume playing football in front of nobody, just because TV have suspended payments, that’s not great, right? You can have exactly the same stakes, the same players, <b>[but]</b> a match behind closed doors isn’t a football match. The energy that the fans give off, that they transmit to the players, that lifts players. You’ve seen Champions League games behind closed doors. It was the same matches, the same stakes, but it wasn’t the same. There’s none of the passion. The players need that energy. It’s like at the theatre, to play in front of an empty room or a full room, it’s not the same thing</p>
