<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Lars Bender, was playing his first full game for the team, at 23. He got his call because right back <a href="jerome-boateng.html">Jérôme Boateng</a> was suspended]</b> It’s true, I’m not used to playing in that position. but I played there in our warm-up matches. Our manager believed in me and that’s why I felt comfortable playing there. I will remember this day for a long, long time, not because I scored the winning goal, but we got through the group stage with maximum points.<br /><br /><b>[A mature debutant, but who is he kidding when he tries to play down his goal?]</b> We were really focused on getting that second goal. I could see space opening up in their half as we counterattacked. You have to fight your way through and get that goal. Miro slipped the ball through, and it was quite lucky that I happened to be in the right place at the right time. You don’t stop to think about it, you just hit it.</p>
