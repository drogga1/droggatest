<blockquote>
  <p>[JDT fans need to give Benjamin Mora time] He does have a handful of players who have won seven trophies in 3 years. Some players are still hungry and some are not as hungry anymore. These are one of the many challenges the coach is facing and sadly, people don’t understand that. JDT’s problem is not the coach, but the mentality of the few players who have tasted success and are fortunate enough to have amassed a fair bit of savings.<br /><br />JDT needs players who are 100% committed to the club and are constantly hungry for success. To identify the right players and make all these changes, takes a bit of time. Running a club is tough and I’m confident that the boss, HRH TMJ knows what he’s doing. What he is sacrificing today and now is only for a stronger and more dominant JDT next year, and all the years to come</p>
