<blockquote>
  <p><b>[on <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Nemanja Vidic</a> of Manchester United]</b> In all honesty, which footballer would you more like on your team than the Serb? What a titan. A man who put himself on the line in every confrontation, he not only gave his all, he ensured his team-mates did also. As captain he not only led from the front, he made sure everyone else followed.<br /><br />Looks are not everything in football. But in <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Vidic</a>’s case they spoke volumes. He looked almost as terrifying as he was. That scowl, that glare, that furrowed brow: it was enough to remove the resolve from the most stout hearted opponent. And a glance from the skipper was equally capable of ensuring no-one on his own team slipped from his elevated standards.<br /><br />This was not just a defender who appeared to regard it as a personal affront to concede a goal, here was someone who chivvied his colleagues into similar acts of defiance. No-one was going to shirk from a tackle knowing Nemanja would be on their case … <br /><br />Tricksy wingers and fancy dan forwards might steal the attention. But it is defenders like <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Vidic</a> who stir the blood</p>
