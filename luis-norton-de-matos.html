  <p><b>[Luís Norton de Matos is set to be appointed as the head coach of the India Under 17 national team]</b> I am not supposed to speak about this at this point of time. I may come to India which depends on the visa. At this point there is no agreement yet.</p>

  <p><b>[Newly appointed U-17 head coach Luis Norton de Matos]</b> I think everybody expects a lot from this Under-17 World Cup and everybody knows that India must grow a lot to reach the top level in football. We are looking to do good work and surprise the fans. We would like to qualify for the group stages by securing at least four points from the group stage.<br /><br />One thing I can promise is that we will think about winning only. We must not think about losing and even if we have very less percentage of chance on paper, we need to fight for that little amount. This is my mentality and hopefully, we can surprise a lot of teams. It is impossible to win or lose a game before playing and my philosophy is that there is always a possibility to win a game<br /><br />In all my life, I have liked a challenge. I like the chance to do something positive and I’m not afraid with the quality of the Indian players because I trust a lot in my methods and expertise. We have eight months and I’m sure they will progress a lot. I have no pressure when it comes to this challenge<br /><br />Of course, I’m not selling any illusions here and say we’re going to have a fantastic World Cup campaign. For me, I have to prepare the team for the first game in October. Victory in the first game is possible if everyone of us thinks positively. It is a big challenge for the fans, players and the whole country<br /><br />I think we have a world cup on our minds but this is something much more important than that. This can influence the future of the game in India. We have a youth World Cup and that is a start. Some of these U-17 players will go on to play for the senior team in the future<br /><br />Plus, this tournament will captivate the billions of fans in India. India has a large population and there will be talents who need to be attracted to the game. It is better for the game, if that happens</p>

Ever since I watched ‘Gandhi’ the film, he has personally motivated me and added to my strength. He gave me the belief that you can fight for what you want, even if your chances look minimal. I believe that’s the reason he is revered to not only in India but all over the world</p>

  <p><b>[India U-17 coach Luis Norton: In football, there are no impossible missions]</b> We’re working for a victory. In football there are no impossible missions. Our opponents are very strong with experience. We are going to fight every moment, for the results.<br /><br /><b>[on USA]</b> They work very well. They are doing a fantastic job for 20 years. They have experience, which is a very important in this competition. Colombia is very strong in South America. Ghana is a tradition, always a strong team. Ghana and Mali are the two best African teams in this tournament<br /><br />I’m not afraid. We’re going to fight very hard for this.They play different types of football. South American team Colombia are very difficult. We’re going to prepare every game to win and we think we can win. I cant tell you which is the best group or best team because every game is different<br /><br />It is very important to show that these Indian players can play good football and with more time to develop, they can fight against any team in the world<br /><br />We’re going to work very hard. We will watch videos of other teams. There is a tournament in Mexico with Colombia and Chile. I don’t want to give excuses. We work very hard to be competitive and at the end of each game, we must be proud<br /><br />The important thing is to play with 11 players on the field and a 12th player..the supporters. If the people support the team and are enthusiastic, they can play with passion and soul more. I hope the young people in India come and watch</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Norton de Matos believes that even though the odds are against his side, the colts can produce unexpected results in the upcoming FIFA U-17 World Cup]</b> We realise our chances of winning a match is extremely bleak in the competition. I think we have a five percent chance of achieving a positive result in those games and we need to fight for that. The coming months will be tough because the players will have to concentrate hard, but we cannot be more confident going into the first game because I believe we can make an impression.<br /><br /><b>[Portuguese coach was asked about India’s home advantage in this tournament]</b> It is unwise to consider that we will have any home advantage. The players from Ghana and Colombia will have no problems in getting accustomed to the weather here and the USA team is already training in Dubai to prepare for the World Cup<br /><br /><b>[Speaking about India’s progress]</b> We have progressed a lot as a team in the last few months. We have produced good football, but it does not matter when there are no points for your performances. However, we showed in Europe that Indian players are on a par with European players. When it comes to my contribution, every coach has his own philosophy and I am trying to help them in every possible way. I want to be a leader, not a chief who just gives orders</p>

  <p><b>[Confident Luis Norton de Matos satisfied with ‘important’ win over Mauritius]</b> This match was very important for us as it was the last international before the World Cup. I wanted to play all the players and hence I put two sets of teams. It’s not that the team which played in the first half who would against USA <b>[in India’s World Cup opener]</b>. All the teams, if you look, we had the same philosophy which was interpreted by different players. The way we play must be the same. It wasn’t easy as we like to build the game at the corridors and it is difficult to have stability there.<br /><br />Of course, there are two periods for the other team. They started well, were organised and had a good physical condition. But with more minutes, they lost their concentration because their condition wasn’t so good as us<br /><br />I never talk about individual names as it is always about the team. It is the team which is more important. However, in every game there are players who play better and some who don’t. However, today those whose didn’t play well perhaps can play well tomorrow. What is important is how we perform as a collective unit<br /><br /><b>[Boris Singh, who scored the opener, will not be able to play in the opening game of the World Cup due to a suspension he picked up]</b> When I came, I knew he cannot play the first game. I’m happy that he can be in the group. For me the most important thing from this win is to finish the game without any injuries. This was my main concern. The field was difficult, the body can have a lot of shock from physical contact. It was good physical work for us<br /><br />We have 15 days for the World Cup and 15 days is enough to have a good condition. If you ask me about the match experience, then no but about the physical condition, yes. The players are here with us for some months and you cannot change nothing now. You must keep the confidence, the players must go on and I’m sure they are going to give 100 per cent. If it is enough, the future will tell</p>

  <p><b>[Why Luis Norton took India Under-17 team to watch a Benfica game]</b> Until now, I am very cool <b>[with our preparations]</b>. I want all the pressure to come to me and not the boys. It’s very important that the players have the freedom to play without being blocked by the coach. My mission is to help the players with their emotions because they love football.<br /><br />Even if we are not favourites or the possibilities are less for us, there is always a chance that we can win a game<br /><br />I saw Bengaluru FC against the North Korean team <b>[4.25 SC]</b> and it was not the question of playing better but of scoring the goals in the right moments. The North Korean team started better and looked more experienced. However, Bengaluru scored in the right moments which took some pressure off their shoulders. This is football. I believe we need to fight for these moments<br /><br />In Italy, even if it was a second team of Italy, the Italian federation may have thought they would beat India. But the players were inspired to do something special and we won 2-0. Against a team like Macedonia, it was a very good test to our defensive organisation <b>[0-0 draw]</b>. In Mexico, I was happy despite losing the first two games <b>[against Colombia and Mexico]</b> because we made mistakes which we can correct. Every game is a lesson for us. We need to concentrate on all the details and focus not to make any mistakes in the first game of the World Cup against USA. There are surprises in football. Even if we lose, we will give our maximum<br /><br />When we were at the Benfica stadium with 60,000 people, the players shared how they felt to watch a game in Europe. As a coach, I also need to give the boys some indirect information of the ambience they are going to face. We invited some professional players to talk to them and the boys were very enthusiastic. This is also part of coaching</p>

  <p><b>[India coach Luis Norton de Matos planning to write a book on his Indian experience]</b> It’s a novel on romance. When you write something, you put some of you in the book in different characters. It’s about the romance of a man in football who is like a dictator. All my life I wrote a lot of articles. When I was a professional player in around 1978, I wrote about what happened in Belgium because I cannot reduce my life to talk about football.<br /><br />Now that I’m in India, I want to express the experience I have here with the different religions and traditions<br /><br />There are books that I was reading before coming to India. I was in Portugal and a couple of friends gave me some books. I didn’t read it for one or two months. One day I took the book and read it in about two days. I was very touched by the information in the book. One month later I received the invitation to come to India. The name of the book is ‘Siddhartha’. When I came to India it felt the same as it was written in the book<br /><br />I was also very touched by the movie ‘Lion’ that I watched in the flight - the story of a boy lost in a train - a very nice movie on India</p>

  <p><b>[Norton de Matos on why Team India are at a disadvantage against footballing bigwigs]</b> I think the players are improving very well but there are some things that are difficult to progress without a competition. It is difficult for any coach in the world to give to the boys in a very short period of time the <b>[feeling of a]</b> real competition. Even if we have had some very good results, it has been in friendly games.<br /><br />Even when we talk to other coaches in Mexico, the coaches of Chile and Colombia teams, they have 10 years of competitive football behind their teams. This changes everything because you can prepare very well in the mental, physical and tactical areas. But they have a match every week.<br /><br />For example, in Portugal, there are the big teams like Benfica and Sporting <b>[Clube de Portugal]</b> who play competitive games from the age of seven or eight. This is very important because there are some kinds of experience that you learn only in the game.<br /><br />It’s completely different if you play for points every week and when you go into a real competition. A real competition gives you the problems <b>[experience]</b> that you don’t have in friendly games</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Norton de Matos had says The base for India is to defend]</b> I think the first criterion to test a player is through his talent. You can have a combination of talent and profile for certain positions. If you’re 1.80 meters, it’s impossible for you to be number one in gymnastics or if you’re 1.60 meters it’s impossible to be good in basketball. In all kinds of sport, excellence can be earned through hard work. Obviously, you need some skills to do that hard work. If you have wingers, it’s not so important if they are big or not but they must be fast. For certain positions like central defence, goalkeeper and so on, being big is important.<br /><br />You look at Mourinho’s Manchester United. Their central midfield is <b>[Nemanja]</b> Matic, <b>[Marouane]</b> Fellaini and <b>[Paul]</b> Pogba. Each of the three players are tall. They are good with the ball and also recover it, win the second balls as well. This is something which I like.<br /><br />But you can also have Xavi, <b>[Andres]</b> Iniesta and <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi. It depends on how they play. Barcelona never play long balls but control the game by possession. Barcelona model is an exception to the rule though. The other teams control the game in the way they recover the ball because they are very strong in that department<br /><br />Almost 50 percent of the goals in football are through corners and free-kicks. These kinds of things for me is all about the organization and knowing what you want from each position. You have to define the position’s role in the game and what profile of players you need<br /><br />What are the profiles of the players, how does the team play. Every coach has a model of playing. For example, you play two wingers, one number nine and one number 10. So you must look for players who can play in this manner. When you construct a building, it starts from the base. The base for us is to defend well. It does not mean that we play defensively but in an organized manner<br /><br />When the game ends, we say that the opponents were stronger than us but it was actually due to the individual actions through corners or free-kicks that we have difficulty with. People think that it’s easy to defend. It’s not easy to defend because the general notion when you have the ball is to attack<br /><br />A competition brings us a lot of information that a player needs. For example, when we play our first game in Delhi, I don’t know how many people are going to be there. Suppose there are 40,000 people, how will the player react? Some may play much better than usual and other may feel blocked by the audience<br /><br />It’s a completely new thing to play with the crowd and responsibility. Even as a nine-year-old if you’re playing in a final, the emotions from the public is also there. Perhaps the public includes family and friends, but they create a kind of a pressure<br /><br />However, this experience doesn’t exist in India as the boys haven’t played in competitive matches in front of a full stadium</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Norton de Matos says Indian players are very able and want to learn]</b> When there is a change in coach, there is a different philosophy. My main concern was to put my ideas and the players following it. To my good surprise was the way the players were focused. In about two months, the process was correct in their mind. We played some good games in Europe.<br /><br />The intensity of the Indian players, they are very able and want to learn. This is a positive. This is an important thing. Earlier they used to play more direct and I try to play more with the ball. We try to start with two lines and reduce the space for teams like USA, Ghana and Colombia. The process started with building the defence. It’s very important. Defence is not all about defending. The offensive process is more difficult and takes more time. But if you have a good defence, then there is a possibility of a good result<br /><br />There are possibilities to score but the problem is that a European player with more experience would need three chances while we need seven. We cannot correct this now as the process starts in grassroots. You cannot learn this very fast. If we have more time to work, certain things can happen easier. Intensity is very good, quality in defence is also very good. Now we will prove if what we learned in the last seven months is enough to win or draw but we will fight</p>

  <p><b>[India’s Luis Norton’s advice to players - Don’t lose your head]</b> I try to coach on the mental aspect as well. They must enjoy this moment, every inch. They must enjoy every tackle, the people cheering. This entire ambience they must feel. My advice is to come in the game and enjoy. It’s important to not lose Concentration, don’t lose your head even if there are issues. Just continue with our process of organization.<br /><br />I’m sure they will give their 100 percent. In the end, we must be proud. There is a will to win or draw, the will to make Indians proud. I’m very happy and the players are confident. It’s important that the players take what they have learnt in training to the game. Each game is a new story. We must try to be competitive. If we keep our discipline, we can make a game<br /><br />There is a lot of information available. We played in Mexico against them, Chile and Colombia. They have information about us. I prefer to play a lot of international games. When you start the process in USA or Portugal, a seven-year-old has lot of competitions to play in. They come in with 10 years of competition. We do not have this experience. Perhaps that is their strongest point. This is the biggest problem we have as we are not very experienced</p>

I know of the possibility of a small weakness they have but always they are stronger. We will fight for this little possibility. We would like to write the history for Indian football. Of course the players are involved in the process. We hope we can play with 12 players - 11 players and the fans.

When you watch US playing and we watched a lot, of course, their philosophy is offensive. For me, I would like to have this variety of solutions in attack. With a fantastic players like the number nine <b>[Josh Sargent]</b>, Akinola and Weah are very strong<br /><br />For us, we will play as a collective unit and try to fight the strength and physique they have.

  <p><b>[Luis Norton de Matos says India must understand what they want for the future]</b> I think it’s a gift for Indian football to have this World Cup. The Indians must be proud of the quality of this team in India. After the World Cup, all these players will be new for the people but they must continue. This World Cup should be the first step to grow football in India. There should be regular competitions at U-13 and U-16 levels across the nation.<br /><br />I don’t believe that we cannot find a lot of good players in the whole country and such competitions can reveal them.<br /><br />When the player is of 10 years, you have more time to build a uniform programme for him across all the teams, who would work in the same way starting from the grassroots. What we do now must have some benefit for the future<br /><br />Even these <b>[India U-17 World Cup squad]</b> players have good experience in Europe and other countries, which is very good but I must say that it is better than nothing. From the time I took over the team in March and now, the tactical and physical organization is completely different.<br /><br />It is still not enough time of working with experience but I accept the conditions and it’s very important to continue with this programme after the World Cup. I hear about the possibility of these players with a mix of U-19 players to play in the I-League. I think it’s good. This generation of U-19, U-17 and U-15 boys in four years for me is the basis of the senior team eventually<br /><br />The first competition India should be interested in should be at the Asian level. Don’t think that you can play the quality of Spain or Brazil <b>[right away]</b>. I am very positive but I’m also being realistic that there is a huge gap. In Asia, if you have a good programme, you can start. If you want to win now or in five-to-six years - this is the main question for the development of football - to understand what you want for the future</p>

  <p><b>[What coach Luis Norton de Matos has to say]</b> Every coach has his own philosophy and through mine I know what I’m looking for on 6th October. I am happy and lucky because I have my system of players. I have different options with players which I can use in my system.<br /><br />The boys are responding to the philosophy very well. The group is very intelligent. I believe, in football, like other sports, you must first have intelligence. They have the motivation- they are representing themselves and the country. They always want to prove they are able of whatever I ask them to do. They are well disciplined, on and off the pitch. This group is professional and they have begun early and so in the future, I am sure they will be the future stars of Indian football<br /><br />The team must have a balance. If you score four goals but allow the opposition to score five as well, you lose. Hence, you must maintain equilibrium. The team perhaps has not scored a lot of goals <b>[in practice matches]</b> but the opponents haven’t been easy either.<br /><br />As a coach I would like a lot that we can reach the quarter finals. I am very realistic because India, in this World Cup, is one of weakest teams that are going to participate. I think my first realist target is to reduce the gap <b>[in terms of standard of play]</b> between the rivals and us</p>

  <p><b>[Coach Luis Norton stated that his team conceded a daft goal in the first half by giving away a needless penalty when Jitendra Singh brought down Josh Sargent]</b> First of all, it was fantastic ambience and congrats to Indian supporters because they pushed us and it was incredible. As I said, there is a big gap between us and the other teams. But I think we proved that we have organization. We conceded a stupid goal in the first half because of a penalty. We started the game a little shy. We weren’t good in the last pass because it was very important for us to get it right in transition. We do have difficulty in putting the last pass. Until the half-time, it was possible to keep the score respectable. USA started better of course.<br /><br />In the second half, we conceded a goal. It showed the experience of the team. The ball from the corner was ours and the USA player scored. Despite it being 2-0, we didn’t lose control. We had two possibilities from Komal <b>[Thatal]</b> and Anwar <b>[Ali]</b>.<br /><br />It was important for us to score in that moment as it would have had a good effect. They could have given a fight in the final 15 minutes. In the same action, they scored and made it 3-0. It was a big punishment for us. Even though the US were superior to us, I would have liked to see what would have happened had we made it 2-1. Surely we would have gone for the draw in the final 15 minutes and the US would have been under pressure. I am not happy with the result. The players proved that with more experience, they can play against such teams.<br /><br />You talk about being defensive, I say very organised. USA played with four forwards. The number 11 <b>[Carleton]</b> or Akinola would play, but they played both which was a strong force with an intention to score early. We know through their past that they want to get a result in the first 20 minutes. They had occasions too<br /><br />You must remember that we do not have a culture of competition. This is the first time the boys are playing in front of a crowd of 40000 and with the quality of USA. This is not a friendly tournament. The 17-year-olds, they were a little shy. They lost a lot of passes which usually they would have successfully completed. Sometime later in the game, they had the possibility to create things. USA played at least seven games in the last two months in a competition. This is very hard and it gives you vital experience. This experience helps you control the emotions at this level.<br /><br />I don’t speak about individuals because the strength of the team is in the collective. There are some players that can be better but in general, I am satisfied with the collective work. They were very organized. Of course, I am not happy with the result. I never said it was going to be easy. We had a little percentage to perhaps win or draw a game. We fought for this little percentage. I thought we could have scored a goal we deserved with 15 minutes to go. USA would have played completely different had it been 2-1 and would be looking to keep the result. At 3-0, they had some control.</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Norton de Matos questions media’s silence over penalty decision]</b> had a doubt when I saw it live. After coming back to the hotel, I have seen it at least ten times. Even now I was watching it on my mobile. I have still not been able to understand why that was given a penalty. But it’s a FIFA competition and I can’t talk against it.<br /><br />Why did the Indian media not write anything about the decision?<br /><br />The team that will play against Colombia will be pretty different from the one that played against USA. There can also be a change in strategy as well. For example, I may start with a 4-5-1 instead of our usual 4-2-3-1<br /><br />I had seen the New Zealand squad once way back in 1997. In the World Cup, they were way above that level. There are hundreds of such examples. We have to keep this team together for a few years<br /><br />How can I deny the reality? Colombia is even stronger than USA. They have played regular competitive matches against the likes of Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Chile, and Argentina. I am not thinking about a draw for now. The focus will be on strengthening our defensive organization</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Norton de Matos says Important that India play without fear]</b> I would like to win but I used to say that if I can’t win, the best result is a draw. As a coach, I don’t like to lose. I know the difference and all the gaps existing but now we are going to fight for a result.<br /><br />My frustration, after I have analyzed the game with a calm mind, is about not scoring a goal seven minutes before the end. I am sure if the penalty didn’t happen, it would have become 2-1. We would have seven minutes after that and I know the mentality of these boys, they can fight till the end. They are very focused<br /><br />The second goal was a big mistake from us and in football, most goals are results of mistakes. It also was a fantastic shot from Durkin. The first goal was not a mistake of our team, it was the mistake of the referee. If it was a game with the video review or a referee near the goal, it would never ever be a penalty<br /><br />Some of these players play in the first division in Colombia. But now we played against Sargent, who was the second highest goal-scorer in the U20 World Cup and it gives my boys the confidence to have played against the best. We have lost three points but have not lost hope and they are concentrated enough to earn a good result<br /><br />I have seen many videos of Colombia and have also watched the first 25 minutes of their match. They made three similar moves down the left and that’s exactly the way they played against us in Mexico. They don’t score in normal way. They scored from two corners and another from dribbling inside the box. But we are very organized. Sometime, people say the team is defensive but that’s also important. You need to play according to your strength and for us, the biggest strength is our organization<br /><br />It’s important that the boys play without fear and it’s an advantage that they know the Colombian players</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Norton de Matos explained the reason as to why Dheeraj Singh performance has improved by leaps and bounds]</b> In our Mexico trip, we played Mexico, Chile and Colombia. It’s good to play competitions and sometimes when you lose, you do learn important lessons. We conceded nine goals of which seven were from set-pieces. It was very important to have a top goalkeeper coach. I brought a top goalkeeper coach for the last month of preparation.<br /><br /><b>[On Paulo Grilo]</b> His work has been incredible. The work he achieved with the three goalkeepers has been exceptional. To control the space of the ball and to be honest, this is not my area of expertise. Today nutrition, recovery, the mental aspect, prevention of injury and more, every area is different and we need professionals for this. We are lucky to have Paulo. He is a fantastic goalkeeper coach. Of course, the quality of the player is also important but the position-specific training has helped</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Norton de Matos was a proud man after his team put in a valiant display against Colombia]</b> Yes, I will sleep well with the sentiment that the players played a fantastic game. I am very proud as the Indian team showed they can play in this competition. It was a dream six months ago to think that we can give this against a top South American team. I’m happy and tired.<br /><br />I’m also frustrated because there was a possibility to win. At least we should have had a draw. The players had the capacity to suffer and the organization was always there. USA coach said that it was difficult to play against us. Even the Colombian coach said the same. It’s a proven idea now. We need what? We need more consistency in our last pass and in the transition to offensive.<br /><br />In first half, I would like to score a goal first and hopefully look to win a game<br /><br />The problem was that we scored towards the end of the game. The happiness of the players after scoring saw them lose concentration. We don’t have this experience. After the goal, three-to-four-to-five minutes, it’s easy to get them to focus. However, the very next minute was like a dream for them<br /><br />It’s a pity that against USA, we struck the post and they scored which was a big punishment for us. 2-1 would have been fine. That would have been the correct result. We lost because the will to win can have some contradiction. They were a bit lost for some minutes. It’s not their fault but they need more competition. This team has a fantastic future</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Norton de Matos was questioned on what he thought was his team’s strongest aspect]</b> We are very strong in our organization. That is our strongest point. We have good concentration and it is difficult to score against us. Of course, India’s offensive quality can be different. After Mexico, we work a lot on set pieces. In football, the most difficult part is the offensive process. It is what we need time to work more and more.</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Norton explains why India U17 group must be kept together]</b> I think it is the best we can do for these boys in the future. For me, it’s a key moment for football in India to let them play in a competition because they need to progress.<br /><br />The question of physical challenge for me is not a problem. As I told you, if you have a good organization and if you can keep the ball with a collective action, our team will be difficult to play against. Of course, success is a consequence of better organization<br /><br />It’s important to have 18 games or so because fans are already following this team thanks to the World Cup. After these 18 games they will be much stronger. Another important thing is that, after the World Cup if you want to keep the attention of 10 or 11 million people watching these players, it will be through this team. The brand of football in India now is this team</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Norton de Matos talks after his side bowed at the India 2017 group stages]</b> It’s important that everybody learns that the process of football in India needs to start with four, five, and six-year-olds in all the schools. Right now, you cannot expect these boys to win against teams like Ghana or Colombia. This generation is a fantastic generation for the future, but all the things this country must do with the grassroots is needed to have results. Here in India, we’ve started the process</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Norton de Matos has decided to step down from his post citing personal reasons]</b> Certain personal reasons, chiefly the health-related issues of my parents have made it difficult for me to continue in the position of Head Coach, Indian Arrows and stay far away from Europe for the entire season. Hence, with deep regret I have decided to step down as the Head Coach of the Indian Arrows, India’s U-19 National team<br /><br />I like to thank AIFF for providing me the opportunity to work with the National youth team. I thank my staff, my players and wish them the best in their careers. Once my personal issues settle down I shall be more than happy to contribute in future as and when I can. I have deep affection and love towards India &amp; Indian Football &amp; wish AIFF good luck for future</p>
