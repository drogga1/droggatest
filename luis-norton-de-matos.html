  <p><b>[Luís Norton de Matos is set to be appointed as the head coach of the India Under 17 national team]</b> I am not supposed to speak about this at this point of time. I may come to India which depends on the visa. At this point there is no agreement yet.</p>

  <p><b>[Newly appointed U-17 head coach Luis Norton de Matos]</b> I think everybody expects a lot from this Under-17 World Cup and everybody knows that India must grow a lot to reach the top level in football. We are looking to do good work and surprise the fans. We would like to qualify for the group stages by securing at least four points from the group stage.<br /><br />One thing I can promise is that we will think about winning only. We must not think about losing and even if we have very less percentage of chance on paper, we need to fight for that little amount. This is my mentality and hopefully, we can surprise a lot of teams. It is impossible to win or lose a game before playing and my philosophy is that there is always a possibility to win a game<br /><br />In all my life, I have liked a challenge. I like the chance to do something positive and I’m not afraid with the quality of the Indian players because I trust a lot in my methods and expertise. We have eight months and I’m sure they will progress a lot. I have no pressure when it comes to this challenge<br /><br />Of course, I’m not selling any illusions here and say we’re going to have a fantastic World Cup campaign. For me, I have to prepare the team for the first game in October. Victory in the first game is possible if everyone of us thinks positively. It is a big challenge for the fans, players and the whole country<br /><br />I think we have a world cup on our minds but this is something much more important than that. This can influence the future of the game in India. We have a youth World Cup and that is a start. Some of these U-17 players will go on to play for the senior team in the future<br /><br />Plus, this tournament will captivate the billions of fans in India. India has a large population and there will be talents who need to be attracted to the game. It is better for the game, if that happens</p>

  <p><b>[Newly-appointed India U-17 head coach Luis Norton de Matos tells he has been hugely inspired by Mahatma Gandhi]</b> Mahatma Gandhi has been a huge inspiration in my life. Ever since I watched ‘Gandhi’ the film, he has personally motivated me and added to my strength. He gave me the belief that you can fight for what you want, even if your chances look minimal. I believe that’s the reason he is revered to not only in India but all over the world</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Norton de Matos talks after his side bowed at the India 2017 group stages]</b> It’s important that everybody learns that the process of football in India needs to start with four, five, and six-year-olds in all the schools. Right now, you cannot expect these boys to win against teams like Ghana or Colombia. This generation is a fantastic generation for the future, but all the things this country must do with the grassroots is needed to have results. Here in India, we’ve started the process</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Norton de Matos has decided to step down from his post citing personal reasons]</b> Certain personal reasons, chiefly the health-related issues of my parents have made it difficult for me to continue in the position of Head Coach, Indian Arrows and stay far away from Europe for the entire season. Hence, with deep regret I have decided to step down as the Head Coach of the Indian Arrows, India’s U-19 National team<br /><br />I like to thank AIFF for providing me the opportunity to work with the National youth team. I thank my staff, my players and wish them the best in their careers. Once my personal issues settle down I shall be more than happy to contribute in future as and when I can. I have deep affection and love towards India &amp; Indian Football &amp; wish AIFF good luck for future</p>
