  <p><b>[Newly-appointed India U-17 head coach Luis Norton de Matos tells he has been hugely inspired by Mahatma Gandhi]</b> Mahatma Gandhi has been a huge inspiration in my life. Ever since I watched ‘Gandhi’ the film, he has personally motivated me and added to my strength. He gave me the belief that you can fight for what you want, even if your chances look minimal. I believe that’s the reason he is revered to not only in India but all over the world</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Norton de Matos talks after his side bowed at the India 2017 group stages]</b> It’s important that everybody learns that the process of football in India needs to start with four, five, and six-year-olds in all the schools. Right now, you cannot expect these boys to win against teams like Ghana or Colombia. This generation is a fantastic generation for the future, but all the things this country must do with the grassroots is needed to have results. Here in India, we’ve started the process</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Norton de Matos has decided to step down from his post citing personal reasons]</b> Certain personal reasons, chiefly the health-related issues of my parents have made it difficult for me to continue in the position of Head Coach, Indian Arrows and stay far away from Europe for the entire season. Hence, with deep regret I have decided to step down as the Head Coach of the Indian Arrows, India’s U-19 National team<br /><br />I like to thank AIFF for providing me the opportunity to work with the National youth team. I thank my staff, my players and wish them the best in their careers. Once my personal issues settle down I shall be more than happy to contribute in future as and when I can. I have deep affection and love towards India &amp; Indian Football &amp; wish AIFF good luck for future</p>
