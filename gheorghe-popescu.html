  <p><b>[Popescu says Only huge <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> fans think <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> is better than Messi]</b> You have to be a big Madrid fan to think <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> as better than <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. Take away allegiance and there is no possible comparison between them. There is <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and then there are others. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is a great player but does not have the quality to win a game that only <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has<br /><br /><b>[The former <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> defender was made club captain after his arrival from <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">White Hart Lane</a> at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> by <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Johan Cruyff</a>, the Dutch coach who is credited for many of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s modern footballing philosophies today]</b> Yes and I did not believe it myself.

  <p><b>[Their club’s president - former <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> star Gheorghe Popescu, who is also <a href="gheorghe-hagi.html">Hagi</a> senior’s brother-in-law - admitted he was delighted Rangers chose to go through with their option to buy <a href="ianis-hagi.html">Ianis</a> <a href="gheorghe-hagi.html">Hagi</a>.]</b> were obviously expecting this transfer because we had information from Scotland and we knew Rangers wanted him very much. It was always only going to be a matter of time before he became an official Rangers player. I believe this transfer is an important step in Ianis’ career. He needed continuity and he’s at a club and a coach who wanted him very much. And he’s playing in front of passionate fans who have loved him from the start. He’s at Rangers on merit. Now everyone at the club is waiting for <a href="ianis-hagi.html">Ianis</a> to take the next step which would be to become an automatic starter for the national team</p>
