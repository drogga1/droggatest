  <p><b>[Gareth Bale could complete a perfect career with a Premier League title win]</b> He’s got enough money. Surely now it’s not how much he can earn. His CV would be enriched and complete with a Premier League winner’s medal. I’d argue that is worth more than all the money he gets. OK, I know he has won La Liga and the Champions League with Real Madrid, but he hasn’t won the Premier League. I wouldn’t want to finish a career like his without a Premier League winner’s medal. Unfortunately, he’s had Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Neymar blocking his path to becoming the best player in the world. If he came to England and started doing the ­business, winning trophies in this ­country, then it will have been the perfect career. He could go to Germany and play for Bayern Munich, but it’s time to prove himself in the Premier League.<br /><br />I don’t think there’s any chance of him returning to Tottenham, so there’s a great opportunity for my old club Manchester United to sign him. There’s been speculation ­virtually every summer about Bale coming to Old Trafford. This time is probably the best chance of it happening. I would love to see him here. He’s a match-winner, he’s got pace, he’s got goals in him - and that’s what United need. It’s just a pity, from United’s and the Premier League’s point of view, that Zinedine Zidane walked out on Real Madrid. If he had stayed, Bale would definitely have been on his way because there was a problem. It seemed that Zidane didn’t really fancy him and Bale was becoming frustrated. He showed what he is capable of in the Champions League final against Liverpool. That overhead-kick goal was world class. He would give Jose Mourinho’s side the X factor. They weren’t afraid to pay out big wages for Alexis Sanchez, so why not do the same with Bale? If United want to get to the next level, then he is the one</p>
