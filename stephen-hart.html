<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former Trinidad and Tobago coach Stephen Hart knew what was coming]</b> You have to be stable in administration. People are always jumping in, changing and looking for solutions and sometimes they say, ‘Let’s just change the coach,’ or ‘Let’s just change one player. And it’s never as simple as that when the structure that is necessary to bring the football forward, especially from a youth development perspective on a consistent basis, you need some sort of continuity in player development. Then you also need to have your players consistently playing at a decent level outside of the country, sorry to say that, but that’s the reality.<br /><br />The relationship is an ongoing one in which we’re trying to do what’s best for the team, I guess. But anybody coming into that situation, it’s very difficult because there’s a complete lack of financial stability. And once there’s a lack of financial stability, what is necessary is to raise the standard of your flagship team, which is your senior men and that is not marked up the way it should be compared to other teams in the Hex.<br /><br />For me, the teams in the Caribbean, it’s always rolling the dice. It’s always a fluke when the teams do well. For example, they did well at the last Gold Cup and they do well because you have time with the team, spend some proper time and developmental time with the unit and you go into the Gold Cup and you show a fair amount of competency, but even when you get to the latter stages you sometimes struggle to get over that hump. It’s a matter of stability and treating players in the right way and paying them on time. There are so many things that need to be done.</p>
