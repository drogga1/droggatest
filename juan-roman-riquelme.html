  <p><b>[Juan Roman Riquelme says Argentina captain or not, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> is the best in the world]</b> If the coach has chosen to give him the armband, that is phenomenal. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, with the captain’s armband or without, is the best on the planet. Players like him don’t need the armband to play as they do. We are lucky that he is Argentine and we must enjoy his presence. When there are players as unique as him, wearing the armband changes absolutely nothing.<br /><br />We know that we have a massive game against Brazil, and we will try to play it in the best possible way. I hope we do well, enjoy it and can give joy to the country</p>

  <p><b>[Boca legend Riquelme says Copa Libertadores final doesn’t matter any more]</b> I’m exhausted and tired of looking at everything that happened, of seeing the people throwing rocks at a bus, I can’t believe it, and the people next to them who didn’t stop them.<br /><br />We should be happy that we don’t have a Boca player severely injured. In Panamericana the same thing happened and there were people injured or dead. They are people. This game doesn’t matter anymore. What’s important is that no players are severely injured<br /><br /><b>[The legendary midfielder also says he has no doubts that the two teams would rather not play the match under such trying circumstances]</b> I feel Boca is going to want to play in normal conditions, and the other team too. I have no doubt that the River manager wants to play when the Boca players are in the right condition to play. I don’t see <b>[River boss Marcelo]</b> Gallardo being any other way<br /><br /><b>[While Gallardo seemingly agreed, he is hopeful that normal conditions can return by Sunday and that the rival clubs can play the match the way it was intended to be played]</b> A football party was expected and it ended up being a general, total embarrassment. First was the aggression against the Boca bus and after everything that was lived during the day, we had to live this when we should have another kind of enjoyment. Unfortunately, it ended as it ended. Hopefully tomorrow <b>[Sunday]</b> in normal conditions we can play the game that we all want. It seemed to me that we could not play the game if Boca’s players had been physically or mentally damaged, and from then on I did not make decisions, it was my opinion</p>

  <p><b>[It wasn’t the first or last time that Riquelme would embarrass an opponent, but given the magnitude of the occasion and the fierce rivalry with River Plate, it has to be considered one of the greatest - perhaps the greatest outright - nutmegs of all time. In typical Riquelme fashion, he played down the incident and was full of praise for his victim]</b> Whenever I’m asked about this trick, I always say it has more worth for Yepes than me. In a 3-0 Clásico with a trick such as this, I believe that any other player would have kicked out. Yet he followed me all the way to the corner without doing a thing. This is much more manly than nutmegging someone</p>
