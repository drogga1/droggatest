  <p><b>[Craig Burley believes it is ‘nonsense’ to expect former players to succeed where others have failed]</b> The one thing I’ve heard is that this unites the fans, what a load of nonsense. It’s the same thing as at United - ‘well this gets the fans on our side’, what the hell does that matter? Right, because fans get on the side of a team when they perform on the field. When a team doesn’t perform on the field, the fans aren’t on that side. It matters not a jot who they appoint, fans will only be on your side because they think ‘oh, well Frank’s been at Chelsea for years, this is a great appointment, we’re all happy’. Guess what, when results start going a little bit awry, like they did at United, things will change.<br /><br />If Frank comes in he’ll probably bring in Jody Morris, who was his assistant at Derby, another ex-Chelsea player. Good coach, good guy, both good guys no problem there. It’s just experience. A big turnaround is needed at Chelsea, a big turnaround, and I go back to it, it’s short-term. I go back to United, <a href="edward-woodward.html">Ed Woodward</a> was so soft in trying to appease the fans that he rushed out and gave <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> the contract. Then results started going downhill. It’s a big call all around if that’s the case. If it is, it’s clearly Chelsea saying ‘we want someone we can control, and we probably aren’t going to spend money on players</p>

  <p><b>[Craig Burley says <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> to Chelsea talk is ridiculous]</b> It’s amazing if you compare two guys going into big clubs, <b>[Ole Gunnar]</b> <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> and <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>, they’re both level-headed, intelligent, experienced football guys. But the perception is incredible among the supporters, it almost clouds the bigger picture and blindfolds them.

Ultimately Derby failed but it was a more-than-decent first season. But if there was no connection for that football club, this appointment would be derided and would be ridiculous. It’s a crazy notion that a lot of fans seem to have that because a guy played for a club, he understands the club.<br /><br />He did, but he did. If my memory serves me right with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>, there was problems at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> when he stepped up from coaching within the system. But there was a whole bunch of players that were ready or just about to come through including one of the two greatest players of our generation <b>[in Lionel Messi]</b>. That analogy and analysis that a lot of people throw out, particularly when the <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> appointment was made, is just not going to stand up to scrutiny. To say, ‘Frank <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>’s our guy’. I find it a tough one to sell, I really do</p>

  <p><b>[Craig Burley on <a href="henrik-larsson.html">Henrik Larsson</a>]</b> I was lucky enough to play with <a href="ruud-gullit.html">Ruud Gullit</a>, <a href="gianfranco-zola.html">Gianfranco Zola</a> and <a href="gianluca-vialli.html">Gianluca Vialli</a>, who all played in a similar position to Henrik. <a href="mark-hughes.html">Mark Hughes</a> was another at that time then I played with <a href="fabrizio-ravanelli.html">Fabrizio Ravanelli</a> later in my career. But <a href="henrik-larsson.html">Henrik Larsson</a> is absolutely in that bracket with all of those guys<br /><br />They were super influential in football all over Europe and Larsson had a similar impact across the board - not just in Scotland. People were talking about Henrik all over the world<br /><br /><b>[That wasn’t the case initially after he and Burley were unveiled at Parkhead]</b> I’d watched Henrik for Sweden and, as far as I was aware, he was a winger. I thought, ‘We’ve signed a good wide man here’<br /><br />Eventually the younger guys at Celtic obviously looked up to Henrik but in the beginning there was a bit of that west-coast attitude of looking down your nose at a foreigner who’d just come in.For them, it was a case of: ‘Who are you? Show me something. It wasn’t until Henrik really took the bull by the horns that people gave him respect. And you could sense how good he was going to be as soon as Wim worked out what he wanted to do with him. You just knew because he was a very clever player in terms of his movement<br /><br />The worst thing for a top-level midfielder is a striker who makes poor runs and bad decisions. The flip side is that their job is so much easier when they have a guy up front with clever movement. That was Larsson. I remember games where before the ball even got to me I could see him already making the run. All the top players I’ve mentioned had the same ability - to make YOUR mind up when you got the ball instead of the other way around. Henrik made it easier for me to play a pass because he had already made the run. For a midfield player that’s gold dust - because I saw the opposite from certain players over the years, who’d make you look like a fool. Certain strikers can make you look really bad. But Larsson had the ability to make you look good and that was just priceless<br /><br />Maybe people don’t realise this but Henrik wasn’t the biggest guy, even though he was great in the air. I wouldn’t say he was skinny because that’s the wrong word but he wasn’t a big brute, a muscular guy. But his strength was incredible. It was uncanny, really, how he would use his body.<br /><br />The other guy who was similar in that sense was <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Bergkamp</a> at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I remember playing against him for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and going in for this tussle with him. I thought: ‘F<strong><em>ing hell, this guy’s as strong as an ox’. I expected to brush him off the ball but he had this ability to use his body so well and Larsson was the same. Centre-halves thought they were going to brush him aside but it was tougher than they thought<br /><br />Henrik had the famous incident with Tosh McKinlay on the training pitch - but in a sense that galvanised everybody. For a few weeks early on, there was a them and us thing going on. It wasn’t bad or malicious but there was a clique. That wasn’t just Henrik, it was Regi Blinker and Marc Rieper, all of those boys. But after the Tosh incident everyone thought: ‘Wait a minute - we all need to be together here’. It got heated and passionate at times. I heard Henrik arguing with Wim at the top of his voice at one stage. He wouldn’t shirk from saying something in the dressing room. He wasn’t a shouter but if we weren’t playing well, particularly when the pressure was on at the end of the season - he would be well p</em></strong>*d off<br /><br />Because it meant a lot to him, he was that type of guy. He was a winner and a top player. We drew a game at home to Hibs that season and there was a shot of Henrik coming off the pitch, taking his headband off, effing and blinding in his native language. But it was because he cared - and a lot of guys had the same attitude in that squad which is probably what got us over the line. He was just a normal guy. He was open, funny and interesting in the dressing room. And he was just able to harness an amazing ability to do what he did</p>

All it’s going to do is results will become so inconsistent that it’s going to pile on pressure as to ‘why?’ We know you don’t fancy him but he’s a better goalkeeper and the chasing pack are coming. We need Champions League football next year, and are we on a ‘grudge’ thing here with Kepa or do you really think <a href="wilfredo-caballero.html">Willy Caballero</a> is the better option? I don’t think many would really put that up as an argument<br /><br />I’m not suggesting Kepa’s been in the greatest form, because he hasn’t.

If <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>’s <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are going to challenge, and that’s a big if, are going to challenge <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> amongst others, they’re going to have to have a deep squad because the other two do have that. That’s something as a player you’ve got to take on the chin and you’ve got to rise to the occasion that if you have a couple of bad games, you might just be out of the team, rather than ‘Oh, I know I’m going to be in the team next week no matter how I play’. That’s not going to happen if you’re in the top three or four in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> or any other big league around Europe or the world for the matter.<br /><br /><b>[on Jesus Corona]</b> If you want to look at him and say ‘is he going to play potentially as a wing-back?’ Yeah, and <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> did do that on the odd occasion last year, primarily to get <b>[Marcos]</b> Alonso on the left side because he was better as a wing-back than a full-back. But then if he plays a back four most of the time, he’s covered down that right side. He’s got <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Cesar Azpilicueta</a> who is the club captain and is very versatile, can play left-back, right-back and can play centre-back in a back three. Then you’ve got a young lad in <a href="reece-james.html">Reece James</a> who did very, very well for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> last year coming in down that right-hand side. Big and powerful, loves to get forward, is learning the game, was very good in the final third with balls into the box. And then all the wingers, so I really don’t see this as a go-er.</p>

  <p><b>[Craig Burley claims Fierce competition for places at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> could lead <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> towards Chelsea]</b> You want to back yourself as a player. You’ve got a manager in <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> who will be very enthusiastic in trying to sell the platform to him. Clearly when I played, you played on the Saturday, you played on a Wednesday and expect to play the following Saturday if you played well enough. If you got told you were left out of the side, you knew it wasn’t for resting purposes, it was because you were dropped. The game has changed, you’ve got to have a deep squad and a quality squad. I think <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> can sell to <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> that <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> and <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> have carried the load for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, and they’re not going to play 50 or 60 games per year. I’m not surprised <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> would be interested, though, he ticks every box for them. He can play out wide, they’ve got wide players, he can play through the middle, he works hard, he presses when he’s not got the ball, it absolutely makes sense for him.</p>

  <p><b>[The former <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Blaugrana</a> star has also been previously been linked with a move to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> and former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> midfielder Craig Burley feels he could be a good addition for the North American competition]</b> I think he’s good enough to play at a reasonable level, wherever that may be. At the end of the day, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are looking for younger players. They’ve got a number of players they can select in similar positions <b>[to Pedro]</b>. So I don’t think there’s any doubt that he’ll be one of the players who will be moving on. The other side of the coin is that he’s had a pretty lucky career with injuries, especially recently unless my memory serves me wrong. He still looks very fit and nimble and fast, which is a big attribute of his. When you look at <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a>, you don’t look at someone who has a bad attitude, you see someone who works hard and is a team player. When you put all those things together, he would be a very good signing for someone in <a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a>. Although he’s turning 33, he’s still got a lot to offer, and he’s a very hard-working player</p>

  <p><b>[Craig Burley says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> must be considered serious title contenders for 2020-21 if they are able to add a big-money deal for Ben Chilwell]</b> I think he <b>[<a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>]</b> showed enough last year to suggest that the players are responding to what he wants. Clearly now there is some confidence from the ownership because owners don’t spend money under managers that they’re not confident in. <a href="ben-chilwell.html">Ben Chilwell</a>, I really, really like him. I looked at clubs in England that might need a left-back, I thought <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> who have got full-backs but are having a problem in that area might go for him. If <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> can get <a href="ben-chilwell.html">Ben Chilwell</a> that would be a huge signing as well because he’s got unbelievable pace to get up and down that wing. When <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> likes to play <b>[Marcos]</b> Alonso, it’s in a back three, he doesn’t like him as the full-back, he has to play <b>[Cesar]</b> <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Azpilicueta</a> there, but he’s a right footer. <a href="ben-chilwell.html">Ben Chilwell</a> will give them great balance down that left-hand side and if he can get those two signings on top of all those other players we’ve mentioned, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> will be in the mix for it <b>[the league title]</b> next season, there’s not a doubt about it from me.<br /><br />I think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> clearly have the money but, as good as <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> is and I think he’s a brilliant player, he was a non-essential player for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. So therefore with the restrictions and financial hit that clubs have taken, they’re only going to spend money if they absolutely need to. Now, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s need was more because <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> has done a fantastic job but he’s not a German international, he hasn’t got the quality or flexibility that <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> brings. So he was an essential signing for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and I think that’s why they’ve pushed the boat out. <b>[Roman]</b> Abramovich has said ‘Okay, we’ll pay the release clause because we need this player, we want to get back to the top and he’s essential for us’.</p>

  <p><b>[Craig Burley says Signing <a href="kai-havertz.html">Kai Havertz</a> from Bayer Leverkusen would be a statement of intent from Chelsea]</b> You can’t have enough good players. It would be a statement of intent to go out and get one of Europe’s most exciting young talents. It does fit with the narrative that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> are going down. They are looking to sign younger players with sell-on value but who can also produce the goods now. If they get Werner, he can play wide or through the middle. <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> is flexible as well. They may be a little top-heavy, in terms of their forward line. But it would be a statement from <b>[Roman]</b> Abramovich to say, ‘we’ve given you Werner and we also want <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a>, one of the brightest talents in European football’. That’s a very exciting sign for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans, but I doubt they will be in that race alone because <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> is probably on everybody’s radar.</p>

  <p><b>[Craig Burley says <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> is under pressure to deliver on Roman Abramovich’s expectations at Chelsea]</b> Anyone who thinks they are going to get in this team because they might sell a few jerseys is living in cloud cuckoo land because <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> knows he is under pressure to close that gap, get <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> back to the top. Abramovich will expect it, he’s gone out with the cheque book already and given him <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> - one of the best forwards in European football - and he’ll expect results. None of that frontline, or any other player in the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> team, will play next season or beyond unless they are deserving of a place in the starting XI. It’s as simple as that<br /><br />Defensively they have looked a little bit iffy and when that happens you need to have a rock-solid goalkeeper behind you, and I don’t think that the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> manager believes he has got that</p>
