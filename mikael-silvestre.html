  <p><b>[Ex-Manchester United defender Mikael Silvestre has warned Anthony Martial against ‘doing a Paul Pogba’ by leaving Manchester United]</b> <b>[He had]</b> a very good season and adaptation to the Premier League and United. He had been their top scorer last season, but this year he’s a different player. He had a difficult summer with France - he had a game where he didn’t perform and he was out of the team - and you have to remember the episode of getting his number <b>[taken away]</b> for <b>[Zlatan]</b> Ibrahimovic to take. He was not happy about that. We always say when you have a good first season it’s hard to <b>[continue performing]</b>, and we have to put that on the fact he’s still young and still learning. I hope he keeps patient, and won’t do a Pogba, like he did and head to Juventus. He has to stick around and show his character. The character is about being courageous, stick to it and work harder - as he has been doing.<br /><br /><b>[He can]</b> learn from Ibrahimovic, and learn from Rooney, because those guys have done it and have got what it takes to win trophies. It’s the best place for a young striker to develop himself. It would be the same for Marcus Rashford</p>

In addition to being the defensive partner of player-manager Marco Materazzi, I did a lot of Italian-to-English translation for my Indian teammates at the club.<br /><br /><b>[The Frenchman also opened up on his relation with Materazzi who left the South Indian club recently]</b> The incident between Marco and ‘Zizou’ in the 2006 World Cup final was unfortunate, but despite that I was able to have a great relationship with Marco in India. This shows that football is bigger than politics and war</p>

  <p><b>[Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann would be a perfect addition to the ranks at Manchester United]</b> You need a lot of energy now in the modern game. Antoine has that. He has a lot of talent. He has got the right attitude. He would be perfect for United. The fans would love him. His stamina, workrate, his finishing. It would be a great signing for Manchester United.<br /><br />In my time we had Andy Cole, Dwight Yorke, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Teddy Sheringham - proven goalscorers. Ruud van Nistelrooy - proven goalscorer. Louis Saha - proven. Wayne Rooney - proven. That’s what you need. It is a priority.<br /><br />Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial are not regular 25-goals-a-season players yet. They have some time to go to be that kind of a player who will produce week in, week out. You need someone like Antoine. Manchester United need him. Someone you can rely on to produce consistently. At 26 he is the right age and has a proven goals background.</p>

  <p><b>[Mikael Silvestre talks up Leonardo Jardim as Wenger successor]</b> You should look at someone who practices attacking football, like a Leonardo Jardim at Monaco. I would not fancy Diego Simeone to come and play a tight two lines in front of the goalkeeper. The Arsenal way of playing is attacking football, so you want to keep that.<br /><br />He <b>[Wenger]</b> will only be the one who decides when he wants to go. I think the real question and concern is what is next and how do you handle the transition? If he goes, who stays behind from the staff? It is really important to keep the staff involved. He has got a major legacy and you do not want to throw everything in the bin</p>

  <p><b>[Alexandre Lacazette would be a great addition for Arsenal]</b> He is very active, he can play both sides, technically he is very gifted and he has been scoring 25, 30 goals for the last four years in the French league so he is a proven goalscorer. In terms of adaptability to Arsenal’s style, he has all the qualities. He is very intelligent, he can make up the play with <b>[Mesut]</b> Ozil, with <b>[Aaron]</b> Ramsey, with <b>[Danny]</b> Welbeck. I think he would be a great addition for Arsenal. And he speaks French!<br /><br /><b>[On Anthony Martial]</b> It’s been difficult for him. Arsene could be interested, but United needs that type of striker. He should stick around</p>

  <p><b>[Mikael Silvestre has dismissed suggestions Samuel Umtiti could head to Manchester United]</b> Man United will always look to sign players with the X-factor, but I don’t see Samuel Umtiti as necessarily a Manchester United player. I think Eric Bailly has all the qualities Man United need in defence but United will always target the best, so who knows who might come in and they will always look to strengthen the squad. For me the focus would be the midfield.<br /><br />I think it was the only decision the club could have made, everyone had an idea it was coming. He’s made a real impact on the team, 32 points out of 39 in the Premier League and 14 wins out of 19 games is a great record so it wasn’t really a surprise decision<br /><br />The captaincy at United is different in the modern generation, as you need a couple of leaders in the team, but I think Paul Pogba could be the one to lead the team</p>

  <p><b>[Mikael Silvestre has backed <a href="william-saliba.html">William Saliba</a> to make an instant impression at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> Defensively he’s strong so he’ll be looking to impress in pre-season. He’ll need to adapt in that period, but he has enough time to learn from the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> staff and players. He’s still very young but has great experience from his time in <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a>. He’ll continue to learn from the current centre-backs, but he’ll have a big part to play from day one<br /><br />I met Saka recently and congratulated him on his fantastic season. We need to remember it’s all very new to him in defence, so he’s needed to learn fast. At the back, if you make a mistake, you’re almost certain to be punished. He’s still learning, especially in his decision making and positioning in the defensive third. He’s got all the attributes to be a great modern full-back - strong going forward and combining with the winger on the left. He has competition for his place with <a href="sead-kolasinac.html">Kolasinac</a> and <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Tierney</a>, but it’s a big plus for the club<br /><br /><b>[Regarding <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a>’s start to life at the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Emirates Stadium</a>]</b> <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>’s departure has seen a similar period at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to when <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> departed <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. It’s a tough transition, but <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> has now come in and he’s unbeaten in eight games. The players are now understanding his philosophy and you can see the methods he wants to put in place at the club. One key difference is in the transition from defence to attack. In the past few games, you can still see a lack of consistency in performance. There is no magic formula to get it right straight away, so the best is still to come for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> under <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a>. They’re on the right path but they need to retain key players <b>[Pierre-Emerick]</b> <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> and <b>[Mesut]</b> <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> for next season.

It’s provided him with more chances and assists than in the past. Martial is more than just a No.9 and if he continues his good form, he’ll be an important player for France at Euro 2020. He’s a modern striker, so he can play as a winger or as a striker. He’s not an old-fashioned striker. As he likes to pick up the ball deeper and take on defenders</p>

It was the same feeling as when we signed <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> the year before. You know you are getting someone that’s going to stay there for a while and perform, bring what you need to win trophies, which is scoring goals and creating chances. I think we were all really excited to sign one of the best young prospects around. For me, it meant an even harder test every day because I had to face him in training, but I loved that. I had always felt that it was better to face the likes of Wayne and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> in training - before them it had been Ruud <b>[<a href="ruud-van-nistelrooy.html">van Nistelrooy</a>]</b>, <a href="andy-cole.html">Andy Cole</a>, <a href="dwight-yorke.html">Dwight Yorke</a>, Ole <b>[Gunnar <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>]</b>, Teddy <b>[<a href="teddy-sheringham.html">Sheringham</a>]</b> - because I was a competitor and I always wanted to test myself against the best. Not only was he fast and clever, he was strong too. So was I and physicality, as a defender, is an important part of the game, so I was always looking forward to the challenge of facing him. He was great when he arrived, but he was always developing. He learnt a lot from the others, from Ole, Ruud, Louis <b>[<a href="louis-saha.html">Saha</a>]</b>, and like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> he was a fast learner. He needed to bring consistency quickly into his game to be able to retain his place in the starting XI for United and England. He was, like the rest of us, a bad loser, and if you don’t want to lose then you always have to improve. He got that. He was always looking to improve his game.<br /><br />When I sit down and think about the players I played with during my career, for my clubs and my country, it’s ridiculous. <b>[<a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine</a>]</b> <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, <b>[Roberto]</b> Baggio, <b>[Thierry]</b> Henry, <b>[David]</b> <a href="david-trezeguet.html">Trezeguet</a>, <b>[Laurent]</b> Blanc, <b>[Javier]</b> <a href="javier-zanetti.html">Zanetti</a>, <b>[Diego]</b> <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a>, <b>[Roy]</b> Keane, <b>[David]</b> <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a>, <b>[Paul]</b> <a href="paul-scholes.html">Scholes</a>, <b>[Ryan]</b> <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a>, and that’s just a few of them. It’s a joke, but no question at all, when I sit down and think about the best of them, Wayne is among them. That’s not just because of his ability, but also because I know what it takes to play that long for United, the work behind the scenes that people don’t see and can’t even imagine. It might seem like the weekend comes, you put on your kit and do your magic, but no. He played for United for well over a decade and scored more goals for the club than anybody else. During that time, putting in all his effort for the club and the team, going up and down the field, defending like he did from the front, playing injured many times, giving his all for United. He was a true Red</p>
