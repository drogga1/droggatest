  <p><b>[Whatever happened to Lester Fernandez? The talented midfielder who won the ISL]</b> Maybe I have played only 60-70 per cent of my football. I could have played for another four-to-five years or maybe more than that but it just didn’t click. I don’t know what to say about it also because the teams that I went to either closed down or the coach changed. I didn’t want to go and play in the second division also back then, coming from the ISL. Maybe that is the fault I made. I should have maybe played somewhere to make my comeback<br /><br />For me, you know, what is hard to swallow is that I just vanished away from the scene and people don’t even know what was the main reason. It was not about my fitness or anything<br /><br />The area where I grew up was called Austin Town. Players like Carlton Chapman, Noel Wilson are all from the same area. Chapman played for India at that time. So everybody in our area wanted to be a footballer like him. I lived just behind the ground where all the players used to train. So I could see football happening right in front of my eyes<br /><br />Dempo had really good players that time and I wasn’t getting much of a chance. Armando (Colaco) Sir asked me to have some patience but I always used to crib because I was out of TFA and my batchmates were playing at Sporting (Clube de Goa). And I thought that I couldn’t afford to sit on the bench<br /><br />After I left Dempo, I started to play well. The time at Pune was the peak and so I cannot regret that I left Dempo. My (football) journey has been very good until I suffered <b>[the ACL]</b> injury in 2015. I was about to sign for FC Goa. They had even sent me the contract but just before signing, there was an East Bengal match in which I got injured. The <b>[2015]</b> ISL was going to start in a few months but my injury took another eight months to recover<br /><br />After returning from my surgery, Bharat FC also shut shop. I don’t know if it was timing or what because the same year (2015) after my surgery, I had gone to Mumbai FC. I trained with them for one month and I was already fit but then they signed Arata (Izumi) from the ISL. I was supposed to sign for Chennai City (in 2017) but the coach (Robin Charles Raja) who called me there was sacked<br /><br />Then I didn’t want to play for any second division club and that year got wasted. Then after three years, automatically I’m off the radar. So it became irritating. Even last year (2019), Ashok Sir (Dr. Ashok Kumar) who was at Pune FC (former general manager) called me to Gokulam (Kerala) but I thought against moving out of Mumbai.<br /><br />Now, you know how it works. Whether you have played football for five years or 10 years, you will have to go <b>[to any club]</b> on a trial basis. So maybe after a good pre-season, I could try out somewhere but I still have to think about it. If I play for a couple of years, either ways I will have to establish myself all over. There are also many coaches these days who are doing their licenses. So who knows what the future holds</p>
