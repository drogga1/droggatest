I like to see the best moments, the goals. That’s why I would never become a coach.<br /><br />Everyone respects me here and gives me a lot of hugs. It’s a club that I love so much. I do not know why people love me so much here - I am speechless when I see it all. I am a son of PSG. When I arrived here, the gates of Europe were opened for me. My time here was very special. There were the games against Marseille and Bordeaux, the goal against Guingamp… these are moments that I cannot forget. To choose a favourite is impossible. I often speak with people who work at the club or who play here. The change of direction has not changed anything. There are still people who are here who were here in my day. I still keep in touch<br /><br />Thiago Motta for me, he’s class. I love to see him play, he is different from all the others. We played together for a long time <b>[at Barcelona]</b> and that’s why I know him well<br /><br />Not winning a title is something that still makes me sad today. In my time there was a nice team with Jay-Jay Okocha, Nicolas Anelka, Aloisio … It is a pity that things did not go well. Today, there are great players and it is certain that playing in this team would have been a pleasure. But my time here was the best of my life</p>

Through FCBEscola, FC Barcelona and Ronaldinho’s football academies will be seeking different ways to collaborate both in terms of the brand and possible associations with the same. The player will also appear in the opening and closing ceremonies at some schools and take part in activities in which he will share his experience in educational talks.<br /><br />Ronaldinho will also take part in FC Barcelona Foundation events related to UNICEF. The Masia 360 project will be another one of the Club projects where the Brazilian will be present, helping with the training and coaching of the athletes involved. The agreement will be signed on Friday at 5.30pm CET at the Camp Nou directors’ box with the presence of Ronaldinho and president Josep Maria Bartomeu. Then, the media will be to take photos of the Brazilian star at the club museum</p>

Maybe even, in the future, the best player in the world. At the moment it is Messi. I have always said I think one day it will be Neymar. But at 19, in the future, it can be Gabriel. He has all the abilities to make that happen<br /><br />I don’t always agree that players should always be eased in - it depends on the type of player. You look at Gabriel Jesus and he has no fear at all. He just wants to play and show what he can do. He will put in big ­performances against Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea and all the other top teams in England. I’m pleased he has been named in the Champions League squad and I think he should play, he is full of confidence. Ronaldo, Kaka, myself and, more recently, Neymar were playing at the highest level at a young age. Gabriel is in that ­category</p>

Maybe in two or three seasons he can consider it, but not now. If his time at Manchester United is up, then it is up, but he will still be an important player for many of the top clubs in England, Italy, Spain, Germany, or France. Over the last 10 years he is one of the players I have respected most, he has exceptional ability and I want to see him play in a league that will still test him.<br /><br />Also he should consider his international career. He is still a very important player for England and the reality is that if you are not playing in one of the top leagues, it does become a lot harder for the national coach to choose you. There have been players that have stopped playing at the top level before perhaps they should have and have ended up regretting it. The career is a short one, you do not want to end up with regrets</p>

That would already be enough. I will never get tired of eulogising about Leo. He’s not just a great player; he’s a great person, a great human being. That’s the kind of thing we must never tire of praising. And when he gets on that field … well, then we could end up speaking for a whole year about Messi. He evolves with every game. Leo is a living legend and we must treat him with so much respect.<br /><br />I’m very happy that he has gone to Barcelona. I think the characteristics of his game are perfect for Spanish football, and for Barcelona’s style. I hope it works out for him, because he has a lot of quality. He is one of the most special players in the world today - the kind who would fit into any team. If he was able to shine in England, with that aggressive football, full of really strong, fast players, that proves he can play anywhere<br /><br />I’m not surprised. Everyone in Brazil already knew <b>[what he could do]</b> due to the excellent work he did at Corinthians. He really stood out.

  <p><b>[Ronaldinho speaks about <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>]</b> We just have to cross our fingers and hope that someone comes along with half of his ability. That would already be enough. I will never get tired of eulogising about Leo. He’s not just a great player; he’s a great person, a great human being. That’s the kind of thing we must never tire of praising. And when he gets on that field … well, then we could end up speaking for a whole year about <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. He evolves with every game. Leo is a living legend and we must treat him with so much respect</p>

  <p><b>[Brazilian football great Ronaldinho has tipped Manchester United’s Paul Pogba to win the Ballon d’Or]</b> He can win the Ballon d’Or, without a doubt. I see Pogba as a friend, I don’t see myself as his idol. He is young, talented and he has the ability to play anywhere, he can play in a free role, defensive, as a runner or attacking. He has the characteristics of a player who can fill any position, he can make history.<br /><br />He knows the substitutes’ bench, like me at Paris Saint-Germain with <b>[former coach Luis]</b> Fernandez. It is not the same, when Mourinho tells you that you’re on the bench you have to respect that, the other guy, a little less. I think Paul really has a lot to learn from Mourinho, who is one of the best coaches in the world. A coach who has won so many titles should be respected. In my case, it was the opposite<br /><br />He is already in a big club and he has everything needed to make history, whether it is this club or another he has to be where he feels happiest</p>

I think when he leaves, nobody will be able to take the No. 10 of Leo.<br /><br />For me it’s not a question over who is more complete, it’s a question of taste. I prefer Messi’s style.
