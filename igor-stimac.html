  <p><b>[How Igor Stimac instilled a new belief in this India team!]</b> It is all about belief. I made the players believe in their abilities. It is more about trusting yourself and your abilities rather than thinking about the opponent’s. Qatar had everything to lose. We had nothing to lose. That is the mentality with which we prepared for the game. It is all about the collective and having a united front. There are no individual stars in this team. Everyone knows their individual job and they performed it to perfection against Qatar<br /><br />I changed the personnel over time since my arrival by bringing in players like Sahal Abdul Samad, Rahul Bheke, Brandon Fernandes, Rowllin Borges, Anirudh Thapa, Amarjit Singh, Manvir Singh, Nikhil Poojary, Adil Khan, Narender Gahlot and others as well. These players are good on the ball. The players who are good technically have had a rub-off effect on players who are not so good. That automatically elevated the levels of the whole team<br /><br />These players have to start playing more consistently. Take someone like Manvir Singh for example, last year he played only around 200 minutes or so. That is not good enough and the only way he can improve is by playing more<br /><br />Effective running is highly crucial. It is important to not go full pace in attack every time you get the ball. You need to be smarter with your game management and pick the important moments to fasten or slow down the game. You cannot be playing with full intensity for the entire 90 minutes. Learning smarter game management is a gradual process but I am confident we will be successful in our endeavours<br /><br /><b>[All these changes that Stimac has implemented came to the fore in the draw against Qatar but the Croatian left nothing to chance tactically as well]</b> We did a complete tactical breakdown of the Qatar team. Their regular left-winger Akram Afif was missing so we knew their captain Hassan Al Haydos would play there. Al Haydos loves to cut in on his right foot so our plan for Rahul Bheke was to force him to go wide. It was similar at the other flank with Mandar Rao Dessai. Their right-winger is not so strong with his right-foot and most of the damage he causes is with his left. Hence, force him out wide too was the plan. Then there is their star striker Almoez Ali who is just so lethal and deadly in the box. Our plan was to starve him off possession inside the box and we were largely successful to that effect as you saw<br /><br />I will be sitting down with the coaches of the various junior teams soon to have serious discussions. We all need to be on the same page as to what are the kind of players we want to produce for the senior team. It is very important for us to have the same vision and approach at all levels if we are to take giant strides in the long run</p>
