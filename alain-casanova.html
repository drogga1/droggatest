<blockquote>
  <p>[Manu Garcia joins the Ligue 1 finishing school] On the technical side, he’s a very high-level player. He’s very comfortable playing a range of passes and his first touch is of a very high quality. He has huge potential, but if he’s not reached it so far, it means there are gaps in his game. He is a very good player with the ball, but he must become a very good player without it. He needs to improve in his ability to become more intense more often and be stronger in the areas of recovering the ball and transitioning to defence</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[On Ibrahim Sangare] He’s one of the greatest players I’ve had at Toulouse. “I’ve managed high-level midfielders, like Etienne Capoue, Adrien Rabiot and Moussa Sissoko. I think he’s of that level. I knew he had potential but I though he needed some time. On the other hand, I’m not surprised because everyone was saying good things about him. I was told: ‘You’ll see, he’s a very, very high level player.’<br /><br />His first touch is one of the best I’ve seen. He’s calm in small spaces and comes out of pressure in incredible ways. He’s also got a great ability to recover the ball, and does a huge amount of running. He can still improve tactically, but for the rest, he’s very complete. He can play as a box-to-box player or a No.6</p>
