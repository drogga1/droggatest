  <p><b>[PFA calls for instant action to combat racism in football]</b> We have spoken to Danny directly, both after the Montenegro game and again today, to ensure he is aware that we are on his side and here to support him as a union and as fellow professionals. To see a senior England international so disheartened with his profession is a shocking indictment of the current experience of many players worldwide. The PFA - together with stakeholders in England - have worked hard to address racism within football over the past 20 years. While considerable achievements have been made domestically, more must be done - both internationally and at home<br /><br />1. Instant Action. Currently, our players are bearing the weight of these incidents, and while we commend the likes of Rose and <b>[Raheem]</b> Sterling for speaking so candidly, protocols must be enforced to protect all players from such experiences.<br /><br />UEFA has a three-step process for halting matches. This relies on a player reporting an incident, the referee responding to the player’s report and then making a judgement call on the magnitude and intensity of the provocation - we want to see this protocol enforced consistently.<br /><br />2. Imposing Sanctions. The strongest possible sanctions must now be imposed on any team whose fans engage in racist behaviour from the stands. Fines are not proving effective, and therefore more strident punishments must be given - stadium bans and sporting sanctions are the minimum punishments required.<br /><br />PFA Deputy Chief Executive, Bobby Barnes, via his role with international players’ body FIFPro, is also speaking directly with UEFA President, Aleksander Čeferin. We know Čeferin has recently exerted direct influence on domestic associations to ensure stronger responses to specific racist incidents. We will be lobbying for stricter sanctions to be applied consistently across all of Europe.<br /><br />3. Member Support. We understand that many members feel frustrated that the current application of deterrents are not sufficient, and feel that not enough is being done by the sanctioning bodies to address the issue.<br /><br />We want players to know that their well-being is a priority. Football is a career; no one should be expected to ‘put up’ with racist abuse at work. Ultimately, if players experience racism during a match and collectively teammates feel the most appropriate action is to leave the pitch, we would understand. However, to do this, is to absolve the responsibility from footballing authorities, match officials and stadium safety officers who are tasked with providing a safe working environment for players.<br /><br />We urge everyone involved in the game to take any reports of racism seriously, and we encourage managers and teammates - regardless of ethnicity - to join together in solidarity with players who are facing racist abuse</p>

  <p><b>[What is the #Enough campaign? PFA’s anti-racism movement explained]</b> The boycott acts as a show of unity by the players, and a call for stronger action to be taken by social networks and footballing authorities in response to racist abuse both on and off the pitch. Players recognise that these racist incidents are a reflection of societal issues. They know first-hand how damaging racism can be and are using their platforms to inspire change that will benefit players, football and society as a whole<br /><br />The PFA will continue to work closely with The FA and government to ensure more is done to tackle racist abuse, while also seeking to put pressure on both FIFA and UEFA through FIFPro. The campaign seeks to shine a light on the need for social media platforms to take responsibility to address racism received by professional footballers and other users online</p>

  <p><b>[Bolton Wanderers players to boycott remaining league games over unpaid wages]</b> The long-running financial crisis at our club has been well-documented. As has the fact that we, the playing staff, have yet to receive our March salaries. Five of our coaching staff are also yet to be paid for March. We have endeavoured to continue our training and playing commitments during this extremely difficult time, with seemingly no resolution in sight. We thought that the prospective takeover of the club would provide a solution, but difficulties in its completion have left us no further forward. This situation is creating mounting mental, emotional and financial burdens for people through no fault of their own. The mental pressure has affected some people to the extent that they feel they are unable to perform their jobs sufficiently. These are unprecedented circumstances and are affecting every aspect of our lives, placing great strain on ourselves and our families. During this time we have remained patient in hope of some explanation but information from the club has been extremely limited and very confusing. What we have been told changes constantly. With deep regret, we have decided not to fulfil our remaining fixtures unless we are paid. We understand that this will disappoint our fans and for this we sincerely apologise. We realise this may be seen as drastic action but we feel we have no other options left. This decision has not been taken lightly and is not a reaction to this one particular incident. We have suffered numerous issues this season, and recent seasons, brought on by the mismanagement of this club. We have been operating in a near untenable environment for some time and it is the accumulation of these issues that have resulted in our decision.</p>

  <p><b>[Bolton Wanderers players to boycott remaining league games over unpaid wages]</b> The PFA supports the actions of the Bolton Wanderers players. The players have shown great patience and loyalty towards the club all season, but today they have reached a point where action is necessary. The PFA has been working with the club since the beginning of the season and we have done all we can to resolve this issue including giving Bolton Wanderers a substantial loan to cover players’ salaries in December. We will continue to support and represent the players and work towards a longer-term solution in the best interests of the players and Bolton Wanderers football club</p>

  <p><b>[PFA proud of England’s restraint in ‘extreme circumstances’]</b> This evening, during England’s European Championship qualifier against Bulgaria, the game was temporarily halted as part of <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s anti-racism protocol, after racist chanting from some Bulgarian fans. Like everyone watching, the PFA was disgusted by the racist abuse and visible provocation by a section of Bulgarian fans, 50 of whom were rightly ejected from the venue at half time. We offer our support to England’s players, who showed restraint while dealing with such extreme circumstances. We also commend <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> and his staff for their decisive action in initiating <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s protocol. Once again, <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a>’s England team has shown leadership regarding this issue.<br /><br />No one should have to suffer racist abuse at their place of work. It is right that action is taken to support those affected and make it clear that such behaviour will not be tolerated. The game in Sofia was already being played to a reduced crowd as a consequence of previous racist abuse by Bulgarian fans. This was obviously not sufficient action to deal with the issue. Given the circumstances surrounding tonight’s game, the strongest action must now be taken by <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> to ensure a clear message of zero tolerance</p>

  <p><b>[PFA calls for <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> disciplinary overhaul and tougher sanctions for racist abuse]</b> The PFA is disappointed at the sanctions announced today, levied by <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> towards Bulgaria in the wake of the disgraceful racist incidents witnessed two weeks ago. While the sanctions are in line with current <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> disciplinary guidelines, this only serves to highlight that these guidelines need to be overhauled and far stronger deterrents imposed - not ruling out expulsions from competitions. Only then can the issue of racism be seriously confronted.<br /><br />In addition, there is currently no BAME representation on <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Committee. This lack of diversity, we believe, will influence the way in which racist incidents are dealt with by the panel. Diversity on the pitch must be reflected at every level of the game, not just on the field of play</p>

  <p><b>[PFA has called for the UK government to investigate racism in football]</b> Racism has no place in football or society. It is deeply disappointing that some fans continue to display vulgar racist gestures and chants from the stands. It has become clear that football players are on the receiving end of the blatant racism that is currently rife in the UK, but they are not alone. The PFA stands beside every player who faces discrimination. We will continue to fight on their behalf to combat this issue for good.<br /><br />Football is part of the fabric of British society. With the huge global audience that English football attracts, we have a responsibility to lead the way with a zero-tolerance policy. Racist abuse in football is not just an issue for black and ethnic minority players, it is an issue for everyone who loves the game. Whilst the protocols in place ensured stadium announcements were executed today, we need to ensure the perpetrators are identified and dealt with according to the law. We believe that the time has come for all governing bodies to unite collectively to end this abuse.<br /><br />The PFA calls for a government enquiry into racism and the rise in hate crime within football and immediate and urgent action from an All-Party Group at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to address this urgent issue</p>

As this is an ever-moving situation, our staff are working tirelessly behind the scenes on this unprecedented crisis to address the needs of the players, while considering the clubs and the wider industry.<br /><br />Our initial response to the outbreak was to focus solely on the health and safety of players, club staff and the fans. We circulated advice and recommendations to all players and clubs regarding best practice at the training ground, and as the outbreak progressed, we then voiced the player’s concerns to the leagues which resulted in training being suspended at all clubs.<br /><br />We wanted to ensure the necessary steps were taken to ensure football was taking responsibility to do its part in reducing the potential for spreading the virus. It was quickly obvious that the wider implications of the pandemic were more important than football.<br /><br />Understandably, with the season subsequently on hiatus, the players’ and clubs’ financial positions then became a priority issue.<br /><br />Contrary to some press reports the PFA has never stated that it will block all wage deferrals. What we have sought to put in place is a structured and unified approach to ensure a fair response across the leagues.<br /><br />Each club’s financial standing will vary. We are aware of the public sentiment that the players should pay non-playing staff’s salaries. However, our current position is that - as businesses - if clubs can afford to pay their players and staff, they should.<br /><br />The players we have spoken recognise that the non-playing staff are a vital part of their club and they do not want to see club staff furloughed unfairly. Any use of the government’s support schemes without genuine financial need is detrimental to the wider society.<br /><br />In instances where clubs have the resources to pay all staff, the benefit of players paying non-playing staff salaries will only serve the business of the club’s shareholders.<br /><br />We fully accept that players will have to be flexible and share the financial burden of the COVID-19 outbreak in order to secure the long-term future of their own club and indeed the wider game. Our advice going out to players at this point reflects that expectation.<br /><br />In addition, the PFA is also expecting to contribute financially to any solutions agreed upon. We are hoping to reach an agreement with <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and EFL that secures the long-term future of the clubs and protects players.</p>

  <p><b>[The Professional Footballers’ Association has advised against blanket reductions]</b> The players are mindful that as PAYE <b>[pay as you earn]</b> employees, the combined tax on their salaries is a significant contribution to funding essential public services - which are especially critical at this time. Taking a 30 per cent salary deduction will cost the Exchequer substantial sums. This would be detrimental to our NHS and other government-funded services. The proposed 30 per cent salary deduction over a 12-month period equates to over £500m in wage reductions and a loss in tax contributions of over £200m to the government. What effect does this loss of earning to the government mean for the NHS? Was this considered in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> proposal and did the health secretary, Matt Hancock, factor this in when asking players to take a salary cut?

Importantly, it will aid cashflow in the immediate, but football needs to find a way to increase funding to the EFL and non-league clubs in the long-term. Many clubs require an increase in funding just to survive. We believe in our football pyramid and again stress the need for solidarity between all clubs. Going forward, we are working together to find a solution which will be continually reviewed in order to assess the circumstance of the Covid-19 crisis</p>
