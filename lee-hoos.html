<blockquote>
  <p><b>[QPR ‘vehemently oppose’ Championship resumption]</b> I am absolutely stunned by this announcement, as is our Director of Football <a href="les-ferdinand.html">Les Ferdinand</a> and our manager <a href="mark-warburton.html">Mark Warburton</a>. Incredibly, there has been absolutely no consultation with individual clubs nor with the Championship doctors’ working group by the divisional representatives - or anyone else in the Football League - regarding this matter. On top of that, we were only made aware of the statement 40 minutes before it was made public<br /><br />Having spoken with Les and Mark, they share my views. We are vehemently opposed to this schedule. The players haven’t even returned to full-contact training at this moment and yet they are now expected to be in a position to play at a competitive level in just three weeks’ time. I have made our feelings known to the EFL and, having spoken with a number of CEOs at other Championship clubs, I am not a lone voice on this matter. We are absolutely appalled</p>
