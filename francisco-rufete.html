  <p><b>[Former Valencia winger Francisco Rufete feels that the Indian Super League has the potential to become one of the strongest leagues in the world]</b> I know Jose Molina, he was at Zaragoza. Carlos Marchena, he played with me at Valencia. They mentioned about the fantastic experience they had in India. They think that in the future Indian league will possibly be one of the strongest leagues.<br /><br />Congratulations to Rafael Benitez for being promoted to the Premier League. It is very difficult to come back in the top division after being relegated in the previous season. For me, Benitez has a big mentality. He has massive knowledge on tactical systems and I think he is one of the important managers in the world. He has done well in Spain and England too and has the experience<br /><br />Obviously, there is money but the plan is more important so that you move step-by-step towards your aim. Now there is a different world because England, Spain, Italy with these payments but the most important is your plan. When you have a good plan, when you have a good league, when you have a good idea, the players and coach will want to stay with you. The Chinese have a model now which is based on money. However, in the footballing history, money is not the only thing important to develop projects, ideas and success<br /><br />I am open to offers however, what is important is that when you go to a club, you need to understand the philosophy of the team especially when signing a contract</p>
