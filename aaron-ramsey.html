  <p><b>[Current Wales captain Aaron Ramsey, who was handed the armband by Speed]</b> I was given the tragic news this morning. To say I am devastated is an understatement. My thoughts and prayers go out to Gary’s family and friends. Today the world has lost a great football manager but even more sadly a great man. He will be missed by all</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey is confident that he will not miss any action after being taken off with an injury while on Wales duty]</b> I’ll be alright. The pitch was very hard. There’s no give in it so I rolled my ankle a bit. Hopefully it will be nothing and I’ll be available for Saturday. These are the games you want to play in and I’m looking forward to it.<br /><br />I don’t know how you could play football on that pitch, to be honest. Normally we play quick and play the ball on the floor, playing around teams, but we couldn’t do that. It was bobbly so it was very difficult. The main thing is we came here and won. Now we can move on and play on grass next time</p>

  <p><b>[Aaron Ramsey has revealed his underwhelming recent form for Arsenal is the result of not feeling in less than peak physical condition]</b> It’s going to take a few more games for me to get back to my best, but I’m not worried. I think certain criticism from people is a bit unfair. It was tough out there again but I’m not worried. I know my qualities and I’ve had a few injuries this season and I’m still getting back. I’ll be honest and say I’m still not 100% physically there.<br /><br />We’ve had a great start and we still have a lot of work to do but we’ve given ourselves a great opportunity now. <b>[It was]</b> a brilliant performance defensively from us. We were under pressure for large periods of the game I felt we stuck together and that’s something we’ve improved on dramatically in this campaign - we’re hard to score against. We’d have taken a draw before the game so it’s a good point in the end</p>

  <p><b>[Aaron Ramsey considers Arsene Wenger to be a brilliant manager]</b> The manager hasn’t said anything about it. He’s our manager and we’re delighted to play for him. He’s been brilliant for us so hopefully we can repay him by finishing off this season strongly and hopefully win something for him. As players, we haven’t really discussed it, we just want to go out there and try to win the game so we’re focused and trying to work hard throughout the week to put it right at the weekend. We’re professional footballers so we have to go out there and perform as best we can and try and get the results that we want. There’s a lot of things going on at the moment but we have to turn a blind eye to that and concentrate on what we are here to do.<br /><br />It’s very tight and we know that anyone can beat anyone else in this league and nothing is set in stone. It is a very unpredictable league so we have to be on our toes and up for the fight in every single game because otherwise you get punished. You can see teams that are taking points from the sides at the top so we just have to focus on ourselves now and hope to finish the season in the top four with a final at the end of the year. I think we have just been through a bit of a tough patch but hopefully we have came out of that now and we still have a lot of things to play for this season, such as the top four and the FA Cup. Hopefully we can finish off strongly and all the players are determined to achieve that</p>

It is going to be an exciting end but one that we are more than up for.<br /><br />We just stick together as a team. We know what we’re capable of doing. It is just about repeating that in every game. We played against a top-quality team with some unbelievable and we stood up to the test. We did answer that and have shown what we are all about</p>

  <p><b>[Mikel Arteta is among those in the running to succeed Arsene Wenger at Arsenal]</b> Mikel was a fantastic player for Arsenal and a great captain. He’s been under Pep Guardiola there, he was always interested even when he was playing here in going into a coaching role one day, I’m sure he’s learning a lot about the game and especially the way Man City have been playing. They’ve done fantastically well, so I’m sure that one day when the time is right, he’ll be a fantastic manager. It’s still early days in his career at the moment.<br /><br /><b>[On the importance of securing continental glory]</b> It’s a massive motivation, to put the emotional side to one side and use it to go on and win this trophy for him. It’s going to be weird next season when he’s not here but for now he is, and we have to finish the season off as strongly as possible. You’ve seen with the amount of fans that turned up on Sunday, and the noise they produced when they got right behind the team, and hopefully they can give him the send-off he deserves. We all sort of knew that one day he was always going to step down as manager, and that day has come and it was a massive shock to the team. But we have to put those emotions behind us and use it as motivation as well to finish off the season strongly, and hopefully we can lift something for him and let the other emotions come in after that when the season is finished. Then we’ll go from there</p>

That really helped us to get over the line and win convincingly in the end. I have been here for many many years, it means an awful lot to me and to the fans as well. I am glad I played my part and we can all go home happy tonight. They could have gone six points in front of us but instead we’ve gone above them. The atmosphere was electric, that really helped us over the line in the end<br /><br />I’m not sure what went on on the touchline, something was said and the two teams came together.

  <p><b>[Aaron Ramsey is preparing to bid farewell to Arsenal]</b> I’m obviously so grateful to the club for that opportunity and I also have to thank Arsene Wenger for giving me the platform to succeed, especially in those early days. In a relatively short space of time, I was able to learn so much from the boss and the world-class players that I had in the team around me. I would always watch them closely, especially our midfielders, and would try to take little bits from their games to make myself a more well-rounded player. Tomas’ burst of pace, Samir’s close control, Cesc’s one-touch passing … I was choosing what I loved from their games and trying to add them all to mine. It wasn’t just about watching, though, I knew that I could ask them for advice whenever I needed it and, while all the experienced players would help me, Cesc was the player who would always stand out in training sessions for me. He played in my position back then and the numbers of assists and goals he would get, as well as his passing ability, was just brilliant. Looking back at it now, I don’t think you realise how big an impact other people are having on your career at the time. It’s maybe one of those things you take for granted, something that you don’t need to consider because you’re flying in the first team and you only need to focus on the next game</p>

Of course, he is one of the greatest to play the game but he is just a normal man. He breaks the ice straight away and makes you feel like you are talking to anybody else. There is a family feeling about the whole club. Everybody is in it to achieve one thing: to win football matches and trophies. Everybody is driven and very focused on what they need to be doing<br /><br /><b>[He has since revealed that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">the Gunners</a> did explain their reasoning behind retracting a new deal]</b> It <b>[was explained]</b> in the end. There was a lot of confusion and a lot of things were up in the air. The decision was made and that was the situation, so I had to look at other options. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are going through a transitional period at the moment. They have many great players and a lot of talent coming through. They are definitely going in the right direction - but my situation now is at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. I have an unbelievable opportunity at a massive club. I just want to be part of this now. Hopefully I can help my team-mates and my club achieve some great things on the big stage</p>

There have been new ideas and new information, which we are working hard to try to put into practice. At times it hasn’t worked as well as we would have liked, but in other parts it really has. We are slowly getting better in terms of what he wants to implement and understanding our roles and responsibilities more. This club has been so good and so dominant for so long. We know other teams have improved and are trying to knock us off top spot. But this place is all about winning and that is what we are striving for</p>

  <p><b>[Aaron Ramsey bid an emotional goodbye to fans]</b> I have really grown up here. I am just grateful for the opportunity to play for this club for such a long time.

That doesn’t happen very often anymore, that’s why it’s so emotional and why the bond is so strong<br /><br />I just want to say thank you very much for all the fans’ support over the years, there has been a few lows but lots of highs and the bond has been so strong because I have been here for such a long time and they have been with me through thick and thin, watching me go from a boy to man</p>

  <p><b>[Ramsey has no <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> regrets and is targeting ‘many titles’ with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>]</b> I had some tough decisions to make but I felt that Arsene and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> made a big effort to get me to join them. They took me and my family to Switzerland where he was covering the Euros at the time. I met him there and his plan and his vision of developing me into the player he saw was quite exciting to take up.<br /><br />There are no regrets from my side. He has a track record of bringing through young players and turning them into great players. That was what was important for me, that I went straight into the first-team environment and was given an opportunity early on to show what I could do, even at that age. I had opportunities when I went there. I played and trained every day with the first team, so for me, it was the right decision<br /><br />The situation happened at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> then <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> came in and wanted to sign me. Again, I felt really wanted by them and they made a lot of effort to try and sign me. I am really excited to have this opportunity to play for this great club. Hopefully, I can contribute to help win many titles here.<br /><br />It’s a lot more technical as you have to try and break teams down. A lot of teams defend a lot deeper and you have to try and break the two blocks <b>[defence and midfield]</b> down. In <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> there’s a lot more space and the game is a bit more open. The intensity is a bit higher in the chasing back and forth. I’ve been very impressed by the standard and the league and the technical quality. I’m looking forward to hopefully having a successful season</p>

  <p><b>[Aaron Ramsey on <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a>]</b> He’s a fantastic player with many qualities. I think he’s great. He can score a lot of goals, he’s very good technically and his link-up play is very good. I like to play off him. He has a good understanding of the runs that I make and I try to play off him. We’ve had a few goals where we’ve combined well together</p>

  <p><b>[Ramsey praises his superstar <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> team-mate]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>’s an exceptional athlete. He’s first in the gym, he goes through his whole routine first and then he’s out onto the pitches. He’s a winner, wants to win every single game, every small-sided game, whatever it is, then he’ll be out there practising his free-kicks and things like that and shooting. You don’t need me to tell you how good or driven he is, he’s unbelievable, he’s one of the greatest in the history of the game.<br /><br /><a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, such a massive club, one of the biggest clubs in Europe and there were other clubs interested. But again, I just felt most wanted by them, with the history that they have, the players that they have. The last few years they’ve done really well in the Champions League and they’re knocking on the door so I want to try and help them play a part in trying to win that, the Champions League. They’re serial winners as well. They win trophy after trophy after trophy so that’s another thing that I wanted to achieve is to go somewhere and be competing every single season for two, three, four trophies</p>

I was just thinking I’m going to go out there, say my bit and I couldn’t control anything. It was just pouring out. I spent 11 years there, I grew up there, I left Cardiff at 17, I’ve been married, had kids and been through so much on and off the pitch. That club meant so much to me and always will</p>
