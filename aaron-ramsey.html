You can’t turn down that opportunity. I’m so excited to be here and hopefully I can be a part of a new history. There were other clubs, but this is the right club for me<br /><br />When I knew Juve were interested, I couldn’t refuse them. It’s a great club, one of the biggest. To have the opportunity to come here, play for them, is a dream to play at the top level. It’s a challenge for myself as well, to come here, experience a different way of life, different culture. I’ll take that in and embrace it. Hopefully it goes nicely over here. I know how hard it’s going to be, but I’ve prepared myself for that and I’m looking forward to the challenge<br /><br />From what I saw last season, he had a very good season for Chelsea. He got to two finals <b>[the EFL Cup and Europa League]</b>, won one of them, and finished in the top four. That’s not easy to do, so it was definitely a success. Hopefully, he can bring his philosophy to this team, winning and playing good football, that’s the ideal situation. Hopefully this will be something we can do, being really successful doing it</p>

Arsenal have completed the signing of Real Madrid midfielder Dani Ceballos on a season-long loan deal. The Spaniard will wear the No. 8 shirt for the Gunners, the squad number previously assigned to Aaron Ramsey, who left the club to join Juventus on a free transfer</p>

I am really looking forward to it. This was a very proud moment for me to put on this famous jersey. I am happy that I got a few minutes out there tonight. I have been working hard to get back fit and hopefully now I can stay fit. I am naturally quite good physically. <br /><br />I have been working hard, and I know I haven’t had the minutes on the pitch, apart from tonight, but I feel good physically. It will take a few games to get there. I think I have had a good pre-season. We have got a new coach who has given us his own ideas. We have been adapting to that. I think the team is in good shape and hopefully now we can have a very successful season. We have been working hard on certain tactics and I think he wants to do good to the team, and we have put that into practice a few times. We are feeling quite confident</p>

Of course, he is one of the greatest to play the game but he is just a normal man. He breaks the ice straight away and makes you feel like you are talking to anybody else. There is a family feeling about the whole club. Everybody is in it to achieve one thing: to win football matches and trophies. Everybody is driven and very focused on what they need to be doing<br /><br /><b>[He has since revealed that the Gunners did explain their reasoning behind retracting a new deal]</b> It <b>[was explained]</b> in the end. There was a lot of confusion and a lot of things were up in the air. The decision was made and that was the situation, so I had to look at other options. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are going through a transitional period at the moment.

  <p><b>[Ramsey has no <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> regrets and is targeting ‘many titles’ with Juventus]</b> I had some tough decisions to make but I felt that Arsene and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> made a big effort to get me to join them. They took me and my family to Switzerland where he was covering the Euros at the time. I met him there and his plan and his vision of developing me into the player he saw was quite exciting to take up.<br /><br />There are no regrets from my side. He has a track record of bringing through young players and turning them into great players. That was what was important for me, that I went straight into the first-team environment and was given an opportunity early on to show what I could do, even at that age. I had opportunities when I went there. I played and trained every day with the first team, so for me, it was the right decision<br /><br />The situation happened at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> then <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> came in and wanted to sign me. Again, I felt really wanted by them and they made a lot of effort to try and sign me. I am really excited to have this opportunity to play for this great club. Hopefully, I can contribute to help win many titles here.<br /><br />It’s a lot more technical as you have to try and break teams down. A lot of teams defend a lot deeper and you have to try and break the two blocks <b>[defence and midfield]</b> down. In <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> there’s a lot more space and the game is a bit more open. The intensity is a bit higher in the chasing back and forth. I’ve been very impressed by the standard and the league and the technical quality. I’m looking forward to hopefully having a successful season</p>

He’s first in the gym, he goes through his whole routine first and then he’s out onto the pitches. He’s a winner, wants to win every single game, every small-sided game, whatever it is, then he’ll be out there practising his free-kicks and things like that and shooting. You don’t need me to tell you how good or driven he is, he’s unbelievable, he’s one of the greatest in the history of the game.<br /><br /><a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, such a massive club, one of the biggest clubs in Europe and there were other clubs interested. But again, I just felt most wanted by them, with the history that they have, the players that they have. The last few years they’ve done really well in the Champions League and they’re knocking on the door so I want to try and help them play a part in trying to win that, the Champions League. They’re serial winners as well. They win trophy after trophy after trophy so that’s another thing that I wanted to achieve is to go somewhere and be competing every single season for two, three, four trophies</p>
