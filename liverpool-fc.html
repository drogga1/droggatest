  <dd>Dubai International Capital (DIC) pull out of a takeover bid after they try in vain to force Liverpool to come to a decision while the club’s board consider a new offer made by American tycoons George Gillett and Tom Hicks.</dd>
  <dt>2007 02 02</dt>
  <dd>American tycoons George Gillett and Tom Hicks offer £435 million for the ownership of Liverpool. This includes £215m for the building of a proposed new stadium on Stanley Park. The club’s board, led by chairman <a href="david-moores.html">David Moores</a> and chief executive <a href="rick-parry.html">Rick Parry</a>, unanimously recommend that this offer be accepted. <a href="david-moores.html">David Moores</a> sold his 51% majority shares in the club to the current owners - American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks</dd>
  <dt>2007 02 06</dt>
  <dd>The offer from George Gillett and Tom Hicks is accepted, valuing the club at £218.9m (£5,000 per share), and confirming debts of £44.8m. In their original press conference, Gillett promises work on Liverpool’s new stadium would begin immediately, saying: ‘The spade has to be in the ground within 60 days’</dd>
  <dt>2007 05</dt>
  <dd>Liverpool are beaten by <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> in the Champions League final, with Hicks promising afterwards that serious funds will be made available to manager <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafael Benitez</a> with which he can strengthen the squad. It results in the infamous soundbyte: ‘If Rafa said he wanted to buy Snoogy Doogy we would back him’</dd>
  <dt>2007 Summer</dt>
  <dd>Liverpool embark on a major spending spree, adding Spanish star <a href="fernando-torres.html">Fernando Torres</a>, as well as <a href="ryan-babel.html">Ryan Babel</a> and Yossi Benayoun. Supporters welcome Torres, a club record signing at around £20m, in particular.</dd>
  <dt>2007 11</dt>
  <dd><a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> and the owners fall out over the Spaniard’s transfer targets for January 2008. Gillett and Hicks reportedly tell <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> to ‘concentrate on training and coaching the players he already has’. <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> responds with a frosty press conference in which he repeats that phrase in answer to every question. Liverpool’s form, impressive in the early weeks of the season, begins to deteriorate.</dd>
  <dt>2008 04</dt>
  <dd>It emerges that Gillett and Hicks are barely on speaking terms, throwing the club into turmoil. <a href="rick-parry.html">Rick Parry</a>, it transpires, was present when Gillett and Hicks met with <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Klinsmann</a> the previous November, further souring his relationship with <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a>. Days later, Hicks rounds on <a href="rick-parry.html">Parry</a>, accusing the chief executive of failing in his commercial and professional duties, and advising the termination of his contract. <a href="rick-parry.html">Parry</a> would leave his role at the end of the following season.</dd>
  <dt>2008 01 14</dt>
  <dd>Hicks admits the club had made an approach to former Germany manager <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Juergen Klinsmann</a>, with a view to <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Klinsmann</a> replacing <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> as manager. The meeting took place at the height of the feud between <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> and the owners in November. Hicks says, however, that such a move was ‘an insurance policy, to have him become manager if Rafa left for Real Madrid’.</dd>
  <dt>2008 01 22</dt>
  <dd>Liverpool supporters, who have formed the supporters’ union Spirit of <a href="bill-shankly.html">Shankly</a>, protest against the Americans’ ownership before, during and after the 2-2 draw with <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>. Banners pledge their support for <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a>, as well as urging Gillett and Hicks to sell to DIC, who are rumoured to be interested.</dd>
  <dt>2009 01</dt>
  <dd><a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> is left frustrated by the club’s transfer policy, as funds are denied following the sale of striker <a href="robbie-keane.html">Robbie Keane</a>, and the club fail to act swiftly over the contract of <a href="daniel-agger.html">Daniel Agger</a>. <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> himself refuses to commit to a long-term deal until assurances are made regarding the control of the club.</dd>
  <dt>2009 06 18</dt>
  <dd>Former Liverpool Chairman <a href="david-moores.html">David Moores</a> quits Anfield Board Of Directors. <a href="david-moores.html">Moores</a> confessed that he was left heartbroken and let down by the new owners, and he follows in the footsteps of chief executive <a href="rick-parry.html">Rick Parry</a> in his decision to step down this summer after twelve years at the club.</dd>

  <dd>Liverpool fans are left incensed after Tom Hicks Jnr, a board member at Anfield, responds to an e-mail from a supporter with a foul-mouthed tirade. Hicks Jnr is forced to resign, with commercial director Ian Ayre and financial director Philip Nash added to the board.</dd>

  <dd>Reports surface suggesting a bid of £110m has been made from the Rhone Group - a New York-based private equity firm - for a 40 per cent stake in Liverpool. Gillett and Hicks fail to respond to the offer within the deadline.</dd>
  <dt>2010 04</dt>
  <dd>Gillett and Hicks announce the appointment of British Airways chairman Martin Broughton, who will oversee the formal sale of the club as soon as possible. The Americans’ statement reads: ‘Owning Liverpool Football Club over these past three years has been a rewarding and exciting experience for us and our families. Having grown the Club this far we have now decided together to look to sell the Club to owners committed to take the Club through its next level of growth and development’</dd>
  <dt>2010 05</dt>
  <dd>Sunday Telegraph reports that Dubai International Capital were close to a £500m takeover prove wide of the mark. The group that initially missed out on buying the club to Hicks and Gillett and were believed to be ready to commit funds for player transfers and for a new stadium.</dd>
  <dt>2010 08</dt>
  <dd>Chinese investor Kenny Huang announces his interest in acquiring the club. After initial claims of backing from his nation’s government and ability to buy any player <a href="roy-hodgson.html">Roy Hodgson</a> wanted, the 46-year-old officially announces his withdrawal from the race on August 21. The Huang situation was matched by the approach from businessman Yahya Kirdi. The Syrian - who headed a consortium of Middle East investors - initially claimed to be in advanced negotiations on August 4, before he announced he expected to conclude a preliminary deal before the season’s opening fixture against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> on the 15th. Again, no offer was agreed.</dd>
  <dt>2010 09</dt>
  <dd>In a bid to retain control, co-owner Tom Hicks attempts to refinance the £237m debt to the Royal Bank of Scotland. If unable to find fresh credit, the Texan could be forced to relinquish his investment on October 15. Reports emerge on September 19 that a £280m package had been agreed with private equity firm Blackstone. A large-scale campaign from Liverpool supporters follows and the company announces the following day that they had no intention of concluding a deal to leave Hicks stranded.</dd>
  <dt>2010 10</dt>
  <dd>With the date looming to repay RBS or face a £60m penalty charge, rumours emerge that a proposed deal with the New England Sports Venture (NESV) - headed by multi-millionaire Boston Red Sox owner John W. Henry - has been agreed on the 5th.</dd>

After carefully reviewing game film and integrating a detailed history - including his reported present and immediate post-contact subjective symptoms - physical examination and objective metrics, we have concluded that Mr. Karius sustained a concussion during the match May 26, 2018.<br /><br />At the time of our evaluation, Mr. Karius’s principal residual symptoms and objective signs suggested that visual spatial dysfunction existed and likely occurred immediately following the event. Additional symptomatic and objectively noted areas of dysfunction also persisted. It could be possible that such deficits would affect performance. We also note that Mr. Karius has reported significant and steady improvement since the concussive event, and we expect him to make a full recovery based on the results of the examination. We expect that with treatment and by following prescribed activity protocols he will continue to improve. We have encouraged vigilance and an emphasis on safety in his eventual return to full activity.</p>

  <p><b>[Rubie’s statement, which was shared by <a href="bobby-duncan.html">Bobby Duncan</a> on his own Twitter page]</b> There has been a lot of things said the last few weeks regarding <a href="bobby-duncan.html">Bobby Duncan</a>’s future at Liverpool. And today <b>[Wednesday]</b> is the final straw of the behaviour and dealing of Liverpool sporting director Michael Edwards. A few months ago before the end of last season, Bobby had meetings with the club’s hierarchy including academy director <a href="alex-inglethorpe.html">Alex Inglethorpe</a>. It was recognised that Bobby wasn’t happy at Liverpool for different reasons and Alex invited us to bring offers to the club for the exit of <a href="bobby-duncan.html">Bobby Duncan</a>. For a player with zero first-team experience, no clubs were prepared to pay an outright reasonable fee for a player they got for £200,000 last summer.<br /><br />With that in mind we have been able to find clubs that were ready to take Bobby on a season-long loan with a (sic) option to buy for amounts of £1.5 million upwards, which is a great return for the club on a player who will never play for the Liverpool first team and who doesn’t want to be there. The club and Michael Edwards specifically made it clear that that kind of deal wouldn’t work. So then myself and my team worked even harder and managed to get a deal on the table for a loan with an obligation to buy after five starts with a higher transfer fee than before and a sell-on to Liverpool. Putting all of that aside, the real reason Bobby missed the U23 game <b>[against <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>]</b> on Monday is because he has suffered some deep mental health issues with all the stress the club has put him under.<br /><br />Stress of being told he can leave but then going out of their way to force him to stay against his will. Not only is he on a very small salary but he also has one season left on his contract after this one and Liverpool have flatly said he will not get a new one. Bobby has not left his room for four days because of this and will never go back to Liverpool again and my only concern now is his mental health and well being. The Liverpool hierarchy have shown zero consideration to that and have even gone as far as saying in writing that they will punish him and make him stay at the club until January and beyond to teach him a lesson. This is not really dignified behaviour from a club with the rich history of Liverpool and one who one of their greatest ever players <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> happens to be Bobby’s cousin. It’s a sad state of affairs that a club such as a Liverpool can be allowed to get away with mentally bullying and destroying the life of a young man such as Bobby.<br /><br />I know one thing for sure, and that is he is never going back there again and he’s on such a small salary that no amount of fines will even make a difference. In this situation all that matters is the player’s health and in this case Michael Edwards has totally ignored that because of his own stubbornness and I really pray that his experience doesn’t happen to any young players again</p>

The player was always contracted to Liverpool FC during this period, and the reason he was not eligible was because the club did not have the relevant international clearance following expiry of an earlier loan agreement. The club’s breach was in part due to the challenges it encountered with securing the correct international clearance, and its subsequent ability to include the player on teamsheets despite the lack of clearance.
