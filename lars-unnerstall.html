<blockquote>
  <p>[VVV-Venlo goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall is hoping he one day gets the chance to ply his trade in the Premier League] I did not play at Düsseldorf so my plan was to go to a club where I could play all the time and play my way into the focus of other clubs. I don’t know what will happen in summer. My first goal is to stay in the league with Venlo. After this we will speak about next season. For sure I will speak with Venlo because I feel comfortable here. But I have to admit that it was my plan to play every game to be in the focus and make another step after this.<br /><br />With my transfer to the Netherlands I may have done a step back in my career. I did it this because I wanted to play as much as possible. I wanted to prove myself. Nevertheless, I can imagine to stay in the Netherlands. If not in Venlo - maybe somewhere else. It would be a dream to play in the Premier League. Even the Championship is very attractive for me because I like the way they play. It’s full of great clubs with a long history<br /><br />[on Raul Gonzalez] It was unbelievable to play with Raul. When he spoke about all the big games he played I loved to listen to his stories. It was a thrilling time with him and everybody respected him a lot. But no one need to be afraid. He is very nice and friendly to everybody. He is a great person.</p>
