  <p><b>[<a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a>’s <a href="ariel-ibagaza.html">Ariel Ibagaza</a> Would Be Happy To Play With Inter]</b> Inter? How nice!

I think he would be very happy to play in Italy, but, I repeat, I am surprised at the news</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid defender <a href="achraf-hakimi.html">Achraf Hakimi</a> would be privileged to play for <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> in the Italian Serie A]</b> The truth is that the <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> sporting director is a man who follows all the best European players, but I’ve never talked to him about Achraf. I have to talk to the club as <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>’s departure took everyone aback somewhat. Achraf joined Real at a very young age and has a long contract with them. However, we think the lad has to leave Real so he can play regularly and grow, but I don’t know if Real agree. Playing for <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> would be a privilege for him because they have an incredible fan base. I haven’t heard from them, but it would be wonderful if <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a> asked for him. All <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s players speak very highly about the new <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> coach</p>
