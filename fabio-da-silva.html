  <p>[Team-mate Fabio da Silva revealed the following year that the crash happened the first time Cristiano Ronaldo was behind the wheel of his new £200,000 car. He had registered the car just two days before hitting the wall of a tunnel near Manchester Airport. The car was later sold online for €30,000] Cristiano had mentioned that he was going to take the car out of the garage, as he had bought it a few days ago, but had not driven it. That is when the accident happened. Everything is all right, but we were scared</p>

  <p>[Former Manchester United full-back Fabio da Silva has praised Cristiano Ronaldo for helping him and brother Rafael settle in at Old Trafford] Some people were incredibly kind to us, like Darren Fletcher. He helped us a lot and we’re still friends. Rio Ferdinand and Cristiano, who spoke Portuguese, were also a big help - we didn’t know a single word of English. I’ve heard Cristiano called selfish, but he gave us non-stop advice both on and off the pitch. When I made my debut against Tottenham, I played alongside him. Cristiano told me not to take any risks in our half because he might not be able to get back to help me. Then he said, ‘When you get into the opponents’ half, you can do whatever you like’. With Cristiano supporting me, I felt so positive.<br /><br />Anderson was another great friend. Cristiano and Fletch were older and more serious, Anderson was my age. We’d go to a Brazilian restaurant with Anderson and he offered to teach us English for free, which was nice of him, but his own English was not the best! He did teach us lots of swear words in English though! Everyone loved Anderson, he has the biggest heart. Even now, we have a group chat of former players and Anderson is in there, still writing in English and still using words that only he understands</p>
