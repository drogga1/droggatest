  <p><b>[Mido talks about Fasting]</b> In England I was fasting in all Ramadan days except the matchdays, but before I did that I asked religious advisors if i can do that or it’s prohibited. They approved it but told me that I have to compensate these days after Ramadan in free days<br /><br />Fasting didn’t affect my performance in the training, but because of the high level of the matches I couldn’t fast</p>

I was very surprised that he didn’t talk to me much, normally you get a player for lunch you try to talk to him, convince him to sign for the club, but he didn’t talk much he was just very quiet<br /><br /><b>[And the awkward exchange in a Sunderland branch of the Italian chain restaurant made up Mido’s mind]</b> I knew straight away that me and him could not work together, we would end up fighting. He was talking to me and looking at the ceiling. I knew straight away that me and him, it would never work</p>

  <p><b>[Salah backed to become Premier League centurion after breaking Mido goal record]</b> I felt proud after Salah reached my number of goals, and I think he can reach 100 goals easily. Salah is on top form, he is strong and fast I’m sure he will score more goals and break more records in the English Premier League. Now he is playing with a very big side, and I want him to focus more and more with the Reds so that he can make history</p>

  <p><b>[Mido hails Liverpool star as Egypt’s greatest ever]</b> Real Madrid want him, and we have all seen the poor performances of Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema with the 4-4-2. I was afraid that Salah might fail at Liverpool, but I think he is ready to jump to the next level. Real Madrid would be able to use his strengths.<br /><br />Salah’s mentality is much better than mine. When I was young I did not get any advice, and this would come to hurt me later on. We could see how strong he was mentally with the way he handled himself when he didn’t play at Chelsea</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah has been advised by Mido to leave Liverpool on the back of his PFA Player of the Year award-winning exploits]</b> With all due respect to Liverpool and his fans, Salah should immediately accept any offer from Real Madrid or Barcelona. He has been amazing with Liverpool the entire season, and could be very useful in La Liga especially with Real Madrid who are suffering from Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema’s horrible form this season. With his quality and pace, it should be easy for him to make it in La Liga. I’ve been there for a while, and I can say that the likes of Salah have a huge chance to succeed alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and the stars of Real Madrid.</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah’s development at Liverpool has been a miracle]</b> He’s the kind of guy who says: ‘Come on, even if I have the whole nation on my shoulders, I don’t mind that’. He’s a great guy and I think the way he developed as a person, comparing Salah of Chelsea and Salah of Liverpool, is a miracle. I saw him at Chelsea and he was a shy boy. I even said on TV that if he keeps that character, unfortunately he will never be a big player, but that his quality can make it to the top. Three years ago when Liverpool wanted to sign Salah and he went to Chelsea, I went on Twitter and said: ‘Salah is 10 times better than <b>[Raheem]</b> Sterling’, and people laughed at me. Sterling is a very good player, he’s developed so much under <b>[Pep]</b> Guardiola, but Salah is unbelievable, one of the very few players that if it’s his day, there’s no way to stop him.</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah wants to stay at Liverpool for as long as he can]</b> I’ve spoken to people around him, he’s very happy and he wants to stay at Liverpool as long as he can. He’s established himself at Liverpool and I think he will want to stay at Liverpool for another three or four years.<br /><br /><b>[On the links to Real Madrid]</b> Why would he want to leave? Real Madrid are massive but Liverpool are not a small club. To be there and feel loved by the fans, that’s what every player dreams of<br /><br /><b>[Back in April, Mido claimed that Salah was ready to link up with Real]</b> I was afraid that Salah might fail at Liverpool, but I think he is ready to jump to the next level. Real Madrid would be able to use his strengths</p>

  <p><b>[Mido on <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and Egypt forward <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a>]</b> I think <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> is the greatest Egyptian player. If I judge all players, we had so many great players in the Egyptian history, we’ve had fantastic players who have done great for the country and for their own clubs back in Egypt as well. But football is in Europe. If a player can play at the top for ten, 12 years in Europe, I think he should be considered the best player in Egyptian history</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale can rekindle his passion for football]</b> I hope that’s not true. I’ve always known Gareth as a top professional, he gave everything for Tottenham and gave everything for Real Madrid and I believe he deserves more respect. Honestly, I would love to see him back at Tottenham. I remember his first day at Tottenham, I was there and I remember him being shown around the training ground with his mum and dad as a young boy. I believe if he goes back to Tottenham he will get his desire back. I think Gareth is one of those players who needs to feel loved to play well, and at Tottenham everyone loves him. The news that’s coming out now is really bad because you can see there’s something against him at Madrid and he deserves more respect.<br /><br />Go back to Tottenham. Come back and play at Tottenham for three or four years. He’s got so much money, I’m sure he’ll be well off enough now to have a happy life with his family. He needs to feel loved and people love him at Tottenham. If he goes back he will be one of the best players in the Premier League again</p>
