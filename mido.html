  <p><b>[Mido talks about Fasting]</b> In England I was fasting in all Ramadan days except the matchdays, but before I did that I asked religious advisors if i can do that or it’s prohibited. They approved it but told me that I have to compensate these days after Ramadan in free days<br /><br />Fasting didn’t affect my performance in the training, but because of the high level of the matches I couldn’t fast</p>

  <p><b>[Mido on <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and Egypt forward <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a>]</b> I think <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> is the greatest Egyptian player. If I judge all players, we had so many great players in the Egyptian history, we’ve had fantastic players who have done great for the country and for their own clubs back in Egypt as well. But football is in Europe. If a player can play at the top for ten, 12 years in Europe, I think he should be considered the best player in Egyptian history</p>

  <p><b>[Mido reveals awkward meeting with <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> in Pizza Express in the summer of 2007, convinced him not to join manager at Sunderland]</b> I never worked with <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> but he took me for lunch, he wanted to convince me to come and sign for Sunderland, just before I signed for Middlesbrough, I was at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a><br /><br />So my agent, <a href="mino-raiola.html">Mino Raiola</a>, the agent of <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>, <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> and <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Mario Balotelli</a>, my agent for 10 years, he said ‘Mido, <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> wants to have lunch with you’<br /><br />So I went to <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> Airport, he came to pick me up with his Range Rover, we went to Sunderland, he took me to lunch at Pizza Express! I was very surprised that he didn’t talk to me much, normally you get a player for lunch you try to talk to him, convince him to sign for the club, but he didn’t talk much he was just very quiet<br /><br /><b>[And the awkward exchange in a Sunderland branch of the Italian chain restaurant made up Mido’s mind]</b> I knew straight away that me and him could not work together, we would end up fighting. He was talking to me and looking at the ceiling. I knew straight away that me and him, it would never work</p>
