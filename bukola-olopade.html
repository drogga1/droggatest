<blockquote>
  <p>[NFF directs NNL to hold playoffs to determine promoted clubs] Nigeria is a country blessed with so many capable hands, despite that, you picked me with the belief that I had the capacity to do a decent job and for that I am grateful. These past few days have thrown up a different kind of challenge to our football, in particular, the promotion of eight teams from the NNL to the NPFL.<br /><br />And in all of these, my stand has been based on the principle of common sense. I am sure you have read from a few social media for my strong opinion on this matter, but importantly, is the fact that I had told you of my intention to leave if the decision of the NNL Congress is not respected and all stakeholders sit down to seek solution to a situation that all caused especially the LMC.<br /><br />I woke up this morning of 8th December 2018 by a call from the NNL’s Chief Operating Officer [Lawrence Katken] confirming to me that the NFF has gone ahead to direct that there must be a playoff to promote only four teams. Mr President, I respect the decision of the highest body in football but I now humbly inform you first through this medium and subsequently through an official letter of my resignation from the position of the CEO of the NNL.<br /><br />Mt President, I once more thank you for the opportunity and also want to emphasize here that I have been very proud of your good work with football not only in Nigeria but in Africa and beyond, that feeling of pride for your excellent statesmanship in football remains with me as I wish you more fruitful years in your stewardship of football in Nigeria and the world at large</p>
