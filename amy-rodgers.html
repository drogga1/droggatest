  <p><b>[Liverpool midfielder Amy Rodgers may have grown up a Celtic fan, but her experiences following <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s side to Champions League glory mean she couldn’t be more excited to play at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> on Sunday]</b> It was the best experience ever. I’ll remember that for the rest of my life. I think it makes you realise how much it means to all the fans. You’re in the middle of them and going through Madrid all we could see was <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> shirts everywhere. It was sort of like a community as well. Although you were there with hundreds of thousands of strangers, you felt safe because everyone is there in a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> shirt. It was so special to see that side of it. I’ve never been a die-hard <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fan, but since I’ve been here, I’ve sort of fell in love with the club a bit. Going to watch the men’s games, it’s just an amazing atmosphere and it is so exciting. It is like a dream <b>[to be playing at Anfield]</b>. I just can’t wait<br /><br /><b>[The Merseyside derby takes on a different meaning for Rodgers, who spent a lot of her time as a youngster with Everton]</b> At first it was very weird, especially when I was in the development squad because it was all my team-mates and I played for them for like four years. Elise Hughes, who I played with in the youth teams, is still there and there’s a couple still in the development squad as well that I’ll run into. It is still weird. But if you’ve played with <b>[your opponent]</b> in the past, you want to be beat them because you don’t want them having those bragging rights over you<br /><br /><b>[Those aren’t the only bragging rights that will be up for grabs on Sunday]</b> Derbies are great. The atmosphere on the pitch and off the pitch as well, it’s what you play football for really. The fans contribute a lot to that because it means so much to the fans, but it means so much to us as well. The challenges are always harder, it means so much more to the players, it definitely always feels like that<br /><br /><b>[But the midfielder is fully behind her manager and believes the team can turn things around]</b> <a href="vicky-jepson.html">Vicky Jepson</a>’s great. When she <b>[was appointed]</b>, it was like the ideal situation for me really because she’d known me for a while and was the person who actually got me in the first place from <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. It is great having her because she does put that trust in young players and gives you the chance to get on the pitch and do your thing. I think we have been quite unlucky <b>[this season]</b> – the results have been very tight. There’s not a big problem. It’s just the little things that I think, if we could fix, we’d be able to change it and hopefully we can fix that at the weekend. It’s a massive game. Not only is it a Merseyside derby at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, but we haven’t had the best start. If we can get a win, and hopefully we win, then this could be a turning point <b>[for us]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Good fortune is something that has evaded the Reds]</b> I think we have been quite unlucky. The results have been very tight. It’s sort of like the little margins that we’ve just missed out on. It’s obviously just us finishing our chances we’ve created. It is really little margins, nothing massive. There’s not a big problem. <br /><br /><b>[That’s a view shared away from Merseyside, too]</b> I have been saying this for the last three or four weeks: They have got a very good squad, a very, very good squad. I don’t like commenting on other teams and so on, but it is very surprising. I think they will pick up points and they will get themselves out of that position</p>
