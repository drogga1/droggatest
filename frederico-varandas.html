I’m sure you don’t believe every single player that we’ve been linked with, but I think that Manchester United sometimes have, because of the wealth, maybe we have had to pay more, a bigger premium to get players in, and that’s just the world we live in. And we’ve taken our time, we’re not going to overpay, but we have to get the right people in, the right players</p>

  <p><b>[Sporting president Frederico Varandas has revealed the details of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s failed bid to sign <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> in the summer transfer window]</b> Offloading players who took up 25 per cent of our budget was extremely important. We lost only one undisputed starter and kept what is, for me, the best midfielder in Europe. It wasn’t easy because they were being paid far above market value and it’s a complicated process. Whoever is at the helm of Sporting has to be strict and responsible and should never add to expenses without first ‘cleaning house’. We have managed to hold on to our highest-value player, <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a>, and have been able to provide balance and better solutions. We think this group is more competitive and has more quality than last season. It was ‘impossible’ to retain <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a>, but we did it. We prepared for his sale by putting a fair price on him, and we had bids, but the only serious offer was from <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and that was €45 million (£40m/$50m) plus another €20m (£18m/$22m) in bonuses for winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and the Champions League.<br /><br />Those are difficult objectives, so we chose not to accept. <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> proved to be not only a great player but a great professional and captain. The dignity and responsibility that he has always shown is exemplary. The day I turned down <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s proposal, I came to the training ground and spoke to him. I told him why I declined the offer and why he would stay here beyond the end of the market and he understood perfectly. In addition, he also understood that the bid they offered us was not fair. He’s not leaving, he’s a Sporting player. Many European clubs want him and we know this is something we will always have to deal with<br /><br /><b>[Another player whose name was mentioned several times across the summer was winger Raphinha, who eventually moved to Rennes in <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a>, but Varandas was always confident that he would hang onto one of the two sought-after stars]</b> Were we going to sell Raphinha early in the market knowing that <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> or <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> could give us €70m for <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a>? Were we in danger of losing both? No, because we could not say no to a proposal of €70m. We held on until last Wednesday and in Monaco, during the Europa League draw, we realised he was not going to be sold. So we retained <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> and moved on to another plan, which was to sell Raphinha and lose only one starter for €21m.</p>

  <p><b>[While his senior career didn’t last long at Sporting, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> has left a lasting legacy at the club with Frederico Varandas confirming they are considering renaming Estadio Jose Alvalade after him]</b> It is an idea that we do not put aside and one of which we would obviously be very proud of. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is - and always will be - one of the greatest symbols of our club’s history. We are proud to be associated with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and that the name of the best footballer in the world is combined with Sporting. As far as our young people are concerned, we are trying to keep his example inside the academy</p>

  <p><b>[Sporting CP president Frederico Varandas says it is really stupid that football players are being tested for Covid-19 more frequently than medical workers]</b> Footballers are tested more than doctors working in hospitals. For me that’s really stupid, it’s political. I understand it politically, but scientifically this is ridiculous. Football in Portugal is crazy, it’s like a religion, it’s sick<br /><br />Now sometimes I go to bed and imagine what would happen if we tried to sell <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> now - what would the price be? 15, 10?. I don’t know what the value of a footballer is now. Sporting, Porto, <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a>, all the clubs in Portugal, we have to sell players<br /><br />I continued controlling things because football stopped, but the club continued. It was not easy at all that first month and a half trying to cope with the hospital work and football. Sports had stopped in Portugal and I thought that I am more important to the country working as a doctor</p>
