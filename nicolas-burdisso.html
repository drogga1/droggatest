  <p><b>[<a href="daniele-de-rossi.html">Daniele De Rossi</a> has expressed an interest in linking up with Boca Juniors following his departure from Roma]</b> The fact that many players want to come here fills me with pride, many important players are interested in playing in Boca Juniors, but desire is one thing, reality is something else. Daniele’s situation is different. He is a friend and I talk to him every day. He has always shown his willingness to come here. I talked to him until a few days ago, then I left him alone because he had his farewell game. I told him we would like to have it with us and we’ll talk again these days</p>

  <p><b>[Boca Juniors sporting director Nicolas Burdisso is hopeful of bringing <a href="daniele-de-rossi.html">Daniele De Rossi</a> to Argentina]</b> A lot has been said about <a href="daniele-de-rossi.html">De Rossi</a>. I know him and he opened the doors to coming here. He would be the cherry on top of the cake. I think Daniele could play for Boca. I know him as I was with him for five years. He values the team highly and watches all our games. Here there are things that China and MLS do not have, such as the passion of the people.</p>

  <p><b>[One of the overriding factors that led to <a href="daniele-de-rossi.html">Daniele De Rossi</a>’s free transfer was the role played by former AS Roma defender and current Boca sporting director Nicolas Burdisso]</b> He is a friend and I talk to him every day. He has always shown his willingness to come here</p>

It is lovely to hear him talk about the club with such affection, but he’s just moved to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and signing him now is impossible. It is one of those cases where the player has to make the first move. We will wait for the right moment</p>
