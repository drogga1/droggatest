I had to have a talk about it with the family obviously but it is a great opportunity,<br /><br /><b>[On December 3, he signed a three-year contract extension with the club]</b> I’ve never hidden that I enjoy being here and am pleased to continue developing the team.

  <p><b>[Manchester United interim boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has urged his players to express themselves]</b> We’ve got a great set-up, with all the analysts. When I came in this morning they were watching Cardiff. Of course I’ve watched the Premier League, I’ve seen all the teams so I’ve got a little bit of a view on them. But it’s not about the opposition it’s about us, it’s about Man Utd, it’s about our players knowing what they can do, seeing them express themselves. So my main focus will be on us, how we want the team play and then will give a few details on the opposition<br /><br />It feels like coming home. It’s been a few whirlwind days, very hectic, but great to see everyone again. It’s six months and I’m going to enjoy the ride. I’m back home and it’s about seeing the players, seeing the staff, and of course just being myself. I know the club is now running a process to find the next manager so I’m going to just be myself in the meantime with Mick <b>[Phelan]</b> of course, and Kieran <b>[McKenna]</b> and Michael <b>[Carrick]</b> and the rest of the staff. We will get the players enjoying their football and looking forward to seeing the supporters again<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was that it’s a family club. Everyone is so tight-knit. And then I noticed the winning mentality. Attacking football, giving youth a chance and winning. It’s the biggest club in the world, best supporters in the world, best players in the world</p>

Maybe I’ll have to do some finishing training to keep him in check!<br /><br /><b>[Solskjaer worked with Lingard in Manchester United’s reserves]</b> I gave him <b>[Lingard]</b> his debut in the reserves away at Burnley. Within two minutes that little tiny kid goes in for a 50/50 with a massive centre back and the little kid absolutely clattered him. I thought you have a chance.

  <p><b>[Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has insisted that he will not be afraid to lay down the law to his Manchester United players]</b> We’re all different in how we manage people, and <b>[Sir Alex]</b> was different to every individual. Maybe I should get the hairdryer out of my pocket, because I’ve got a hairdryer! When my hair needs lifting I use it on myself, but I’m also not afraid of laying down the law. You treat players similar to how you treat your kids really because you want the best for them, you want to guide them, you want to help them, but if I get disappointed … ask <b>[my kids]</b> or some of the players I’ve had in Molde … You have to tell them the standards we’ve got.<br /><br />I’m not sure that the power has gone to the dressing room. Football’s evolving of course, and the gaffer <b>[Ferguson]</b> was in charge of more or less the whole club. Football is developing, the structure of the club has developed, but the power is with the manager… He picks the team, he picks the tactics, the strategy, the philosophy is in these walls. So that legacy is more important than any player power, because I have to say being a part of Man United and being a Man United player is a privilege. And I think all of them want to succeed here<br /><br /><b>[On Paul Pogba]</b> We’ve spoken about what we expect, what standards we have on and off the pitch. You prepare for every game, I trust the lads to know what they’re doing to help the team. Everything we do is to help the team. I’m not into this social media, my kids are! I am that old that I’m not on Twitter and Facebook - maybe Facebook’s old now! - but it’s just common sense for me that I’ve spoken to him about that. We can move this forward, and we have one target: that we succeed. And we do that as a team. He’s a World Cup winner, Paul’s a terrific lad. When I had him as a kid as well, he was always the happy-go-lucky lad and he’s not changed personality-wise. He’s a better player, and of course he’s one I want to get the best out of. You have so many quality players that I want to try to get the best out of and he’s no different to anybody else</p>

It’s down to man-management. I had the best manager as a player and as a coach to learn how he dealt with people. It’s about communication. Of course, I’ll sit down and speak to the ones who are not playing, what I expect from them.

He’s been my mentor but I didn’t understand early on he’d be my mentor. Towards the last, maybe the injury in 2003, I was making all the notes what he did in certain situations and I’ve already been in touch with him, there’s no one to get better advice from<br /><br />When you get a job like this and you sign for six months, you say: ‘I’m happy to help out.’ My job now is to do as well as I can and move the club forward as well as I can. I understand that there are so many managers that would love to be at this club. I am one of them. Staying longer is not something that we have talked about. 	They are going to do their process for the next six months<br /><br />I’ve been here as a player, 11 years, coach three and a half years, the best part of 15 years of my life - it’s a third of my life.

I have seen more or less every game from Norway when I’ve had time. I have to get to know the players, and see what I can help them improve on. The club has their recruitment and scouting so I’m sure they’ve got their targets.<br /><br /><b>[Solskjaer’s tenure begins on Saturday against Cardiff City - a team he managed during the 2013-14 campaign]</b> I’m getting old, my grey hairs are coming, I’ve had about 300-400 games as a first-team manager now. That period in Cardiff was of course a huge step for me. I’ve learnt a lot, I’ve evaluated, I’ve reflected on it. I made a few mistakes, but if you don’t make mistakes you’re not going to learn and unfortunately I made a few of them. But then again they’re in the Premier League now so I don’t think they’re too unhappy about it now</p>

I’m looking forward to seeing them.<br /><br /><b>[Solskjaer explained that his first-team selection would be heavily influenced by coaches Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna]</b> Of course, it’s Michael <b>[Carrick]</b> and Kieran <b>[McKenna]</b> who have been here for the whole season. They’ve had their say and input, but there are so many games in the next 10, 15 days, so it’s about picking a team that you think is going to get results. We need results but, then again, every player needs to know that they’re probably going to get their chance in this period, because that’s just the nature of the game over here in England, that we have to rotate. Kieran and Michael have been great, I have to say. It’s great being back home and seeing the development already, because I played with Michael, how good a coach and man-manager he is already, so it’s been really helpful. The job now is to get to know the players, observe them, see the qualities that we’ve got. Of course, I’ve seen more or less every game from Norway when I’ve had time from the other job <b>[as Molde boss]</b>.

No matter what team you’re coaching, and what players you’re coaching, they all want to have a picture of how you want to play but these are quality, quality players, so it will be easier to get these players expressing themselves. Good players are easier to coach than bad players. We play at Man United, and you play without fear, you play with courage, you go out and express yourselves, take risks. The last game <b>[Sir Alex]</b> had was the 5-5 game at West Brom.

He told me to make them play football, enjoy themselves and be Manchester United.<br /><br />We had a session yesterday about patterns of play and we wanted Ashley Young and Luke Shaw to push on more. It worked out well today. Your work-rate is the easiest thing to work on. It is free. It is the attitude and application of the boys. If we approach all the games like this - and we want them to approach them all like this - with combination play and playing the ball forward then I’ll be happy.

They are the best fans in the world. I had such a great relationship with them. It was probably more emotional for my family in my box as I was focussed on the game. I was surprisingly calm all day. The lads have helped me settle in really quickly.<br /><br />You need momentum. The next two games will be massive for us. Coming into those games with confidence is great. This is Manchester United.

  <p><b>[Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has revealed his blueprint for bringing the best out of Marcus Rashford]</b> What we can do with him is use him more, because I don’t think the team is used to his runs. If you just watch him, the amount of runs and the good runs he makes in second half when we’re 2-0 up and 3-0 up and he makes runs in behind and he gets in behind the defence. We must look for his runs earlier. His speed is his strength. I’m going to work with him on his finishing. He’s just got to calm down a little bit. He’s got a great strike from outside the box and inside the box we’ll just keep on working on being cool and calm and pass it past the keeper.<br /><br />My philosophy is you’ve got to have width. So today you’ve got Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard wide, but they’re more comfortable coming in, then the full-backs need to go. It’s different when you’ve got <b>[Anthony]</b> Martial or you’ve got <b>[Marcus]</b> Rashford wide, someone who likes to play one-against-one. So it depends. But yes I’d like my full-backs to come, that’s more and more in, for me, in modern football, it’s important in modern football to get the full-backs flying on</p>

  <p><b>[Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says Manchester United are looking to build a team around midfielder Paul Pogba]</b> I think Paul’s a top, top player. He’s one of the best top players in the world. Attacking wise he’s done really and but he’s a big lad - can win headers, tackles. He’s been the same as the others. The attitude has been perfect and that’s key - you should be tired towards the end of every single game. He’s been top class and we’re looking to build a team around him of course, but there are so many quality players <b>[in this squad]</b>..<br /><br />I cannot do anything for their performances on the pitch. Paul has done it, my chats with Anthony, Romelu, Alexis… I’m here to keep them on the right path and it’s up to them to do it on the pitch. It’s up to them when they get a chance. That’s the name of the game as a footballer, you’ve got to do it yourself. I gave some guidelines of course on expression, freedom of expression, but that’s how I’ve always been as a manager. You can’t tell what the players to do in this position and this position. They are here for a reason. It’s up to them to use their imagination and creativity and just enjoy playing for this club. That’s the best time of your life, but it’s not a bad time to be manager for a while!</p>

For me, I would hope I can help or guide these players to maybe tip them over to thinking they want to stay at this club.<br /><br />I had loads of offers and possibilities to move but the manager sat me down and told me I was going to be an important part of his team, his squad and I was going to play enough games. I felt privileged to play here. I am also stubborn. The club agreed to sell me to Spurs one time and I said ‘no, thank you.’ My agent wanted me to go, but I knew I was at the best place</p>

  <p><b>[Solskjaer wants Man Utd players to ‘dominate games’]</b> I’ve been here for 15 years before and of course my football philosophy is driven by what I experienced here. We do go and attack teams, try to dominate games and go into every game believing that we’re going to win, although we respect the opposition of course. It’s not like we used to win 5-4 every time with the boss <b>[Alex Ferguson]</b>. When we had Jaap <b>[Stam]</b>, Ronny <b>[Johnsen]</b>, Rio <b>[Ferdinand]</b> and Vida <b>[Nemanja Vidic]</b> at the back, you knew that we could keep a clean sheet, so there is a fine balance there. And I love seeing players express themselves. It probably comes down to that I experienced more in my football career than I ever believed, so I want other players to have the same feeling when they’ve finished their careers - that means we need to win.<br /><br />Tactics is one side of it but we haven’t changed many of the tactics. We’ve just asked them to go out and express themselves because we need to see what they’re capable of as well for when we get to the bigger games. Tactically, we’ll get time to work more, we get weeks now in January to work on the other side of it because it’s all been about us in the first couple of games</p>

  <p><b>[Anthony Martial can mirror Cristiano Ronaldo’s impact at Manchester United]</b> Cristiano was the best, the way he’s changed to now. That’s up to any player if you make a decision on how to develop your own career. You’ve got to model yourself on someone and you’ve got to have more challenges ahead. I spoke <b>[to him]</b> about my experience at this club what he can achieve. You talk about Cristiano’s career, what he’s made, how he’s got there and all the fantastic players we’ve got. Anthony wants to be a part of this, and the club have got a top player there. I know how much this club can give to your career and I think by being honest with him it’s the best place to be. I made my career and it was easy to sell the club to Anthony, but he knows what we’re capable of. He’s a fantastic finisher with great ability. He’s young, he’s intelligent, he knows his football. I’d like him to do a couple more runs in behind, but I’ve not seen many players with the quick feet and the skills in the last third as he has. So we’re going to build his career and hopefully he’ll grab the chance with both feet.<br /><br />He <b>[Martial]</b> has the capability. ‘I’d like him to make a few more runs in behind because he doesn’t miss chances, he’s a fantastic finisher. He doesn’t miss chances but he needs to get more chances. You’ve got to sniff some scruffy goals at times. He and Marcus score loads of worldies but those tap-ins that I used to score make all the difference. Anthony’s preferred position would probably be number nine. Most of them want to play through the middle. We want them to rotate, interchange, you’ve got to get into the box to score. They can have healthy competition but they can also create a relationship and get an understanding of each other because both are very good coming in off the left. When they play central they go in and out so in the coming years we’ll see loads of combinations<br /><br />It’s a confirmation that we are happy with him and we believe in him he’s got fantastic potential. He’s had ups and downs. He’s been top scorer but he’s been developing. As a young lad moving abroad it’s not easy, but he knows he’s going to stay here for the coming future and I believe in him. The club is working on a few players. I don’t know how far <b>[it has got]</b> but it’s a statement from the club we want to keep our best players. I hope so.</p>

I have got to know the players, what potential they have, how far away they are from reaching that potential, and who we can build a team on. So of course I put my views into the club.

I wasn’t ready for that fight. I didn’t say I wasn’t ready for the Premier League. That’s different. My belief is to trust players and to trust them to play the right way.

I should have flipped that mentality into a different one at a team that struggles against relegation if you know what I mean<br /><br />It is easier here because I know what the DNA and identity of Manchester United is and what a Manchester United player is.

I have a picture of how I think this Man United team will look in a couple of years. I don’t know if it is with me, but I always put my views across to Ed Woodward and the ones in the club. I’ve supported Man United and I’ve followed Man United for many, many years since I’ve gone back home. And I did have a clear view on what I thought my opinion would be, you get a different view on some of the players - he’s impressed me, he’s got some way to go - but we’re not too far away from when I came.<br /><br />You take one step at a time and that’s one of the goals we’ve set ourselves. That we move into that top four and, if we do so, we want to stay there and improve on that. Of course, it has been fantastic over the last two months now with the points we’ve got, so consistency now is a key word, that we keep on improving, keep on winning games, but winning games in a better way than say the Leicester one. I felt we hung on. I felt that it was one of them, it was good enough, but we shouldn’t just be happy with just <b>[being]</b> good enough. We want to improve and games like this, Fulham now coming up, is a character revealer really. It reveals if we have the focus on what’s important, which is always the next game in football. And can we forget about PSG and all the games coming up? Because now the focus around the place has been, and in the media, about the PSG game for a long time. Chelsea, Liverpool too.

I think our players know what it means for everyone at Man United.<br /><br />I played a few of these myself and know the magnitude of it for the fans everyone who works here, the staff there have been making many comments that this is the big one and it’s our job to be focusing and channelling all that energy into performance mode when we start the game on Sunday. It’s not about emotions, I understand emotion can be brought into it but we have to stay focused and controlled with some fight in us as well. We know we’re in for a very tough game, Liverpool have been fantastic and will know as well to come to Old Trafford it should be a different one, they pay us respect and we’ll pay them respect. For them, it’s a big game, we want to be in the top four and we’re playing Liverpool, we know how big that game is for Manchester United, the staff, supporter. We’re just looking forward to another challenge for this team, we want to build this team to be worthy of Manchester United’s history and it’s another step. Tottenham, Arsenal, Chelsea away, it was fantastic to win those three</p>

  <p><b>[Ole Gunnar Solskjaer considers Paul Pogba to be unique within world football]</b> There’s different types of midfielders but in his mould there’s no one near with his physical presence, great close technique, diving header against Chelsea, did the same vs Bournemouth, but he can also spray passes. I don’t think that’s his best position but he can do that as well.<br /><br />I was asked wasn’t I and I’ve been quoted so many times on if you build your team around Paul Pogba. I said a couple of years back, he’s a top, top player I’ve always liked, a World Cup winner, a leader in the dressing room, wants the ball all the time. My idea was to get him playing to the best of his abilities as an attacking midfielder. PSG man marked him, other teams will, I don’t know if Liverpool will. If Liverpool do then he will have experienced that, that was what stopped Paul and created space for others</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba’s apparent decrease in social media use]</b> Paul has always been a larger-than-life character. He has a fantastic family, but you don’t do yourself any favours. You don’t want to give anyone an excuse really so, of course, you don’t go to the Brit awards this week. We know leading up to the other game against Liverpool there were stories about players not being focused. It is not about that. We know they are focused, we know they are doing their best, but he does help himself by toning it down a bit and that is just Paul being Paul.<br /><br />Knowing him he wants to win, he wants to be the best. You would be surprised by the number of minutes he’s played. Apart from David <b>[de Gea]</b> and maybe Nemanja <b>[Matic]</b> he has played the most minutes for us in the league. There was a perception that Jose left him out all the time. Maybe he does not have the energy to do it. Who knows?<br /><br />He is a leader in training, he is a leader in the dressing room. Players are allowed to be themselves. He spends a lot of energy being a leader on and off the pitch. If you want the nice car, different haircut. I can’t do anything about my grey hair, but it is not a problem that have whatever haircut you want. It has never been a problem with Paul. I remember when he was 16 he wanted to feel good. If you feel good you will play well</p>

Rashford’s goals are sometimes worldies and he does have a sensational strike but you saw the improvement and maturity and change in Cristiano <b>[Ronaldo’s]</b> goals from young to now and that’s what Rashy has to improve as well. Stay in the box, maybe not get away from the centre-backs so much, just get those five or 10 extra goals. He’s been told that</p>

  <p><b>[Solskjaer slams penalty call after Arsenal loss]</b> We started slowly, maybe a backlash from Wednesday night, but we created chances and when they get the first goal it becomes a different game. We created so many more chances today than when we beat them in the FA Cup. Sometimes it happens, we hit the woodwork twice and had five very big chances ourselves. The referee will be disappointed when he sees it as I don’t think it is a penalty. We just had to go for it towards the end, but we were not really at it and it is one of those days where you have to dust yourselves down from. We have Wolves in the cup quarter-finals and it’s a big game to look forward to.<br /><br />David is disappointed every time he concedes a goal. The ball moves so strangely and it looks like it goes to David’s left and it changed direction, but in the first 15, 20 minutes we were too slow and never put them under pressure</p>

  <p><b>[Solskjaer ‘looking for quality’ amid Man Utd Gareth Bale links]</b> I can’t really comment on Gareth Bale or specific players because they’re property of other clubs but we should look for quality players, definitely, and players who could improve us as a team. There’s so many factors you need to think about when you sign players. It’s easy when you’re in the media or when you’re a supporter, you can think short term. We’ve got to think about the longevity as well, who’s going to fit in personality-wise. So there’s so many things that we need to think about.<br /><br />To win trophies you’ve got to win at least one or two really tough games. They’re like defining moments. We beat Liverpool, we beat Chelsea, we beat Arsenal back then <b>[in 1999]</b>, and you think ‘We deserve a little bit of luck in the draw next time’ but Wolves away, what a difficult game that can be. So comparisons? Well we’re not challenging to win the league this year but we are challenging for the other two trophies. The more games you win, the more confidence you breed, the more hunger there is in the players. Every single game that you win puts another layer on that, on the way to becoming the team that we want to be. So I don’t agree with Gary Neville when he says that teams should go out of this and this to focus on that<br /><br />I think we’ve shown against PSG that on any given day we can beat a top team. Then again there are so many variables and these games will be decided by margins. And of course that VAR, even though for me it’s a penalty, you can still be unlucky and not get it in the last minute and then we’d be out and no one would really remember the PSG performance. So yes, we can go all the way but you’ve got to be lucky and good along the way</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will not be piecing together a special plan to stop Barcelona talisman Lionel Messi]</b> What kind of plan can you have to stop one of the best in the world? We are looking forward to it. This season we played against <b>[Cristiano]</b> Ronaldo and <b>[Kylian]</b> Mbappe and had <b>[Eden]</b> Hazard for Chelsea and <b>[Luis]</b> Suarez and <b>[Philippe]</b> Coutinho and Messi will keep our defenders on their toes, let’s see how we manage.<br /><br />He will be difficult to stop but never impossible. It’s not like it’s Messi against Man United, there is Suarez, Coutinho,<b>[Arturo]</b> Vidal, so many good players. We can’t focus on one, we have to focus on 11 of them<br /><br />The Champions League throws up so many strange results. It’s not going to be decided until we play 90 minutes in Camp Nou, we just have to make sure we perform to our best and have a result to take over to Barcelona<br /><br />I think all my experience, and over the years with Barcelona, admiring the team, you always look at what you can do against them. Of course I have discussed Barcelona with the gaffer <b>[Ferguson]</b> since the draw was made. But no details really</p>

He is always giving his all. It doesn’t matter if it’s five weeks or five years on his contract.<br /><br />Maybe the future might have been worrying him and that’s part of the reason he’s injured, who knows. He doesn’t know.

Sometimes it is luck, sometimes it is David at the other end saving. We didn’t stamp our authority on the game at home, we didn’t keep the ball or create chances as we should have. We know we need to perform better and play ourselves. If you give players like Suarez and Messi time on the ball, you will suffer. Of course, we have to use set-pieces. We have to be better than what we did last week. Sometimes it is counter-attack, sometimes it is quick play. We have to be the best we can be.

With France he has played as one of the two sitters, or one of the two central midfielders with N’Golo Kante. So that is the great thing with Paul. He can do both and what we have to do with all the players is adjust to the games, what that game needs.<br /><br />Some games have needed Paul to drop back, sometimes it has needed him high up the field. You can see teams now thinking more about what Paul’s position is and trying to stop him in that position.

We know the quality of their team but our fans need to know we’ve given absolutely everything - tactically, mentally, physically, as well as handling the ball. For me it’s the best game we could have. There’s no hiding place. The world’s watching. The whole of Manchester is watching. Liverpool is watching!

I can see so many good things about this squad - things that we can improve on - and I have 100 per cent confidence that we can find the right players to come in and fit our mould of the personality and quality. You need stability, consistency, a long-term plan. Short-term results is always important because short-term gains make it easier to sell your long-term ideas. We want to find that identity within the group we have. You can’t compare but Jurgen <b>[Klopp]</b> and Pep have been very successful in building a team over the years and I think everyone knows that part of the success is having time to build that continuity. The work, the ambition, the drive in the coaching staff - both short and long term is unbelievable.

It’s about doing everything you can to close <b>[the gap]</b>.<br /><br />Next year when we get a pre-season behind us, that will help us to know that your shape is the same every game.

But we are doing things differently to all the previous managers. We can’t try to copy Sir Alex and think that’s going to be successful, because he was unique. We’ve got a different generation of players and we’ve got to do it our own way. Maybe some of them couldn’t have handled Sir Alex’s way of managing, but we’re looking to do it our way<br /><br />The Premier League is wonderful.

That showed us the potential and quality in the players, of course we didn’t have the consistency, but it’s a competition here now. The Premier League is the most competitive league in the world and we just fell that short of what would be a miraculous target of fourth back in December. It’s been a mixed bag for me but I can handle it, I’m just thinking about the players, how emotional it will have been for them - they started the season with one manager, finished with another one, they’ve had the highs and lows. I’ve been in football a few more years than these and I’ve had those emotions but I’ve looked forward to coming in every day, so have the players.

It’s a massive difference, we’ve got six teams who would say ‘we can challenge for trophies’ and it used to be one or two, with us when Arsenal or Chelsea were challenging when I played. Leicester won the league, Everton are challenging and there are 10 teams who could qualify for Europe. You can see by Man City winning the league and possibly a domestic treble, maybe to Liverpool and Spurs in the Champions League final, and Arsenal and Chelsea in the Europa League final, that we’re competing against the best clubs in the world. That’s a challenge we won’t take lightly. It’s a great challenge for this club, the biggest and best club in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Carrick will remain part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s coaching staff for 2019-20]</b> They are all going to stay. I think that’s important, that we keep that team going forward. We do bounce off each other and they are some excellent coaches. Kieran, with his 32 years of age, you’d think he’s had 32 years in coaching. Demps - I’ve worked with him now since 2011 when I moved back to Norway, he came with me to Molde. He’s a Manchester United lad through and through, he came through with Norman Whiteside and Mark Hughes in that youth team. I think he was captain and he played once for the first team. He knows what this means. Michael - what can I say that no-one else knows about Michael? When he came in, it was my last season as a player so I played with him for one year. He’s a personality I can really connect with.<br /><br /><b>[Phelan would be staying on as Solskjaer’s assistant]</b> I’m very pleased. When Ed <b>[Woodward]</b> rang me in December, I hadn’t spoken to Mike but I spoke to him once when I was at Cardiff. He was out of a job and we spoke for an hour or two there. When I got the job, I was quickly thinking ‘what do I need for help?’ and Mike Phelan was my first port of call. Since I got the first call, there were a few hours of thinking ‘what if he doesn’t want to come’ as he was first choice. He’s such a knowledgeable and likeable lad - I can’t say lad as he’s so much older than me! To have played under him as well and working with him now, this team is so important to me. I said to Ed we need to make sure after he gave me my job full-time that we get Mike with us</p>

We’ve only played once, we want the partnership to develop with David at the back. We want to play out from the back but we’ve got good centre-backs around as well. Axel is knocking on the door, he wants to play. I hope Victor and Harry don’t give me a reason to change. No injuries, suspensions or lack of concentration. They can both play, they read the game really well. Of course, Harry with his presence in the box, it’s great for any centre-back to have that presence next to them. I’m sure Victor will enjoy that.

I think him and Marcus both are capable of playing both positions. Sometimes it will be Marcus through the middle and Anthony on the left, or <a href="daniel-james.html">Dan James</a> on the left and maybe one of them on the right. But, of course, the goals are scored from between the posts and not the worldies that we’ve seen them score, both of them, Marcus and Anthony with curlers in the top corner or dribble. I want both of them to be more scoring easy goals because you don’t have to work too hard to score them … If you can get five extra goals like this every season, both of them, that’s 10</p>

For him to restart and get himself playing regularly and scoring goals that will only benefit everyone. In the end, for us, we’re going to watch every weekend to see Romelu and Alexis playing together. He will come good for them. For us, we had a decision to make, I’m trusting <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a>, <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a>, <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a> to be our centre-forwards.<br /><br />We’ve got wingers in <a href="tahith-chong.html">Chongy</a> (Tahith Chong), <a href="daniel-james.html">Dan James</a>, <a href="andreas-pereira.html">Andreas Pereira</a>, we’ve loads of options. For me, it’s time for our boys to feel that pressure and responsibility, to be more robust, to know they have to play five games in a row. I trust the fitness staff and medical staff and the pre-season work. We’re mentally and physically more ready, that’s the next step for our young players<br /><br /><b>[Solskjaer went on to express his faith in the youngster’s ability]</b> Mason is not used to playing as little as he is at the moment, he’s used to playing every week. Now he’s coming on for half an hour here or there and that’s a learning curve for him. He won’t play five games on the bounce, he’s cover and an option behind Marcus and Anthony</p>

Any game in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is winnable but is also loseable, it’s margins, fine margins and sometimes you stand there smiling happy to have won a game, sometimes angry because you’ve lost, you’ve got to portray the right image.<br /><br />In my own words: It’s a team improving, evolving, a young team, the culture is there I see them every single day in training and we don’t have any issues with attitudes, with work rate, with desire. Now can we trust ourselves, you can see against Astana and Rochdale they want to impress, do well and maybe they rush their finish at times. It is getting there<br /><br />You can see how much we’ve improved defensively, that’s where we put the big money in with <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Aaron Wan-Bissaka</a> and <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a>. We don’t concede many chances, concede too many goals. The other way, going forward, is where we’ve struggled with injuries, <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>, Anthony, Marcus, we’ve had some bad luck in that respect. It’s about building relationships and it doesn’t help when you lose players. These boys need to get the pattern of play and if you’re half a second with your movement, sometimes finishing could be better, could be frustrating but that’s also down to some outstanding keepers out there</p>

  <p><b>[Speaking after United’s narrow win over Rochdale]</b> He’s proven when he’s been on the pitch in the last two games he started that, when you get him in the box, he’s dangerous. What’s pleased me about him in the period that we’re in is he doesn’t turn down chances to finish. He’s not 18 yet but keeps trusting himself. He gets the chances so we’re not worried about that at all. But we can’t just throw him in the deep end all the time. He’s proved in those games he’s ready for it.

We’re such a young team that we’re still going to see some inconsistency but you’re not going to see us surrender - you’re not going to see that. I never fly off if we’re doing well and I don’t really get too down when it’s going against us because it’s a fine line there and fine margins between success and not-so-great results in football. I think that’s me as a person. It’s just looking forward to the next one and how I can make sure we do the job properly and that we’re prepared for what’s going to come. You’ve got to take the ups and the downs and the setbacks with the same mentality as when you’re doing well. You’re not going to see me in the dumps and you’re not going to see me in the skies<br /><br />We want to get back into winning ways. We want to lift trophies.

I don’t really speak to agents, because I have nothing to do with the money side of it, but the final decision on who becomes a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player will be mine<br /><br />All I can say is that Paul is working as hard as he can to get back and you will see him smile again as soon as he’s back on the pitch. He is a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player, someone we are really happy to have in the squad and one of the best players in the world, but he needs to be fit.<br /><br />Everyone is allowed to be injured from time to time. I was out for 18 months once, and of course I attended weddings and did all sorts of different things during that period, but it was still a bad time for me because I wasn’t playing football. Being out for a long time like Paul is the worst thing that can happen to a player, because everyone wants to play. It’s a proper mental test for a footballer because there’s nothing more disheartening.<br /><br />He’s back in training, that’s a step forward for us. I’m not going to push him. It depends how he feels. When he’s fit, he’s fit. Obviously it’s frustrating to be without a player of his quality for so long, but it’s part of football. You always want to play your strongest team but you have to plan for different scenarios. The rest of the team have stepped up and done well while Paul has been out.</p>

I don’t really speak to agents, because I have nothing to do with the money side of it, but the final decision on who becomes a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player will be mine</p>

  <p><b>[Pressed on whether he will look to bring in another frontman]</b> I’m a striker by nature and I’ve always been an optimist. I’m optimistic we can keep players fit and if the right ones become available we do have the resources and I do have the backing from the board. One addition, and if you get two additions, of course that will be competition for places.<br /><br />But it’s also about getting the right ones. It has to be. There’s no point suddenly bringing someone else in now for the sake of three or four months if that can disrupt any good feeling or chemistry in the group, because the chemistry in the group is really good.<br /><br />It has to be the right type and it has to be a good investment for the long-term as well. We always believed Anthony and Marcus were going to score goals but Mason has filled a big void, he’s chipped in with goals. So I’m not worried about goals from centre-forwards. Mason’s on eight now. Marcus is on 15 and Anthony has quite a few (10). Romelu <b>[<a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>]</b> is a good striker and he’ll always score goals but it was time for him to move on. We didn’t find the right one outside our club (in the summer) but we had Mason<br /><br />We will consign this decade definitely, that’s just in the nature of this club. But 2020 sounds quite good for me. I’m going to make 2020 a good year for myself. I think we’re on the right track. We are in a transition period, we’ve seen other clubs do it and come out strong after a couple of years. We’re improving. I think we can see more and more of what we want to be and our identity and what we’re good at. We’re making games suit our style more and more. We’ve played the same way for a little while and we’re getting use to each other. We’re quite a bit away still from where we want to be and we’ll have ups and downs, but less and less of the downs hopefully. I’ve said we’re not a <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, we can’t out-play and out-football teams like they do yet, but hopefully in a few years we can.

That’s 104 points, so it would have been a more than decent season. They are doing well, to say the least, and could win a treble this season but let’s see where they are in May. They have a couple of difficult games coming up<br /><br />United have a really good football team, talented and experienced. There is a lot of good potential on the pitch. I think they will probably qualify for the Champions League this season. So, of course they can beat us. But they can only play as good as we let them play. If we are at our best it’s difficult for every team. It’s our stadium so we have to make sure everybody knows that</p>

He can strike a ball fantastically.

I think he is another piece in the jigsaw. I’m sure he will give us that X-factor we’ve been missing at times this year. He can do absolutely everything. He’s my size so he probably isn’t a target man in the box, but he is such a good footballer. He can play in a three-man midfield, as a No.10, off the side and in a diamond.

We had to prepare for this spell coming up. We have seven games in 21 days starting on Monday and ending against City. We have a big squad and we have 19 here. A couple of youngsters haven’t travelled. I’ve got to make not too many changes but enough to keep consistency and we want players feeling part of the team.

I don’t think it was one of the best games that anyone’s seen. A bit sloppy, concentration-wise, but the conditions with pitch and the ball make it hard. You can ask any of the players; that ball doesn’t help when you want to play football<br /><br /><b>[When asked to elaborate on his comment about the ball]</b> It’s just different and difficult to play with, you can get one and try. But it’s the same for the two teams. The conditions weren’t nice; the wind and the rain. But anyway, strange goals for both teams. Their throw-in and long kick straight through the middle. A lack of concentration from both teams there<br /><br />Of course, a Monday night game and then Thursday, there’s less recovery and it’s a game again on Sunday. So you’ve got to think about the bigger picture and not one game. So we made the decisions we made and we got a draw, a score draw.

For me, I don’t think the fans underrate him, I think everyone really, really appreciates what he did for us, he’s still very welcome, he’s still around the place, he still comes to <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>, so he will get a good reception from our away fans in that game<br /><br />I think he just wants to stay in the game, as many of us do, and he’s a great person, he makes everyone feel good - whether you are 80 or 10. He’s even my Noah’s favourite player, not just because what he did as a player, but the kind of human being he was in and around the place. I’m sure when he becomes a manager he’ll affect his players. When he’s coaching, he’s so enthusiastic about the game and he knows the game</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> boss Solskjaer hits back over coronavirus criticism]</b> For me football is an easy target sometimes. For me it’s unfair to call on any individual or footballers as a group because I already know players do a great amount of work in the community, and players are doing a lot to help this situation. Discussions are taking place between players and clubs, what kind of contribution they’ll make. It’s not easy for anyone, and to be called out is not fair for me. Mistakes are being made and have been made by loads of people and that’s how we learn as well. Now it’s about making better decisions, good decisions, I think we all want to help the NHS, the communities, and I think it’s important every single club do what they think is right. We’re all good people, and I’m sure we all want this to be over with as soon as possible. For me it’s about following the guidelines from the government as well<br /><br />First of all, we are role models, sometimes we’re heroes in football, at the moment we have to take a back step, the real heroes are the workers on the front line, I think everyone appreciates and admires what they’re doing. Let’s follow the guidelines, but football is very important for mental health for many, and for communities and society. I’ve seen players do video conferences, challenges to each other, sending messages and sticking to those messages, being role models. Football is such a big thing, so even a little fun game of <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>, it’s great that they can just show that footballers are normal people who are good at kicking a ball once in a while</p>

In March 2019, players were physically tired, mentally tired and we had injuries. The players started with negative thinking, whereas now it’s positive thinking. There were other things I didn’t like last year, some personal agendas which couldn’t be sorted out until the summer. There will always be players who want to play more in football, but if a team is to be successful then players have to be available at different times. I feel in this group we don’t have one bad apple<br /><br />When you win, everything is easy. It’s when you hit difficult times that you can see who you want and who has the right mentality. We didn’t see that until after Paris, when we went into a bad run. That’s when I saw who I could build a long-term, successful squad around. You need some egos in football, but it has to be team first. I could see more and more at the end of the season what needed improving</p>

I think that’s helpful because footballers, after being out for so long, going into competitive games will be a challenge for them and we have to look after them injury-wise and fitness-wise. We can’t just flog one player and say to them, ‘you play every game and every minute’ because it might be a period when we have to rotate quite often.<br /><br /><b>[Solskjaer intends to make full use of his squad from this point]</b> We have a big squad, a strong squad and at the moment, loads of these players can prepare for the first game and hope to play in the first game and then if you don’t play in the first, you might play the second or the third. So that’s what it is about at Man United, being in the squad, being in the team, being ready when you’re asked upon<br /><br />Of course, when you get to Man United, you want to end the season with trophies. But trophies won’t be what we’re talking about now. We’ve got to make sure we make this short spell before next season a good one for us and if it ends up with trophies, fantastic. We’ve just got to focus on what we can control and that’s our own performances. If that takes us to a final or two, it would be great. I’m focused on each game as it comes but also on developing this team. It’s a young team with some great talent, some great work-rate, personalities … the human qualities in the group are fantastic. And of course, Paul and Marcus are back, Eric has been out for a long time, Scott <b>[<a href="scott-mctominay.html">McTominay</a>]</b> was out for a long time, so we want to gel the team together again</p>

He has worked really hard and he deserves his chance to come back in. We know his qualities. He has different qualities to other players and he knows we value him</p>
