  <p><b>[On Zidane]</b> That comparison can only flatter me. However, I see myself more as a Yaya Toure. But I can see myself as a future playmaker. That is how I like to play most, and my last season in Lazio has proved it.</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd target Milinkovic-Savic welcomes Jose Mourinho’s presence at Serbia clash]</b> I’m a Lazio player, but obviously I was pleased that a coach of his calibre came to see the game. If he gave the impression of disagreeing with the starting line-up, it may not be because of me. Maybe he wasn’t here for me but for someone else. I read a bit from everywhere that he came here to watch me play, but that doesn’t mean anything</p>

  <p><b>[Lazio midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic has revealed that he admires LA Galaxy striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic]</b> I like <b>[Zlatan]</b> Ibrahimovic a lot,” he told Goal and DAZN. “I’ve been following him for years now. I like him as a player and as a person. <b>[The comparison]</b> might be because I’m as tall as him and because of his technique. I have a similar jumping style to him as well, so I like him because of all those aspects<br /><br />I missed scoring goals a lot and with that one, I lifted a huge weight off my shoulders. Last season I scored often, so people were already criticising me saying I wouldn’t score again. I read a lot, unfortunately, that’s my main issue. But that’s okay, as I always looked ahead. I had many friends who helped me keep my head up, along with my team-mates and family. I can say that it was a tough period for me. But I’ve played further back on the pitch as well this season, because Luis <b>[Alberto]</b> has played many games this year, so he plays higher up and I fall in behind him. But as I’ve said many times already, it is not important if I score a lot or not, what is important is always giving it my all to help the team win the match<br /><br />I already knew in those final days that I would stay here at Lazio. I was already fully concentrated on this team. I obviously read those rumours that came out in the last days, but I didn’t pay much attention to them as I knew my future was here. I was only thinking about Lazio</p>

  <p><b>[Sergej Milinkovic-Savic sees no reason why <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> should not battle <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and Inter for Scudetto]</b> I scored, but the whole team got this victory. It’s true what we said a few days ago, we are a family and we want to continue like this. Inter didn’t play a great first half and we created more chances, but they scored. So we went into the dressing room, said this has to be our game and we came back out with the same attitude, as if it was 0-0. What we feel obliged to achieve is a Champions League place, but if we are up there towards the end, then why not go for the Scudetto? Inter won’t give up because we won tonight, we won’t give up no matter what happens in future, then we’ll just see how things pan out</p>
