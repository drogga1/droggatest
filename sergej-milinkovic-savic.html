Lazio president Claudio Lotito insists it will be harder to keep star player Sergej Milinkovic-Savic in the current transfer window</p>

<p>: 2019 07 22
The FIFA 19 Ultimate Team event, the FUTTIES has already produced some phenomenal cards and now adding to that is Manchester City and England right-back Kyle Walker. The FIFA community couldn’t resist voting for the pacey defender, opting for him over Kostas Manolas and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic.</p>

<p>: 2019 07 30
Manchester United are ready to offer £82 million prise Sergej Milinkovic-Savic from Lazio – who signed the 24-year-old Serbia midfielder in 2015</p>

  <p><b>[Sergej Milinkovic-Savic has revealed his pride at being a Lazio player as he continues to be linked with a transfer window move]</b> Happy to wear for four years this shirt with the eagle on the chest</p>

  <p><b>[Sergej Milinkovic-Savic was once again linked with a move to Manchester United over the summer, but the Lazio midfielder claims such speculation was merely paper talk]</b> You’ll never hear me say that I want to leave Lazio. I never mentioned a possible transfer to Manchester United, it was just a newspaper story. The situation doesn’t weigh on me because I know there’s still time for a possible transfer. If something has to happen, it will. There hasn’t been anything until now and we’re moving forward<br /><br />The Premier League transfer window is shut, so the Manchester United story is finished. I wasn’t irritated by everything that was written in the papers, because my mind was concentrated on preparing for the new season in the best possible way. I am where I am and I want for nothing at Lazio. I don’t think much about the transfer market. All sorts of things were written about me, but I know where my mind is and who I have a contract with<br /><br /><b>[He said when quizzed on a prized asset]</b> If an important offer arrives, it is only right the club take it into consideration</p>

  <p><b>[Sergej Milinkovic-Savic sees no reason why Lazio should not battle <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and Inter for Scudetto]</b> I scored, but the whole team got this victory. It’s true what we said a few days ago, we are a family and we want to continue like this. Inter didn’t play a great first half and we created more chances, but they scored. So we went into the dressing room, said this has to be our game and we came back out with the same attitude, as if it was 0-0. What we feel obliged to achieve is a Champions League place, but if we are up there towards the end, then why not go for the Scudetto? Inter won’t give up because we won tonight, we won’t give up no matter what happens in future, then we’ll just see how things pan out</p>
