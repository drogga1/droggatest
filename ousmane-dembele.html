  <p><b>[Dembele determined to prove worthy of <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> praise after struggling to justify <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s faith]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is a great player. I watched him on television when I was younger but playing with him and seeing him in real life is even better. It’s an honour for him to tell me that I have talent, but I have to prove it on the pitch<br /><br /><b>[He added on the challenges he faces after seeing fitness issues hold him back again at the start of 2019-20]</b> During the pre-season I was very well. Afterwards I got injured and I was out for a month. When I returned, I had some physical problems. Now I have to fight for my place because we have a great team and there is more competition than in past seasons. There are many very good forwards, with a lot of quality, and we’re motivated to be even better. Since my arrival at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> three years ago I have improved in my preparation for games. I go to the gym and warm up properly. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> are a great team, with great players and that makes you want to win to give everything. I want to show what I can do on the pitch. The whole team helps me, but I especially receive support from <a href="paul-clement.html">Clement</a> <b>[Lenglet]</b> and Samuel <b>[Umtiti]</b>. With <b>[Antoine]</b> <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a> we have been friends for a long time and he gives me many tips. He’s a very good person and a good friend. He is doing very well with the rest of the group and didn’t need much time to adapt<br /><br /><b>[The next outing for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> will fight <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> in the Champions League]</b> <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> will be a special match for me. I still have friends amongst my ex-team-mates. We will be rivals, but nothing changes. I left three years ago and I haven’t seen them since then. Emotionally, it will be a bit difficult, but I will be happy to see them and to play against them. They’re a team that attacks and doesn’t tend to play defensively. They always play as a team and give everything, wanting to win every game, because they’re a great side. They’ll come with a lot of intensity, but <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> awaits them</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona’s Dembele leaves field in tears after injury against Borussia Dortmund]</b> I felt very well in pre-season but then got injured and was out for a month. When I came back I had more problems and now I have to fight. We have a great team and there’s more competition than in past seasons<br /><br />It’ll be a very special match for me. I have former teammates there. We’ll be rivals on the night but nothing changes. I left three years ago and haven’t seen them since then. Emotionally it’ll be difficult, but I’ll be happy to play against them. We have to win against <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> to ensure qualification as soon as possible. It’s the most important match of the first half of the season. With the support of our fans, we hope to take three points and go to Inter in peace</p>
