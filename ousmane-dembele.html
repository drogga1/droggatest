  <p><b>[Ousmane Dembele has explained why he snubbed interest from Barcelona and Bayern Munich]</b> Yes, that was it and then of course the speech of the bosses I liked. They told me that if I was good, I would play no matter what happened. I am very happy to be here and I do not regret my choice at all.<br /><br />I’m just trying to show what I can do, have fun on the pitch and be decisive for my partners. What they say about me does not change anything at all, I just show what I can do. I give my best and I try show my qualities. There are many talented players. I was one of them in my years of training. At Stade Rennais we were happy together then everything went a little fast for me. I was upgraded to the older teams a few times, but nothing more<br /><br />I do not care at all. The value of the players, mine, I do not pay attention. I stay focused on the matches and the competition. This is not my goal <b>[winning the Ballon d’Or]</b> because I think mostly about the collective. Winning titles is my goal</p>

  <p><b>[Ousmane Dembele has labelled his new Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi as the greatest player in history]</b> I remember two games especially. One against Chelsea, when Iniesta scored the goal to qualify for the Champions League final. When I see Andres now I remember it. I can’t wait to tell him. And the other was a Champions League game against Arsenal. Barcelona had not done great in the first leg but in the second leg they produced a brilliant performance, with four goals from Messi. That’s when I realised Messi’s not from this world. It was incredible.<br /><br />I had a poster of Iniesta. He seemed like a different player to me: elegant, special… a genius. I watched all the Barcelona games to see how they played and the geniuses, Iniesta and Messi. After, I tried to imitate them but it was difficult. They do things that no one does. Messi always plays at a sublime level. He’s the best player in history!<br /><br />He <b>[Tuchel]</b> loved me too much. Being serious, it’s not a challenge in my life. My objective is to learn from the best in the world, to integrate myself into the team. I am only 20. Personal titles aren’t something which motivate me<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether comparisons between himself and Neymar]</b> No. Honestly I don’t think so. Neymar is a great player with a lot of class, one of the best in the world. I am young, I am here to learn and to add what I can to Barcelona</p>

  <p><b>[Dembele explains why he delayed Barca move]</b> I’d been a professional at Rennes for just six months. Can you imagine? Just six months! Of course <b>[it was too soon]</b>. I wanted to learn, play Champions League games, know what that competition was, to play a whole season with a big team, playing regularly, developing… I would have learned a lot in training but it would have halted my progression. Luckily Barcelona have come back for a second time and this time I could not let the train pass.<br /><br /><b>[Dembele came in for criticism during his final days at Dortmund for skipping training sessions as he tried to force a move]</b> I was relaxed. It was a question of negotiation between Barca and Borussia. I knew I had to have patience. I decided to stop going training. I didn’t want to go. I looked for an excuse not to go. If it didn’t work out and I hadn’t done my part to get the move to Barca, now I would be lamenting the fact I wasn’t here</p>

  <p><b>[Ousmane Dembele must pass a final exam at Barcelona]</b> He will need some time. Barca is like a final exam for a footballer. It is like Dembele is passing a Master’s degree right now because not everyone can play for this club. Why? Because you have to know things three times more than elsewhere. Barca play on barely 30 metres of the pitch. Dembele has a lot of talent, he is very fast, but here, he is not going to have the space he had at Dortmund or Rennes. He had more space, so more time there<br /><br />He will have to learn to think faster, in a few thousandths of a second. This is where we will see if he has the mentality. He must say to himself: ‘l am a Barca player’. You have to be mentally strong, to have conviction. There are average players who spent 15 years at Barca, because they had character. And there are some excellent players who did not do anything because they couldn’t handle pressure. In training, when you saw them, you would say to yourself: ‘They will break everything. They’re going to be legends’. But no. As soon as they entered the pitch, their legs started shaking, they did not want the ball anymore. And you would wonder: ‘Holy fuck, what’s happening to them?’<br /><br />Mental strength is what stabilises the performance. That’s what makes you stronger. When there is fire, Marcelo, <b>[Luka]</b> Modric or Sergio Ramos do not hide. On the contrary, it’s at this moment that they appear. What did Lucas Vazquez do against PSG? He entered the pitch with the desire to win. A missile. The guy even went to <b>[Presnel]</b> Kimpembe. And there you say to yourself: ‘What is he doing? He’s crazy or what?’ No, he’s just mentally strong</p>

Now I have to fight for my place because we have a great team and there is more competition than in past seasons. There are many very good forwards, with a lot of quality, and we’re motivated to be even better. Since my arrival at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> three years ago I have improved in my preparation for games. I go to the gym and warm up properly. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> are a great team, with great players and that makes you want to win to give everything.
