  <p><b>[Liverpool target Presnel Kimpembe wants more PSG game time]</b> I’m in competition with two great players, Thiago SIlva and Marquinhos, and if I played tonight it means that the coach put faith in me. I try to give this confidence back every minute I’m on the pitch. I’m ambitious and I would like to play more but I’m okay with this situation.<br /><br />There was no war between Cavani and Neymar. They are two players who want to score goals</p>

  <p><b>[Presnel Kimpembe is the future star who won’t cost PSG a penny]</b> It’s the match where I’ve had the least pressure in my life. The day before, I read the reviews on social networks, in the newspapers: ‘Oh, he’s going to get killed.’ It’s something that makes me even stronger. I always want to prove to people that I am capable. Critics are the fuel I need<br /><br />Things had started to change six months before that. That game was more of a Eureka moment. Before that game, people would say: ‘He has to play well in the next game, then he has to play well in the next game’. Having played so well in that match, which was a benchmark, was a trigger that made people say: ‘OK, he’s capable’.<br /><br />Maybe it’s because I’m not a big star who was bought for €50 million, I’ve always got something to prove. For the young guys coming out of the academy, it’s always like that, but that’s not a bad thing</p>

  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain defender Presnel Kimpembe has vowed to never let one of his teams suffer through another loss]</b> It hurts me, very bad even, I feel what the fans feel. I can see their anger, I realize it, I understand it and, most importantly, I assume it so that I can swallow it. It’s a game that inevitably stays in the heads but that we will have to forget for the rest of the season.<br /><br />We lost that grit and that rage we had in the first leg. It’s not the fact of having lived through past experiences that made us feel stressed. or whatever it was. No, it was really a self-satisfaction. We took this game lightly, and it’s something that will never happen to me again. It’s enough, never again. Of course we will lose more games in the UCL, but losing games like this is over. I don’t want it to happen to us anymore<br /><br />We’ll have to raise our heads so we can move on, it’s going to be complicated, but there’s still the Ligue 1, the Coupe de France, which is important to us too. Even if all the world thinks winning these trophies is easy, it’s never easy</p>
