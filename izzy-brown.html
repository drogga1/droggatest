  <p><b>[Chelsea forward Izzy Brown has torn his anterior cruciate ligament and will miss the remainder of the season]</b> Not the news I wanted to hear. I have torn my ACL &amp; it will need surgery to fix. I will come back fitter &amp; stronger and hopefully be ready for next season. Thank you to everyone at Brighton for the love and support they showed towards me, the fans, the staff, &amp; all the players. I’ve met some amazing people here &amp; these memories will be with me forever.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea loanee Izzy Brown is looking forward to making his Leeds United debut after missing 10 months of action]</b> It’s happening. I played my first 45 the other day and I’ve got 90 minutes to play on Monday, that’s the plan so far. After the 90 minutes on Monday I should be ready for selection.<br /><br />I always thought I’d be getting there and then there would be a setback but I can start to see the light at the end of the tunnel now. I’m training every day with the boys, doing double sessions and basically part of the team. I’ve heard before that I’d be back in a month and then it would take longer than it was supposed to so I don’t ever really get my hopes up but this time I’m excited because I can see that I’m near the end<br /><br />When I put my shin pads on before the game it was the first time I’d put shin pads on in 10 months. The little things you take more notice of and it makes you appreciate playing football more. Some days I used to think I was tired but now, every day I want to train and play. I just want to play football. It’s like I’m a little kid again</p>

  <p><b>[Izzy Brown apologises to Leeds as disastrous 11-minute loan from Chelsea comes to an end]</b> I don’t know what to say, words can’t describe how we feel right now. I just want to say thank you for the love and support this season, even though it didn’t end the way we all wanted it to. It’s been a pleasure to be able to play for this amazing club. I’m sorry that I haven’t played as much as I hoped this season, but that’s football. I’ve learnt so much this season and it’s been a pleasure to have been on this journey with the boys. Thank you to everyone at Leeds United, the players, the staff, the fans, you will always have a place in my heart and hopefully next season you will get back to where you belong. Thank you for sticking with me through the difficult times, it’s really appreciated</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> loanee Izzy Brown reflects on injury nightmare: I was a ghost]</b> I think everyone has a different path. You can have your moment when you are 18 or 24, 25. There’s no age limit to when you are going to make it as a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> player. So I don’t think what they are doing inspires me too much because I know when my time comes, I am going to be ready to take it. Me, Tammy and Fikayo are close friends and we basically grew up together; we are all ’97s. We played at England together.<br /><br />It’s great to see as everyone used to think <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> don’t bring through young players but now <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> is in charge you are starting to see those players coming through, playing well and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are winning games. You can’t question that those players are not good enough because they are going out every day and performing. Tammy is <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> second top goalscorer. I am happy for him because for the future of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and the young players there it’s going to be a good thing that they are doing so well. I am proud of my close friends <b>[at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> and I am happy to see them playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but, for me, I am just solely focused on myself<br /><br /><b>[Brown sees the merit in getting game time away from the parent club]</b> You step out in the real world is you go out on loan. Then you really understand what football is like. I think at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> they sugar coat it when you are young. That’s why loans are so important because you can man up. When you come in the dressing room, there’s no one there for you. These are grown men and they will tell you when you are not doing good enough. It was a good decision at the time to do it young<br /><br /><b>[Izzy Brown seems to have mostly overcome those injury concerns having registered an impressive five assists in the Championship so far this campaign, despite manager Graeme Jones easing him back into action]</b> It is good to hear because sometimes you doubt yourself. It does give you so much confidence when the manager says the things he says. At the same time, I need to prove it. Some people may not agree with him. I am just going to go out there and give it 100 per cent.<br /><br />My first three games here were tough for me. I didn’t feel pressure from the outside, but you put pressure on yourself to be able to do what you used to do. To not be able to do what I used to be able to do straight away was difficult. I was trying things that weren’t coming off and I was thinking, ‘what’s going on?’. I feel like now the confidence is coming back and the sharpness is coming back. I am just trying things and sometimes they work and sometimes they don’t. I keep trying them and I am not afraid to make mistakes.<br /><br />In my head, I think I can play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I don’t think that’s big-headed because I played in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> <b>[in 2013 with West Brom]</b> and I don’t think I was outside my limits. I feel, with my injury, I took two steps back when I was on my way up. Now there is a different focus in my mind, which is just football and playing games. So I am not focused on <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at the moment. I just want to try to get myself back to where I was and then once I am there, I will look forward again.<br /><br />For me to come here, the manager sees me every day in training and he has been around in Belgium, West Brom and they are top class players. It gives me confidence that in the future I can look and say I should be playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but I can’t let that get into my head now. I feel like we have the team, players and staff to keep us in the division. Now we just need to get the results that we deserve. I think we have never been outclassed<br /><br /><b>[At Luton, Brown is also only an hour away from where he grew up in Peterborough while it is also the hometown of his girlfriend, Destiny, who helped him through those difficult days post-knee surgery]</b> I was always coming to Luton because my girlfriend and her family are here. I don’t know how my girlfriend put up with me - the mood swings from the heavy tablets I was having after the operation… I was a ghost. I didn’t know what I was saying but she made sure I had my ice on in every minute. She would refill it. She would get me drinks when I couldn’t move, help me upstairs even washed me when I couldn’t shower. She did so much. She was watching over me.<br /><br />I owe a lot to her because without her, I don’t know where I would be. I could still be injured or have the pain in my knee. She made sure we did the exercises together that the doctor gave me. She was pregnant and doing the exercises with me while I was injured. She did a lot. I have a little daughter and she is amazing. She has made me grow up so much. She is my best achievement. My daughter has been coming to the home games. I look in the crowd and she is smiling and can wave. It is things like that which gives you so much confidence that part of you is here watching. You just want to make them proud on the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Izzy Brown opens up on ‘the toughest year of my life’ at <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a>]</b> When you’re injured you do really doubt yourself. You think: ‘Will I get back to being as good or better than I was before?’. It kept playing on my mind because people say you lose 10 per cent once you do your ACL and you lose your speed and awareness and I was thinking: ‘No, I do not want that to happen to me’. When I was at <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> I thought I might have lost it because I wasn’t playing and I thought that I should be playing. This season I am starting to gain confidence, getting assists and playing well and that’s what I want to do. I need to add goals to my game but other than that the confidence is back<br /><br /><b>[<a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Bielsa</a>’s side are on the promotion trail again this season and will be welcomed by Luton to Kenilworth Road on Saturday]</b> Last season was difficult for me at <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>. I came back from an ACL injury and that was probably the toughest year of my life. When I came back, I had it in my mind that I just wanted to play football again because I missed it so much. Going to <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> I thought it would be a great decision. I feel like I learnt a lot but the main reason I went there was to play and that didn’t really happen there. I’ve got a lot of respect for the club and the medical staff because they got me where I am now but I think this season I needed to play football 100%, that’s all I was focused on. When Luton came up I thought that’s the perfect fit for me because I felt I needed just to get a run of games which I haven’t had for a few years. The other day I started three games in one week for the first time in two years. I feel like I have come on so much since I have been here and I have been getting fitter every game. I had a little set-back last week but that has all cleared up now and I am ready to go again<br /><br /><b>[Yet despite the frustrations of his lost year, Brown has no regrets over his time in Yorkshire under one of the best-regarded managers in the game]</b> He is a great manager. Very different and some players warm to that and some players don’t. If you don’t warm to it you can feel it because if you aren’t giving 100% on the training pitch, you won’t play. If you are over your weight target, you won’t play. It’s very precise with numbers but all of the staff know what he wants. And even if the staff don’t give him what he wants, he will tell them. He’s not afraid to tell people off. He’s a good man, though.<br /><br /><b>[I learned]</b> so much. He has a completely different method to what every other coach has. He sees football completely different. It was a great experience for me to actually work under him because he is respected throughout the world for being one of the best managers. His training is tough. I wouldn’t say it is boring but it is very repetitive and you do the same things every day. The same drills. You watch the clips in the games and you say ‘that’s exactly what we did in training’ and they just do it on the pitch. He puts it into your brain and the players do it for him. You can see it get results. It will be tough to match against them because of how fit they are so maybe we will have to change our game plan to deal with the way they play but you know how they play and we know how we can play so we have to be focused on that game</p>
