  <p><b>[Blaise Matuidi has stated his belief that his new Juventus team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo is the best player on the planet]</b> Cristiano Ronaldo is the best player on the planet, knowing that he will play with us is great news - especially for him as he gets to share a locker room with a world champion! Two years ago he managed to beat me in the final in Paris, but it is also true that the World Cup is worth something more than the European Championship! It was a real surprise. I’m happy with what the team has done, getting him to wear a Juventus shirt… we have the strongest now.<br /><br />There is a culture of work in Turin that I repeated <b>[in Russia]</b> - the taste for work has given me so much. At Juve there is always the need to be at the highest level and that’s what allowed me to push and become a champion. <b>[Deschamps and Allegri]</b> are both leaders of men, two people who can lead a team and really manage the group - I’m proud to have been coached by such great people</p>

  <p><b>[Blaise Matuidi calls for punishment for fans who use racist chants]</b> It’s sad, because it happened to me in that very same stadium last year. We just can’t tolerate that kind of things. There were monkey shouts when I touched the ball. When Kean found himself in front of the goal twice - and it’s important to note that - it happened again. This is why Moise celebrated his goal saying that he didn’t understand. It intensified over the end of the game. Those are stupid people, who have nothing to do in a stadium. They must be punished.<br /><br />I don’t want to calm down, I don’t want to just ignore that,” he added. “We have to fight it, not ignore it. We should not be afraid and act as if we didn’t hear anything. It’s important to say it loud and clear. Those monkey shouts should not be said and could not be said and that must be punished. I thought at that moment that the referee was not taking the good decision. The best decision was to stop the game. I went to talk to him and he was open minded. He said that he didn’t understand in the right moment. I’m a father, I have kids. I don’t want to show this world to my kids.</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo is the ‘best player’ in Europe]</b> We have the best player: Cristiano Ronaldo. We are happy with what he’s doing, we are having fun and we hope he can continue like this. He played phenomenally in the match against Atletico, but I think he shows his brilliance every day in training, you see it in the way he trains. He surprises me every day because he works harder than everyone else and I think that is what makes the difference. It makes you say: ‘It’s not by chance that he reached this level.<br /><br /><b>[Matudi commended <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> for his work at Juve]</b> Every coach has his own philosophy and <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> has his. He’s particularly great at managing his players, but he’s also very good when it comes to preparing a game tactically. He knows how to manage the players as well as the locker room as a whole.

  <p><b>[Blaise Matuidi has called <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>’s work ethic inspirational]</b> After the World Cup I did not have time to play around, because if I had played around someone else would have taken my place. The arrival of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, seeing him work on a daily basis, I can tell you that it does not leave you the choice either. He’s won everything. You say to yourself that when you have won everything, the backlash will come and you will ask yourself ‘what more can I earn?’ Not him! He always wants to go higher. In training he always wants to win everything, he is not happy when he loses and I want to ensure you that it is not fake.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="tanguy-ndombele.html">Tanguy Ndombele</a> started the game in midfield, and Matuidi says competition for places in the engine room has helped to spur him on]</b> I can say without pretension that I knew how to make myself indispensable, but that’s work.

When I started at Troyes, to be honest, if I had been told that I would reach 80 caps, a World Cup, a Euro final <b>[in 2016, when France lost to <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>’s Portugal]</b> and that I would have played in major European finals, I would have signed right away</p>

I already had this problem. There was the <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> problem. It was also in the same stadium. I think there must be some measures <b>[taken]</b>. It has no place in football. And in all sports even - and even in life. We don’t like to see that. This is not a good example for the young people, for our children.
