I see that with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is also like that. Kylian will be a great player. He is already. He is doing big things.

  <p><b>[Blaise Matuidi has called upon <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> to take action to combat racism after Inter forward <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> became the latest player to face abusive discrimination]</b> Racism in Italy? I already had this problem. There was the <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> problem. It was also in the same stadium. I think there must be some measures <b>[taken]</b>. It has no place in football. And in all sports even - and even in life. We don’t like to see that. This is not a good example for the young people, for our children. We will do everything so that it is no longer the case, even if it is difficult because it concerns a minority. But this minority of people has no place in the stadiums. We have bodies that are there to make decisions and I think it’s up to them to make the right decisions<br /><br /><b>[Matuidi was heavily tipped to make a move to <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> during the transfer window]</b> I always declared that I was comfortable at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, one of the best clubs in the world. Paris will always have a place in my heart. I have supported <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> since I was a child and wearing their jersey was a dream. But now I’m proud to be at Juve<br /><br />We are lucky to have a huge pool, with a lot of high-quality players. There are important players who are absent, but there are others who are there and who have proved for their club that they can bring a lot. We have great confidence in this group and we are able to win despite absences. <b>[The absentees]</b> should not be an excuse. We have 23 players and must be successful and win these two games, especially at home. When we wear the jersey of the French team, we always play to win</p>

  <p><b>[Blaise Matuidi has insisted he never considered leaving <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> during the transfer window]</b> You were convinced that I’d leave in the summer, but I never considered this opportunity. I work every day for the team and I’m only thinking about what happens on the pitch. <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> are a great team and they give me so much confidence<br /><br /><b>[Both <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> goals came from set-pieces and Matuidi admitted his side have to cope better with dead-ball deliveries]</b> We had a good game against Atletico, creating lots of chances. We only have a small problem with set-pieces and we’re working hard to prevent it from happening again. I should’ve done more to put off <b>[Hector]</b> Herrera for 2-2, so we all still have a lot to learn</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus’ Matuidi calls on white players to condemn racism and says walking off pitch isn’t right answer]</b> It’s stupidity, these people have no place in a football stadium. I tell myself that this is not the right solution. I have thought about it, but I do not think it is necessarily the right thing to do. It would be a defeat, doing that would be like saying that they won. I will tell you what I really think: I think it would be good if a strong statement came from a person who is not of colour. It would be more striking. It would be great. We must all be aware of this scourge<br /><br /><b>[He was part of the <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> team which lost 6-1 to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in March 2017, throwing away a 4-0 first-leg lead in the Champions League last 16]</b> The worst moment of my career? No, that was at Euro 2016, but it was hard. At that time, in the locker room, I said to myself: ‘It’s not possible, I don’t want to play football anymore!’. I was ashamed of myself. But that’s football and I had some great moments in Paris. I keep wonderful memories and the supporters and people who love the club, I think they have a good memory of Blaise Matuidi.</p>

I am very happy to continue another season here. I never had any doubts because I felt the trust of all parties. It is certain that I am getting old and in this choice, I also think of my family who love Turin</p>

If I had not been, perhaps I would never have known I was. I am positive, I am strong, my morale is as high as that of my family. I am positive, I am strong, morale is good.

  <p><b>[Blaise Matuidi says Coronavirus quarantine made me ‘psychotic’]</b> We’re in good health. As you know I unfortunately got coronavirus. Honestly, I was panicking. Total Panic. When they came to me and said: ‘You’re positive’, I was speechless. I was mad at the doctor, I said: ‘Is he joking? Why would he tell me such a thing?’ I couldn’t feel anything! It was tough for my mum because she was far away. You see the parents, but I knew how to reassure them. Some people are not that lucky. It’s complicated. It’s a delicate time for us. We hope that health comes first. I just hope the coronavirus fades. It’s not an easy moment because you’re afraid for your family. I’ll tell you the truth. It’s hard. It’s really hard. When I tested positive, I couldn’t even go out shopping. It made me psychotic. You always try to make sure people aren’t too close, you have to be mentally strong. It’ll take time, this is a new situation for all of us. I had no symptoms but, as soon as I heard the news, I was in shock. I was in total panic, I feared for my family and friends. It was difficult for them, but I was able to reassure them. It’s not a good time, we really want this to end as soon as possible. I ask myself what will happen to football and everyday life. It’s something very unique. We have to live it. I’m asking myself questions. What will happen with football? In our everyday life? It’s not easy!</p>
