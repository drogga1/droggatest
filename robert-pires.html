  <p><b>[Robert Pires on The Games That Changed My Life: October 9, 1996: France 4-0 Turkey]</b> Nobody else will remember this game, but it was my first goal for my country. It was a friendly at the <a href="psg.html">Parc des Princes</a>, which we won 4-0. It was an incredible moment in my life, not just my career, to wear Les Bleus’ colours and score with style<br /><br />My country has always been very important to me.

It wasn’t easy - he’d scored that famous goal at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> to make him a fan favourite<br /><br />I scored a good goal that got us an important draw in Italy - something that let the supporters know I could help <a href="arsenal-fc.html">the Gunners</a> win many trophies in the future.

You can see how relieved I was to prove myself!<br /><br /><b>[March 17, 2002: <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> 1-2 <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> We were struggling against a really good <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> side, but I scored one of my best goals at a crucial time to get us the victory that we needed. We were behind <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in the league table, and needed to go on a good run<br /><br />We had to win that game. I was through on goal, saw the size of <a href="peter-schmeichel.html">Peter Schmeichel</a>, and thought the only way to score was to chip him. I love scoring over big goalkeepers like that! People still ask me about that goal, but it was the win that mattered most<br /><br /><b>[May 17, 2003: <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> 1-0 <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>]</b> When we got to the final we knew we had to win<br /><br />Nobody had retained <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup for a long time <b>[since <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> in 1982]</b>, and for us to do it - in a game when I scored the only goal of a very close match - was very special. The game wasn’t the most exciting I have ever played in, but I know how much it meant to the supporters to carry on winning things<br /><br />When we got to the final we knew we had to win and, for me personally, being the difference between the two teams on the day was important in my life<br /><br /><b>[November 13, 2004: <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> 4-5 <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> The atmosphere that day was something that I’ve never seen before in my career. The supporters of both clubs were always good in north London derbies, but this was something else, even though it was at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">White Hart Lane</a><br /><br />I think it’s one of the best matches <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has ever seen and it’s always replayed on my TV. I’ll never forget playing a part in a match that brought people so much excitement <b>[Pires scored the fifth goal after coming on as a substitute]</b>. If that game went on for longer, the goals wouldn’t have stopped going in - the attacking play was just so good by both sides</p>

All we want is for Alexis to stay at Arsenal. I hope he re-signs because he is a wonderful player, the engine of the car. I hope he stays forever. I see him in training every day. He’s stronger and more powerful. He’s more mature. The way he trains is impressive and he never wants to stop. Wenger and I have told him to take it easy, but he says that if he is on the field, it’s to train.<br /><br />It was impressive. He doesn’t know what pressure is. You have to have a lot of balls to take a penalty like that</p>

They play together, they change the team under Antonio Conte because now they play with three defenders, obviously the new football, the new generation.

  <p><b>[Arsenal need to prioritise Europa League success as a route to the Champions League]</b> The Europa League has to be Arsenal’s priority now, already. The objective has to be to do what Manchester United did last season - they are a good example. United won the Europa League and went straight into the Champions League - for Arsenal it is very important to get this state of mind. It’s a trophy, a good trophy, so it’s very important. And this season it is the last opportunity Arsenal have of making the Champions League. Unfortunately, but if you see the table it’s very difficult for Arsenal to reach the top four. I want to see Arsenal playing again in the Champions League. But it is very difficult with Tottenham, Liverpool and Chelsea all above them.<br /><br />Atletico and Arsenal are the favourites, for me this is the final in Lyon. They both have a lot of experience, especially in the Champions League. They just need to avoid each other and Celtic if they want to face each other in the final. I love Celtic. It is not easy for any team, especially in Celtic Park. The atmosphere is amazing. When you are a player, inside, playing against Celtic, it is a great atmosphere. It is still very close to the pitch, maybe only Liverpool has a similar atmosphere. That’s why it is very difficult to win in Celtic Park</p>

He would be suited to the Premier League.<br /><br />I think Lyon will receive offers from clubs across Europe for Nabil Fekir this summer. He has a lot of quality. He’s fast, he’s strong and he has a lot of quality. He has a profile that would fit the Premier League very well and I would be surprised if there weren’t attempts to sign him this year. Lyon have a fantastic academy and they are the best club for young players</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal legend Robert Pires has backed 17-year-old Yacine Adli to become a success at the club]</b> He’s a talented player. He has very good qualities, very fast with the ball. Sometimes he can score. I know Unai Emery likes this player. I don’t know what’s happened the last two days, but if he joins Arsenal, I think he will be a good player for the new squad. He’s young and it’s very difficult to leave your family, your country and find new players, new football and a new philosophy. It’s very difficult, very tough, that adaption. But I know Arsenal is like a family, so if he wants, he can make a success of his career at Arsenal. Everything is new and you need to adapt. New football, new teams. So for him, if he joins, at the beginning it’s very important to learn and watch what happens on the field because you need to learn every day.<br /><br />When you are young and you join Arsenal, the communication with the manager is very important. My time with Arsenal at the beginning was very difficult. Adaptation is very important and it was very long for me. But Arsene Wenger helped me during five or six months. I learned everything in France, I grew up in France, but England is not the same football. It’s very difficult, it’s very tough, very physical</p>

He’s a very good player<br /><br />It’s very difficult for me to compare. With Arsene Wenger it was very good. Unfortunately this page is finished so we need to focus on the present and prepare for the future. The present for Arsenal, especially for the fans, is to be passionate with Unai Emery. Of course he won with Sevilla and he won with Paris Saint-Germain, but this is a new challenge for him. It’s a new team, a new club, new football and the Premier League is more competitive. Maybe it will be difficult in the beginning but I think he can make a success with Arsenal. I believe in him.</p>

It is important he has learnt a lot with Roberto Martinez and when he used to play with Arsenal <b>[under Wenger]</b> and Barcelona with Pep Guardiola he learned a lot about this. It is a totally different thing to be a player and manager. It is not the same job. He can make a success because Titi loves football. He knows everything about football, the teams and the players.

He did well with Sevilla, he has won some titles, especially with Paris Saint-Germain last season.

He stands out for his professionalism and that helped Arsenal to win several titles. Honestly, it surprised me. For me, Sanchez had to stay at Arsenal, where he was one of our stars. I don’t know if he could say no to United, but I think the style of play of the London club suits his performances better. But you have to respect his decision.<br /><br />Yes, he’s going through a complex moment. The relationship with the manager is always important, but it’s notable that there are complications between Jose Mourinho and him. When you’re a United manager and you have players like Paul Pogba and Sanchez, you have to take care of them, because in the end the only important thing is for the team to win. When there are problems, the most important and complicated thing, at the same time, is to sit down to talk and say things face to face. Sanchez doesn’t deserve to be on the bench or stay at home. We’ll see if he finds a solution in January, because he is not playing and he has to do it, since he is a wonderful footballer</p>

I think Arsenal have found a new face, maybe with a new philosophy, because this guy is like a warrior. You can see him when he’s on the bench: he’s a little bit crazy, but good crazy.<br /><br />Maybe this is one of the differences between Arsene Wenger and Unai Emery. But management is very difficult, you need to find a good communication with the players. Sometimes Arsene is more quiet, Unai Emery is more - how do you say? - expressive. He wants to help, every minute, the players. You need to talk, you need to have good communication with the players. I think this is a new thing for them, but a good thing</p>

He is having a very tough time on and off the pitch at the moment, and there are a lot of questions about how settled he is in the dressing room and how appreciated he is by the fans. You can see that Bale is an unhappy player at the moment. I think coming back to the Premier League is the most logical step for Gareth Bale. There’s an assumption that he would go back to Tottenham, but I would encourage Arsenal to open the door to the Emirates for him. I know Tottenham fans would not be happy, but Bale would be very welcome at Arsenal. I hope the club tries to see if it is an option this summer.<br /><br />It would be very strange to see Arsenal sign Alexis Sanchez back in the summer. I don’t see how it makes sense for either Sanchez or Arsenal after how it ended. There’s no chance Sanchez will return to Arsenal. Sanchez isn’t playing his best football and he is on a lot of money at Manchester United which Arsenal are not willing to pay. Sanchez won’t want to come running back to Arsenal with his tail between his legs after having a rough time elsewhere. He will have to hope he returns to form with a fresh chance under <b>[Ole Gunnar]</b> <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> at Manchester United<br /><br /><b>[On Aaron Wan-Bissaka]</b> He’s exactly the type of player that would suit the attacking full-back role that Arsenal like to play and he would definitely improve the team next season. <b>[Hector]</b> Bellerin will have a long road to recovery and Arsenal won’t be wanting to rush him back in too quickly. There’s also the chance that his injury will be a recurring one so they need to have another full-back of the same high quality and I think Wan-Bissaka is that player</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal have been warned that selling Mesut Ozil would be a big step backwards]</b> It’s vital that Emery finds a space for Ozil in the first team. It would be a big step backwards for the club if they sell him. He recently extended his contract and there’s no arguing that he is one of, if not, the best player in Arsenal’s squad. There seems to be a communication breakdown between Emery and Ozil and whatever the issue is, it has been allowed to drag out over the season. For me, it’s vital that they put whatever’s happened behind them and they move on. If they put it behind them and start fresh next season, having Ozil behind <b>[Pierre-Emerick]</b> <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> and <b>[Alexandre]</b> Lacazette will be a formidable force. Arsenal have a fantastic box-to-box player in <b>[Aaron]</b> Ramsey, who will do the running for Ozil which allows him to focus on his own game. There’s no reason why Ozil shouldn’t be in the side.<br /><br />I’m upset that Ramsey is leaving Arsenal and it’s a shame the player and Arsenal couldn’t come to an agreement as he will be missed. The club and players have to respect his decision and I’m glad he still receives a warm welcome with the Arsenal fans as I feel he still has a key role to play in how this season will end up. Emery needs to utilise Ramsey as often as possible until he leaves in the summer and he’s key to Arsenal finishing in the top four this season. I think Ramsey has been excellent for Arsenal and I would be surprised if he wasn’t given a warm send-off from the fans and club. It’s a great chance for Ramsey to play with some new players, including the likes of <b>[Cristiano]</b> Ronaldo and I wish him the best of luck</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba may have eyed a move to Barcelona in the past]</b> I think Paul Pogba is the best player at Manchester United and has always had the potential to become the best midfielder in the world. Pogba has played very well and been almost unstoppable since <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> arrived at the club. He has been given more freedom, he’s encouraged to take more risks without fear and is playing further up the pitch. He’s a very good athlete and it’s not surprising to see him play like this when he is allowed to do so. It’s difficult to understand why Mourinho limited him so much when it’s clear to everyone how many attributes he has. He is an all-round midfielder who is also a leader in the dressing room. I don’t think Manchester United fans need to worry about Paul Pogba leaving the club. I think there was a time when he was eyeing a move to Barcelona and I wouldn’t be surprised if his agent still is, but the best thing Pogba could do would be to stay at Manchester United. I think he can continue to improve so much more at a club where he has stability and can be the main man on and off the pitch.</p>

  <p><b>[Zinedine Zidane is considered to be a warrior]</b> It’s a very strange situation with Chelsea and how they treat their managers. Sarri is a very good manager and he performed very well with Napoli, but it’s hard to see him at the club next season. There appears to be a lot of player power at Chelsea that he is struggling to overcome like many have before him. I think Zidane would be a very good appointment at Chelsea. He would demand respect from the Chelsea players and control the dressing room as a result of everything he has achieved both on the pitch as a player and on the bench as a manager. He’s a winner and a warrior. He’s had great success in the Champions League which is attractive to the Chelsea owner. It would be very good news for the Premier League if Zidane moved to England.<br /><br />I think Mbappe will win the Ballon d’Or, there’s no doubt about that. He is football’s next big star and could reach the same status as <b>[Cristiano]</b> Ronaldo and <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi. It’s a matter of when he will win the Ballon d’Or rather than if. He is very consistent and he is never injured. Mbappe always performs whether that’s in Ligue 1, Champions League or with the France national team. He maybe just needs Ligue 1 to get more recognition so he is appreciated more and as often as his performances deserve.</p>

Playing against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> at Wembley is a great stage for Jack. But not just him. This is a chance for Villa to win a big trophy and that would have a big effect on the rest of their season</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> legend Robert Pires reveals he wants to become a manager]</b> There are some who have made the decision to be a coach or sports director or to be a consultant. I took this route and it allows me to still be in football. But, I think coaching is a good job, even if it’s hard on a daily basis. I think that in the years to come, I will decide to take the coaching diplomas. And I plan to do it in Spain. I can’t say which team I’m going to coach. Honestly, I can’t choose. You can’t know where you’re going when you’re a coach. Let me give you the example of <a href="sabri-lamouchi.html">Sabri Lamouchi</a>, who is very happy in the Championship, in <a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a>. The coach puts himself on the market, and then he analyzes according to the proposals he receives. I could tell you that I’m going to train <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, Metz, Reims, <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> or <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a>, but no I can’t. Today is complicated</p>
