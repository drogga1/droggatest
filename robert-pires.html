Nobody knows how he managed to get the team into the 2006 World Cup final. The team crashed and burned right from the start of the Euro 2008 finals, yet he is still in charge. The game in Romania looks like a trap, but I expect he will escape from it. He is so lucky, I reckon Les Bleus will win on Saturday<br /><br />France’s young players no longer have any respect for their seniors, and the coach is solely to blame. He does things badly. But <a href="raymond-domenech.html">Domenech</a> has done anything but set them the right example with his theatrical antics and comments<br /><br />As the French FA dislikes revolutions, maybe <a href="raymond-domenech.html">Domenech</a>’s assistant, <a href="alain-boghossian.html">Alain Boghossian</a>, could take the top job - similar to the way Roger Lemerre took over from <a href="aime-jacquet.html">Aime Jacquet</a>. took over from <a href="aime-jacquet.html">Aime Jacquet</a>.

  <p><b>[Robert Pires on The Games That Changed My Life: October 9, 1996: France 4-0 Turkey]</b> Nobody else will remember this game, but it was my first goal for my country. It was a friendly at the <a href="psg.html">Parc des Princes</a>, which we won 4-0. It was an incredible moment in my life, not just my career, to wear Les Bleus’ colours and score with style<br /><br />My country has always been very important to me. I understand it was a friendly, but I was so happy to have all my family there to share such a moment with me<br /><br /><b>[October 17, 2000: Lazio 1-1 Arsenal]</b> I scored a good goal that got us an important draw in Italy<br /><br />This was significant not because it was my first goal for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, but because fans were starting to doubt that I had what it takes to play for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and replace <a href="marc-overmars.html">Marc Overmars</a>. It wasn’t easy - he’d scored that famous goal at Old Trafford to make him a fan favourite<br /><br />I scored a good goal that got us an important draw in Italy - something that let the supporters know I could help the Gunners win many trophies in the future. I just ran and ran, and finished well. You can see how relieved I was to prove myself!<br /><br /><b>[March 17, 2002: <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> 1-2 Arsenal]</b> We were struggling against a really good <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> side, but I scored one of my best goals at a crucial time to get us the victory that we needed. We were behind <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in the league table, and needed to go on a good run<br /><br />We had to win that game. I was through on goal, saw the size of <a href="peter-schmeichel.html">Peter Schmeichel</a>, and thought the only way to score was to chip him. I love scoring over big goalkeepers like that! People still ask me about that goal, but it was the win that mattered most<br /><br /><b>[May 17, 2003: <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> 1-0 Southampton]</b> When we got to the final we knew we had to win<br /><br />Nobody had retained <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup for a long time <b>[since <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> in 1982]</b>, and for us to do it - in a game when I scored the only goal of a very close match - was very special. The game wasn’t the most exciting I have ever played in, but I know how much it meant to the supporters to carry on winning things<br /><br />When we got to the final we knew we had to win and, for me personally, being the difference between the two teams on the day was important in my life<br /><br /><b>[November 13, 2004: <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> 4-5 Arsenal]</b> The atmosphere that day was something that I’ve never seen before in my career. The supporters of both clubs were always good in north London derbies, but this was something else, even though it was at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">White Hart Lane</a><br /><br />I think it’s one of the best matches <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has ever seen and it’s always replayed on my TV. I’ll never forget playing a part in a match that brought people so much excitement <b>[Pires scored the fifth goal after coming on as a substitute]</b>. If that game went on for longer, the goals wouldn’t have stopped going in - the attacking play was just so good by both sides</p>

  <p><b>[Robert Pires has said Arsenal manager Unai Emery must be given time to build his own side at the Emirates]</b> It is step by step. The manager now is Unai Emery. I think he had a very good season. For a first season, it was very difficult because the people, fans and media compare him with Arsene Wenger. And unfortunately we lost the final <b>[of the Europa League]</b> against Chelsea. But I think he’s a good manager for Arsenal. We need to say: ‘okay, you have the time - maybe you can build the team next season’, and the most important thing is to believe in the manager.<br /><br /><b>[Ljungberg was appointed as assistant first-team coach earlier this month]</b> I’m very happy for Freddie Ljungberg because he will join the staff with Unai Emery. This is a good decision from Arsenal. He did very well with the Arsenal Under-23s, by winning the title. He knows Arsenal, he knows high level <b>[football]</b>, he knows how you can win the title. When I saw the news, I was very happy for Freddie. That’s why I sent a message to him wishing him good luck for the new season. I think Arsenal need an ex-player like him to bring his experience and philosophy to the team<br /><br /><b>[Ljungberg was previously in charge of the club’s youth sides and Pires hopes the Swede’s promotion will help pave the way for the Gunners’s young talents]</b> Yes, maybe <b>[Ljungberg’s appointment will help]</b>. Because Arsenal have a very good academy. On this point, Ljungberg knows all the young players. Maybe during the pre-season, he will bring two to four players to play with the first team because we’ll have a very good pre-season in America with lots of very great games. So that’s why I think it’s important now to mix players with experience and the young players from the academy. A guy like Ljungberg is like a bridge, a very good bridge</p>

  <p><b>[Robert Pires claims <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> deserves a second shot at management and could get that opportunity in the Premier League]</b> I saw <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry</a> a few weeks ago for the game against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> at the Emirates and he is waiting. He is waiting for something, for the new challenge. Some people say ‘Yeah, but he was a mistake with Monaco’. I say no. When you start like this, like <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry</a>, if you have only three months it’s so difficult to prove something. And especially at this moment. Monaco were so bad, it was so difficult, they had a lot of injuries<br /><br />He told me it was a good experience with Monaco. Unfortunately only three months. But he’s ready. He’s ready for the new job and he’s waiting for something. I think he deserves to have a second chance, maybe in the Premier League<br /><br /><b>[While backing Henry to get back into management, Pires says that is not a move he is considering any time soon]</b> For the moment, no. It’s not in my plans. I think it’s a great job, a fantastic job. but it’s so difficult, so hard every day with the players, with the fans, with the media, with the owner. For the moment I’m involved with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, like an ambassador, and believe me it’s more relaxing and more quiet. For me it’s perfect. I love <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, I’m open to work with the first team, with <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> maybe one day but for the moment it’s not in the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> plans and I respect the decision</p>

  <p><b>[Robert Pires urges <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> to bring in homegrown talent]</b> The team needs so many ingredients in the squad. Physical, technical, some players with intelligence. Of course, we need leadership - and we need English players. We need English players because we are in England and nobody else has grown up with this mentality. You need to be born here. It’s very nice when you get to discover new countries but for me when you play in England you need English players. It’s a different time. But I used to play with <a href="david-seaman.html">David Seaman</a>, <a href="lee-dixon.html">Lee Dixon</a>, <a href="tony-adams.html">Tony Adams</a>, <a href="martin-keown.html">Martin Keown</a>, <a href="ashley-cole.html">Ashley Cole</a>, <a href="ray-parlour.html">Ray Parlour</a> … We’re talking about six English players in the team. We need similar players. Of course I respect the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> philosophy but we are in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and it’s so tough every weekend<br /><br /><b>[Pires sympathises with the manager’s current plight and insists he can still turn fortunes around between now and May]</b> My problem is I am always confident and optimistic when I talk about <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. This team has such quality. The squad can improve this situation. The most important thing now is that <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> needs to talk to the group to try to find a solution together. I hope they can, for the players, for the club, for the manager. I know he is having trouble. Unai is a good guy. He is a nice person. He is a good manager. He is under pressure, unfortunately. Fans can’t always appreciate the details of the situation but to be a manager is very difficult, especially when you work in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. You can be a manager in Spain, France or Italy but when you come to England the intensity is totally different. It is about the fight, the spirit. The intensity is extremely difficult</p>

But <b>[Emery]</b> is a competitor, he knows the high level.

The situation isn’t so good, but him and the players need to find the solution<br /><br />The target for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and for Unai is to finish in the top four because it’s very important for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to play again in the Champions League next season. I don’t know what will happen at the end of the season, especially for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>.

Everyone knows that <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> is one of the best managers in the world. He won lots of titles: Spain, Italy, and of course in the UK. In the UK, we know there is competition between <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> and Gunners, but this is football and I’m very sad for <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>. He is a great manager, only six months ago he got to the final of the Champions League. Unfortunately for him he lost against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and now he is sacked.

They are going to have to be patient but this is a little bit what has been happening since the start of the season. We are weak, we are not calm.

After Boxing Day, I thought they would fall apart anyway, and no the guys are still there physically.<br /><br />Today, technically <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has dipped a little.

You feel euphoric, invincible, which is normal. But when you lose, it’s a real blow. You’re not used to it. Psychologically, you take a hit, and you have to be careful afterwards.

But I think <a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a> is a player who would interest a lot of top clubs, like United, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. This has been a tough season for Villa, but I think <a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a> will take a lot from it. He has learned how to fight every weekend and we have all seen how much it means to him to play for the club. Playing against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> at Wembley is a great stage for Jack. But not just him. This is a chance for Villa to win a big trophy and that would have a big effect on the rest of their season</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal legend Robert Pires reveals he wants to become a manager]</b> There are some who have made the decision to be a coach or sports director or to be a consultant. I took this route and it allows me to still be in football. But, I think coaching is a good job, even if it’s hard on a daily basis. I think that in the years to come, I will decide to take the coaching diplomas. And I plan to do it in Spain. I can’t say which team I’m going to coach. Honestly, I can’t choose. You can’t know where you’re going when you’re a coach. Let me give you the example of <a href="sabri-lamouchi.html">Sabri Lamouchi</a>, who is very happy in the Championship, in Nottingham Forest. The coach puts himself on the market, and then he analyzes according to the proposals he receives. I could tell you that I’m going to train <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, Metz, Reims, Marseille or <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a>, but no I can’t. Today is complicated</p>
