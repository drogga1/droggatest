<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Ron-Robert Zieler on Silvio Gazzaniga’s <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup trophy]</b> In the changing room we were all proud; we took photos with the cup. The whole dressing room was full of people. The <a href="dfb.html">DFB</a> bosses came in and later the chancellor <a href="angela-merkel.html">Angela Merkel</a>. Normally we would have been silent and welcomed her. But we were so full of adrenaline we did not stop singing and jumping around the room, drinking alcohol and giving each other champagne showers. We only saw the cup and nothing else. While partying hard we realised that we all reached this one trophy every player of the world dreams of<br /><br />After that we had a big party with a lot of people in the hotel. I remember that <a href="per-mertesacker.html">Per Mertesacker</a> was dancing like crazy with the cup in his hands<br /><br />The trophy was secured by some security men, so nobody could steal it and take it to bed<br /><br />The party in Berlin was crazy! Thousands of people celebrated with us and were proud of us. There we felt how big the thing we reached was. Some bands were playing and we were behind the stage. Then we came out in groups and saw the people standing as far as we could see. Going out and presenting the trophy to the crowd was one of the best feelings of my life because it is a symbol of fulfilling your biggest dreams. It is the one cup everybody knows and everybody dreams of touching - if only for one time<br /><br />Holding it in your hands make you realise you wrote history that will never been forgotten</p>
