  <p><b>[Is it time to change the MLS All-Star Game format?]</b> I grew up watching the East versus West and all the different skills challenges and whatnot. In terms of the competition and playing some of the biggest clubs around the world, that part is obviously great. It’s exciting. We understand that they’re in their preseasons gearing up for their long seasons ahead. But at the same time I think its something to be said with the fact that the league has grown so much in, ultimately, such a short amount of time that you probably could get away with playing an East vs West and still have a fantastic game with a fantastic turnout. I think as these guys sitting next to me, their names alone speak volumes about how much the game has grown, and the attention they bring from the media and from the fans. I think it could go either way and I don’t think you’d have a drop in popularity and quality or anything like that.</p>

  <p><b>[Red Bulls dominate Atlanta United to show MLS they are the team to beat]</b> It was down to intensity, desire - we never got started. We never got into the game until the game was past us and we were chasing the game. High pressure or not, we knew what they were going to come with, we knew what to expect - we just never got into the game.</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT heads into Peru friendly with eye on keeping the ball]</b> For us to learn from the Colombia game in the sense of making sure we’re able to dictate the game a little bit on our terms and not let the game get away from us. It’s going to be important that we’re able to get on the ball and keep the ball for stretches at a time, and not just try to hit a home run pass within the first or second ball, then we turn the ball over and we’re defending again.</p>

  <p><b>[With playoffs looming, Atlanta United squanders first crack at MLS history]</b> We knew what this game meant for us, in terms of winning the shield and everything that came with it. We just didn’t show up. It’s rough at the minute. We didn’t expect this from ourselves. There will be some conversations, tough <b>[ones]</b>. We need to make sure we put things right and put this behind us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Excuses wearing thin as frustrated Pulisic &amp; USMNT fall flat against England]</b> We never got close to them. We never got close to guys, we allowed them too much time and space on the ball and they’re too good. They showed in the summer they’re a good team. Individually they’re good players, and then collectively they’re a good team. When you give them time and space, like we did, they’re going to pick you apart. The first half we defended for literally 45 minutes. I think we had one chance and that was it. In a game like this you’ve got to make sure you’re ready from the start. We were ready, we just never got up to the speed of the game<br /><br />Everyone’s probably eager to see who <b>[the next coach]</b> is. Not just the players, fans, Dave, everybody involved with U.S. Soccer. As a national team, of course, you want that direction and what not, but ultimately, when you step across that white line, to a certain extent, tactics go out the window and you’ve got to be able to play with a bit of desire and a bit of fight</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT keeper Brad Guzan reveals what he said to Wayne Rooney after preventing final England goal]</b> I just said, ‘Congratulations, you’ve had a fantastic career’. We shared some words in the tunnel afterwards. It’s been a good move for him going to America. He’s settled, his family really enjoy it, so I was pleased to be able to see him get back to playing with a smile on his face and enjoying his football<br /><br />He was appreciative. He talked about moving over from England, enjoying his time over there, coming into our league. He was appreciative of that, appreciative of the gesture, and ultimately us coming here<br /><br />I was saying to our defenders that obviously they were trying to get him to score, so we had to get close to him. It was as clear as day that they wanted him to score, so I said that to one of our centre-backs and he turned around and said, ‘I know they’re trying’. It’s a special night for him and his family. Full credit to the English FA for putting on a night like this for him. Listen, you’re not thinking about things like that <b>[spoiling Rooney’s night]</b>, you’re just trying to keep the score as low as possible. You laugh and joke about it afterwards but in the midst of the game you’re not really thinking about it. You’re just trying to keep the ball out</p>

  <p><b>[Attack-heavy Atlanta United rides defense to MLS Cup final]</b> We talked about being organized, talking to each other, communicating, and ultimately being intense, and getting in guys faces and making it difficult for our opposition, whether it was NYC or Red Bulls. From the start of this playoff run, we talked about being harder to play against, and tougher in all aspects of the game. We’ve shown that in four games now.</p>

  <p><b>[On Jeff Larentowicz and Michael Parkhurst]</b> It’s been good. I think those two guys in particular are great for us. You look at what Jeff has been able to do in this league for so long, so consistently, it’s something special. You look at Parky who was in the league, went overseas, came back and it’s like he never missed a beat. Those guys have played a huge part in us as a team.<br /><br />Obviously, Josef (Martinez) and Miguel (Almiron), some other guys, get the talk about them. but Parky and Jeff have been huge for us, especially with bringing the team together and doing the little things that don’t go noticed as much</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United hopes to send off humble, direct Martino with MLS Cup win]</b> There’s no added urgency because of Tata leaving or the rumors regarding any of our players or anything like that. There’s urgency because, when you’re in a cup final, you never know when you’ll have the opportunity to be in another one.</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United’s championship season sets lofty new standard for MLS]</b> It just took the right combination of city, of venue, of training ground, of players most importantly. And it all started with the vision from Arthur. He’s the man behind all of this. He thought that it could prevail: this sport, a team in this city. And it all started with a belief.</p>

  <p><b>[Miguel Almiron’s Atlanta legacy is secure even if MLS Cup was his final match]</b> His legacy, his impact on the game, on the team, on the city, it’s huge. Whatever happens with Miguel, we wish him all the best. He has been a fantastic servant of this club, of this city. He deserves everything that he’s going to get going forward in his career on an individual basis. So, couldn’t be happier for him - if this is the end for him - to be able to send him off as a champion.<br /><br />I think he’ll do fantastic in England</p>

  <p><b>[D.C. United goalkeeper Bill Hamid ruffled some feathers when he said in a recent interview that he is better than Atlanta United and long-time USMNT goalkeeper Brad Guzan. He backed up the talk with a shutout in Sunday’s 2-0 win against Guzan’s team. Guzan didn’t take kindly to the comments though]</b> When you hear things like that, being a goalkeeper in this league or across the world, there’s something about being a part of the goalkeepers union. Having respect for your colleagues. Having respect for the position. Carrying yourself in a professional way. Some of us maybe lack in some of those areas</p>
