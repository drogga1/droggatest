  <p><b>[Hermann Gerland on when <a href="philipp-lahm.html">Philipp Lahm</a> as 17]</b> Lahm was a perfect footballer even at that age. But no one wanted him. I offered him out on loan. One manager even wanted me to reimburse him for the petrol money he had spent to come and watch Philipp because he was unimpressed. A few years later I met the same manager in Berlin so I took out my wallet and said: ‘Now, young man, how much did you want for that trip?’</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> assistant coach Hermann Gerland on <a href="philipp-lahm.html">Philipp Lahm</a>]</b> You can play him wherever you want and he’ll be flawless. He is one of the world’s best players. He’s maintained an incredible level for the last 12 years. He has still never been Player of the Year, though, and that’s a catastrophe. He’s outstanding in 55 out of 60 matches per season, but that’s never been recognised</p>

  <p>Lahm was already perfect when he was 17. He could do it all, there was nothing left for me to teach him. Philipp never played a bad game for me. He is incapable of playing badly<br /><br /><b>[Hesse points out Germany’s fall from grace after Lahm’s international retirement following the World Cup win]</b> From one day to the next, he <b>[manager <a href="joachim-low.html">Joachim Low</a>]</b> had to make do without one of the best defensive midfielders in the world, one of the best left-backs in the world, the best right-back in the world and his right-hand man on the pitch, a player whose understanding of the game is so faultless that the most famous coach in the world has called him the most intelligent footballer he’s ever worked with. These four key figures are called Philipp Lahm</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich assistant coach Hermann Gerland has paid tribute to Philipp Lahm ahead of the defender’s final game]</b> I still have strong memories of his first match for my team, when our reserves faced Burghausen in the Regionalliga Sud. We won 2-1, and Philipp played, well, as he always does: he turned in a flawless display.<br /><br />As reserve coach I enjoyed the two years with him, and I’d have liked to enjoy him longer. But it would have been disastrous not to let him play in the Bundesliga, it just wasn’t possible. Arranging that wasn’t easy. Renowned coaches declined until Felix Magath accepted. Two years ago I ran across a scout working for a Bundesliga club. I’d recommended Philipp to him back then. We talked, and he told me: ‘I’ve watched Philipp Lahm and seen the same things you’ve seen, that he’s an outstanding player. But my people didn’t believe me.’ That’s a nice little story<br /><br />Philipp was able to play in the Champions League <b>[by joining Stuttgart]</b>. After only three months he was the best man on the pitch against Manchester United, so Alex Ferguson wanted to sign him. That says it all</p>

  <p><b>[The lack of players coming through the youth system]</b> We want to be able to bring a talent to the first team every two years, Obviously, every year would be even better! The conditions are first class; now we have to produce first-class talents. We need talent with rough edges. Everyone must want the ball. Our motto is: ‘Don’t give the opponent any time to think’. I can promise you this: I will give it everything. And all who don’t give it everything have no business here. It’s that simple.</p>
