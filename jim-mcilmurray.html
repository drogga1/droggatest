  <p><b>[The documents, which had been misfiled with the Ulster Defence Regiment by the UK Government. They had recently been uncovered about the torture of ‘hooded men’]</b> These documents show that torture was discussed at the highest level with the knowledge of Heath. Because of this documentation the case is very much black and white. The UK Government had lied about its knowledge and six months prior to internment had ordered a special unit to carry out torture<br /><br /><b>[Mr McIlmurray said that Mrs Clooney was an excellent lawyer who was a great addition to the team but hoped her presence would not turn the case into a circus]</b> Unnamed sources tell me that Mr Clooney has rediscovered his Irish roots and is embracing them. But I couldn’t tell you if this has influenced Mrs Clooney … and I don’t know whether he is coming to Belfast as well. We have to be careful to keep this professional</p>
