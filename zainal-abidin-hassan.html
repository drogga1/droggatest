  <p>[Zainal Abidin Hassan has been brought in by Penang to save them from relegation to the Premier League] I have to concentrate on what i have and the players will get their chance before we make a decision on them. I know most of the players. I got a tough job to get their morale and spirit high. i know they are capable of better. I’m thankful for the chance and hopefully we’ll bring back happier days to Penang</p>

  <p>[Zainal Abidin Hassan is optimistic and confident ahead of their game against the Fighters] Training and preparations are going well and I am confident that we can show a good performance. However, I am sweating over the fitness of four of our players for this game.</p>

  <p>[Zainal urges his team to keep their winning momentum, and warn them about Kelantan in-form striker Mohamed Ghaddar] For me, we must pay attention to Ghaddar, Badhri Razi and Indra Putra. We must not let them to have a shot or any attempt at our goal. Even though we won against Felda United before, it doesnt mean that we can take this game lightly because we know Kelantan play at a really high tempo.<br /><br />The last two games for the first round of Super League for us are like a do-or-die missions if we want to book a spot in the Malaysia Cup. I am confident that the players will give their 100% focus when we face Kelantan this Saturday and JDT next week</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Zainal says he will tweak his tactics to surprise their opponents, as well as because of injuries] The first round win is already history and I have to change my tactics as they [Felda] are already familiar with our gameplay. But I am concerned by the absence of several key players due to injuries, which may disrupt the plans that I’ve worked on in order to collect the all three points</p>
