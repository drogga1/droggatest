  <p><b>[Harry Maguire has suggested that he is ready to ignore interest from the likes of Manchester United by stating a trophy ambition at Leicester]</b> I look back at the start of the season when I had a few options in where to sign and I’m delighted with my choice. I’ve come to a great club, with a great set of fans, who believe in me ever since I’ve come to the club, so I’m thankful of that. I’m lucky to be at this club and hopefully I can continue to push on up. Every year first and foremost, we want to stay in the Premier League. We feel like we’ve got enough ability to stay in that comfortably now, so we need to start to look up, rather than down. Next season, I think the aim is to beat the points tally that we finish on and we need to go on a cup run and hopefully bring some silverware back to the club and give the fans something to go out with happy</p>

  <p><b>[England defender Kyle Walker was bemused by the decision to give a penalty against him in the first half of the Three Lions’ World Cup triumph over Tunisia]</b> The first half we should have been clear. We conceded a soft penalty - we knew we didn’t want to concede the next goal. We kept our shape and ‘H’ has done it again. It was really warm, we wanted to start really well and we did. We missed clear-cut chances that you don’t get much at this level. We knew we’d get more chances and it’s come right at the death.<br /><br /><b>[On Harry Kane not winning a penalty after he appeared to be wrestled to the ground in both the first and second half]</b> It was as much a penalty as they got. You know ‘H’ is always in the right place at the right time and when he gets that chance he’ll take it. I had a couple of nervy passes in the first half - it’s a big occasion and your first game at this high pressure. You have to focus and concentrate and I feel I grew into the game. It’s a massive three points and we can now build some momentum</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Maguire has confirmed that Manchester United did try to sign him over the summer]</b> Obviously going into a World Cup there was always going to be interest if we were as successful as we were. There were always going to be players who came under interest, as that is part and parcel of the game. I spoke with Leicester after a bit of interest from clubs, and they reiterated that I wasn’t for sale and I respected that decision. They gave me an opportunity to play in the Premier League, when I had just been relegated with Hull. They gave me that opportunity and it is a club I am really enjoying my time at. I am playing week in and week out which is important to me. They have given me the platform to play at the World Cup so I feel I owe them and I respect that decision. Now I am looking forward to the season.</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Maguire admits he does not understand the UEFA Nations League concept]</b> It is quite confusing - I don’t know what you guys think of it? The boss tried to explain it to us the best he could the other day. I think he has got his head around it now, but it took a lot of studying. It is confusing, but we are trying to get our heads round it. For us players, we just go into each game trying to win it and see where it takes us. So we will see after the game.<br /><br />I still see little clips now and again, and you get that little bit of a buzz and you still have the memories, but I still have that bit inside me which is a bit disappointed. It does make me feel a little bit gutted at times to think how close we were. We had one foot in the final of a World Cup so if you look back at that game it is disappointing. But then you look at the experience and what we did for the country, everyone getting right behind us, and it was something really special and something we want to do again in the future</p>

I played every game in the Premier Leageue and to make a World Cup squad and to reach a semi-final is something that I am really proud of.<br /><br />From the summer I think maybe just the experience of playing in the big games at the World Cup, playing in the high-pressure games. I haven’t done that so far in my career so to go out there, play in a World Cup and play under the pressures that were there, gives me great belief that I can go on and have another good season<br /><br />After the World Cup I came back and sat down with the owners and they reiterated what they wanted me to do. They wanted to reward me for a great season and obviously a successful World Cup with England. I’m looking forward to the future now and to see where we can go as a club</p>

We were not at our best and got punished for it<br /><br /><b>[While the defender conceded that it takes time for the squad to jell, he urged his team-mates to adapt to the demands of international football]</b> You are wanting to develop partnerships. Sometimes in international level you can’t really do that. You have players who aren’t playing for their clubs so they don’t get selected, and you have players that pick up injuries. You’ve got to adapt. That’s one of the tricky parts of playing international football. Every camp you’re normally playing alongside <b>[someone new]</b> - you don’t want to be - and need to develop new partnerships. But listen, there’s no excuses. <b>[The defence]</b> need to be better. We need to be better going forward. We need to be better on the ball. And we certainly need to be better at keeping the ball out of the net<br /><br /><b>[Brabec’s equaliser came from a corner less than five minutes after <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> opened the scoring, while Ondrasek capitalised on <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a>’s attempted pass to Rose]</b> The first goal was a set-play and we probably need to tighten up on those. We’ve been really good over the last year or so at defending set-plays. The second goal has come from us being a bit too open when we were trying to build up from the back and maybe it was at a stage of the game when we shouldn’t have looked to do that. We could have consolidated the point and tried to play in their half a bit more. So maybe better game management would have helped us, at worst, draw the game 1-1</p>

I apologised to him and it was nice that the referee saw sense<br /><br />It was a solid performance. We knew we had to get the win to close the gap. It’s a big three points. This season we’ve been far too inconsistent. We’ve let ourselves down when the pressure has been on to break teams down.

  <p><b>[Harry Maguire says <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a> took the philosophy of defending to another level]</b> I’ve always looked up to two centre-backs really: <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> and <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a>. <b>[They were]</b> two centre-backs who when I was growing up were playing week in, week out, winning big trophies, winning big games and playing for England as well. <b>[They were]</b> the main centre-backs for England. I think Rio took the philosophy of defending to another level. <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> was always good on the ball. He had the range of passing, left and right foot, but I think Rio took the philosophy of you do have to start bringing the ball out from the back, stepping in and committing players. He was really great to watch and from my era that’s the person I’d probably say made me open my eyes and think that’s what you need to be a top, top centre-back in terms of you’ve got to start helping your attackers as well. Like I’ve said, the main thing is defending but the bonus of playing through the lines and playing good passes to start attacks is important too<br /><br />The best thing is just to be calm and composed and trust your ability. A lot of dribbles start with good defending, in terms of intercepting passes, but I can manipulate the ball quite well, especially for a big lad. It’s something that I’ve always had as part of my game. I do like to dribble the ball out and start attacks off. It sets the tempo for our team. <b>[Rio]</b> probably did it most out of anyone, and it was quite unusual at the time, but he really stood out when he did it</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Maguire says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> have been sloppy, not all over the place]</b> We need to build on clean sheets. It is a foundation. If we keep a clean sheet, it is a cliché, but, if you keep a clean sheet, it gives you every chance of going on and winning the game. Eight in 10. Defensively, all season, we have not been a team that has been all over the place and conceding numerous chances. We have never been that team. We have conceded sloppy goals at sloppy moments. Set-plays, long-range shots, special goals but, lately, we have cut it out. We have been defending set-plays and I can tell you that is a big bonus. It is the key to start picking up good results and that is what we have done<br /><br />We don’t want to be a team that gives up possession really easily. In terms of the game, the way it panned out when they had the ball, we as a back-line, I didn’t feel under threat. I didn’t feel there was any need for me to start telling the full-backs or centre-halves to start jumping more, or trying to start putting pressure on higher up the pitch because we were 1-0 up and didn’t feel under threat in terms of them creating chances. But we don’t want to be a team that doesn’t have a lot of the ball. We want to be a team that controls the game, especially at home. It is something we can work on, on the ball. But they created pretty much nothing and it was a solid display.<br /><br />We dug in deep out there. Don’t get me wrong - we can play better than that. We know that. We can play better on the ball especially. Without the ball, we pressed them really well, the midfield and forwards ran tirelessly for the team and didn’t give them a sniff to get their head up and create a chance. The back-line defended our box really well. But, with the ball, we can do better and we know we can do better. However, it is a big win against our rivals. It is nice to do the double over them but, most importantly, it is a big three points to close the gap on where we want to be at the end of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Maguire admits challenging for top-four finishes is not enough for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> You can see from the start of the season that we look a lot more like a team. You can see where we want to be and where we want to head. I knew when I first came to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> that Ole had said loads that it’s a building process but we will get to where we want to be. I can see where we are heading and the style that he wants to implement on the team. Don’t get me wrong, there are plenty of aspects that we still need to improve to get to the top, where we want to be. We don’t like challenging for the Champions League spots, we want to be challenging for titles. We know there is still a lot of improvement to be made, but we feel like we’re on the right track and I’m sure eventually we’ll get there<br /><br />Playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, every game is so big. I knew before coming to the club having spoken to ex-players - I spoke to <a href="jonny-evans.html">Jonny Evans</a> a lot, who recommended an unbelievable club - it’s more than a club. You have seen the way they have acted during this crisis, how classy they have been, it’s more than a football club, it’s something that works well in the community.<br /><br />It’s been a great run of form for clean sheets.

One thing we have shored up on at the moment is set-plays. You look back at our record before this run of clean sheets, defending set-plays we were up there with one of the worst in the league. If you do that and aren’t scoring from them at the other end, you aren’t going to stand a chance in getting where you want to go because they are such a big part of the game. It’s just gelled together more. It’s a new back four. We have got a settled back four</p>

  <p><b>[club captain Harry Maguire says <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> has shown himself to be a leader at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> First and foremost it’s a great privilege to be <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> captain. I have to look after my own game, making sure I’m performing at my level and then look after the team. I think it’s important as a captain that you put the team before your own performance, but you have to be on the pitch to implement that. Around the place, we have got a number of leaders now. Bruno has come in and shown himself to be a leader. We have got a leadership group with a lot of experienced pros so we are all trying to help. It’s something that I want to make sure this club goes forward and gets back to where it should be<br /><br />In the six months where I worked with Ash, he was brilliant as a captain. He had great authority around the place, he had great respect. I didn’t expect Ashley to move on in January, but I wish him all the best and I did learn a lot from him in that short space of time<br /><br />He’s been brilliant since he’s come in. He’s been brilliant off the field around the training field. He’s hungry, he wants to win. You can tell he’s been brought up with that attitude. He’s just given us that little bit more life, a bit more creativity in the middle. It’s a start. There are lots of aspects of his game that I’m sure he’ll want to improve and I’m sure he will get better for this club. We have got Paul <b>[<a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>]</b> to come back as well, who will lift his game even more. There is good competition for places in that central midfield now</p>

I would say that, at times this year, as a team, we have probably let ourselves down by being a bit too inconsistent. Not just for a full game but during games. There have been times when we’ve been so good in games and then we’ve come off it a bit and been punished. So I’d say our toughest opponent is ourselves. We need to be mentally strong. We are a young group but we don’t really want to use that as an excuse. We want to be young but play mature.

I think as a club, you should have a captain and rely on him but you need to spread the onus of the leadership in the group. Marcus is there and he battles through every game, obviously he’s missing through a bad injury at the moment but he’s battling hard to get back and he’s very rarely missing games. He’s always wanting to make himself available. I think you can see around the place and on and off the field as well, he’s excellent with his charity work, which is great to see.

It seems such a safe environment. It’s our first day back today, but it seems so safe and everyone is respecting it so well, so long may that continue and I’m sure no one will have any problems. There is a lot less people at the training ground when we go in. Today <b>[Wednesday]</b> I was in a group of four, working with one coach, so not many people. You’ve got a lot space, big areas, not going really close to anyone, but the main thing is getting the work in and it was a tough session, <b>[then]</b> go home and now I’m relaxed and it’s all in the bank and I’m looking forward to tomorrow.<br /><br />The safety, it seems really well organised. We all got tested before we came in, so everyone in the changing room has a negative test. Every morning we get our temperature taken before we get to the training ground, so obviously they’re checking the temperature. We all have an app where we fill in to see if we’ve had any symptoms throughout the day. It’s such a safe environment and it’s an environment which is there to be built on. At the moment we’re all just taking it phase by phase, step by step, and that’s the only thing we can do at the moment. I think it’s just taking it day by day. Like I said, the main thing is getting the physical work into our legs and it helps you mentally as well: being at the training ground and seeing familiar faces<br /><br />Well, first and foremost, it’s the first step. I think at this moment in time we’ve just got to take it step by step. We’re in phase one, let’s get through this phase without any troubles. I’m sure with the way things are set up and organised that should be done and then hopefully we can move into phase two and go from there. It’s step by step, it’s day by day. It’s only the first day, but it’s been a good start for me. To see the organisation has been really pleasing</p>

We were really poor in the first half. No doubt about it, it was one of our poorest first halves of the season. We managed to find ourselves two goals down but then got in a great position and looked like we were going to win. They didn’t really create any chances in the last 20 or 30 minutes of the game and then, obviously with the last kick, they found space and it was a good finish from Oli McBurnie. In the end, it was a tough result to take but I don’t think we deserved any more on the day than a point. We weren’t good enough and know we have to perform better in this game<br /><br />It’s disappointing not to play in front of your fans but, one day, they’ll be back. And, when they’re back, I am sure the atmosphere is going to be even better and louder than it normally is at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> - if you can beat that. We’re going to miss the fans. Home and away, they follow in great numbers and the support is incredible. But we know they’re going to be in front of their TV screens, watching us, shouting us along, and the main thing is we want to put smiles back on their faces.<br /><br />Maybe it does take away the home fans making the atmosphere uncomfortable for the away team, but it’s still about the 11 players who turn up on the day. There is enough talent in our squad to go and beat anyone. We’re fully focused on ourselves and are not looking at it being home or away. We’re just seeing every game as a chance to try to get the three points and perform at our best</p>
