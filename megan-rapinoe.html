I think it forced us individually, and as a team, to figure it out, and everyone who has figured it out is now narrowed into this group here at qualifying and we’re working well with each other. It was challenging and sometimes frustrating, but we’re out on the other side of it and much better for it</p>

You have to build a solid business and oftentimes women’s sports has just bootstrapped so hardcore and the budgets are so tight that you can’t expect to have a business and increase your budget like a half a percent every year. That’s just not going to work.<br /><br /><b>[Rapinoe spotlighted two teams, one at home and one abroad, who can be examples for other owners to follow]</b> I think that teams like the Utah Royals, teams like Lyon really put an investment in it and then the product on the field can grow with the product off the field<br /><br />It’s exciting to have these huge crowds and the game growing as much as possible but I think the next step needs to be taken, otherwise you’re just going to get these exciting moments that don’t have any way to really be fully realized or sustained.

I feel very fortunate to be in this country, I’d never be able to do this in a lot of other places but also, that doesn’t mean that we can’t get better, that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t always strive to be better.

  <p><b>[Rapinoe was among the players to voice their anger regarding U.S. Soccer’s wording following Wednesday’s win]</b> We’ve sort of felt that those are some of the undercurrent feelings that they’ve had for a long time. But to see that as the argument, as blatant misogyny and sexism as the argument against us, is really disappointing<br /><br />But I just want to say, it’s all false. To every girl out there, to every boy out there, who watches this team, who wants to be on this team, or just wants to live their dream out, you are not lesser just because you’re a girl. You are not better just because you’re a boy<br /><br />We’re all created equal and should all have the equal opportunity to go out and pursue our dreams, and for us that means playing on the soccer field. So, everything that was in that deposition, what they said in the argument is just not true. Don’t ever believe that</p>

  <p><b>[Rapinoe continues Trump feud by labeling U.S. President as ‘white nationalist’]</b> I think we know that immigration does not cause loss of jobs. Immigration is actually good for the economy. We know that women in the workforce is good for the economy. We know that equality is good for the economy. We know that mass incarceration is bad for the economy. We know that mass incarceration is bad for society and ends up costing us more money in the long run, the war on drugs, whatever it may be. I think that that has proven to be really detrimental. Now, obviously, we have a white nationalist, I think, in the White House and the spewing of hate and the ‘othering’ of the rest of the country has only led to more strife between people and more despair and more anxiety and more fear going forward. There’s been nothing to ease <a href="donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a>’s base, really. There’s been nothing, it’s not like he’s given them a bunch of jobs. It’s not like he’s made life really better for them, he’s just given them this false reason why maybe they’re not happy with their lives. There’s been no sort of path forward<br /><br /><b>[Rapinoe said the idea of a political career still seems wild but she’s not going to shut the door on it]</b> I mean, President, of course. If I’m going to do, I want the biggest, baddest post. That way, I can be the president, but then I get to pick everyone else who’s way smarter and way more qualified and way better at everything to actually do the thing. I’m not here being like ‘I’m the smartest, I should be the president.’ I’m actually like ‘I’m wholly unqualified for probably any position in government,’ but I’ve got that little bit of humility where I can be like ‘You’re smarter, you do this, you do this, you do this.</p>
