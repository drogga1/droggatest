  <p>[Paris Saint-Germain’s former head of youth recruitment Marc Westerloppe believes it is now up to <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> where he plays for France] I think it’s mostly up to him to know where he wants to play. When you have a player like him, you have to put him in the best possible conditions. There are not fifty other players like him. Football has evolved and today, in the 4-3-3, we have players who play as false wingers to make a difference directly in the game. When you play alone at the tip of the attack, it is now a little more complicated as the ball does not always arrive. When you have the qualities of Kylian, it’s a shame, because he needs to touch the ball. Kylian has tremendous potential and he has already proven that he is able to be effective for France without having a lot of experience.<br /><br />It is important for him to keep his energy so he can play the final ball in attack. He needs freedom, he is a player who asks for the ball to feet and makes the difference with a goal, assist or run. Would he always be consistent and efficient if he defended like he attacks? Kylian is a player who likes to touch the ball - he can’t stay ten minutes without one. That’s why it’s important for him to play in a team that controls the game</p>
