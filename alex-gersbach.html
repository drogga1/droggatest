  <p><b>[Alex Gersbach believes the expectation of perfection at Rosenborg is ideal for him]</b> We won the Super Cup and then we won the first four league games, and with 12 points after four games, top of the league, and the fans weren’t happy because we weren’t playing particularly well, apparently. No, like the rhythm and stuff wasn’t quite there but we were winning tough games, which I thought was a good thing, you know, we were winning when we playing bad. The last two games have been a little bit better, I think, but the fans put a lot of pressure on the club and they want us to qualify for the Champions League like in the golden days<br /><br />I think it’s perfect, to be honest. You want to be playing at a big club and Rosenborg is a big club. It’s the biggest club in Norway and they’ve got big expectations and big goals, so it’s the perfect place to be<br /><br />I’ve been struggling a little bit with a hamstring problem but it hasn’t stopped me from training or playing. I played the Super Cup and started the first four league games and my form wasn’t great, to be honest, but we won those four games and then I was dropped for the fifth game and I came on after about 15 minutes and played the rest of that game, and I thought that was probably my best game of the season so far. Then I wasn’t picked the next weekend, which was a bit disappointing, but that’s part of it being at a big club. You know, you’ve really got to fight for your position</p>

  <p><b>[Rosenborg’s recruitment of Nicklas Bendtner underlines the Norwegian club’s desire to replicate their golden era and return to the Champions League]</b> The signing of Nicklas Bendtner shows we want to play in Europe and I think we’re going to have a decent shot this year. I think it’s a really good move for him <b>[Bendtner]</b>. It’s courageous for him to come here to Norway and leave everything else behind, and he’s sort of starting fresh, I guess, and I think so far it’s working out really well for him and I think it’ll get even better from here.<br /><br />I think he’s calmed down a lot now. He’s actually a really nice guy and he’s fun. He’s always laughing, he’s always making jokes, so he’s really good to have around the change room. He doesn’t really have an ego. You’d expect a player like that to be cocky and arrogant, but he’s genuinely a nice guy.<br /><br />Bendtner’s the best player I’ve played with. The media made a big splash about <b>[him when he signed]</b> and so they should. He’s a top-class player and you can see at training and during the games that he’s played at a high level</p>
