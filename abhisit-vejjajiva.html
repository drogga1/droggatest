  <dd>Democrat Party leader and former prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva (centre) arrives at Bangkok criminal court in Bangkok. A Thai court has dismissed murder charges against former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva linked to a bloody crackdown on protesters in 2010. Mr Abhisit was Thailand’s leader when anti-government ‘red-shirt’ protesters blockaded Bangkok for 10 weeks. In the end the military moved to end the stand-off. Over 90 people, mostly civilians, died during the protests. The 2010 protesters supported <a href="thaksin-shinawatra.html">Thaksin Shinawatra</a>, the prime minister removed by the military in 2006. It was under his sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, that proceedings were brought against Mr Abhisit. Prosecutors said Mr Abhisit and his deputy prime minister at the time, Suthep Thaugsuban, were responsible for authorising the use of live fire against protesters. Both men rejected the charges. The Criminal Court ruled that it could not hear the case because the two men had held public office at the time and were acting under an emergency decree</dd>

  <p><b>[Having recently been criticised for toeing a conservative line]</b> The Thai Democrat Party is preparing to propose ideas in line with a liberal democracy for the country to move forward with people’s participation, in accordance with our core values. The new generation must work with the old generation, but the party must change too<br /><br /><b>[He stressed that his party represents a significant shift away from the bureaucracy of the current regime and the populism of the Pheu Thai Party. The Democrats will focus on a sustainable system that emphasises welfare and civil rights]</b> There are a lot of gaping holes in the current constitution, which has failed to curtail corruption or deliver true reform. After the election, politicians must work transparently and diligently to fix the constitution and restore Thai people’s faith in democracy<br /><br />The Muslim community has played a very important role in our party’s progression. One who made a significant impact which none of us will forget was Surin Pitsuwan, a believer and protector of democracy. His son <b>[Fuadi Pitsuwan]</b> is more than qualified to carry on Mr Surin’s legacy, but he has promised to complete his PhD before joining us</p>

  <p><b>[Thai Democrat Party open to coalition that moves in right direction]</b> If we win a significant number of seats <b>[and are]</b> able to try to form a majority in the lower house, we would approach parties we feel we can work with. If we don’t do so well in the election, we have to consider whether we would join any kind of coalition. The criteria for me is that we will only join a government that we feel will take the country in the right direction. We won’t join a government for the sake of being in power<br /><br /><b>[Although ASEAN has its own plans for enhancing connectivity within the region, these are being overshadowed by China’s Belt and Road Initiative]</b> Over the last five or six years, we hardly see ASEAN taking advantage. It’s more China addressing us. I think ASEAN should be dealing with China and the Belt and Road Initiative as a bloc rather than as individual countries<br /><br /><b>[He also has a bone to pick with big overseas companies in ASEAN]</b> We should be asking friends and partners to collectively speak to some of the big tech multinationals … that are doing a lot of business in the region without actually contributing back to these economies<br /><br />Most of the advertisement <b>[revenue]</b> goes to these companies, and they are not paying taxes. As an individual country, we can only do so much. As a bloc of 10 countries with our partners, we can perhaps come up with an arrangement whereby these companies <b>[have]</b> to make contributions to the region<br /><br /><b>[A summit of leaders from ASEAN and East Asian nations in Pattaya in April 2009 was called off as hundreds of demonstrators pushed their way past security into the venue]</b> Obviously, we would not want a repeat of what happened. Despite the difficulties, I managed to get ASEAN a seat on the G-20<br /><br /><b>[Abhisit sees the Pheu Thai as his main competitor]</b> Our main rival has proved time and time again that they practice a brand of democracy that is illiberal and allows the use of populist tactics to make a creeping authoritarianism set in. <b>[Aiming to gain votes from the poor, the Pheu Thai government led by Yingluck before a 2014 coup offered pork-barrel measures for rice farmers and first-time car buyers]</b> Many of the programs that they implemented <b>[have]</b> proven to be failures or unsustainable<br /><br /><b>[Abihsit gave the junta partial credit for how it has ruled, but also emphasized its policy missteps]</b> The biggest achievement from the current government has been to restore stability to the political situation, obviously with availability of special powers. The infrastructure projects that this government has initiated, we mostly support. But there needs to be better implementation.<br /><br />Clearly the economy has underperformed. We are currently growing at a rate lower than most … countries in the region. Many people in rural areas and the agricultural sector even had their incomes decrease for the last four years</p>
