His talent is innate although he works a lot. In training he does things that are out of the norm. Sometimes he dribbles past everyone as if we were nothing more than cones, including me</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona’s Samuel Umtiti has promised to try and convince France team-mate Antoine Griezmann to join him at Camp Nou]</b> We have already seen what he can do at Atletico, he is a world-class player. If the opportunity to sign him is there I will tell him not to hesitate, and to come to Barca.<br /><br /><b>[Gerard]</b> Pique has explained to us what has been happening. He is a very intelligent person, a brave guy. But after all that he is still focused. It was vital to win, even if other things were going on. It was strange but the only option open to us was to win. Life is like that sometimes. There was no need to convince Pique and Sergi Roberto, it was the president’s decision to play and they understood. Everyone understood<br /><br /><b>[Umtiti also had warm words for Lionel Messi]</b> I don’t want to think about having to defend against him at the World Cup. He is the best player in the world, he makes all the difference. Whether he wins titles or not, he is the best. There is no debate on that. He never lets you down</p>

  <p><b>[Samuel Umtiti has revealed that he is happy at Barcelona and suggested he is trying to convince Antoine Griezmann to join him at the club]</b> With Griezmann, I put myself in agent mode! It’s true that we talk a lot about it, but it was just to know what he thinks of Barca. If he comes, we will play with six attackers<br /><br />Barcelona was the club of my dreams, I joined them when I was 22. It was exceptional. And now, every day, I’m happy, whether it’s a match or in training. Xavi thinks I’m the best central defender in the world? I’ve heard that, I’m very grateful, he’s a very smart player, he knows football, he knows what he’s saying. As a central defender it’s very important to have that intelligence and to know how to get the ball out. In Barcelona I can take the risks without losing a lot of balls and help the team to move forward</p>

In this world, everything goes so quickly. I’m happy and very proud to play for Barca.<br /><br /><b>[On his release clause]</b> It’s not very big, everyone knows that. But it’s not something that interests or worries me. I am focused on the pitch, that’s what I enjoy. The rest will come</p>

I just play, try to do things right. This is the most important thing for me. I try to do it for a club like Barca, and continue to do it. As for everything else, these are things that come out in the press. Some are true, others wrong, but I just focus on football.<br /><br />It’s not only Manchester United, other clubs want me as well, but my sole focus is on Barcelona. Negotiations for a contract renewal have not started yet. My release clause is low, but that’s not what I worry about, I focus on the pitch</p>

My situation? I don’t think it’s going to disturb me too much because it’s been going on for a few months and I had to finish a season like this. I think it’s important to settle these cases before the start of the competition and for my part it will be done.<br /><br /><b>[On Antoine Griezmann]</b> Antoine Griezmann is a fantastic player, he would be very important in any group.

  <p><b>[Samuel Umtiti has claimed that Barcelona will have to throw him out the door in order for a summer switch to be made]</b> I’m at a club that allowed me to realise my dream of playing there. I’m still under contract at the moment. So for me to leave, either they throw me out the door or I decide to leave.<br /><br />We know that our job will be very important. During the last meetings, we were able to get a run of matches together - whereas we rarely played together before that. It’s about finding automatic reflexes in central defence, because sometimes you don’t have the time to talk to each other and to know how the other plays or perceives certain situations. You need games and dialogue. Raphael is someone who’s very intelligent. He plays for one of the biggest clubs in the world. So I don’t think we’ll have any problems in finding a way of complementing each other</p>

The act of signing will take place Monday, at 10 a.m. in the Camp Nou, and later the player will speak to the media.

  <p><b>[Neymar and Kylian Mbappe are made to play together]</b> Neymar was a very good team-mate to have when he was at Barcelona. He’s somebody who is always full of joy, who is always happy and who is always playing pranks and making jokes. We know all about Neymar’s qualities. He can unlock any match. He is <b>[playing]</b> at an exceptional level. Neymar together with Kylian Mbappe … players of their talent are made to play together. There is no reason why it should not work.<br /><br /><b>[On World Cup]</b> I think about the World Cup title every single day. When I pick up my phone, I see it as it is my wallpaper. It is true that I think about it all the time, even when I speak with my family or team-mates who shared these moments with me. We had a wonderful squad. Honestly, I could have spent two more months with them. It was fun, but at the same time, also serious. It is all well and good to have won the World Cup but there were other things behind it too. You have to stay focused and not try to be somebody else<br /><br />I would like to go into coaching. I think that it is a job that I will be able to enjoy after my footballing career</p>

But I know he feels good there. He could play in any club around the world because of his qualities, whether in Barcelona or elsewhere, and be happy and successful<br /><br />Yes, I took a risk. It’s every four years and you’re never sure if you will play it many times. So it was a dream that I realised. I forced it on my left knee and it has made things a bit more complicated over this season. But I do not regret that choice. I feel good. I’m trying to get back to the rhythm after several months of inactivity. It’s pretty complicated. Training and matches is the only way I’m going to find the rhythm and feel good</p>
