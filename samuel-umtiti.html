  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> defender Samuel Umtiti gives insight on <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>’s dominance in training]</b> He has so much ease on the ball. His talent is innate although he works a lot. In training he does things that are out of the norm. Sometimes he dribbles past everyone as if we were nothing more than cones, including me</p>

  <p><b>[From world champion to broken and error-prone - Samuel Umtiti’s miserable season]</b> I came from an extraordinary World Cup, where my childhood dream came true. I had some problems with my knee before and during the competition. I gritted my teeth and played the best I could. During the World Cup, I didn’t necessarily do what I needed to. Or rather, I did things I should have avoided</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> defender Samuel Umtiti says that he is unsure whether his international team-mate <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Antoine Griezmann</a> will join him at Camp Nou next season]</b> Will he be at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>? That’s a very good question. The truth is, I never heard anybody talk about him in our dressing room. Maybe I wasn’t there when it happened.<br /><br /><b>[Umtiti was quick to distance himself from reports that he could be leaving Barca in the near future]</b> I have a contract, I feel happy in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. I had a complicated season but that’s not a reason to have desires elsewhere. I will be in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> next season</p>

  <p><b>[Samuel Umtiti is expecting to stay at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> this summer]</b> The quality of life is great. For me, it’s the best place to play and live. The place, the mentality of the people, my team, the players that I meet daily, frankly I could not have dreamt of better. Every day I feel happy to live my passion, and what’s more to do that here in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. The adaptation went very well, I was very well received. They were very cool with me, even though I did not speak too much Spanish we managed to understand each other and everyone helped me a lot.<br /><br /><b>[He made just 13 starts in La Liga last season, but feels he is ready to kick on into 2019-20]</b> I’m better. It’s true that it was a difficult season due to the injury but I knew it was going to happen, that there had to be a transition because I had a lot of difficulties during the World Cup. I think it was a good thing and it was worth it. At the end of the season I was able to play again and I recovered my fitness. Now I will prepare for the next season and be at 200%</p>

  <p><b>[Samuel Umtiti has rubbished reports suggesting that he had contact with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> over the summer]</b> Honestly, I don’t know where this rumour with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> came from. Overnight, I received messages from my friends ‘ah, so you are joining <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>?’ I’m not, I’m sorry but I’m staying at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. Contacts with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>? To be honest, I don’t know if they had conversations with my agent, I just told him that I didn’t care what was happening this summer and that it wasn’t even necessary to talk to me about it. It was useless, I was going to have the same answer. My dream as a child is to play for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. Last season was the most difficult of my career, especially in terms of injuries<br /><br /><b>[With <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> forced into favouring other options, Umtiti was billed as one of those who could be used as a makeweight in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s efforts to prise <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> away from Paris Saint-Germain]</b> Exchange coin for <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>?

  <p><b>[Umtiti absent from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s Slavia Prague Champions League trip]</b> In the final part of the session on Tuesday at the Ciutat Esportiva, Samuel Umtiti picked up a bruised knee and so the French central defender misses the trip to take on Slavia Prague. Sergio Roberto also misses out as he is still recovering from a knee injury picked up in the win at the weekend against Eibar in La Liga</p>

I take notes from those I’ve worked under, their training sessions and what they do. Returning to <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> is a possibility, as a player or as a coach.<br /><br /><b>[Umtiti has added to those, but has opted to focus on <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a>’s life off the field rather than his efforts on it]</b> I don’t like <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a>’s haircut at all and I tell him he needs to cut it every morning. But he always says that it’s a work in progress. He also says he’s really good at basketball and he’s good but he isn’t as good as he says he is!</p>

With all that we could win, we remain humble, and simple in our approach. He is a very smart player and he’s going to show everybody that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> is for him.
