  <p><b>[Former Ghana striker Anthony Yeboah has expressed shock upon hearing the news of his former <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> team-mate Garry Speed’s passing]</b> I could not believe it. He is very calm and didn’t have any problem. The last time I spoke to him was two weeks ago when I was in London. He’s a family man and very responsible so this came as a shock</p>

  <p><b>[Tony Yeboah reveals how bribery forced him out of football]</b> I once told a referee in an away game to officiate fairly but to my surprise, he asked if I was a novice in Ghana’s league. Some of my players used to come to inform me about referees’ <b>[requests]</b> for bribes <b>[in order for us to]</b> continue to be in the league. But I told the players to play with their strength. If I didn’t quit, I would have fallen victim of bribery allegations</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Ghana striker Tony Yeboah reacts to <a href="jordan-ayew.html">Jordan Ayew</a> comparison after <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> feat]</b> If you compare my games to Jordan, it tells you I had fewer games. I played 47 matches, scoring 24 goals in two and half years for <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a>. <b>[The <a href="epl.html">English Premier League</a>]</b> is not a small league but Jordan scoring 24 goals means that the future is bright for him despite playing more matches than me. Looking at his age, he can add more goals if he continues to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. But for now, if you compare my statistics with him, you can see some sort of differences between us</p>

  <p><b>[Former Ghana international Anthony Yeboah has revealed the team was divided at the 1992 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon), resulting in a final defeat to Cote d’Ivoire]</b> We realised we made a lot of mistakes, we were supposed to win the tournament totally because we were much better than the others. Unfortunately, Abedi ‘Pele’ missed the finals because he was suspended and that was a big miss because he was one of the key players and the captain of the team. Just petty things we couldn’t do right cost us that trophy but the team we had at that time was fantastic. There was also a little bit of misunderstanding in the team. Yes, it is true <b>[that the team was divided]</b> because you could see from some of the players. For example when we meet or when we sit together as a group, you could see the Kumasi people sitting at a particular place and the Accra people also sitting at a particular place. We didn’t have a problem against each other but as I was saying there was some misunderstanding. The teamwork wasn’t like it was supposed to be, so I think that cost us a lot</p>

  <p><b>[Yeboah on missing out on <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> move and his famous <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> goal]</b> Any time I am in England, I am asked about my goals and I always choose the goal against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> because I am a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fan so it was special to score against them. And it was a long time that <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> had beaten <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I met <a href="ian-rush.html">Ian Rush</a>, <b>[John]</b> <a href="john-barnes.html">Barnes</a>, players I had liked from a distance and said; this one I have to show something<br /><br /><b>[Yeboah joined <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> from German side <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> in 1995, having fallen out with coach <a href="jupp-heynckes.html">Jupp Heynckes</a>]</b> Normally I should have gone to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> but <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Frankfurt</a> would not allow it because the fans would kill them so they said ‘no, we are not allowing you to go’ even though <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> was 100 percent interested. I didn’t know <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> but when the offer came I said why not? Then I had a problem with the coach at <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Frankfurt</a> so I decided I want to play football, I want my peace<br /><br /><b>[Despite a slow start at <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>, Yeboah did well to find his feat as he would end a two-year stay with 32 goals in 66 outings]</b> Initially the trust from <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> was not there so they loaned me for the first six months and had the option for another two years. I was fit and it didn’t take me too long to adjust to English football. I wanted to retire after <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> but one coach from Germany convinced me out of it and then I went to Hamburg. I lasted four seasons at Hamburg then I moved to Qatar. That was the pension move. That league is nothing so we just went there and finished our career</p>
