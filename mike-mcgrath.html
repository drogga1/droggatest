  <p><b>[The Sunday Supplement panel say the EFL’s current <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> Rule must be strengthened and a similar scheme used at boardroom levels through <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> to increase BAME representation]</b> I think the <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> Rule really has to be looked at and strengthened. It’s effectively a policy which is completely optional. It is something that is used if there is an interview process. There’s nothing to stop a club not having an interview process, and a chairman just appointing his best mate if he wants to. The <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> Rule should really be implanted properly across all 91 clubs and then also to have transparency, to have data to show who you’ve interviewed. The FA have had a very positive policy recently in having a BAME coach in every single age group for England, from U15s to <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a>’s senior squad. I don’t see why that can’t be implemented for the 20 teams in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and possibly Championship. I don’t think it would be a financial problem for that to happen. There are only 32 BAME coaches with the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> A licence. The LMA have said themselves they want coaches fast tracked for this qualification, to have more black coaches would mean a greater chance of getting a job. So that’s absolutely vital as well - and could happen very easily.</p>

  <p><b>[The Supplement panel discussed how the lockdown period will have given teams ample time to analyse other teams and their own tactics]</b> It’s going to be really interesting in terms of fitness levels, but also in terms of momentum; have they used the time to look at other teams? Analysts have had nothing to do but look at other teams in the past three months. For example, <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> had been on fine form, have teams looked at them and figured out how to beat them? Figured out how <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> beat them at Bramall Lane? Will they use that blueprint? And on the flip side, <a href="chris-wilder.html">Chris Wilder</a> will have his team as fit as anyone; will he come up with a different game plan to surprise us for the second time in one season? I think the coaches themselves have had a long time to think about it. If you’ve had a good mini pre-season, it could really separate the best teams from the rest</p>
