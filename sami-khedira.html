  <p><b>[Sami Khedira has rubbished reports suggesting that he considered making a move away from <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>]</b> I haven’t talked to any other teams. I know there’s many of us and that <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> must sell. At 32 and having played just 17 games last season, I was always going to be scrutinised. It’s always been like that for me, but I’ve always ended up playing. With <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, everything was clear from the start of preseason. I wouldn’t leave and I didn’t want to leave. I heard I was only staying for the money. That struck me because then the fans believed it. I’ve never played for money, only to win trophies<br /><br /><a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> wants us to play in a totally different kind of way. For that reason, we’ve had some difficulties and we need time to adapt to the new system, but it’s normal. Playing a different kind of football, pressing, intensity, passion and intelligence. They’re all things that appeal to me<br /><br />My knee is fine and I feel completely fit, I trust my body. Last season was unlucky for me. I wasn’t very happy, with all the injuries to my knee, the heart operation. I’d entered a negative spiral. I questioned everything: do I still have fire in my belly? Do I still have the right physical condition? I replied ‘yes’. If you play for <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> you always want to win the Champions League, you have to improve year after year. And I always want to be amongst the 11 starters. After a training session, I felt dizzy and I couldn’t see clearly. I warned the doctor, but I didn’t feel my life was in danger and the arrhythmia operation was almost routine. I’m convinced that I can get back to being at the highest level, otherwise you’d be talking to a pensioner and not the footballer Khedira. I can play at such a level for three more years</p>

  <p><b>[Sami Khedira says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is extraordinary and <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> improved me as a person]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is an extraordinary footballer and a fantastic person. Meanwhile, we are playing together for seven years, five of them in Madrid and two with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. Because of his skills and his ambitions, in my opinion, he is one of the best football players the world has ever known. He wants to win every time, even if it’s a training session. He is a role model for all the people. That’s the reason why he is one of the greatest footballers. I think I can consider myself fortunate, still play and train with him.<br /><br />The most impressive person as a coach and person is <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> because in fact he trusted me. The biggest step in my career from Stuttgart to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> after World Cup 2010 and he taught me a lot of technical stuff but also improved me as a person, he trusted me. I still have an amazing relationship with him, I’m still in contact with him and I follow him as a coach and as a person and that’s why I choose Jose Mourinho</p>

  <p><b>[Khedira wants Champions League success with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>]</b> I won almost everything, but winning is like a drug, if you don’t win a title for one year, the next year you try to win all kinds of titles. My dream is to win the Champions League with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. Almost three or four years ago, we were very close in the final against <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. I think we can win this title with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> in the next few years.

I spent unforgettable moments there with many successes. We won all sorts of titles like the league, the cup, but also the Champions League. We had a very strong team with very strong characters. That’s why I will never forget this great time and I am still a big fan of this big club. That’s why: Hala Madrid!<br /><br /><b>[With his current contract with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> set to expire next year, Khedira recently stressed he’s not looking at moving on anytime soon]</b> My contract with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> expires in 2021.

  <p><b>[Khedira reveals Low’s half-time message to Germany in 7-1 World Cup thrashing of Brazil]</b> Jogi said to us: ‘Great! But the game is not over yet. If I see anybody messing around, I’ll take him off immediately. He took the euphoria completely out of the question, and said: ‘We are starting again at 0-0 and I want us to win the second half as well’. It was a perfect message from him. We were all in each other’s arms. Even those who didn’t have access to the dressing room at half-time. Everyone was together, and the message came from the top: ‘Enjoy it, but keep your feet on the ground’<br /><br /><b>[Khedira says friends and family were blowing up his phone after the game, such was the global reaction to the scoreline]</b> I got messages from all over the world. It wasn’t even like a birthday. I just couldn’t read everything. Everybody was writing to me, ‘Unbelievable!’, ‘Mad!’, ‘What’s going on?’. Tunisians, Germans, people that I didn’t even know to be football fans.</p>
