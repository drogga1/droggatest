  <p>[Adelaide United’s Riley McGree has admitted he didn’t believe it when a Football Federation Australia representative called him about his Socceroos selection] Honestly, I was a bit lost for words … yeah, I was lost for words. I didn’t know what to say to the bloke. I didn’t really think it was true to be honest. I told my dad prior to it being announced and he was obviously delighted and really happy for me but I let my mum find out through the announcement and she was obviously on top of the world and screaming and all this stuff, so it was good.<br /><br />It was a bit unexpected to be honest but it’s a great opportunity for me as a youngster. I guess I’ve been given the opportunity in the A-League - the club have been good to me, they’ve believed in me</p>
