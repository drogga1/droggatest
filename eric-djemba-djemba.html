  <p><b>[Eric Djemba-Djemba says <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> faces the same problem at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> as <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> does at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> has his style and he can’t do anything about that, he has always played like that since he played back in Italy. But English football is different; you need to work hard, tackle and more. Italian football is more tactical, but you need to be box-to-box in England, tackle and work hard. If you watched <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> playing as a striker, he would still come back and tackle hard. <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> has his style and he is a very good player. When you put <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> in the right position and he has the confidence, he is absolutely amazing. It’s like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans with <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a>. They think he is not trying but of course he is trying. It’s crazy!<br /><br /><b>[<a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>’s failure from 12 yards saw him attract more racist abuse on social media]</b> For me it’s awful to see, its just football and there’s no need for it. Imagine how Paul’s child or family feel about seeing that abuse. Racism has no place in either football or this world, and it’s a real shame to see</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Djemba-Djemba says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> never frustrated his team-mates at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> despite being the complete opposite to <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> as he loved the tricks]</b> The players didn’t find <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> frustrating, he was just young. If you look at <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> now versus playing 15 years ago, you can see the difference. He was young and that was his game. Sometimes it was hard for <a href="ruud-van-nistelrooy.html">Ruud van Nistelrooy</a>, <a href="louis-saha.html">Louis Saha</a> and <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> because they didn’t know if he would cross the ball, when you’re waiting for the cross and it doesn’t come. But they knew that was <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>’s game, and they knew that he wouldn’t cross the ball so they waited for the cross, for <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> to dribble past the defender before he would cross. He wasn’t like <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>, he would take one touch and whip it in. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> loved the tricks!<br /><br />Sometimes Ferguson would tell <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> ‘no’, but I never saw <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> angry or unhappy at <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>. For Ferguson to be unhappy was very hard for him; he was like a dad with his kids! He could be unhappy if we were drawing a game or not playing well. He was like everyone, you can be unhappy because you’re not playing well. He never had a go at me; he was like my dad! He was a dad for <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, <a href="john-o-shea.html">John O’Shea</a>, <a href="darren-fletcher.html">Darren Fletcher</a>, David Bellion, even <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a>!<br /><br /><b>[<a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> has gone on become a five-time Ballon d’Or winner]</b> People can watch <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> on the television, but they don’t know the real <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is a man, who had a difficult time as a kid in football. People see him on the television and think he is arrogant or takes the piss out of people, but <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is an emotional man. You need to talk to him to see who he really is. My mum passed away and he said Eric if you need me, you can call me, you can visit me, don’t worry I am here for you. Every day when we were together at United, we drove to training together. Sometimes we would drive in my car; sometimes we would drive in his car. After training we went to eat at Nandos in Manchester; he helped me discover Nandos! When we went to away games, we were roommates. He was my best friend. We were together every single day for training; sometimes I would go to his house to eat as his house as his mother was there with him when <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> was young. Sometimes he would come to my house to eat, as I was living alone in <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a>’s old house!</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Djemba-Djemba: From Nando’s with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> to happiness in Swiss amateur football. The player himself admitted he struggled with the pressures of being at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>, having to compete with the likes of Keane, <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> and <a href="darren-fletcher.html">Darren Fletcher</a> for a spot in the team]</b> It was difficult. I was 22, I came from France and I went straight into a team that was one of the biggest in the world. There was a lot of pressure, and <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> was a man. Everybody listened to him. At the beginning it was good, I played matches because Keane was injured. But when he came back, it was hard for me. Sometimes I played with him, sometimes with <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> or with <a href="darren-fletcher.html">Darren Fletcher</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Djemba-Djemba denied the speculation about his finances but revealed his struggles in dealing with the extravagant lifestyle of a professional football star]</b> It was difficult handling the money. Now I am a grown up, I have learned. I was too trusting. I trust in God and he opened my eyes. Maybe he wanted that to happen to me so tomorrow I might be better. I didn’t lose everything but I lost a lot. It was said I had 30 bank accounts as well. Come on, no one has 30 bank accounts. When I read stuff like that it upset me<br /><br /><b>[It wasn’t until he was considering retirement at the age of 35 that a surprising phone call from a friend would allow Djemba-Djemba to finally find a home at Swiss amateur side FC Vallorbe-Ballaigues]</b> <b>[I joined]</b> because of my friend Jacques Etonde, who I grew up with in Cameroon…it was a boyhood dream for the both of us to play together in Europe after we’d grown up together in Africa. I just love playing and, when I finish training, I’m happy to carry the balls or the water bottles<br /><br /><b>[After years of travelling to all corners of the globe, the Swiss move allowed Djemba-Djemba to be closer to his family in <a href="nantes-fc.html">Nantes</a>]</b> I went everywhere in the world, but in the meantime my kids were growing up fast in <a href="nantes-fc.html">Nantes</a> and it was difficult for me. I could only really see them about two times a year. It was a sacrifice <b>[to come here]</b>. I’m happy I’m in Switzerland because I wanted to be close to my kids</p>

  <p><b>[On their way to the Stade de Gerland, <a href="eric-djemba-djemba.html">Djemba</a> Djemba said Marc-Vivien Foe talked about death on the team bus on that fateful day and complained of fatigue during the match that ended 1-0 in favour of Cameroon]</b> I will never forget what he said to us on the bus before we played. He said, ‘if someone needs to die today, we will die. We don’t need to lose that game because I promised to my wife and children we need to go to that final. I need to win the Confederations Cup.’ I was the last person that talked to him. He said to me just before, ‘Eric, I am tired.’. So I said to him, when the ball goes out, we’ll tell the coach, and he will substitute him. But he didn’t have one minute. The ball was in the air and he jumped up with Mario Yepes, who I played with at <a href="nantes-fc.html">Nantes</a>. I saw Foe fall down and then I saw Mario shouting, ‘Hey, hey, hey’. We walked over to him and we knew he was dead straight away<br /><br /><b>[<a href="eric-djemba-djemba.html">Djemba</a> Djemba, 38, who is currently plying his trade in Swiss fifth division, admitted the tragic incident nearly made him quit football]</b> I didn’t want to play again. Everyone was afraid to play the game. We won 1-0, and we needed to play the final. But we said we don’t want to play. We couldn’t sleep that night, everyone was crying. How could you go to play football and die?<br /><br /><b>[The sudden demise of Foe made Cameroon reluctant to play in the Confederations Cup final but efforts from ex-Fifa president <a href="sepp-blatter.html">Sepp Blatter</a>, and Foe’s widow Marie-Louise, charged them to play the encounter which they lost 1-0 to France]</b> He spoke to us and said he understood it was difficult, but added Fifa didn’t know what to do because we had got to the final. Then Marc’s wife came to the hotel, and she said to us we need to play for him, for her and her children. So we went to play and we lost the game 1-0. <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> scored. But we weren’t in the right frame of mind</p>
