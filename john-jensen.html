  <p><b>[Why are Eriksen &amp; star players fighting with Denmark FA?]</b> When I say yes to help here, it’s because I feel very strongly for the national team as an institution and because I think the most important thing must be that the games will be played. I just hope to get us through the two matches and that the parties find a solution as soon as possible.<br /><br /><b>[When do they play?]</b> We got 24 heroes who were called in about 48 hours ago. And <b>[they]</b> play in a very low division compared to Slovakia, who have got world-class players. I’m proud, I’m shocked. These players that were on the pitch, and also these players that didn’t come on the pitch, the friendship and what they did was absolutely amazing and I will never forget this defeat. This is my best defeat in my career</p>
