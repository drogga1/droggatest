I’m responsible for all the selections and the end results, but I’m still proud of this group of players. The next step will be decided after I meet with the Egyptian FA board tomorrow<br /><br /><b>[the manager believes the game was decided by his side’s inability to put away their scoring chances against Bafana Bafana]</b> The game was open and witnessed scoring chances; the only difference was that South Africa scored a goal that helped them to qualify. We also had our chances but couldn’t convert them</p>
