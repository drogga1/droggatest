  <p><b>[Brighton have completed the signing of striker Neal Maupay from Brentford for a reported £20 million]</b> It’s a dream of mine to play in the Premier League, and once I had met the manager and found out that the club was interested in me, I had a good feeling straight away. It’s a team that fits in well with me, and like them, I want to improve. I managed to do that when I arrived in England with Brentford, and now it’s time for me to work twice as hard because it is the best league in the world. I know it will be tough, but I am really excited and I have that desire to work hard for this club</p>

  <p><b>[Speaking after the game, Neal Maupay revealed he went to the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> dressing room at the break to apologise for the incident involving Leno, which he stressed was accidental]</b> At half-time I went to the manager <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> to apologise. I never meant to injure the keeper. I jumped for the ball. I apologise to the team and to him (Leno) as well. I have been through a bad injury, it is hard. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> players maybe need to learn humility sometimes. They were talking a lot. They got what they deserved. I just went to get the ball really. When he landed he twisted his knee. It is football, there is contact. I never meant to hurt him. I apologise again and wish him a speedy recovery<br /><br />I am so happy because it our first win this new year. The team has worked really had the last few months. We have been training really, really hard. The team kept working. The whole club - managers and staff - did a very good job to have us in a good place. It is just a win, we have eight games to go - some very big games. Anything can happen and we need to stay focused. It is a good start, we are really happy but we need to get straight back in tomorrow to focus on the next game</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal midfielder Guendouzi escapes punishment despite grabbing Brighton’s Maupay by the throat]</b> <a href="matteo-guendouzi.html">Matteo Guendouzi</a>’s conduct during this incident was not seen by the match officials at the time, but it was subsequently reviewed by the VAR, so he will face no further action</p>
