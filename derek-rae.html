  <p><b>[Derek Rae speaks about how recording the commentary for <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> 19 works]</b> I can quite easily in my mind paint the picture of a corner kick scenario where the big defender comes up from the back and heads it over the top, and what I would say under the circumstances. It definitely was a change, but a change in a good way and one I found very creative from the start. I think it was somewhere between 20 and 25 days by the end of it. We work on different things on different days. From the point of view of your voice, the production team are mindful of not doing a whole day where it’s high intensity stuff because that can quickly ruin the vocal chords</p>

  <p><b>[How do you become a football commentator?]</b> It was always something I wanted to do from a very young age. I started as a seven-year-old in Aberdeen making tapes of the 1974 World Cup, which is the first tournament I really fell in love with. From that point on, I always knew that’s what I wanted to be.<br /><br />But wanting to do something and actually doing it is a different matter. From the age of 11, 12, I used to go to games, usually Aberdeen reserve games, and make tapes for myself and people around me would give me funny looks, saying: ‘You’re that strange laddie that makes tapes to himself.’ From the age of 13 on, I went on to hospital radio where you’re making programmes for the patients in local hospitals. I got the gig as one of the commentators for Aberdeen games on hospital radio, which was the only way you could broadcast Aberdeen games in those days because there wasn’t community radio or a local station covering the team week in, week out. I continued doing that all the way until I went to university.<br /><br />I also had written to my broadcasting hero David Francey who was the voice of Scottish football on radio. I worshipped his broadcasting style which was a rich distinctive Scottish style. I sent my tapes to him and got some great feedback from him and we stayed in touch. I sent another to him when I was at university when I was 19 and instead of just sending back a letter of advice, what David did for me was he passed it on to the BBC. I got a call back from the producer there and I ended up on the air at 19. My second game as a commentator was England vs Scotland at Wembley in 1986 because David was unable to do the game<br /><br /><b>[What is it like being a commentator?]</b> The Champions League has given me so much as a commentator and hopefully I’ve done a job that people have enjoyed all around the world. The 2005 final in Istanbul when Liverpool came back against all odds with Milan, I was lucky enough to be there that night for ESPN. I remember saying after the game to my producer: ‘We will never ever get a final like that again.’ To have been able to provide a soundtrack to that, I don’t think it gets any better than that as a commentator<br /><br />Number one, realise that it’s a very difficult industry to get into. You have to be quite patient and you have to not expect that you will make it. That’s the harsh reality of it. You have to put an awful time and effort into it. You have to, and I can’t stress this enough, really work on your voice. The job is not shouting, the job is like that of a singer. You are a professional voice person and you have to treat your voice as your musical instrument.<br /><br />You have to really love it and have to realise that commentating is a job outside football. You have to love the football, that’s important, but you also have to love the broadcasting. You have to spend a lot of time working on your craft and realise it’s going to take many years to get to close to even where you want to be. When I listen back to my early stuff, it wasn’t that great. You do end up being your own harshest critic.<br /><br />That’s probably sobering words for a lot of people trying to get into the business, but it’s not something you fall into and it all falls into place. It does take a lot of time and effort and there will be a lot of setbacks along the way. A lot of people think they can do it because they think they can sit in front of a screen and talk, but could they do it for 90 minutes and could you do it flawlessly? It’s a difficult job and in this age of social media, you have to have very thick skin, thicker than ever, but if you can break into it, it is a wonderful job</p>
