  <p><b>[Ngolo Kante talks about winning the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup]</b> When we won the World Cup and the camera was moving across, some of the players knew that I don’t like to have too much attention on me, so they pushed me forward and were singing. It was a good moment, and I hope I enjoyed it in the best way. I hope that some moments like this will come again, because it was really exceptional. Honestly, it’s been an amazing experience with the national team, both the qualification and the competition in Russia. There was a good atmosphere in the team, I think we really spent a good time together, both in football and outside of football, and when we started to enjoy success, qualifying for the last 16, then the last eight and the semi-final and the final, we enjoyed those wins together</p>

The last few years have provided some beautiful memories for me. There have been beautiful achievements of winning titles with my team-mates. I hope to continue in the same way. Even if we had ups and downs with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> last year, because we didn’t get into the top four, we finished well with <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup. Following that, by winning the World Cup with the national team was a beautiful way to end 2017/18</p>

  <p><b>[Eden Hazard once again stole the show on Wednesday night as he scored a brace in Chelsea’s 4-1 win over the Arsenal in the Europa League final and team-mate N’Golo Kante believes the Belgian has earned the right to move on]</b> It’s not sad. I think Eden did an amazing job, had an amazing time with Chelsea. He stayed here a long time, he’s won many trophies. He played amazing tonight. We are happy for him. I don’t know what is going to happen next but we can only wish him the best because he did a lot for Chelsea. It was a pleasure to play with him and we’ll see what happens.<br /><br /><b>[The former Leicester City star lasted the full 90 minutes in Baku despite picking up a minor injury just days before the final]</b> I was a bit worried because I twisted my knee on Saturday. The staff did an amazing job to be ready for the final. I was ready to play and am happy for the team</p>

  <p><b>[N’Golo Kante says he enjoyed the challenge of adapting to a new midfield role under Maurizio Sarri]</b> The new role stemmed from our 4-3-3- system. It’s been a few years since I played in a team with two flat midfielders. Then, I found myself playing with a single number six and two number eights. By repeating patterns of play in training, in matches and with advice from the coach, I think I managed to adapt. I like this position, it allows me to join in with attacks and have a role when the team goes forward. There is a bit more pressing high up the pitch but I like it. In this position, sometimes the game is behind you and you have less time than in the number six role. You have to orient yourself properly and apply yourself technically. I like this challenge and I like this position<br /><br /><b>[They secured qualification by finishing third in the Premier League last season, adding a Europa League win for good measure]</b> Everyone knows what this competition represents for footballers. I had the chance to play in it once before with Chelsea but we went out in the last 16 against Barcelona. I hope we will be able to further this season</p>

  <p><b>[N’Golo Kante admits <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have not made a great start to the season]</b> It is not a great start, we have work to do.

I was happy to come back in front of our fans and for this big game. I am disappointed by the result but I am happy to be back to help the team to try to win. We tried our best during the game and we are disappointed by the result. With the two set-pieces they scored they put us in difficulty but had some good chances. As soon as they scored to make it 2-0, we went in the changing room believing all together that we can do it and as soon as I scored, we had the chance to come back into the game but we were not able to get the result we wanted<br /><br /><b>[First-half goals from <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> and <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> downed the Blues, with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> once again proving destructive from dead-ball situations]</b> The first one was a beautiful goal but the second one we maybe could do better but at the end, we played well, we tried to come back but the set-pieces meant <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> won. We played very well in the second half. We were able to score one but not to equalise, but there were some good points in the performance and we need to take those points on to have a good result in the next game. If we keep working this way we can get a win in our next game</p>

I hope the difficulties have ended and I can keep giving my best for the team<br /><br /><b>[Kante believes <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>’s side need to show greater belief to turn losses into wins]</b> We are a little bit disappointed. We wanted to come for the win to keep our run going and to stay second in the table. I think it was a difficult game and we know City are a good team. We can be proud of what we did and we need to keep going for the next game.<br /><br />I think we had our chances. We could have scored to equalise but I think we are playing against a strong team. It was difficult, it was tight and they won. It is what we want. We want to fight against every opponent. We gave our best. Even <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was a tight game. This is the way. We need to believe that we can compete against everyone in the league and give our best to see what we can achieve this season. I think they have played together for a long time with the manager and players. We can feel that they have a lot of ways to play together. They gave us many difficulties in their counterattacks. I think we could have done better in some ways but, in the end, it was a tight game<br /><br /><b>[Kante has scored three goals in his last four <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> appearances]</b> Not especially <b>[being asked by <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> to score]</b>. I enjoy it, but I enjoy it more when we win. This is how it is for the whole team. No, no <b>[I am not like <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> was]</b>. I would rather win than score. I want to help the team and keep winning to stay at the top of the table. I am trying to score when I have the opportunity to help the team. I think from the years I have been playing here, and I am now more often arriving in the box.<br /><br />I start to score when I have the chances. It was a good goal. We didn’t manage to keep the result but a good pass from Mateo <b>[Kovacic]</b>. I hope we can score more as a team and win many games. I think this year, as the year before, we have a lot of quality midfielders. I think that it doesn’t matter who plays but everyone wants to play his part and give his best when they are playing. We are a squad together and it doesn’t matter who is playing, you just have to give your best for the shirt</p>

We have everything that we need in this team<br /><br />We are having an important time of the season because we are all fighting for the fourth position. Man United were a bit behind but now they have closed the gap so it’s a big opportunity either for us to keep them behind or for them to close the gap more. It’s an important game for both teams. We all know that Man United at home is a very difficult game, especially after what happened in the first game but we don’t look at this. We just look forward because we want to keep the gap and so that’s why we need to win, not to get revenge<br /><br /><b>[Kante believes the Blues have the perfect manager]</b> He was here for a long time as a player and won many trophies but now he is back with the status as manager of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. We know all about him as a player so when he speaks about my position as a midfielder, to go forward and get the balance in the team, you listen to him. He has good ideas, he wants to play the young players and the older players together to get our target to be in the Champions League. Frank knows how to bring the players to their best and we have time to get what we want from this season</p>
