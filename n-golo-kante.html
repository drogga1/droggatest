  <p><b>[N’Golo Kante has appeared to confirm that he will stay at Chelsea for the foreseeable future]</b> I am at home. It is my club, I am a Chelsea player. This is my second year at Chelsea. After what happened last season, it was a very good one for us because we got to celebrate winning the title. In the second season, I have got to play in the Champions League and we are going again to finish in the top four. We will fight until the end to finish in the top four and to get in a Champions League position. We also have the FA Cup to play for - it is a good competition. Last season we failed in the final. It is the only trophy we can win this season, so we have to give everything to get to the final and win it.</p>

  <p><b>[N’Golo Kante believes the jeers were merely a show of frustration from those hoping to witness a more exciting encounter]</b> I think the quality of the game sometimes depends on the opposition. We all knew it was a special game because we knew all we needed was a draw. The tempo was slow, that’s why we played this kind of game. But I think we can do better, we will improve in the next game. On the pitch I didn’t feel the booing was for us. It was just for the slow tempo of the game at the end. We can understand that some supporters want to see goals and spectacle but sometimes both teams are focused on what they need and we can be happy to be first in the group.</p>

It is something you dream of from when you are young. To get it in your hands represents a lot, for me, for the people who helped me to be here and the professional that I am, for my clubs. It brings a smile to my face.<br /><br /><b>[He is also still coming to terms with what he has achieved]</b> I was basically crying! I can’t explain that moment. When the final whistle blew, you just want to run everywhere, to jump on your team-mates. I was on the bench for the last 15 minutes, and I could start to realise what was happening. I ran on to the pitch, I crossed Adil Rami and we hugged, and then I stayed maybe 10 seconds on the floor, wondering to myself what had just happened. After that I went to enjoy it with my team-mates, but I was basically crying like a kid</p>

  <p><b>[Former Leicester City midfielder N’Golo Kante has described the club’s late owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha as a great man]</b> I was with Leicester City Football Club for a year and during that time I met a man who was always there for the players and their needs. He always had a smile on his face and was there to spur us on before games throughout the entire season. He was a very compassionate man; he cared a lot about his players, he looked after our well-being and was very generous, always gifting us presents. He genuinely cared about the happiness and the togetherness of the team. It was very touching to see all of the tributes left by thousands of people outside the King Power Stadium to a great man like Khun Vichai. It is all in his honour and I think it is proof of the affection and respect that Leicester City fans feel towards him..<br /><br />The 2015/16 season in general is a great memory for me. Khun Vichai was always at the games and when we were crowned Champions, we spent a night in London at the end of the season to celebrate. I remember Khun Vichai had presents for all of the players and was so thoughtful to everyone. It was a great night, one of celebration with the Chairman and the Club, and one that will stay with me. It will always be a very fond memory of mine. Khun Vichai will leave a lasting legacy at Leicester City Football Club. He was a great man, a generous man who was very successful. He brought a lot of success to Leicester City and without him I don’t think the Club would be where it is today</p>

I just want to be a player among the players. I am how I am. I cannot explain it well, but I don’t feel the nicest person, on the football pitch or in life, I’m just myself. If I win, I win and if I lose, I lose, but I always try to give my best in any competition. That’s not because I’m nice or something. I’m just myself.<br /><br />I’ve been at Chelsea for just over two years and we won the Premier League and the FA Cup. This is a champion’s club, an ambitious club, and I hope to win these trophies again. Of course Europe is a target, but every season I hope to win the most trophies I can.

I think the position doesn’t change everything. I know I have a bit of work to do in this position but I enjoy to play in this position. I can enjoy more of the offensive play and I am, but I know I have a little work to do and I can still improve.<br /><br />It is true that he prefers to train in the afternoon and in the training he likes to put the accent on the offensive play. He wants us to play with enthusiasm, try and enjoy our football, and all the team are enjoying this idea of football. I think you can see it during the game, but we are playing very well and we try always to play and to find a solution by playing good football</p>

It was a good moment, and I hope I enjoyed it in the best way. I hope that some moments like this will come again, because it was really exceptional. Honestly, it’s been an amazing experience with the national team, both the qualification and the competition in Russia. There was a good atmosphere in the team, I think we really spent a good time together, both in football and outside of football, and when we started to enjoy success, qualifying for the last 16, then the last eight and the semi-final and the final, we enjoyed those wins together</p>

Even if we had ups and downs with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> last year, because we didn’t get into the top four, we finished well with <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup.

  <p><b>[Kante comfortable playing new role under Sarri]</b> It is something possible <b>[to play Jorginho’s role]</b>, but the manager decides. It’s fine, it’s fine. I like this <b>[more advanced]</b> position. Prefer it? It depends on the game, but I enjoy it. I’m with the manager, and I’m enjoying the way I’m playing now. It is a position I used to play when I was in France. I’m enjoying participating more in the offensive positions to change the game. I am enjoying it..<br /><br />Jorginho came this season. He is doing very well. He knows very well the philosophy of the manager. He is very important for us at the club. We are doing well. As a team, we have some difficulty at the moment, but we are all together and no-one’s special. We missed many opportunities to be happy like in the FA Cup and some games in the league. We can understand their disappointment in our performances in some moments of the season. I think we all want to get tighter and we will all be together for the final and the rest of the season<br /><br />They are a great team. We played them three times this season. In the last three months, we played them at home and away. They were two different games. I think it’s possible. They are not unbeatable. We need to go with a lot of hope and to prepare for the game in the best way. After our last result against Man City, it was difficult to accept the defeat. We lost again against Manchester United. This victory (against Malmo) is good to give us confidence and look forward to the final in the best way and to be ready, to hopefully win the final. Every defeat like this is difficult to accept as a player. At Chelsea, we are not used to that. It was difficult to accept. At the end, we cannot change it. We need to accept it and go forward and do better. That’s what we try to do. <b>[We are]</b> not especially <b>[after any revenge]</b>. It is another game. It is most important to win this one title in this game. It is what we will try to do, what we will prepare to do and hopefully we can do it. We need to know that we can win like at Stamford Bridge, or we can lose as at the Etihad. Everything is possible. It gives us more awareness of this team</p>

We’ll go into the semi-final with confidence and we hope to qualify for the final. I think it’s important to be in the semi-finals, it was our target.

It would be a great finish. Why not? It can make this season be cheerful. But step by step, the first step is to get to the final<br /><br />I think we have played together all the season and we understand the idea of the manager. That is the most important thing. We are improving because we understand better the idea of the manager and we are doing better game after game.

It’s been a few years since I played in a team with two flat midfielders. Then, I found myself playing with a single number six and two number eights. By repeating patterns of play in training, in matches and with advice from the coach, I think I managed to adapt. I like this position, it allows me to join in with attacks and have a role when the team goes forward. There is a bit more pressing high up the pitch but I like it.

We played very well in the second half. We were able to score one but not to equalise, but there were some good points in the performance and we need to take those points on to have a good result in the next game. If we keep working this way we can get a win in our next game</p>

  <p><b>[Kante hopes injury problems are over as he calls on <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> to show more belief]</b> I feel fine. I have a good feeling on the pitch. I went to the national team and it was good for me. I hope the difficulties have ended and I can keep giving my best for the team<br /><br /><b>[Kante believes <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>’s side need to show greater belief to turn losses into wins]</b> We are a little bit disappointed. We wanted to come for the win to keep our run going and to stay second in the table. I think it was a difficult game and we know City are a good team. We can be proud of what we did and we need to keep going for the next game.<br /><br />I think we had our chances. We could have scored to equalise but I think we are playing against a strong team. It was difficult, it was tight and they won. It is what we want. We want to fight against every opponent. We gave our best. Even <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was a tight game. This is the way. We need to believe that we can compete against everyone in the league and give our best to see what we can achieve this season. I think they have played together for a long time with the manager and players. We can feel that they have a lot of ways to play together. They gave us many difficulties in their counterattacks. I think we could have done better in some ways but, in the end, it was a tight game<br /><br /><b>[Kante has scored three goals in his last four <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> appearances]</b> Not especially <b>[being asked by <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> to score]</b>. I enjoy it, but I enjoy it more when we win. This is how it is for the whole team. No, no <b>[I am not like <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> was]</b>. I would rather win than score. I want to help the team and keep winning to stay at the top of the table. I am trying to score when I have the opportunity to help the team. I think from the years I have been playing here, and I am now more often arriving in the box.<br /><br />I start to score when I have the chances. It was a good goal. We didn’t manage to keep the result but a good pass from Mateo <b>[<a href="mateo-kovacic.html">Kovacic</a>]</b>. I hope we can score more as a team and win many games. I think this year, as the year before, we have a lot of quality midfielders. I think that it doesn’t matter who plays but everyone wants to play his part and give his best when they are playing. We are a squad together and it doesn’t matter who is playing, you just have to give your best for the shirt</p>

Maybe this is it for the qualification in the Champions League. We need to rest a bit and focus on Wednesday. Of course, of course, <b>[we mustn’t lose]</b>. Three points are needed for the Champions League game and we need to be ready for this game.

  <p><b>[N’Golo Kante says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have the team to win a title]</b> I believe we have the team to get what we want this season - to finish in the top four, get Champions League football next season and why not to win a title as well. We have everything that we need in this team<br /><br />We are having an important time of the season because we are all fighting for the fourth position. Man United were a bit behind but now they have closed the gap so it’s a big opportunity either for us to keep them behind or for them to close the gap more. It’s an important game for both teams. We all know that Man United at home is a very difficult game, especially after what happened in the first game but we don’t look at this. We just look forward because we want to keep the gap and so that’s why we need to win, not to get revenge<br /><br /><b>[Kante believes <a href="chelsea-fc.html">the Blues</a> have the perfect manager]</b> He was here for a long time as a player and won many trophies but now he is back with the status as manager of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. We know all about him as a player so when he speaks about my position as a midfielder, to go forward and get the balance in the team, you listen to him. He has good ideas, he wants to play the young players and the older players together to get our target to be in the Champions League. Frank knows how to bring the players to their best and we have time to get what we want from this season</p>
