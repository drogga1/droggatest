<blockquote>
  <p>[Sunday Adetunji hopes for another impressive season with Abia Warriors] I got a goal against FC Ifeanyi Ubah and it was the best way to start the pre-season for me. I just resumed for the pre-season few weeks ago after I was granted extended break because of my participation in the Caf Confederation Cup with Enyimba till October. It was the experience with Enyimba that actually made me forget about what happened to me two seasons ago in Makurdi. It was a horrible experience when I got injured at a time I was in the best form of my life. It was hard staging a comeback and when I did I was a little careful because I still had the whole drama coming back to my head. I think it was my brief period with Enyimba that made me rediscover myself. I began to enjoy my game again and I forgot about the injury nightmare. I knew I would only be staying with Enyimba for the remainder of last season and I can say that I enjoyed every bit of my stay there<br /><br />I can only say that I am back to my best and I want to have an explosive season with Abia Warriors. I have overcome my difficult times and I am eager to reclaim my best form again. This is just the beginning for me and I am going to sustain it. It is my desire for Abia Warriors to finish higher than they did last season</p>
