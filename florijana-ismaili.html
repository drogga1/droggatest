  <p>[<a href="young-boys.html">Young Boys</a> and Switzerland midfielder Florijana Ismaili has been missing since Saturday afternoon and police are carrying out searches for her, the club have confirmed] The officials of the BSC <a href="young-boys.html">Young Boys</a> have been informed that our player Florijana Ismaili has been missing since Saturday afternoon on Lake Como after a swimming accident. Searches by the police continue. We are very concerned and have not given up the hope that everything will turn out well.

  <p>[Florijana Ismaili has been missing since Saturday afternoon. Police searched the lake on Saturday evening, before calling the search off. The mission was resumed early on Sunday morning, but as yet has yielded no results] We’ve been up since 8 o’clock this morning. We take a rubber dinghy around the area [where Ismaili was last seen] in a two kilometre radius. So far in vain. Helicopters and divers will arrive later in the day. Lake Como is treacherous. It has strong currents under the calm waters.</p>

It could be that the young woman fainted when she jumped into the cold water</p>
