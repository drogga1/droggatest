  <p><b>[Thailand U23 head coach Worrawoot Srimaka is confident that his team will defend their SEA Games gold medal]</b> We have been through such crises in the U-23 event. We have survived and that means there’s nothing to worry. We should be able to win the gold.</p>

  <p><b>[Worrawoot Srimaka keeps faith with squad that qualified for 2018 AFC U23 finals]</b> About Check <b>[Suppachok]</b>, his profile is good, but I’m not sure about his condition. I’m concerned that if he face hard game there, he can be injured again. When he’s injured, he will rest about 1-2 monthes.</p>

  <p><b>[Thailand once again proved that they are the kings of South-East Asia after winning gold medal in the 2017 KL SEA Games]</b> Happy with the clean sheet, especially more so because we’ve only conceded one goal in the entire competition. We are lucky because Malaysia could have also scored. An unexpected goal but it is our luck. It’s a good experience playing in front of 80,000 fans.<br /><br />All the teams <b>[in the SEA Games]</b> are almost equal, with not much different with each other. We just came prepared to win. But this team is not the best team, we have many quality players who will join and improve the team for the AFC</p>

  <p><b>[Worrawoot Srimaka sacked as Thailand U-23 head coach]</b> Srimakha paid me a visit on Friday, asking for a chance to improve, which I carefully considered. <b>[But]</b> after the freedom to work without any intervention that he had been given, without delivering proper results, there will be no further chances given to him. He has been relieved of his duties with immediate effect, and I believe he’ll understand. We thank him and his staff for their hard work all these years.</p>
