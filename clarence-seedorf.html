  <p><b>[Clarence Seedorf on how he feels about being called ‘the most Brazilian foreigner in Brazil’]</b> Of course it’s a real compliment and, yes, I do feel a bit Brazilian. The facts prove that the very best players come from here, while there can’t be many places in the world where you go out on the street and see so many people wearing their clubs’ shirts. In Suriname, people really follow the Brazilian national team. When I was watching the 1986 World Cup with my dad, he had to take me outside and calm me down after Brazil lost to France. I was crying with anger, because it was <a href="zico.html">Zico</a>’s last tournament. For me, he was what football was all about</p>

  <p><b>[Is Clarence Seedorf doomed to fail with Cameroon?]</b> It was obviously difficult conditions but the team spirit, the fighting spirit to try to escape with the victory was there. I do not think another team would come here to have an easy day. I am absolutely not disappointed, but happy with the spirit we have shown. I finally got to know the players. This first step of this cycle has been very positive.</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar’s decision to leave Barcelona was a terrible sin on his behalf]</b> Neymar’s talent is undisputed, but he needs a squad that can help him grow in order to give the best of himself because he won’t achieve that on his own. I honestly believe that leaving Barcelona so quickly was a terrible sin on his behalf. If he had stayed in the club for two more seasons, things could’ve worked out differently for him. But now he is at PSG and that’s the path he needs to follow. Neymar also needs a manager who can give him what he needs, because he is still very young and he hasn’t been in Europe for too long. He also needs to play alongside other footballers who are better than he is, I’m not talking about players who rival his quality as a footballer but people who have won bigger titles than he has. These players can teach him about different experiences and they can also teach him more respect.</p>

  <p><b>[Cameroon manager Clarence Seedorf admitted he is unsure whether or not Jose Mourinho can bring success to Manchester United]</b> After Ferguson, it’s just difficult. It’s a transition phase still, and not only Ferguson but the players that he had. Once the last team of <b>[Paul]</b> Scholes, <b>[Ryan]</b> Giggs and <b>[Wayne]</b> Rooney fall away, it’s a part of the club that leaves the heart of the team. To replace that you need to have patience. That’s not only happened with Manchester United, it’s happening in Milan but they need to keep on working. I think they have all the means to be able to stay competitive.<br /><br />He <b>[Mourinho]</b> definitely has an interesting track record. It’s up to the club and him to understand whether his management still has influence and he can turn things around. He definitely has the capacity - I don’t think we have to discuss Mourinho’s qualities but sometimes things just don’t go and that could be the main decision to stop working with each other</p>

  <p><b>[Clarence Seedorf coaching career under scrutiny as Cameroon face Brazil]</b> Playing Brazil is always special - it will be a huge experience for all of the players and for us coaches too. It is a great testing moment, to understand where we are as a team and also, beyond the result and what happens in the actual match, the way we prepare and the attention around it will help us for important games in the future<br /><br />When I went to <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>, they were four points away from the relegation zone and by the end of the season we were just one goal away from being in the Europa League. In China I maintained the same results the team had been getting before, and although I could not take (Deportivo) La Coruna out of the relegation zone, people who saw the matches saw how we were playing and the evolution of the team<br /><br />Unfortunately results are the only thing that some people look at, but there is more to defining success than just stats. I am a winner - and I like to win - but I cannot think that, if I lose, I did not do a good job, because there are other external factors involved. I know what I do on a daily basis and how it improves players individually and how my teams have improved. People who really want to understand how I work will appreciate what has been done.<br /><br /><b>[He faces the insurmountable task would be helping Cameroon defend the Afcon crown as they host the tournament next June]</b> Of course African teams are underachieving when you think of what their potential is. That is one of the reasons I took this job. We want to change things and make a contribution to African football. The potential is incredible, the talent is incredible, so it is really about organising and creating a structure on and off the pitch for that to flourish. This is my life now as Cameroon coach - I am not a player any more so for me it is now about building my career as a coach. It does not only feel like a new career, it actually is one, and I am happy with that<br /><br />I am very satisfied with what I did as a player so I am not looking back with any strange feeling about that - I am ready for the new challenges you get as a coach - like this one. A lot is new for me now - a different environment, a different country, a different culture and a different mentality, but it is exciting to have to adapt, and it is fun too.</p>

  <p><b>[On Neymar]</b> He has to play with players better than him. Not technically, but those who have already won big prizes, who can talk to him and who he can respect. He’s still young; he’s not been in Europe for so long. It was a sin to leave Barcelona so quickly. Two more years there and it could have been different for him..</p>

  <p><b>[Ronaldo was king of Madrid but Zidane departure hit harder]</b> Cristiano was considered a king in Madrid and he guaranteed goals for the team. If Cristiano was still in the team then Los Blancos would have more confidence in themselves, but I don’t believe the results would have been so different. It’s likely that the exit of Zidane has had a far greater impact because the way of working has changed. Whoever had replaced him would have needed to do a special job in order to have immediate success and overcome the inevitable initial difficulties.<br /><br />It’s always difficult to know exactly what is happening internally when looking from the outside. Isco is for sure a very important player and he’s one of the footballers I would put on the pitch if I had the chance to coach him. At the same time, all important players go through difficult times and it’s the coach’s job to help the individual recover from either a physical or mental perspective. Solari isn’t crazy enough to leave out a player without having a good reason<br /><br />I consider Real Madrid my home and, to be honest, I would have accepted the job. There were contacts but the decision was made to go in a different direction. I’m young, so I hope to return in the future<br /><br />It would be like returning home. I already had a similar experience when I was AC Milan coach, so the feelings would be similar</p>

  <p><b>[Clarence Seedorf says Real Madrid remain capable of winning the Champions League]</b> Last year was the same question. If a club has the cups it has, you have to think that Real Madrid is always capable of reaching the final and winning it. Who was going to say they were going to win three in a row? Impossible! Because it never happened. Not even two in a row. So, of course, they are capable. Football never ceases to amaze us. Knowing that, it will be very difficult, but you can not rule out Real Madrid.<br /><br /><b>[Gareth Bale, Marcelo and Isco have widely been linked with moves away]</b> I do not know if they will have a change. What I always say is that young people need older people to develop their game, grow as people, and understand what Real means. And the club has done well because they have kept key players, and they are being competitive: third in the league, alive in the Champions League, eliminated in the semi-finals in the Spanish Cup but against Barcelona, which is not a shame either for any of them. Then I think that, having won so much these past years, they are having a decent year. A year where they remain competitive. Now, to demand that young people now be those who maintain all this capacity of the past few years of going and winning everywhere, it’s not so easy. It is not so simple. They have to build the group again with patience, where it is a moment of reflection for those players who have been a part of the story, and who can shine again, and the young people giving their energy. Those players (Vinicius and Reguilon) I think they’re giving it. But, when you play against Barcelona and other great teams in the world, you can lose. It happens. You can not always think about winning everything and forever. Everyone would like it, but you also have to know how to accept with intelligence the moment the club is going through. It is essential to get back to an important level</p>

  <p><b>[Clarence Seedorf has backed Vinicius Junior to reach the very top of the game at Real Madrid]</b> Vinicius is doing a very good job. Playing those matches gains experience for him. It is clear that the boy has talent, but you have to be patient. You cannot leave the pressure and responsibility on young people in general. Young people must enter a safe and protected environment to be able to pass and fail, so little by little they can adapt. The most important thing is that the environment protects them. Real Madrid bet on Vinicius a long time ago. He has had the good fortune of being able to graduate from the Castilla side quickly because Cristiano <b>[Ronaldo]</b> left and the others may not be going through their best moment, so he is creating his own space. And he’s carrying it with a lot of personality, putting in a lot of work and helping the team. It’s normal that not everything will turn out well. But we have to applaud the fact that he is contributing a lot of personality on the field, assuming a role that should not be his right now, but he is doing it. On the other hand, you have to be prepared if he can not give continuity, which is normal for any young person. It happens to everyone<br /><br />Only every 30 years there is one that is already a phenomenon from the first day and so on until the last day of his career: Ronaldo Nazario, <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi, Cristiano, <b>[Diego]</b> Maradona, Pele - we must keep calm. Look at Pato at Milan, who arrived at 18 years old, started to score goals under a lot of expectation, and now look at the career he has had. Sometimes it is not a criticism but, knowing football, it will be in five or six years when we can say that this guy is going to be a star or not. Having said that, I like Vinicius a lot from the matches I’ve seen him in recent weeks: how he faces the opponent, how he runs back to help. He’s going to have a great career if he keeps up this mentality of wanting to improve</p>

  <p><b>[Despite focusing on the job at hand, the former Netherlands international admitted when Real were in the hunt for a new manager in the summer, he was an unsuccessful candidate with the club opting to hire <a href="julen-lopetegui.html">Julen Lopetegui</a> instead]</b> I think there was a very simple reason: they had their idea and they chose it. A great club like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> always analyse all possibilities, and it was not an easy time either. It was all in a short time that they had to make such an important decision. But let’s say that the fact that I have been among the options is already a great honour for me. I feel like a place that is my home, where I wasn’t treated good, but more than good. Always. Returning one day would be an honour for me, but the most important thing for me would be that <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> keep to be competitive nowadays<br /><br /><b>[Seedorf also insisted the club’s disappointing season in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> so far was to be expected following huge success over recent years]</b> They have done incredible things in the last five years, and it is normal that you can have a bit of disappointment for the performances. They are human beings and everyone when they play against Madrid give something more. This moment of transition is not easy. But it is a club that has always shown in the difficult moments to be able to raise again, to find union and strength to improve. Now I think we have to respect <a href="santiago-solari.html">Solari</a>, who is doing his job in a complicated year and we have to give support to everyone so that things can keep in a positive and competitive way</p>
