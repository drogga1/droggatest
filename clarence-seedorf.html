  <p><b>[Clarence Seedorf on how he feels about being called ‘the most Brazilian foreigner in Brazil’]</b> Of course it’s a real compliment and, yes, I do feel a bit Brazilian. The facts prove that the very best players come from here, while there can’t be many places in the world where you go out on the street and see so many people wearing their clubs’ shirts. In Suriname, people really follow the Brazilian national team. When I was watching the 1986 World Cup with my dad, he had to take me outside and calm me down after Brazil lost to France. I was crying with anger, because it was Zico’s last tournament. For me, he was what football was all about</p>

  <p><b>[Is Clarence Seedorf doomed to fail with Cameroon?]</b> It was obviously difficult conditions but the team spirit, the fighting spirit to try to escape with the victory was there. I do not think another team would come here to have an easy day. I am absolutely not disappointed, but happy with the spirit we have shown. I finally got to know the players. This first step of this cycle has been very positive.</p>

  <p><b>[Clarence Seedorf coaching career under scrutiny as Cameroon face Brazil]</b> Playing Brazil is always special - it will be a huge experience for all of the players and for us coaches too. It is a great testing moment, to understand where we are as a team and also, beyond the result and what happens in the actual match, the way we prepare and the attention around it will help us for important games in the future<br /><br />When I went to <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>, they were four points away from the relegation zone and by the end of the season we were just one goal away from being in the Europa League. In China I maintained the same results the team had been getting before, and although I could not take (Deportivo) La Coruna out of the relegation zone, people who saw the matches saw how we were playing and the evolution of the team<br /><br />Unfortunately results are the only thing that some people look at, but there is more to defining success than just stats. I am a winner - and I like to win - but I cannot think that, if I lose, I did not do a good job, because there are other external factors involved. I know what I do on a daily basis and how it improves players individually and how my teams have improved. People who really want to understand how I work will appreciate what has been done.<br /><br /><b>[He faces the insurmountable task would be helping Cameroon defend the Afcon crown as they host the tournament next June]</b> Of course African teams are underachieving when you think of what their potential is. That is one of the reasons I took this job. We want to change things and make a contribution to African football. The potential is incredible, the talent is incredible, so it is really about organising and creating a structure on and off the pitch for that to flourish. This is my life now as Cameroon coach - I am not a player any more so for me it is now about building my career as a coach. It does not only feel like a new career, it actually is one, and I am happy with that<br /><br />I am very satisfied with what I did as a player so I am not looking back with any strange feeling about that - I am ready for the new challenges you get as a coach - like this one. A lot is new for me now - a different environment, a different country, a different culture and a different mentality, but it is exciting to have to adapt, and it is fun too.</p>

  <p><b>[Despite focusing on the job at hand, the former Netherlands international admitted when Real were in the hunt for a new manager in the summer, he was an unsuccessful candidate with the club opting to hire <a href="julen-lopetegui.html">Julen Lopetegui</a> instead]</b> I think there was a very simple reason: they had their idea and they chose it. A great club like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> always analyse all possibilities, and it was not an easy time either. It was all in a short time that they had to make such an important decision. But let’s say that the fact that I have been among the options is already a great honour for me. I feel like a place that is my home, where I wasn’t treated good, but more than good. Always. Returning one day would be an honour for me, but the most important thing for me would be that <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> keep to be competitive nowadays<br /><br /><b>[Seedorf also insisted the club’s disappointing season in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> so far was to be expected following huge success over recent years]</b> They have done incredible things in the last five years, and it is normal that you can have a bit of disappointment for the performances. They are human beings and everyone when they play against Madrid give something more. This moment of transition is not easy. But it is a club that has always shown in the difficult moments to be able to raise again, to find union and strength to improve. Now I think we have to respect <a href="santiago-solari.html">Solari</a>, who is doing his job in a complicated year and we have to give support to everyone so that things can keep in a positive and competitive way</p>

There’s been no response. but we have to have a deadline because we need to build a team, we cannot chase players. If players want to join us, they know where to find us<br /><br />All Cameroonian players in the world, local or playing wherever-if we think they can add value to us we will call them. The door is not closed for anybody. We are calling the players we think are best for the team, if we don’t call them then they are not best for the team at the moment.<br /><br /><b>[Another burning issue for Seedorf is the captaincy, with the armband being rotated among several candidates during his tenure to date]</b> Before the Afcon in Egypt we will get a list and get the first-choice captain, then second and third. We just need to be patient</p>

Which players have won the most Champions League titles? Juventus ace Cristiano Ronaldo is tied in second place with the second-most number of UCL trophies at five, won during his time at Manchester United and Real Madrid. He joins the likes of AC Milan legends Alessandro Costacurta, Paolo Maldini and Clarence Seedorf as well as other Los Blancos giants in Hector Rial and Marquitos.</p>

  <p><b>[When asked by the media, Clarence Seedorf unsure of Cameroon future after Africa Cup of Nations exit]</b> Maybe you want to give us a few days. The first thing is I’m very sorry for the boys. They have worked really hard and played well but this is football and only one can win in the end. It’s not so important in my future. The important thing is what we have built until now; we’ve improved in many aspects on and off the pitch. It’s a group that is very united. I hope the people at home can be proud of the fighting spirit we’ve shown. Obviously, the disappointment is really big but this is sport. This is the moment where everyone must say we are united and continue to work for the future.</p>
