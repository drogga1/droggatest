He is very fond of the city and this club. After <b>[Ronaldo]</b>(ronaldo.html) and <a href="marco-van-basten.html">Marco van Basten</a>, I’d say Ibrahimovic is the best Number 9 of the last 30 years. He’s still phenomenal, despite his age. Zlatan makes his team-mates give 110 per cent and can still make the difference in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>. He’ll have to, because 80-85% of the current squad do not deserve to be at Milan. I am sure Ibra will get the best out of them, because if they don’t give 100% in every training session, he raises his voice. When he does that, you’d better be scared. I also have faith in Paolo <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Maldini</a> and <a href="zvonimir-boban.html">Zvonimir Boban</a>, they deserve more patience. They’ve got Ibra now, there is talk of Jean-Clair Todibo from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, so I think Milan can get back to the top in two-three years</p>
