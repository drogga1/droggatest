  <p><b>[Antonio Cassano is willing to resist the lure of big money in China and continue searching for a new club in Europe]</b> For me, football is Europe. Football is a serious thing. Everybody says they are going to China because they are attracted by the project, but they are not telling the truth - they are going for the money.<br /><br />Football is competition, it is about measuring yourself with the best and then the money is secondary. Of course I’m well off and it’s easier for me to say no <b>[to China]</b>, but I’m definitely not going over there because I am attracted by any project. I definitely want to keep playing and enjoying myself. After my family, the most important thing for me in life is football. I love it and if there is an opportunity, I want to be enthusiastic and happy about it<br /><br />I’ve had a good career and I don’t know if I could have done any more than I have. There’s no room for ‘ifs’ in football. I had six years on my contract in <b>[Real]</b> Madrid and I left after just a year because I was a crazy fool. But that’s the way I am, and that is my biggest regret. But then I moved to Sampdoria and got to know my wife. She changed everything. I have two magnificent children and an amazing wife</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Cassano believes that his career would have been brighter had he taken advice from Francesco Totti]</b> I could have gone to Juventus from Bari, but I really admired Totti. He was the best and I could see similarities between us. I was meant to go to Juve, but when Roma made an offer, I told my agent we had to go there. I went there so I could play with Totti. It’s impossible not to be his friend. He’s a humble, real down to earth guy. I lived with his mum and dad for the first four months in Rome, so I really felt at home. If I had listened to just 10 per cent of all the positive advice that Totti gave me, I’d have had a very different career. We were dealing with the renewal of my contract and he said to me: ‘Remember, it is better to earn less but be happy than to go somewhere else in the world and not be 100% sure’. I went to Madrid and after a year and a half, I was away.<br /><br />I was seduced by their offer. If I’d listened to Totti, I probably would’ve stayed at Roma for 10-15 years along with him. That was the advice he gave me, and I had to listen. But I did my usual and it went instinctively to my head. We had such fun together and just understood each other in a flash. I had more fun playing football with Totti than at any other point in my life..<br /><br />My biggest mistake was the year and a half at Real Madrid, because I did everything and more to ruin it. That’s a huge regret. My joy at the time was not having rules. I wanted to go home, as my mother wasn’t happy in Madrid. There was the opportunity to play for Juventus in Serie B, I turned them down for the second time and went to Sampdoria. Juve are like a beautiful woman, but can’t have me!<br /><br />I was so happy at Samp and found the person in the world of football who was on a human level just the best: Riccardo Garrone. He was the father I wished I had. The row I had with him was the biggest regret of my personal life and I will never forgive myself for it. I am glad that, before he died, we cleared the air. I have always been an Inter fan, so I pushed like crazy to move from Milan to Inter. It was a good season, nine or 10 goals, then that guru Walter Mazzarri turned up and wanted to act like he knew everything. At the start he said there were no problems with me, but as soon as he signed, he said I was the first who needed to go<br /><br />I am another person now. I am more balanced and relaxed. I would like to continue playing because, after my wife and children, football is my life. I have been training hard with the youth team, because I am still very enthusiastic. It’s the first time I’ve remained at my target weight even without playing for six months. I am convinced that I can still have fun and make the difference in Serie A</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Cassano has announced another sensational U-turn in his retirement plans]</b> Remember Almeyda, the Argentina midfielder who played with Parma and Lazio? He stopped for two years then started again with River Plate, who play in a physical league. If I have the opportunity, I’ll always make a difference. I’m 110 per cent, I feel good with my head and my body - as for the feet, I can play until I’m 60! I often talk with Ale <b>[agent Alessandro Moggi]</b>, he performs miracles. I would like to play for a team near Genoa, where I live - maybe Bologna, Sassuolo, Parma, Turin… but also Empoli and Cagliari - because I cannot live without my family. There are things that make a difference for me, like accompanying my children to school.<br /><br />Can I make a difference? In this league? Yes. Today’s Serie A is a race with quantity, little footballing intelligence and quality. When I started at the end of the 90s, there were absolute champions. I remember Fiorentina: they only reached sixth place with Edmundo, Batistuta and Rui Costa. Apart from Ronaldo, Higuain and Pjanic, I do not see many champions around. Some of the players today wouldn’t have gotten close to the training ground 20 years ago</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo means Juventus have the Serie A title sewn up until 2022]</b> It goes without saying now, Juventus have the Scudetto sewn up until 2022. CR7 will score at least 40 goals, while I only see Inter behind the Bianconeri. Juventus did a great deal by signing the second best player in the world. Of course, I still consider Lionel Messi to be the best, as I even named my son after him. Ronaldo will repay Juve not just in goals and results, but also in economic terms.<br /><br />I know Real Madrid well and all that counts, even for Florentino Perez, is the club. When the time came, they dumped the Brazilian Ronaldo and David Beckham, so I’m not surprised they treated Cristiano like that, too. CR7 is made for Juve. He’s like an extra-terrestrial in terms of fitness, as he loves hard work and never takes his foot off the gas. I’m sure he’ll get along well with Allegri, as Max is extraordinary when dealing with champions. Having said that, I don’t think Juve are the favourites to win the Champions League, as I’d give that to Barcelona.<br /><br />Ronaldo will be Capocannoniere, with Gonzalo Higuain and Edin Dzeko on the podium. I’d put Mauro Icardi fourth in the list. I do believe Gonzalo could’ve played with Ronaldo, because he is effectively a copy of Karim Benzema and it won’t be easy to find a role for Paulo Dybala now</p>

  <p><b>[Former Italy international Antonio Cassano has said that AC Milan would be mad to let Gonzalo Higuain leave the club]</b> For me it’d be madness to sell Higuain. He’s their only decent player, their only champion, and one of the best strikers in the world. I would never get rid of him. If Milan want to win something they need their best players - with just their other players they’ll struggle.<br /><br />Higuain played for Real Madrid for seven years, there’s a reason for that. If Milan are having problems it’s because they don’t have players who can give him the right ball. His movement on the pitch is great, but no one gives him service - that’s why he wants to go to Chelsea. He’s having difficulties but he’s not finished. He’s always able to score and make a difference.</p>

Barella is worth 50 million euros? OK, so how much is Thiago Alcantara of Bayern Munich? He <b>[Thiago]</b> is young too, he is 27 years old. He is worth at least four or five times more than Barella. A player makes two good games, he runs right and left, maybe he is also a player of quantities like Allan or Barella, and then he is worth immediately 50, 60, 80 million? For me it is madness.<br /><br />I saw him <b>[Zaniolo]</b> play a couple of games, he’s good, but he’s still young. We’re not making comparisons with Totti, he’s a different player from the classic natural talent, in the sense that he’s very physical, he must be physically fit to play. He has good quality, he has room for improvement and he has personality. I still haven’t figured out if he’s a midfielder or a forward, but I like him</p>

  <p><b>[Former Italy and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> forward Antonio Cassano recalls a story about former Brazil forward <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>]</b> We were losing 1-0 at home. The whole stadium was whistling, especially him <b>[<a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>]</b>. In the locker room the coach removes Ronnie to put <b>[Ruud]</b> Van Nistelrooy on, but he <b>[<a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>]</b> stops him and says ‘no, you take me off in 15 minutes if I haven’t scored two goals’. Minute 15: 2-1 and two goals from <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. I said that if there is a football god, it is <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. Then I discovered that <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is above him</p>

He is super intelligent, he understands football, he killed you on the pitch when you played against him, but outside he is a great person. He must have had his good reasons.
