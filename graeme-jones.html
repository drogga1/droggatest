<blockquote>
  <p>[Eden Hazard has been likened to Lionel Messi by Belgium coach Graeme Jones] If you look at the FA Cup Final between Chelsea and Manchester United, Eden won the trophy on his own for Chelsea that day. They won 1-0, Eden won the penalty and then scored it. He is at that stage in his career where he has become a match-winner. There aren’t many in international football. Messi is also one of them. Eden is at his peak. He is fit, mentally strong, he has experience and is comfortable with his game</p>

  <p>[Real Madrid target Thibaut Courtois will definitely be heading out of Chelsea before the summer transfer window closes] I think definitely in Thibaut’s case. He’s got under a year left [on his contract] now, and I can only see him moving if I’m being honest. He’s obviously won the Golden Glove at the World Cup, and he had a fantastic tournament. I think he’ll move on.<br /><br />With Eden I don’t know. Contractually he’s a Chelsea player, but he’s another who had a fantastic World Cup and could play for any team in the world. Again, Alderweireld’s contract is running down. Toby is a great boy and an excellent footballer, and I think he’s one of those boys that whoever he plays for, he will be focused and will give everything he’s got. So we’ll have to wait and see</p>
