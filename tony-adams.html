Naturally because he played left-wing all those years he naturally slipped to that side and came up with that right-foot finish. It was always natural for him and he must have got about 50 goals just doing that move!</p>

If I went back there as a disaster, I would be a disaster as a manager, not as a player, so I’ve got no fear of going back there one day and doing it my own way - good, bad or ugly. Maybe not this year, but next season, I might have a chance of winning the Azerbaijan league title with Gabala and going into the Champions League qualifying rounds. We could even play <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, but they are struggling to get in the top five now, aren’t they? Who knows?<br /><br /><b>[The former Portsmouth boss has travelled 2,500 miles to revive his managerial career, and has already boosted the defensive displays of FC Gabala, a strength Adams has attributed to the management of <a href="george-graham.html">George Graham</a>]</b> We kept 21 clean sheets in 32 games last season, including 11 on the spin, which I believe is the 89th best in the history of football. Good back four, everyone behind the ball, good at set plays, very <a href="george-graham.html">George Graham</a>. No disrespect to Arsene, but George’s coaching ability, defensive structure and technical ability, for me, is far better.

George was an outstanding coach - I think I won six or seven trophies under him, including the Cup Winners’ Cup against <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> with a team including Ian Selley and David Hillier in midfield and Steve Morrow at the back.

We worked hard on organisation. Morning and afternoon. We hated George for it, but we were on top of our game and we reaped the benefits. We won the League in 1989 and 1991 but we should have done so much more - we under-achieved with that squad. I’ve been working at my job in Azerbaijan and when I came back at Christmas, during our winter break, I went to the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> game at the Emirates and it was great looking at the madness back in England - the greed, the fear and the managers’ average shelf life of one year, three months. More than 50 coaches have lost their jobs in English football since I went to Azerbaijan. I love the anonymity and I don’t think working in England is for me - apart from the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Tony Adams on life as an alcoholic. You suffered from painful self-loathing and self-doubt as a child. Do you think these characteristics made you more vulnerable to problems such as alcoholism later in life?]</b> I think it is nature and nurture. I think alcoholism is hereditary and genetic but there are also a lot of issues that maybe I could have avoided if I had dealt with them better in my childhood: fear being one of them. I pretty much ran away from everything other than football because it was the only place I felt comfortable. When I wasn’t on the football pitch I was full of insecurities. I had low self-esteem; I didn’t like myself; I had a big nose and big ears; I was the gangly, tall guy who didn’t fit in.<br /><br />I was so sensitive to any little jokes. I remember a book being passed around at school in a reading lesson and I was having a full-scale panic attack. There was just fear in my heart. I was sweating. When it came round to my turn to read I was in bits and I made a complete pig’s ear of it which only made things worse. I said ‘wheely’ instead of ‘really.’ There was a programme called ‘Chorlton and the Wheelies’ on TV at the time and I was then forever known as the ‘Wheelie Kid.’<br /><br />Normal boys would probably laugh it off but I am still talking about that incident 40 years later. The shame and the self-loathing and the lack of self-esteem were huge.<br /><br /><b>[q: In your days as a player you would sometimes wake up hungover, covered in vomit and urine. Do you still reflect back on those dark times?]</b> I am now 20 years without a drink so I know I don’t act like that and I have not wet the bed since then, so sometimes you think: was it really that bad? Did I really get sent to prison? (Adams served 58 days in Chelmsford Prison over the winter of 1990-1991 for drink-driving.) You can convince yourself as time goes on that maybe I can just have a glass of wine? But for me it is important to be real and to not gloss over those moments that got me to the bottom. That is the way it was. That is the person I was. And I have got to remind myself that my best drinking took me to the bottom.<br /><br />I go back to AA meetings to remind myself how bad it got. But I don’t think too much about the past. It is dealt with. I try to live in the day. If I get anxious at all it is usually about the future; the fear of what is next. But I try to stay in the day.<br /><br /><b>[q: Professional athletes dedicate themselves to their sport to the point of obsession. Did you find your sense of self-worth tied to your performances on the pitch?]</b> Absolutely, I said to James - he is my therapist but I call him my friend - that I know how to get drunk and I know how to play football but I don’t know who I am. In the early days I was Tony Adams, the footballer. That was who I was. Once you identify yourself with that sport, if you remove the football element, what is left? Who are you? So when you get injured or retire, where is Tony, the human being?<br /><br />I see this problem in footballers all the time now. When they stop playing, who are they? They have lost their identity.<br /><br />I have a great story which sums it up. I was at a Rolling Stones concert with Colin Pates who played for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and was very successful and later came to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. A kid came up to me and said: ‘can I have your autograph, Mr Adams?’ Then he looked at Colin Pates and he said: ‘didn’t you used to be Colin Pates?’ Colin had retired by this time. But even to other people you are entirely defined by what you used to do.<br /><br /><b>[q: Were there particular moments in your career - injuries, victories - when you were more likely to hit the bottle?]</b> It is a progressive illness and for me it is like a lift going down and down and down. You can get off at any floor. But yes Saturday afternoons after matches were common and then on Sundays it got worse. There were also holiday periods when I had no reason to stay sober so holidays were just fuelled with drink. Injuries were problematic too because I had no responsibilities so they were just another time to get on the lash.<br /><br />But it was not a simple case of going out for a couple of beers and going home. That is not my story. I took it to excess. I crossed a line and I couldn’t get back. I had long periods of sobriety when I was focusing on football but I always had a drink at the end of it. I would just fall off the wagon. It was like a running joke. I wouldn’t drink for weeks, then I would get pissed again. It went down and down. But there were other periods when I didn’t drink because I just swapped drinking for football, my first love.<br /><br /><b>[q: You helped to set up the Sporting Chance clinic to help other athletes dealing with addiction. Are things better for athletes today?]</b> We do about a hundred education seminars a year now but in my day no ex-pro came into the club and taught you some life skills. They took you down the pub. We are trying to pass the message on with the new generation that there are other ways to live.<br /><br /><b>[q: Was alcohol ingrained in the football culture in your era?]</b> I must admit it was in the culture in those days. I don’t think I could have got away with it in today’s modern game. Maybe I would have swapped that addiction for another and started gambling or something. I don’t think I could have kept up physically and still done that level of drinking.<br /><br />There has been a big shift away from alcohol and into gambling at the charity I work with. Certainly in my generation, over the three decades I played, booze was part of the industry. We would have a Tuesday drinking club but I had a Monday and a Wednesday club as well and it got out of control. I found myself not able to control it. I had lost all control by the end.<br /><br /><b>[q: As you sobered up, your male friendships changed. You spent less time with heavy-drinking teammates and more time with more thoughtful and intelligent teammates like <a href="lee-dixon.html">Lee Dixon</a>. Were you surprised at how sobriety changed you?]</b> When I was drinking I was not really talking to people. There is no real communication. It is banter and drinking, no more. But I have real humour today. I have real laughter. I have real pain. But I also have real friendships. I don’t think they were real friendships before. They were what they were. I don’t think anything less of those other guys. It was my problem, not theirs’. But when I put down the drink I started to change. I became close to different kinds of friends and different kinds of people became open to me too.<br /><br /><b>[q: As you were sobering up, you had to deal with the death of your parents, including watching your mother die of bone cancer. Was it difficult to stay sober during that period?]</b> Life happens and death happens but to go through that, as a man who couldn’t keep sober for three weeks - that was my record - was something I am proud of. I am now near on 21 years sober.<br /><br />Even good things like marriage and success can be dangerous at times, because that is when you are celebrating and happy and you think of booze as a reward. I would always celebrate trophies with a drink, so I would work hard for six weeks and then, when it was all done, I would have a skinful. That had to stop.<br /><br />But my mother’s and father’s deaths - and especially with my mum because it was really horrific watching her die; she didn’t deserve to die like that, she was a good woman - made me question everything. What the hell is this about? I had to watch her die over nine months and it was just horrific and so sad.<br /><br />I am proud of myself that I dealt with it step by step and I didn’t go down the pub, get smashed or run away. I was with her to the end. This is pretty much normal stuff for normal human beings but for me it was quite pivotal. I would never have done that before. I would have found some excuse and run away and got drunk.<br /><br /><b>[q: Your father never accepted that you were an alcoholic. Was the impact on your family the most devastating of all?]</b> It is really interesting with the family dynamic and how hopeless you feel. My first wife was an addict as well and there was a lot of co-dependency. You want to cure them, so I have got an understanding and compassion for family members who deal with this.<br /><br />My dad didn’t understand it. Listen, I didn’t understand it. That is why I kept drinking. So I have compassion for my dad and he reacted in the only way he knew. He sat me down in my kitchen and called me a drunk. He said: ‘Sort yourself out, son. You are drinking with builders, embarrassing yourself, weeing yourself. You have to take care of yourself, son.’<br /><br />A few years later when I had sobered up I took him for a nice meal and he said: ‘Tone, I won’t have it, not one person will call you a drunk. You are not. Your wife left you. You had a few problems.’<br /><br />I just said, ‘Thanks dad,’ and left it there. It is hard for anyone to understand. When my first wife was getting treatment I was ringing up counsellors, saying: ‘Get her arse home now! What are you doing? Get her sorted out, for God’s sake, and get her back home. I have got three kids in this room.’ I was angry but that comes from a lack of understanding of the illness.<br /><br /><b>[q: In AA meetings you were talking to tube drivers and plumbers, far away from the bubble of professional football. Did that dose of normality help you?]</b> There is one common denominator among all alcoholics and that is that we have all been to hell. By identifying together we get out of that hell. That is the common thing. Hopefully people don’t have to go there but luckily I got out. Other people were the same. They were tube drivers and postmen but they were the same as me. I identified with these guys. I am not special and different and neither are they. Illness doesn’t care how much money you have got.<br /><br /><b>[q: Were you a very different man on your debut in 1983 compared to in your final match in 2002?]</b> Oh my God, listen, thank God I sobered up six years before I retired because that gave me some preparation and I got to know myself as a human being. It meant I was ready and prepared to face the normal world. That little boy who was playing football for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> at the age of 17 was completely driven but so scared of failing and frightened of everything. By the end I was a completely different man.</p>

It’ll be difficult if they’re looking for European players - it’ll be quite tricky.<br /><br />Ivan Gazidis never had to make a decision but now he’s having to. He’s let a lot of people go. He realises it’s not been good enough and now maybe he’s doing something about it. I think these people need to be more accountable, step up and do their stuff. My great pal Rowley was phenomenal.

For the last 10 years now - <b>[we’ve been]</b> leaking goals, soft away from home. I wanted him to put his new goalkeeper <b>[Bernd Leno]</b> in, work with his back four, have two screening central-midfield players, and keep a clean sheet. It was crying out for it. But I didn’t see that. I thought he got a lot of selections wrong. His three best players were his subs <b>[Alexandre Lacazette, Stephan Lichtsteiner and Lucas Torreira]</b>. I don’t know why he didn’t start with them.<br /><br />I can’t see it. I don’t know what he’s been doing for the last six weeks. He’s been rotating all of his players and giving them all a game. They’ve got some good results but it’s pre-season. From minute one, I would’ve picked my own goalkeeper, my back four and put the two lads in that I want to screen those, and get a firm base that’s been missing for the last ten years. You’ve had six weeks of pre-season - go on, get on with it! Arsenal fans up and down the country all want him to challenge for the title but at the moment we’re nowhere near</p>

He’s a World Cup winner and a class act. He’s like Bergkamp, who cruised through his first couple of years at the Arsenal. We had to get him a little bit toughened up but Ozil hasn’t got the people around him to push him and get him going. There’s only so much a coach can do. It starts in training. We used to kick Dennis. <b>[Steve]</b> Bouldy would kick him up in the air again and again. After a while of this he turned round and stamped on Bouldy and said ‘I’ve had enough of you effing kicking me, you’re going to get a little bit back here’. We all said ‘aye, aye, he’s a got a bit about him - Hallelujah!’. But it’s all become a little bit too nice there. You can’t criticise or say bad things. When I was at the club, if people weren’t pulling their weight, I’d tell them. If you haven’t got leaders, you get anarchy. People just do what they want to do. The game has changed and it’s not about kicking people now but it is still about aggression. It’s about tracking runners, getting in behind teams, getting down the throats of opponents and really testing their touch.<br /><br /><b>[Adams believes Arsene Wenger is partly to blame for the shift in culture at Arsenal]</b> For the last 10 years he lost the balance. He stuck to his principles but he has an obsessive and addictive personality - he had to, to stay in that job for so long. Dave Sexton always said that a team needed a balance of ‘artists and soldiers’. Now George Graham would have wanted 10 soldiers and one artist. Arsene would have wanted 10 artists and one soldier. But I played this game with him once and he said ‘you need 11 artistic soldiers, Tony!’. That was his perfectionism. His obsession was to play free, play open, with no fear. Be entertaining and construct 18-pass moves for every goal. That’s a wonderful starting point but you maybe need a bit of realism when you don’t have the best players in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Tony Adams has spoken out in admiration of Arsenal’s Lucas Torreira]</b> I’ve been talking to the recruitment boys for a long while now. It’s obvious we needed a goalkeeper, we needed a decent back four, and we need somebody in front of the back four to protect them, and we’ve got one at long last. He may be three-foot-nothing but it’s a start and we love him. He’s a fan favourite because he gives everything and he looks like he really wants to play for Arsenal, and that’s all the fans want at the end of the day.</p>

  <p><b>[Aaron Ramsey’s decision to leave Arsenal for Juventus is confusing to Gunners legend Tony Adams]</b> Well it’s a different game and it’s a different club to the one that I left in 2002. We would be challenging. The Juventus players would be signing for us. Aaron Ramsey is too good to let go, and to not be an Arsenal player for ever. To be fair, why would you go to Juventus anyway? They’re a smaller club than Arsenal. That’s the way I’ve always felt about the Arsenal. But other people think differently - maybe he thinks Cardiff’s bigger</p>

It’s inevitable, if you keep turning it over you’re inviting pressure. It’s very worrying. Just push them out from the back and play in their half for a while</p>

The recruitment has been very poor for some years now. You have got to have characters in there. There are not any in the squad. It is difficult for him, he hasn’t got the players.

  <p><b>[Tony Adams says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are looking after themselves too much]</b> I think they are looking after themselves a little bit too much. They need brave people on and off the pitch. You need a bit of honesty here, and a coach to go ‘hold on a minute, come on guys’. You need to be called out. And I don’t think a lot of that has been going on. The coaches put on lovely sessions for the team and everything goes round and round until you go ‘actually guys, you’re the ones on the pitch, you’ve got to make the decisions and stand up and be counted’.<br /><br />There are not too many of those guys out there. They’re all kind of looking after themselves. And the minute it goes wrong, they’ve gone. They’ve gone under. It’s too lightweight, there’s not enough characters in there. I think they are feeling a little bit sorry for themselves. I think they need a bit of a shake. If I were the coach in there I’d definitely be giving them a shake and saying ‘look, be more scared of me than actually getting out there and getting on with it’. That’s what they need at the moment. They are sitting there waiting for things to happen instead of going and making it happen. They are ready for it to go wrong. When you go into a football pitch expecting bad things to happen they usually do<br /><br />You’ve got to walk on to that football pitch so positive, ‘we’re the best team in the country, we’re going to prove to everybody we’re fantastic players’. Like I said, at the moment they are a little bit sorry for themselves. It’s difficult - I remember back in the day if we weren’t leading at half-time they’d boo us off the pitch. They’ve got high expectations at the club. It’s irrelevant if those expectations are unrealistic. For me, you’re a player, you play for the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, you represent the club, you perform to your 100 per cent. There are not a lot of players doing that. They are all looking after themselves, blaming other people, you can’t be like that. You can’t wait for the crowd to help you, it’s the other way around. We always went out there to do our stuff, then you win the crowd over</p>

  <p><b>[Tony Adams says the athletes he has helped via his Sporting Chance charity eclipses anything he achieved during his playing career]</b> I needed a lot of pain. Alcohol gave me a good hiding: prison, intensive care, pissing myself, shitting myself, still not giving up. Do you know what I mean? Sleeping with people I didn’t want to sleep with. I have to remind myself, at the end of my drinking I did not want to live, but I didn’t know how to kill myself. I was at ‘jumping off point’, we call it. I got there, and only then was I able to ask for help<br /><br />Captaining your country, going out at Wembley, captaining <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to 10 trophies, playing your first game - they’re all amazing things. But, phew, saving people’s lives takes it out of all context. When I was at the bottom, you see, football was off the radar. The game that I love to death, absolutely has given me everything in my life, why I’m here sitting with you guys today, is football. And I couldn’t give a fuck. It was off the agenda. The charity is the best thing I’ve ever done<br /><br />As a charity we are not anti-gambling and not anti-drinking. We are very pro athletes who want help. We are not involved in the politics of the gambling companies or sponsorship. We don’t take any sponsorship from gambling or alcohol. It’s not part of me. I can’t be associated with something that nearly killed me. That would be morally wrong <b>[…]</b> Ideally I would get the advertising out of the game because it does influence people</p>

  <p><b>[Tony Adams says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s recruitment has delivered 10 years of depression]</b> It’s been bloody depressing the last 10 years. All us <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans are like: ‘Oh my God, we concede so many goals’ - going from the extreme that we were so fantastic in that department to what we’ve been seeing.

  <p><b>[Tony Adams on his alcoholism]</b> I remember going to Hong Kong before the tournament, when I was at a stage with my alcoholism that I knew if I picked up a drink, I wouldn’t have made the tournament.

So I locked myself on the 15th floor of the hotel and all the lads went out and had the infamous dentist’s chair while I was in my room, crying my eyes out and scared to death because I knew at that point, after I’d had five or six months trying to moderate my drinking, nothing had worked. But I knew that I could abstain from alcohol while I was playing football, as it was the only thing I had at that moment</p>
