  <p><b>[Victor Valdes has been appointed as <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s new U19A head coach, returning to Camp Nou five years after ending his time at the club as a player]</b> Victor Valdes is back at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">FC Barcelona</a> after signing a contract on Friday morning to become the new head coach of the U19A team. The agreement binds him to the club until June 2020, with the option for an extension by one additional season. The contract was signed in the presence of the director responsible for professional youth football, Silvio Elias, and the managers of the professional youth football section, Jose Mari Bakero and <a href="guillermo-amor.html">Guillermo Amor</a>. The U19A team will be beginning their pre-season preparations on July 29 and will be appearing in the game to open the new Johan Cruyff Stadium on August 27 against the Ajax youth team<br /><br /><b>[The club also penned a small tribute to Valdes highlighting why he became a fan favourite at the club]</b> Valdes was always solid between the sticks, was a master at playing the ball with his feet and had an authoritative presence in his area. For several seasons, he was the absolute first-choice stopper and huge fan favourite</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> youth coach Victor Valdes has revealed he had to help <a href="ansu-fati.html">Ansu Fati</a> buy new boots after discovering just how poor the teenager’s pair were]</b> I told him to bring me his boots and they were a complete disaster, they were causing him pain. Nobody had thought it could be the boots, but I did. We went to buy some new ones<br /><br /><b>[With both <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> out injured, opportunity presented itself for the teenager and Valdes clearly believes it’s just the start for Fati]</b> He’s strong, quick and self-confident. You have to give this kind of talent freedom so that he flows. I’m so happy for him, he called me this morning and it made me very excited. I’m thankful to Valverde for giving him some minutes. His performance didn’t surprise me. He represents hard work. He has the soul of an elite player and he’s a predator in the box</p>
