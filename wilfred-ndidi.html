  <p><b>[Nigerian star Wilfred Ndidi has admitted he is flattered to be linked with a big money move away from the King Power Stadium]</b> I am flattered when hearing such a thing. It is very good to hear about that interest from big clubs, but there is nothing on the ground so I won’t care about it. I am focusing on AFCON with Nigeria now, and then pre-season with <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a>. We have a great manager with ambition to compete with big clubs in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Ndidi, however, is taking nothing for granted ahead of next weekend’s opener]</b> <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> is a very good player. I’ve played against him three times - he’s a great finisher and very fast. <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> is also a very good player. But the toughest one for me is (Algeria’s) <a href="riyad-mahrez.html">Riyad Mahrez</a>. He was at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> and we trained together every day before he left for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. He is very difficult, skinny and very technical. You have to slow down to take him out - if you go fast he will finish you in seconds. I don’t think that it is an easy group. For me, there is no easy team in modern football. The name does not matter - the only thing that matters in the 90 minutes of the game. We can get a shock from this group, so we have to stay focused on the game, not on how easy it is, and ignore what people say. We will play tough games against very good teams, and our target is to be on the top by the end of the group stages<br /><br /><b>[on <a href="john-obi-mikel.html">John Obi Mikel</a>]</b> It is great to play with him. I grew up watching Mikel. He is my role model and playing alongside him is a great thing. He is very calm, a good captain, and he gives advice to everyone and speaks with everyone. When you talk to him, he is very humble. It is a plus to the team having such a player. We grew up watching him, and now we’re playing with him he gives us more confidence. With our current players, coach and staff, I think we can do something great. The important thing is to try to win games as much as we can. We cannot talk about winning the cup now - we will deal with it game by game and see what will happen. There are many good teams here. For me, Senegal and Egypt are the favourites. Senegal is a very good, tough team and they have great players, while Egypt are at home</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> midfielder Wilfred Ndidi is ‘happy’ to be studying business and management at the De Montfort University]</b> I was really happy when DMU staff said I could study here. I wanted to do this course because growing up in Nigeria we didn’t really have the opportunity to actually go to school. It’s a personal thing for me that I want to do, to expand myself and learn new things. Instead of sitting at home after training I come to DMU for my classes. The teachers have been amazing, they really try and help me understand. Rather than just reading books they take time to explain things to me and they are also very understanding about my schedule with training<br /><br />Back home so many kids aren’t able to go to school because their parents can’t afford it. I want to set up a football resort where people can stay and play football while getting an education at the same time. I think it’s really important to try to learn things outside of your normal life</p>

  <p><b>[Ndidi happy at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> amid <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> links]</b> We are doing well and I am enjoying myself here. I still have a contract with <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>. I am learning and trying to improve myself every day and I am doing okay here so no need to go anywhere. It’s the <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> effect. With him, it is not just about the 11 players and subs. Even the players in the Under-23s, he carries everybody along. So there is always space for anybody to fill in and to play. He is that kind of coach that always believes in the squad and not just one player. The main thing is the squad, the squad comes first. That is why we are doing very well, because we understand that we must always try our best. Where we are is because we work hard and try to improve all<br /><br />No disrespect to other managers but kudos to <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a>. He has done a lot of work on me. I remember the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> game when (Mason) Mount took the ball from me and scored? That day made me a better player. The manager and the staff spoke to me. They made me understand what to do better and made me take it as a habit to do certain things, but he encouraged me to continue to play my game. The fact that he trusts and tries to improve the players is one thing. It is very difficult for a manager to come in and then dedicate himself to improving players, getting regular one-on-one meetings with players to help them make improvements. This is professional football, some teams won’t have that time for you to do all that. Everybody just focused on the business, they’re paying you for it and expect you to do the work. But Rodgers is different, very differents</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a>’s Wilfred Ndidi opens up on tough childhood]</b> Though we had some ups and downs and trying to meet up with some bills, I was always there for my mum. My mum was a food vendor and I supported her by hawking. I don’t regret that because growing up was really tough because it was all about survival. There were no fruits that I didn’t sell. I was the market boy and I was known mostly for selling groundnuts because it comes out every season. Just name them - I sold peppers, tomatoes and avocado. We basically sold fruits that came with different seasons. All these were done to survive in the military zone and outside<br /><br />It was difficult because my dad wanted me to go to school but there was no money. What made it easier for me was that when he was transferred out of Lagos. I had the freedom because when he was around, if I go out to train and he gets home before me, I have to explain where I was coming from. When I tell him I went to play football, I get whooped. There was a time I got whooped with a cow skin ‘Koboko’ and it was like a tattoo on my body. I couldn’t wear my shirt because when I put my clothes on, it becomes sticky and it’s painful. It was a military kind of discipline<br /><br />Growing up, I didn’t get a chance to play more with my peers because they were training in the evenings while the bigger guys were training in the morning. I was training with the bigger guys but just for ten minutes because I was too small. They always put me in when everyone is tired and also for them to be able to give me the training bibs to wash and bring the next day. My mum kept complaining because I didn’t have the time to wash them because I had to go hawk for her, but before I return, she would have washed them. That was the routine until I left my mum for Nath Boys</p>

  <p><b>[Wilfred Ndidi has praised the philosophy of <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> and said the manager has had an instant impact on his career at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a>]</b> Playing under <b>[Brendan]</b> Rodgers has changed my game so much after from the fact that I moved from an attacking team to a possession team. When he <b>[Rodgers]</b> came, he was trying to make us understand that he will always be there for us. He makes time to meet the players individually and tries to make us understand that there is space in the sky for us to improve. Since he came, I won’t lie to you I have improved as a player because I now understand simple things I never knew. No disrespect to other mangers, Brendan took his time to explain things like understanding space, understanding the game, where you can actually be and how you can actually improve on yourself and your quality<br /><br /><b>[When asked to compare Rodgers’ style of management to others, the 23-year-old responded]</b> My training style and that of so many players have improved. He made us understand that whatever we did during training is what we’ll do during games - there is no magic. You can’t be lazy in training and expect to be a superman during games. It all begins from the first whistle during warm-ups. During our training, you just have to be there. It’s not an academy where everybody will come and pamper you. One thing he has done also is encouraging the whole team and letting us know that there is no one who is irreplaceable. That is just his philosophy</p>
