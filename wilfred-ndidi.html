  <p><b>[Wilfred Ndidi has played down comparisons to N’Golo Kante as he helps to repair the damage caused by the loss of the box-to-box midfielder at Leicester]</b> No, I have never put myself in Kante’s shoes. I didn’t look to play like him when I arrived. I just came here to play my own game. I just feel like a different player to him. He is a good player, he has proved that he’s great this season. With the support of others, you can do anything you want and you can do it here.<br /><br />My parents are very, very happy. Although, my dad never wanted me to play. He wanted me to go to school instead but I didn’t listen. I was always just playing football. When you are in the game, you have great opportunities so I don’t really try to look where I want to be. I just want to play and do my best. If I work hard, it will open doors to get me wherever God wants me to be.<br /><br />For Ranieri, I felt bad. I don’t really talk about managers though. I am just here to play my football. It was sad that he left, though, because he brought me here but I just need to focus on my game. I am still playing. It is just football, everything became good. Everything started to come together. I never experienced any problems in the dressing room with any players. We were always happy in the dressing room and looking forward to games. Optimistic. We were focused on trying to win. When we lost, everyone was down, but I didn’t notice anything personally. I didn’t see anything strange<br /><br />I have this mind to adapt quickly. I didn’t find it very difficult. It is easy because everybody speaks English. I have a team-mate Ahmed Musa from Nigeria, which helps also</p>

  <p><b>[Wilfred Ndidi’s incredible assist from centre-back led him to become a Premier League star]</b> I didn’t score <b>[to impress Genk]</b>, I was actually playing in central defence. I was told not to play long balls, so I just made a one-two and another one-two and then I gave a pass, made an assist. It was important because we were an academy, we played a team from the Nigerian Premier League <b>[and we were only an academy]</b>, 3SC Shooting Stars, who were winning 1-0. I gave that pass and it made it 1-1. I was the only one selected out of 40 teams, 500 players. I had to go and do trials in Genk after that. Then I did the trials in Genk, After a year, they gave me a contract. It was difficult <b>[coming to Europe]</b> but I stayed with a family who tried to make me feel like I was at home. It was the time of the trial. So when I came home every day I felt like part of the family, it felt like home and made it easier.<br /><br />I always wanted to play for my country. I feel good, I feel so much fun in the national team. I like seeing my friends and I feel good here but I never see myself as a very important player. I have always said to myself, anywhere I go, I can be replaced. So I just try to keep doing my very best. Keep focused. <b>[The squad]</b> have a lot in common. There’s a lot of guys around the team who are my ages so communication is easy. <b>[Iwobi and Kelechi]</b> have lots of strengths and play good football, you know, because of where they play and their experience. They have experience in Arsenal and City which is good for the country. They have a lot of skills and the future is good <b>[for Nigeria]</b>. I don’t think about the World Cup, I just feel we need to take every game as it is. That’s important. Fight for every point that we need, that way we can improve where we stand in the qualifiers and get to the World Cup. I have played in the junior World Cup, so I have that feeling about how the World Cup might look. I know the senior World Cup will be much more big. It would be good to feel that</p>

  <p><b>[Wilfred Ndidi admits it was John Terry and John Obi Mikel who inspired him to become a footballer]</b> I have always looked up to Mikel. When he was at Chelsea, I was at Nath Boys <b>[as a youth player]</b> and I have always liked him as a player. I have always been crazy about Mikel. The way he plays is amazing. When me and my friends talk about players, we always want to talk about Mikel. He is so important for Nigerian football. I actually liked two players from outside of Nigeria <b>[when I was younger]</b>. Kaka and John Terry. Because I was a central defender, I was watching John Terry. The way he was leading Chelsea and putting his heart into it made me like him. I liked Chelsea, with Mikel and Terry. They were my favourite players, but I never dreamed of the Premier League. I just wanted to play football. Enjoy the game. For Kaka, I didn’t watch much of him at AC Milan, but when he won the Balon d’Or and I started to look at him. I followed him up and watched him more when he went to Madrid. I liked his style of play and I liked his lifestyle outside of football. Very professional.<br /><br />Yes, I always wanted to play football. I wanted to play in Europe but I could have played in Nigeria instead. I never specifically wanted to play in the Premier League or anything like that, I just put my game first. Doing everything on the pitch will bring everything</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi says he went against the wishes of his parents in becoming a professional footballer]</b> My family were not really into football. My dad watched it on the television but he didn’t want me to play football. He is a soldier, but he didn’t want me to follow in his footsteps, he just wanted me to go to school. I did miss out on some school because of football. When I moved to Nath Boys academy then I started to miss out on some of my schooling. My family haven’t been over to see me play yet. They only see it on TV.<br /><br />When I was going on to the pitch I was nervous, seeing players like Romelu Lukaku and the players I was used to seeing on television. But when the game started I was like ‘okay, let’s just do it’. That is how I try to do things. That is the way I live<br /><br />I know how to drive but I don’t have a licence. I need one over here. The lads came out and took a picture of me when the instructor came to pick me up for a lesson. Ahmed Musa has been helping me. He drives me around. If we have an away game, he picks me up and drives me to the airport, and he is showing me around</p>

  <p><b>[Having seen N’Golo Kante head for Chelsea in 2016, the agent of Wilfred Ndidi, Hakeem Bello, has warned Leicester that his client won’t say no to Manchester United]</b> Ndidi won’t say no to Manchester United. I can proudly tell you that if a bid is launched for him, he will most likely ask Leicester City for a transfer. We’re talking Manchester United, the biggest and most successful <b>[club]</b> in England. That’s a no brainer.<br /><br />We can do nothing about speculation. It is a credit to him, in terms of the way he has performed, but also the way he is. He is a very good professional, very mature head on his shoulders. I have no problem with speculation, but we have our best players tied up. Of course, there can always be bids, we can always turn them down. But football is football, you’ll always get bids for good players. It is vitally important we keep our young players. Speaking to Wilfred, he is very happy here. He knows that we have given him the opportunity and I am sure that he will be a player here for a long, long time</p>

  <p><b>[Wilfred Ndidi has issued a rallying cry ahead of his side’s unlikely Champions League quarter-final clash against Atletico Madrid]</b> It was really amazing because right from the start we spoke to ourselves and said we need to try to be warriors <b>[against Sevilla]</b>. That’s the only way we could win. We had to go out and do everything we wanted. The atmosphere was nice but we just had to leave it and focus on the game. We all like winning games here, especially a big game like this. Atletico will be another huge game. We will just do our best and that’s all we can do. It will be good to test ourselves.<br /><br />They are good guys, they are good players also. They have so much technique - especially Mahrez - but Vardy also. He’s impressive. Everything is good, I like playing with them. Everyone is my friend in the team as long as we are team-mates. I try not to have favourites, the game is more important. Vardy is very funny though, he is always trying to make fun of people and trying to bring something for us to have a laugh<br /><br /><b>[Ndidi has looked immediately comfortable in a Leicester shirt]</b> On my initiation, I had to sing. I don’t want to say what I sang but it wasn’t great. I have given up on my signing skills after that day. I was very nervous standing up in front of my team-mates because I don’t know how to sing</p>

  <p><b>[Wilfred Ndidi has adapted quickly from Belgian football to the Premier League and Champions League]</b> Genk bring together young players, they try to make them understand football properly, you know. It was difficult <b>[when I came in]</b> it was the first time I came to Europe. I stayed with a family who tried to make me feel like I was at home. There were also different managers with different methods, but they always try to keep the players in the first team young and they give them a chance. They train them well and seem to find the right players.</p>

  <p><b>[Nigerian star Wilfred Ndidi has admitted he is flattered to be linked with a big money move away from the King Power Stadium]</b> I am flattered when hearing such a thing. It is very good to hear about that interest from big clubs, but there is nothing on the ground so I won’t care about it. I am focusing on AFCON with Nigeria now, and then pre-season with <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a>. We have a great manager with ambition to compete with big clubs in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Ndidi, however, is taking nothing for granted ahead of next weekend’s opener]</b> <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> is a very good player. I’ve played against him three times - he’s a great finisher and very fast. <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> is also a very good player. But the toughest one for me is (Algeria’s) <a href="riyad-mahrez.html">Riyad Mahrez</a>. He was at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> and we trained together every day before he left for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. He is very difficult, skinny and very technical. You have to slow down to take him out - if you go fast he will finish you in seconds. I don’t think that it is an easy group. For me, there is no easy team in modern football. The name does not matter - the only thing that matters in the 90 minutes of the game. We can get a shock from this group, so we have to stay focused on the game, not on how easy it is, and ignore what people say. We will play tough games against very good teams, and our target is to be on the top by the end of the group stages<br /><br /><b>[on <a href="john-obi-mikel.html">John Obi Mikel</a>]</b> It is great to play with him. I grew up watching Mikel. He is my role model and playing alongside him is a great thing. He is very calm, a good captain, and he gives advice to everyone and speaks with everyone. When you talk to him, he is very humble. It is a plus to the team having such a player. We grew up watching him, and now we’re playing with him he gives us more confidence. With our current players, coach and staff, I think we can do something great. The important thing is to try to win games as much as we can. We cannot talk about winning the cup now - we will deal with it game by game and see what will happen. There are many good teams here. For me, Senegal and Egypt are the favourites. Senegal is a very good, tough team and they have great players, while Egypt are at home</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> midfielder Wilfred Ndidi is ‘happy’ to be studying business and management at the De Montfort University]</b> I was really happy when DMU staff said I could study here. I wanted to do this course because growing up in Nigeria we didn’t really have the opportunity to actually go to school. It’s a personal thing for me that I want to do, to expand myself and learn new things. Instead of sitting at home after training I come to DMU for my classes. The teachers have been amazing, they really try and help me understand. Rather than just reading books they take time to explain things to me and they are also very understanding about my schedule with training<br /><br />Back home so many kids aren’t able to go to school because their parents can’t afford it. I want to set up a football resort where people can stay and play football while getting an education at the same time. I think it’s really important to try to learn things outside of your normal life</p>

  <p><b>[Ndidi happy at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> amid <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> links]</b> We are doing well and I am enjoying myself here. I still have a contract with <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>. I am learning and trying to improve myself every day and I am doing okay here so no need to go anywhere. It’s the <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> effect. With him, it is not just about the 11 players and subs. Even the players in the Under-23s, he carries everybody along. So there is always space for anybody to fill in and to play. He is that kind of coach that always believes in the squad and not just one player. The main thing is the squad, the squad comes first. That is why we are doing very well, because we understand that we must always try our best. Where we are is because we work hard and try to improve all<br /><br />No disrespect to other managers but kudos to <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a>. He has done a lot of work on me. I remember the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> game when (Mason) Mount took the ball from me and scored? That day made me a better player. The manager and the staff spoke to me. They made me understand what to do better and made me take it as a habit to do certain things, but he encouraged me to continue to play my game. The fact that he trusts and tries to improve the players is one thing. It is very difficult for a manager to come in and then dedicate himself to improving players, getting regular one-on-one meetings with players to help them make improvements. This is professional football, some teams won’t have that time for you to do all that. Everybody just focused on the business, they’re paying you for it and expect you to do the work. But Rodgers is different, very differents</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a>’s Wilfred Ndidi opens up on tough childhood]</b> Though we had some ups and downs and trying to meet up with some bills, I was always there for my mum. My mum was a food vendor and I supported her by hawking. I don’t regret that because growing up was really tough because it was all about survival. There were no fruits that I didn’t sell. I was the market boy and I was known mostly for selling groundnuts because it comes out every season. Just name them - I sold peppers, tomatoes and avocado. We basically sold fruits that came with different seasons. All these were done to survive in the military zone and outside<br /><br />It was difficult because my dad wanted me to go to school but there was no money. What made it easier for me was that when he was transferred out of Lagos. I had the freedom because when he was around, if I go out to train and he gets home before me, I have to explain where I was coming from. When I tell him I went to play football, I get whooped. There was a time I got whooped with a cow skin ‘Koboko’ and it was like a tattoo on my body. I couldn’t wear my shirt because when I put my clothes on, it becomes sticky and it’s painful. It was a military kind of discipline<br /><br />Growing up, I didn’t get a chance to play more with my peers because they were training in the evenings while the bigger guys were training in the morning. I was training with the bigger guys but just for ten minutes because I was too small. They always put me in when everyone is tired and also for them to be able to give me the training bibs to wash and bring the next day. My mum kept complaining because I didn’t have the time to wash them because I had to go hawk for her, but before I return, she would have washed them. That was the routine until I left my mum for Nath Boys</p>

When he <b>[Rodgers]</b> came, he was trying to make us understand that he will always be there for us. He makes time to meet the players individually and tries to make us understand that there is space in the sky for us to improve. Since he came, I won’t lie to you I have improved as a player because I now understand simple things I never knew. No disrespect to other mangers, Brendan took his time to explain things like understanding space, understanding the game, where you can actually be and how you can actually improve on yourself and your quality<br /><br /><b>[When asked to compare Rodgers’ style of management to others, the 23-year-old responded]</b> My training style and that of so many players have improved. He made us understand that whatever we did during training is what we’ll do during games - there is no magic. You can’t be lazy in training and expect to be a superman during games. It all begins from the first whistle during warm-ups. During our training, you just have to be there. It’s not an academy where everybody will come and pamper you. One thing he has done also is encouraging the whole team and letting us know that there is no one who is irreplaceable. That is just his philosophy</p>
