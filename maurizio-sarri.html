But it’s honestly a pity that we only discovered Mertens as a striker at the age of 28, because he could have been at the top level in the world for years and years.</p>

My goal is to have fun and be competitive until the end. In life the biggest gift you may receive is to have fun while you do your job. I think it is better not to whinge, but to enjoy.

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri is happy his side secured Jorginho from under the noses of Manchester City]</b> I will try to explain all the <b>[transfer]</b> situation to <b>[Guardiola]</b> on Sunday. Jorginho is one of the steps to try to reduce the gap. He’s only the first. But the rest is to work and <b>[ignore]</b> the market. We need Jorginho more than City, so it’s right that Jorginho is here. Pep has great midfielders, central midfielders. Fernandinho is a wonderful player. The table of the last PL told me City 100, Chelsea 70 points. We have to try to reduce 30 points and I know only one way: to work. My job is this, to improve my players. I will try to do it. I don’t think that every problem can be resolved by the market.<br /><br />Apart from the tactical point of view, I think it’s very difficult for everybody to play against City. Not only for one player or another. I played against City in November last season, in the best moment of City, of the season. And it was very hard, very difficult. The first 20 minutes was a nightmare, it was horrible<br /><br />I talked with him <b>[Hazard]</b> yesterday. We didn’t talk about this <b>[transfers]</b>.

They arrived yesterday or the day before so it was only because I think it’s better to play 25 minutes than to have a session alone with a physical coach. They have to work, obviously. I’m very happy and at last I can work with all my players for the first time <b>[together]</b> tomorrow. We have only three days to prepare for the next match and it will be very important for us.

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri is concerned that Chelsea might struggle in their first few games as he implements his ideology on the team]</b> They know it. They know it very well. I hope that the second part of the season, for us, will be very good with a lot of points. I expect in the first part of the season some problems. At the moment, we are not at the top of our potential. We did a pre-season and what can I say? It was unusual, maybe. So, we are not at the top. I hope to be at the top of the potential of the squad in one or two months, but I don’t know. Sure now, we are not at the top. <b>[I expect a problem]</b> with the results. Maybe the performances in the first part of the season will not be in line with the potential of the squad. I think you have to wait for a couple of months <b>[to see my best football]</b>. You have to wait.<br /><br /><b>[I will change pre-season]</b> completely, I think. If I can, completely. I don’t know. I arrived in the middle of July, so the problem was there. I have to accept it completely, but I think, for the future, it will be better to change it. But I think that my perfect programme of pre-season is not completely in line with the programme of the club. So, we have to arrive at a compromise<br /><br />It was the same in pre-season this year, I think. We have to play at another speed. The offensive phase may be a problem at this speed. If we are able to play at another speed, maybe scoring will not be a problem for us. But, at this moment, at this current speed, it may be a problem. No, <b>[it isn’t because of]</b> Conte. He plays another football. The players in this moment need to think what to do too much, and so the ball is not moved at the right speed, material and mental, at this moment. They have to think too much. In Naples we played at great speed, ball forward, ball back, with continuity, with great speed with the strikers. So, it was fun for the supporters. And useful for the results, I think. We made the record of the club in the first, in the second, in the third year. <b>[We got]</b> 91 points in the last season. On 23 of the last 25 Serie A <b>[seasons]</b>, 91 points was enough to win it. So, it was a bit unlucky, I think. I have to adapt myself on the characteristics of these players, and not vice versa<br /><br />I saw the last three matches of pre-season, and then I saw one match of last season against Liverpool, because Liverpool played 4-3-3 in that period. I think it can be a very difficult game because they did a very good pre-season, and I know that in the last season, they started really very well. They won their first three games in the last Premier League season. So, at this moment, they can be a very dangerous opponent. I have to do it week by week <b>[to learn about the other teams]</b>, I think. In pre-season I was really very busy with other things, so I have to study week by week. I started to study with Huddersfield. I respect them very much. In this moment, they are a very dangerous team</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri has admitted he was was concerned about losing Eden Hazard during the transfer window]</b> Of course, I was concerned about this problem. The first time I spoke to him, I was sure that he would stay. So I was concerned for 20 days, no more. Chelsea are one of the most important clubs in Europe. I think one of the most important clubs in Europe cannot sell an important player without the possibility of buying a player on the same level.<br /><br />Hazard, technically, is really one of the best in Europe in this moment, I think. He has to work from the physical point of view, of course. In the last five years, Cristiano <b>[Ronaldo]</b> has played like a striker. <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi like a striker, Eden sometimes like a winger. Eden can improve. We are talking about one of the most important players in Europe now but, in my opinion, he can improve more. He can be the first. It depends on him. The best for technical skill, the best for scoring, but I think it depends only on him. On his mind<br /><br />Because I think my players are professional. They must be professional not by rules, but by a good mentality. I don’t know <b>[if I have a relaxed attitude]</b>. We talk about nutrition, but we have a very good doctor <b>[as well]</b>. He’s better than me <b>[on that subject]</b>. We are talking about the day before the match, but that depends on the moment. Now, at this part of the season, we need to stay together the day before the match. But, in the future, when we play three times a week, maybe it would be better to stay at home before the matches.

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri smirked as he revealed that he is giving up smoking cigarettes]</b> No I needed half-time and the first half to end, not a cigarette. I am going to stop for just one or two years then I will start again. Inside there were 15 minutes that were horrible. We lost ground, we were not able to press, we were not able to defend, we were really in trouble. I think in the second half, we did very well from our mental point of view. It was really very hard to answer about the last part of the first half. I prefer to speak about the other 75 minutes, it is better. I remember better the good things instead of the worst.<br /><br />In terms of quality not too much <b>[more is needed]</b>, because in the first 25 minutes we did really very well.

We have to improve which I think is normal. We started to work all together just two weeks ago, so my target now is to play 90 minutes like we played our first 25.

It’s usually three months, but my feeling is in this team there are a lot of intelligent players so I hope only two months. It takes defenders longer because I want to defend by looking only at the ball, and some players have played for 10 years looking at the man, so you have to change the way of thinking of this player, and it’s not very easy. For a defender who is 18, it is easier. For a defender who is 30, it is more difficult<br /><br />I like it when the team is in control of the match, I like very much the ball possession, I like to play in the other half. Ball possession, but at a very high speed. Mental speed, first of all, not only ball possession in my half. Maybe I’ve learned it from a lot of lost matches, I think! I tried to play as a five-man defence six years ago, but for me it is impossible. Because if I want to press in the other half, if I want to look only at the ball with five defenders, I lose immediately the metres</p>

If you are 28 and, for 10 years, you’ve played the other way, it’s not so easy. So you have to change completely the mind.<br /><br />I think it’s better. I think, if you arrive to think in this way, then it’s very easy. It depends only on you. You are not depending on the opponent. I think it’s very easy and if you defend by looking only at the ball, you can stay very high up the pitch. In the other way, you defend on the movements of the opponent.<br /><br /><b>[The forward line will normally be no more than 15 metres away from the defensive line and Sarri rubbished the assertion that his players are struggling to cope physically with his methods]</b> No. I don’t think so. If you defend forward, you only have to do 10-15m. If you have the ball inside, you have to back for 50m. I think we can press for 90 minutes, only if we have the right distances between the players, we stay very high. Otherwise it’s a problem, of course<br /><br />No. I don’t think so.

If he improves that, he could be the best left-back in the world.<br /><br />I am happy with the result and I am happy with the performance. It was a very difficult game. They are very organised defensively, and defended very well. The first half, the situation was difficult. Maybe we needed to move the ball at another speed, and maybe more movements without the ball. But in this kind of match, usually you can win in the last 20-25 minutes. So I was always confident. I think that now for us it is better to think about the next match. The gap at the beginning <b>[to last season’s champions Manchester City]</b> was 30 points. I think it’s very difficult to recover this gap in only one season.

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri has hailed the quality his Chelsea side have in their attacking ranks]</b> Pedro played the first three games in the starting XI but today I thought it was better to play with Willian. I am lucky because any coach who can choose between Pedro and Willian is a lucky coach. Pedro is a great player. I think in every season he has scored about 15 goals, so it is normal for him to score. Hazard, Pedro, <b>[Victor]</b> Moses, Willian, all in the same position - I am very lucky and I don’t want to forget <b>[Callum]</b> Hudson-Odoi.<br /><br />I think we need to be careful - especially the positioning of the player when we are in the offensive phases. Today, we had the right full-back making a cross and the other one in the box. It was a little bit dangerous. We were always in a position to face the counter-attack with only the centre-backs. David Luiz and Antonio Rudiger were in the right positions when the opposition attacked the space but the defenders and the midfielders on the left and right were not. We need to improve the positioning under the line of the ball. If we improve in this, then in this kind of match we can have more continuity without the counter-attacks of the opponent. With this continuity maybe we can score earlier<br /><br />I don’t know <b>[what we will do at Cobham]</b> because it is very difficult to work, we have 18 or 19 players in national teams. We will be only eight or nine players, so it will be very difficult to work. I think that is a problem because with this situation, the very important players at the end of the season could play 65 or 70 matches and I think that is not right.

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri is fascinated by Chelsea’s ability to one season compete for a title and then collapse the year after]</b> We want to win. But the history of this club is a little bit strange. 14/15, I think 87 points. 15/16 50 points. That’s very strange, with the same coach and the same group. Then 93 points (in 16/17), then 70 points last season with the same coach and group. So the numbers of this group are a little bit strange. I need to understand why. I am studying. I think that these numbers tell us something. I don’t know what, at the moment. But I want to understand and I want to help my players to be at the same level. Maybe if you are lucky or unlucky, you can gain 85 points or 80, but the difference in one season is 43 points! I have to understand why. Then, if I am able to do it, I have to help my players be at the same level for a long period. I don’t know. I don’t know <b>[if the players have an attitude problem]</b>, because they usually have training very well with continuity. So the attitude is good. There is probably something from the mental point of view. I have to understand it.<br /><br />I think so. I think so, but I have to find the right way. No more, no more. Hazard is on the pitch every day. I think he can do more in continuity, in intensity… not only in physical intensity, but in the mental intensity. So I have to try to improve him because my feeling is he can improve more. So I want to try and improve him. To try and give him the chance to arrive at his 100% because my feeling is, now, he’s only at 80%. So I want to help him to be the best player in the world<br /><br />I don’t know. I think that Manchester City are a very, very, very good team. Maybe they are the best at the moment. But I think that Liverpool want to win more, I think. So the determination of Liverpool could be higher. Maybe, I don’t know. It’s only my opinion<br /><br />I think that the market is not the only solution. I think we need the team only to work. I think we can improve by working every day. So it’s only a question of time. Time and work. Maybe the market, sometimes, is the solution. But if you need only one player in one position, you can improve the quality not only with the market. I think we have to wait. We have to see the match of tomorrow. Because the other match was unusual. We have changed eight or nine players. They have changed eight players, I think. So we have to wait for the match tomorrow, and then we will see our position compared to the level of Liverpool. Liverpool, at the moment, and City are the top level in England. Maybe in Europe. So I am waiting for tomorrow<br /><br />I want to speak with my club face to face before I tell you my decision. I think it’s right the club knows my decision before the journalists. It has been impossible in the last two or three weeks, but I think it will be possible next week</p>

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri says he likes David Luiz’s direct style of communciation]</b> Yes, I have to say he is a lot better than a thought. A lot better, both as a player and as a man. I don’t know what happened before I arrived, but when I arrived here, immediately I had the feeling that he is a very good player for my way of football because he is a very technical centre back. Then I appreciated his qualities as a man. He is direct, if he has to say something to the manager, to talk to me. Then he goes directly to me. I don’t know <b>[if Conte didn’t like it]</b> but I like very much the direct people. I like this <b>[communication]</b> very much. He was a little confused because two seasons ago he was a protagonist then he had six months without playing, he was a little confused. I think he is very able to play my football with his characteristics. He is very able to start the actions from the defensive line. So I think he is very suitable for me.<br /><br /><b>[On Eden Hazard]</b> I am really very happy with him today. Especially for the defensive phase, especially for the defensive phase in the second half when the team needed some help from him. I am really very happy. For us, this attitude is important. We are trying to defend looking at the ball and if we are defending looking at the ball then we need every player to participate in the defensive phase, otherwise it is impossible. So I am really happy with the defensive phase of Eden today.<br /><br />I think that we have played very well. We have had five or six chances. I also think Liverpool have had five or six opportunities. We have played against a top level team, so I am disappointed about the result but only because they have scored in the last 10 minutes of the match. I think that the draw was the right result for a wonderful match</p>

He has played more than the last season in two months.<br /><br />He had a big, very serious injury one year ago.

He is very good from the technical point of view, so he can become a very good player, a great player<br /><br />He was unlucky in the last three weeks, after the national team. He had a problem. In the last five, six days, he has been better, so I think he is able to play tomorrow. He needs to get used to the pressure.

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri has declared that Eden Hazard is staying at Chelsea]</b> Hazard is immense and I don’t think even he knows how much he can still improve. I said he could end up in the tight circle of the best three or four players in the world. The problem is he plays to enjoy himself and at times doesn’t realise the importance of moving from fun to reaping the rewards. At the end of the day, you’ve got to get the fruits of your labour. Hazard’s approach is a positive, but it can become a potential limitation too. He needs to lift his head up, look around and realise there’s a whole world in front of him that he can dictate with his feet for the good of the collective and not just the individual. He said such kind words about me, I wasn’t expecting that. His contract expires in 2020, but he’s staying here. I was tempted to use Hazard as a centre-forward and I might consider it again in future, but it’s not the right time now. We need to believe in Olivier Giroud and Alvaro Morata<br /><br /><b>[On David Luiz]</b> David Luiz is a really sweet guy, exemplary and professional. Cesc Fabregas has immense quality, he returned from injury and I am proud to have him with me, as he’ll give us a big hand<br /><br />I’d say this Chelsea side is only at 60-70 per cent capacity right now, but how much we are missing and how much we need is not the same thing. It’s double that. The whole Sarriball thing amuses me. I don’t go on social media, but I did see the fans post these videos with the most passes. If I have to be honest, the Chelsea fans aren’t even sure what Sarriball means. They invented this term, pronounce it all in one word and carry on. It’s very funny. It’s a dream to be here. I walked into Stamford Bridge and hear this shout: ‘Mauriziooooooo!’ Then the chants, it makes you want to pinch yourself. They usually do that for those who have won, but what have I won? I couldn’t believe it</p>

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri says that Manchester United’s under-fire manager Jose Mourinho should be considered the better coach]</b> The Special One is Mourinho. The results speak for him. So, at the moment, he is better than me for sure. I hope to improve myself in the future, but at the moment I have to say he’s better than me. I think he is different. I think that I have my character, and my character probably is different to his character. So I have to be myself, always. Otherwise I am not credible. He has won everything everywhere. So I need to win if I want to compare myself to him. <b>[Mourinho’s success]</b> is not all just in the past - I think he will also be able to win in the future. He is really one of the best. Maybe the best. I think he will be able to win again. At the moment, it’s not possible <b>[to compare us]</b>. You are talking about one of the best coaches in the world, and I’m not - at the moment - one of the best. I’d like to win something because, at the moment, I need to win. I have won in Serie B, Serie C, Serie D like the Championship, League One and League Two here in England. But now I need to win at this level.<br /><br />My target in that period was to be a professional coach. I didn’t think that I was able to arrive at a Champions League club. It was incredible at that moment, so I think I am lucky. You need to be lucky. To be in the right place in the right moment. First of all, at Empoli, I had a very young team. The players were very young but very good. I remember that we won Serie B with <b>[Daniele]</b> Rugani, who was 19. Elseid Hysaj, who was 19. <b>[Riccardo]</b> Saponara, who was 20. <b>[Lorenzo]</b> Tonelli was 21. Nobody knew them at that moment, but they were very good. So I was lucky<br /><br />The problem is not the way of football, if I like it or not. The focus is he is able to win. He has won everything everywhere, so probably that means he is right. Maybe they will play on us or maybe they will play their football. Because they can play their football. They are a wonderful team. I think that we need to expect everything because we have to play against a very strong team, and usually a very strong team play very well in important matches. So we need to be prepared to face everything<br /><br />The character is different, but maybe the level of determination is the same. But I think that, without determination, it’s impossible to arrive here from a non-professional team. So I can speak very calmly, but I think my level of determination is the top level</p>

They have to improve but their characteristics are a little bit different.<br /><br />e used 26 players in official matches this season so the rotation at the moment is this but I don’t know in the future. I know that we used 26 players in this season. If you look only in the Premier League the situation is that, you are right <b>[only used 19 players]</b> but I have to look at all competitions. Ninety minutes are 90 minutes. You have to look at the League Cup, Europa League and the national team. I have to look also at the minutes in the national teams. So I think the rotation is good. Every moment was done only between the Europa League, League Cup and Premier League but in the future it will be different. No, of course if you look at December and January, you need to change also in the Premier League because we will play every three days in the Premier League. So we need to change in the Premier League. We didn’t use 26 players in Naples but I have to choose about this situation of the club. About the atmosphere<br /><br />In Naples, everybody wanted to win Serie A. Only Serie A. So maybe this atmosphere influenced my choices. It was clear in Naples, in the last season. Everyone wanted to win Serie A, not the other competitions. When I arrived in Naples, the gap was 24 points. In the last season it was only four points. I think that we have worked very well. When I arrived here the gap was 30 points, so the first step is to try and cover the gap. We are trying. I don’t know how many points we can cover in the near future but first of all we try to cover the gap and then we can try to think something different. At the moment we can think only that we need to cover the gap<br /><br /><b>[He thinks that players at Loftus-Cheek’s age are capable of fighting to be at Chelsea]</b> I don’t know but I think that if you are 19 or 20 then it is better to go on loan. It is better to play and get experience. It is not possible that every player is good enough to play here when he is 19 or 20. When you are 22 after one or two loans then you have to fight to try to have minutes here. It is not easy but it is not easy also at the other big clubs. It is not easy to play for Manchester City, Manchester United, Juventus. It is normal, if you want to play with continuity in a team like this. You have to play well when you are on loan, but very very well. But then when you return you have the same problem. I think it is better to stay here and fight for minutes on the pitch <b>[after a few loan moves]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Sarri considers game Chelsea didn’t win to be the highlight of his Blues reign]</b> I am enjoying working in England as much as I hoped I would because this championship is very competitive and the atmosphere in the stadiums is great. So, I am very happy to be in the Premier League. Really very happy. Even when a game is close I can enjoy it. I can enjoy if the match is a good match. For example, we did not win against Liverpool but I enjoyed the match. It was a very high level, so at the end of the match I was happy with the performance. I think that one was the best match so far. I think from the tactical point of view, our best performance was at Burnley. But the match was different. I had more fun against Liverpool. Without winning!<br /><br />When I was young and studying in London for my other work in banking, my experience of watching football in English stadiums was good. I did not see it as aggressive, only when English teams played abroad. When I studied in England the atmosphere did not feel threatening. It seemed like fun, it was entertaining, I have always been fascinated by English football. I am not surprised it was players from Serie A who improved Chelsea in the 1990s. Tactically, Serie A is a championship that is very difficult and so, as a coach, in Serie A you can improve a lot because tactically every match is very interesting, and difficult. The coach can improve a lot but also players with a couple of seasons in Serie A can improve a lot. In England, football is played at another speed with another intensity, but in Italy the match is difficult from the tactical point of view</p>

We have to be focused on this problem. For sure, it’s not a physical problem because, in the last part of the match, we ran a lot, I think. It’s not a physical problem. It’s a mental problem. We have some difficulties to enter into the match. It’s not a tactical problem.

My problem is to improve my players, to solve the situation, to solve problems, to try to gain a lot of points. Then there is the club that will decide what is better for them.<br /><br />He told me the first season in England is really very difficult. For him, it’s impossible to improve the first season 20 players. He told me, in the first season, you have to work only on 14 players otherwise you are in trouble. You need too much time to improve all the squad. In England, it’s really very difficult. But every history is different. You learn, of course, that the Premier League is a fantastic championship, but it’s really very difficult. Every match is difficult. Every match, also, if you are able to win, is very expensive from the mental and physical point of view. You have to play every three days. You have no time to work or improve the team, so it’s really a very difficult situation. You need a season just to understand the real situation here<br /><br />At the end of the day, I can tell you the position <b>[where I would sign a player]</b>. But, before, we need the improvement of every player in the team and then, maybe, you are able to know the right position for changing the team. At the moment, we have Hazard with eight goals. We have Morata with seven goals, I think in the season, not the Premier League. Giroud with four goals. Pedro with five goals. It’s important to score, of course. If you have a player who is able to score every match, it’s really important, but I think that’s impossible. I was really very lucky three years ago in Naples because Higuain scored 36 goals in 34 matches, but that was something exceptional. It’s very difficult for a striker to score in every match. Every two is possible. In every match, it’s difficult for everybody. Also for <b>[Mohamed]</b> Salah, but last year he scored 32 goals. So it’s very difficult. If you have a player like this, you are lucky. But if you haven’t a player able to score in every match, you have to do something else<br /><br />It’s very easy to change <b>[tactics]</b> when you have to face a difficulty. But, at the end, if you believe in a style of play, you have to improve and you have to arrive to do very well this way of football. So the target is this, not to change in every match. To change the style of football, system, players … that’s not the right solution, I think. We need to work, we need to improve, we need to understand very well the style of playing. We need to change the mentality, not because the old mentality was bad. But it’s not suitable with the new way of playing. Then, after all this, maybe you do need one player. But the market is really very important when you understand that you need only one player in one position for changing the team. But you cannot think that you can buy 11 new players without problems. If you do, the problems will be the same. You have to create a new mentality and a new style of playing. We need to improve. We need to arrive at 95 per cent of our potential. And then we can get the last five per cent with a new player. With a new player, not 11 new players</p>

We thought yesterday that for the first time in the season that there was a possibility to have more spaces - so we wanted to try with Eden - because for the first time there was a possibility to play on the counter-attack.

So, I think Kovacic could be a very good option. A very good option, then we need to recover completely Loftus-Cheek, after his back problem. Then, we can play sometimes with Kovacic as a central midfielder and then Jorginho will be able to rest. We are trying in training with two players; the first is Ampadu and the second is Kovacic. It may be that for the characteristics, Kovacic is more suitable for this team. As you know, Ampadu is more defensive. Kovacic is really close to Jorginho in moving the ball really fast at one-touch. In the future, I think he will be able to do this position well.<br /><br />No, Jorginho played very well. I put Kante on the pitch after the fourth goal because Jorginho had a little problem with his groin. This was the only reason because, in my opinion, Jorginho had a good match. Jorginho needs movement without the ball from the other players, because he is used to playing one-touch and it is very difficult to play one-touch without the movement of the other players. So, if the team, like in the first 20-25 minutes, played very well with movements without the ball, then for Jorginho it is easier, I think. In the first 25 minutes we played our football because we moved the ball very fast and very well. There was good movement without the ball. We were really very dangerous. We didn’t play with our backs to the opposing goal like in the last match, with five players doing it in the last match. We attacked the spaces and so I think that we played our football<br /><br />Not in the past <b>[have I managed a team that’s so inconsistent]</b>.

  <p><b>[Sarri admits he could be losing Chelsea dressing room]</b> I think <b>[the players are still with me]</b>. Of course, I am not sure, but I think so. I think the situation with the players is really very good for the relationship, but the relationship is not so important. It’s important to play, it’s important to get good results, but my relationship with my players is good at the moment.<br /><br />We need all to improve because I am not able to get out of my players a very high level of aggression and determination<br /><br />I think that, with the result, we were unlucky. In the first half we played better than the opponent and, at the end of the first half, it was 2-0 to them. Then in the second half, it was really very difficult to play because they are a really physical team and defended very low, compact. So we played confused football in the second half. But, in the first half, we played well. We need, of course, more aggression, more determination in the situation inside our box, and inside the opposing box. Because the difference was there. We played 78 balls in the opposing goal, and United played only 16 into our box, and it was 2-0. That was the difference</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri says he is concerned only about results]</b> I am worried about the results. Not about the fans. I can understand the situation and our fans because the result wasn’t good. We are out of the FA Cup, so I can understand them. But I am worried at the moment about our results.<br /><br /><b>[He believes getting the supporters back onside is easily done]</b> It’s really very easy. If we are able to win three or four matches in a row, it will be very easy. It’s difficult to win five matches in a row<br /><br />Not completely at the moment. Because, especially in a situation like in the second half, we need to move the ball faster. Faster mentally. Faster materially. We need movement without the ball. Less individual actions, because when you have spaces, of course, you can go for an individual action, but when the situation is like in the second half you need to move the ball faster and have more movement, otherwise, you cannot score<br /><br /><b>[Sarri was stoic when asked if he was worried about his job]</b> It’s not my problem. My problem is to start (preparing) for the game tomorrow morning and to work with my players to try and improve in a few days. Find more determination, more aggression, because we conceded the second goal without determination or aggression. I was worried when I was in League Two in Italy, but not now</p>

But it’s not easy because we have to play every three days. On the pitch, we have no time. I have to think we are able to improve, and able to improve immediately. The result is not all in a match. In the last match we played better, better and better, especially in the first half. We have to solve a big problem because we stayed in the other half for 75 minutes out of 90 and were not able to score. They only played 15 or 16 balls into our box and scored two goals. So we have to solve this problem: a problem of aggression and determination in both boxes.</p>

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri has stated Chelsea will need to sell a winger if they are to keep Callum Hudson-Odoi]</b> You need to understand that, in the same position, we have Pedro, Willian and ,,., so it’s not easy for a young player to play with the consistency with his team-mates. I want to remind you that Callum, with this one, played 14 matches. There isn’t in England another 18-year-old player with 14 matches in the first-team. So I think that we are using him in the right way at the moment. Of course, the 20 matches this season will be 30 matches in the next, and 40 in two years. Also, I think that the club has to decide. If I am at the club and I want Callum on the club consistently, I have to sell another winger. Otherwise the manager is in trouble</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea players need freedom to avoid another Man City disaster]</b> I think we were lucky in the first match <b>[against City]</b> because we were in trouble in the first half. We scored in the last minute of that half and then the match changed. We were unlucky in the second match because we started very well for five minutes, then conceded a stupid goal, and we weren’t able to react. So it was a disaster. I think the truth is in the middle. It’s not true, the 2-0 two months ago, or the 6-0 two weeks ago. For us, it’s really very important for us to stay in the match for a very long time. And that will give us our best chance. In this match, for 30 minutes, I saw a team very worried. Without confidence. So I don’t want to press them tomorrow <b>[in training]</b>. I want their minds really very free. We will prepare the match only on Saturday, I think. I didn’t like our minds in the first 30 minutes. I want to see something more free. So we will prepare the match in 60 minutes, no more.<br /><br />I want to see my players before <b>[deciding]</b>. For sure, for <b>[N’Golo]</b> Kante <b>[needed a rest]</b>. And I was a little bit worried about Azpi, because I wanted Zappacosta on the pitch today, but he had a problem yesterday with fever. So it was impossible for him to play. So I tried to cut, for him, 20 minutes. The same for Kante. Then, my feeling from the bench was that <b>[Ross]</b> Barkley was more tired than <b>[Mateo]</b> Kovacic at that moment of the match<br /><br /><b>[Why Guardiola didn’t get linked with the sack in his first season]</b> Because he was lucky. I don’t know. You have to ask the club. You have to ask both, Manchester City and Chelsea. But I don’t know if I am under pressure from my club or from you. I don’t know at the moment. I think that, if you choose Guardiola, you have to wait because the club knows very well that Guardiola needs time. It’s not really very easy for an English team to play that kind of football, so it’s normal. I am used to arriving at a new team from below. I started at a very low level and, season by season, I arrived here. Of course, in every season, I was the coach who arrived from below. So for me it’s normal. I’m used to this situation<br /><br />I don’t know the meaning of Sarriball. As I said in England on the first day, I don’t know what Sarriball is. I think it’s from a journal, I think. In Italy, I have never heard it. I don’t know. I think that, in the end, the most important things are the results. Without results, everything good to criticise us. In my job, I need the result.

  <p><b>[Sarri plays down Kepa mutiny in Chelsea defeat]</b> It was a big misunderstanding. I understood he had cramp so I didn’t want the goalkeeper to go to penalties in that physical condition. I only realised the situation after three or four minutes when the doctor came to the bench. In the meantime I wanted Caballero on the pitch, and the keeper only wanted me to know he was in condition to go to penalties, so it was a big misunderstanding. Kepa was right, even if the way he conducted himself was wrong. Mentally he was right, he was able to go to penalties, but I only realised everything when the doctor was able to come to the bench, not before. I was really angry. I want to talk with him because he needs to understand that with a misunderstanding we can get in trouble, especially with you (the media). So I think I only have to explain the situation to Kepa but without any other problem.<br /><br />They played exactly how I asked them. Today I am proud of my players. You have to ask the club <b>[about his future]</b>. Here I am really very happy. In the last three matches we are improving, we have improved a lot.

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri has called on Chelsea fans to give more support to their players]</b> spoke with Marina this week, before the final, just for good luck. I spoke to Marina after the match about the Kepa situation. My relationship with the club is like before. The goalkeeper is not a problem. He made a big mistake, but he is really a very nice boy. There is only one difficulty: the results. The atmosphere in the training ground is now very good. The application of the players is better than before. I think Willy Caballero is a very good goalkeeper and he’s a great man. He is a point of reference in the dressing room for his personality, for his behaviour, for everything. He has the maturity to be ready for anything. The problem now is to have results with consistency. We know the situation. It’s difficult to play every three days with the same mental intensity. It’s not easy because, usually, we talk about physical condition, that it is very difficult to play every three days. But the big problem is mental, to play every match with the same level of application and determination is very difficult. We have to do it tomorrow because this is a very important match. A very difficult match. Tottenham are playing very well away from home. It’s not easy to play with the same level of application as in the last match because, mentally, we spent a lot in the match on Sunday.<br /><br />I was disappointed with the atmosphere for my players. Only for my players. But I can understand the fans because they are used to winning. I’d like to see more support for my players, not for me<br /><br />I don’t know the situation well, but I know the club are working. So I think they can solve this problem. Maybe for this summer, maybe not. But they are working. I think that, first of all, we need to improve these players. Because we cannot buy 20 players in the market because they aren’t 20 players ready for Chelsea in the market. It’s very difficult to find a player ready immediately for this level, so I think the first target is to improve these players</p>

In that case, there are two spots for four teams, and it’s much better than one for three. So we will see. Now I can understand very well that, in England, it’s very difficult to be in the top four. The Premier League is very competitive and very hard. Not only the Premier League, because you have to play in the FA Cup, the League Cup, and every match is very difficult. If you think that, in the League Cup, we played against Liverpool, twice against Tottenham, the final against City … it seems like a Champions League. If you won against Liverpool, if you won against Tottenham, you can go into the final of the Champions League. So every match is very difficult and mentally very expensive. You risk arriving at this moment of the season really very tired, more mentally than physically. In England, the season is really very difficult. I would be very happy because I know very well that the target of my club is to return in the Champions League. I would be really very happy. I was lucky because, with Napoli, we returned <b>[to]</b> the Champions League. We went in Champions League three times in a row for the first time in the history of the club.

I think that he played very well in the last match, better in the second half than in the first half. So, for him, it’s very important to finish the match in that way. I think that he can do better.

Sometimes we’ve played with very good quality in the offensive phase, and sometimes not. But at this moment, for us, the most important thing is to be solid. I changed <b>[Chelsea’s system]</b> in the last match because the opponent didn’t come to attack. And so, in the last 20 minutes, we could make the change. But I think that the system is not so important. What is important is our way of football. We don’t play in the same way with another system. Before changing, it’s better to consolidate the first system, to consolidate our way of football. Then we can change, also, in matches. But first of all, I want to see my football. We started to defend in a very good way in the last month, I think. Now we need to start in the offensive phase to play every match with the same ideas. At the moment, we are not able to do this because, sometimes, we are without movement without the ball.

Usually, I don’t want to think about this kind of situation, if a player is an ex of another team or not. I don’t like that. Today he was on the bench because he was one yellow card from a ban, so we thought it was better not to put him in the starting XI. For the next match, we will need to evaluate the situation. It was the first match for Loftus-Cheek to play 90 minutes, so we don’t know the reaction yet. So we need to evaluate everything on Saturday, and then we will decide ahead of playing a very important and difficult match for us. In my opinion, Everton, outside the top six, are the best team in the Premier League in terms of technical quality. So we have to play a very important match, and a very difficult game</p>

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri believes that Callum Hudson-Odoi has the ability to make his first Premier League start soon]</b> Callum is ready to play against every opponent. I think the qualification for the European Championships, the level is really very low. It’s not the Premier League level, of course. I think he needs to improve more. And I want him to improve more. And he has to stay with his feet on the floor. I have not got to play against Montenegro. There are a lot of national teams at a very low level. He has to work every day, and improve the left, improve in the defensive phase, improve in the movement without the ball. I want him to improve because the potential is really, really very, very high. And so it’s right that he continues to improve. Otherwise we risk stopping him. He is, at this moment, a very, very good player. But he can become more. I want him to become more.<br /><br />No, as I said before, we have some players a little bit tired. A little problem with Jorginho. But we are trying to recover him. I think it’s possible for him to play. I am not sure at the moment, but I think it’s possible<br /><br />It’s really very strange. In the first half of the season, we played better away than at home. Now, in the last five matches, we were in trouble away, and I don’t know why. It’s very difficult to explain the last four or five matches away. I am really very confident, but, especially away, the reaction on the pitch to the difficulties in the last few months were really wrong. In the last match, we played very well for 45 minutes. And then the first difficult <b>[moment]</b> - two corners - we conceded a goal, and after the goal, we were not able to react in the right way. It’s very strange after the first 45 minutes. The problem is the reaction. The problem in the last match was clear. We were not able to face the first difficulty of the match. We were not able to react. So it was clear that the problem was the mentality. So we need to work and try and improve our mentality as soon as possible because we are able to react. In the first part of the season, if you remember, we were able to react immediately when we conceded a goal. So it’s very strange. Now the situation is different</p>

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri has called on Gonzalo Higuain to start firing for Chelsea]</b> I would like to see him at the top in the last two months. At the moment, only this is really important. We need Gonzalo at the top. It is not easy, I think, to get used to this championship. The level is different. The way of playing is different. I think especially for a striker it is very difficult to get used to the Premier League in just one or two months. He said to me that it is difficult because the physical impact of the defenders here is really very strong. The referees here are really very different than in Italy, and so it is another football for him and especially for a striker or goalkeeper. It is really very different, so he needs time, but we have no time. We need him to get to his top level in these last two months<br /><br /><b>[On Ross Barkley]</b> Probably he is not a leader in that way. He is not able to lead the other players. He is a fighter. He is able to fight in every match. I think it is a question of personality. Sometimes you have a very young player with a very high level of personality. Sometimes they don’t. It is not easy to change. It is an individual characteristic, I think. He has improved a lot tactically. Also, physically, I think. As you know well in the last season he played only 200 minutes, so he needed to stay on the pitch. Fortunately, now he is going very well with his leg and he improved a lot during the season - a very, very good player. I think that he improved a lot in the defensive phase because technically he was, and he is, a very good player. In the offensive phase, he can score seven or eight goals every season. Now I think he is also a good player in the defensive phase. He is not a defensive midfielder, of course, but he is good enough now. Of course, at the beginning of the season, he didn’t have big confidence because last season was really very hard for him. Then after three or four or five matches in the starting eleven, he changed. Now he is a very important player for us<br /><br />I hope so, but my feeling is the same. When there is a match or whether there is training. For me, everything is very important. So I want to stay at the same level in my mind for eleven months. No, <b>[I don’t switch off]</b>, but I tried. I worked during the break. I watched our matches, our last five or six matches. I saw future opponents. So I tried to work in the same way. I know very well that in my job you are always alone. Here, in Naples, in Empoli and everywhere you depend on the results. For me, it is normal to have the feeling of being alone. Not for just me, but for every coach. You are with others only when you win. When you lose, you are alone. It is fine.</p>

We need to improve playing our way of football. So we are trying to do this, but it’s not easy. It’s not easy, especially in the first season because we started to work only in the middle of July.

I think that, in this case, it was easy to solve the problem. But the situation is this, so we have only to adapt to the situation. We have to play after three days in Liverpool, so we’ll need to change. I think they could have done more for the English teams in Europe. In Serie A, teams play on Friday. Teams involved in the Europa League away from home, they can ask to play their next Serie A match on Monday. It’s a Premier League decision. And they showed in the last season that they are the best because they are able to sell in the best way English football. This is the situation and we need only to adapt to this situation<br /><br /><b>[Sarri has admitted that it is a beneficial part of being a Premier League manager]</b> For me, it’s not so important for me, the salary.

We have to try in the Premier League. We have to try in the Europa League. But we want to win the Europa League because it is a very important competition, not because of going in the Champions League. So we have to try to get top four. It’s not easy for us because we only play four matches, but we have to try. The last four or five matches will be difficult for every team involved in fighting for the top four, not only for us. So we can see some very strange results in the last part of the season. We are going to fight and see at the end. I know very well Premier League is very difficult, for getting in the final of the League Cup we had to play against Liverpool, against Tottenham, the final against Manchester City. It was easier to get to the final of the Champions League, I think. It’s very difficult to stay in the top four of the Premier League but at this moment, of course, when you arrive to the semi-final it will be really difficult. The Europa League at this point you cannot expect something easy, I think. We have to try in both ways. It is not time to choose. I think many give the Champions League too much importance. Of course, it is the most important competition for clubs, but it is a competition with straight elimination, so sometimes you need a post in or a post out to qualify or to be eliminated. So we need to play very well but you need to be lucky in that competition. I can understand if you stay in the Champions League is another world probably. I have played two times in Champions League and it’s clear it’s the most important competition for clubs in Europe and as a consequence in the world I think, but it’s a competition in which you need to be lucky</p>

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri believes Chelsea’s season has been successful]</b> We played a final. We lost the final on penalties. We are in the semi-final in the Europa League. We are fighting for the top four. So the season, at the moment, is good. Of course we have two very, very strong targets: We want the top four in the Premier League and, at the moment, we want to go to the final of the Europa League. If we are able to get to the final, then we will want to win the final. And so I think the season is, at the moment, good. Of course, a very difficult season. We lost in the wrong way two or three matches, so the feeling, sometimes, is worse. But if you look at the season we are doing well, I think. Of course, it’s only the first step. We need to improve more. We need to become competitive for the top. The first step, though, is good<br /><br />In my opinion, he was really very angry about the situation on the pitch because we were not winning. I’ve not spoken to him. I’m really very happy if a player wants to play, wants to react. But I think that he was really very nervous about the situation because we were not winning. The situation on the pitch, as you have seen, was very difficult against opponents who didn’t want to play. So it was frustrating, his situation, I think<br /><br />I think that, on the pitch in every match, there is a strong discussion. Sometimes a player against another player. Sometimes a coach with the other coach. But in every match, there are very nervous moments. As you know, I made a lot of mistakes on the pitch sometimes in the past. But under pressure, it can happen. I know very well you can say something sometimes that is not in your mind. I think that the situation is finished, and I prefer that the situation is finished. I think that the two clubs spoke, and they agreed that the situation is finished. I agree with the two clubs</p>

  <p><b>[Sarri pledges to stay and improve Chelsea with full pre-season]</b> English football is different. I don’t want to say better or worse, but it is different. The Premier League is wonderful. I want to remain in the Premier League and I want to remain at Chelsea because the level is very high. The atmosphere in the stadiums is really fantastic. It is a wonderful championship and I would like to remain here.<br /><br />I think <b>[I can improve them]</b> because we had only two or three weeks working. At the end of August, we started to play every three days. In Naples, I was able to have a pre-season with 60 training sessions for the defensive line. Here I had about 11 or 12 sessions in the first period. So that’s a big difference. I needed the time to get used to English football. It is normal and it can happen. Now in the next season, I will be able to give more to my players.<br /><br />I am sure that in two seasons we will be able to be close to them. I am not sure in two seasons that we will be able to be better. When I arrived in Naples, Napoli in the table in the season before were 24 points away from Juventus. In the first season we were nine points away, in the second season we were six points and in the third season, we were four points. For us, it was impossible to cover that gap completely. At the end of the third season, we were very close to them. We are predictable I think. We need to learn to move the ball at another speed. Of course, if we want to move the ball so fast, we need more movements off the ball</p>

Then we started to play after 25 minutes and played very well until the 85th minute and deserved to win for the number of opportunities. We were in control of the match for 70 minutes and should have won. But they are dangerous on the counter-attack if you give them spaces. We deserved to win. 1-1 is not so bad away.

Christian is a very young player, of course, but he is really very strong. So I’m really very happy. He has the possibility to improve more, so he could become a very important player for us</p>

We’ll keep working on it and sooner or later this concept will get into their heads. I continued to tell them, and there were many who were doing it, moving the ball too slowly and therefore getting into the wrong positions. We had training yesterday and the ball was moving twice as quickly as it did tonight. This is the opposite of what should happen. Lately we’re doing a lot of things opposite to in training. When the ball is slow, you lose positions, you allow the opposition to close you down, to be aggressive and steal the ball back.

I’m happy with Miralem and I’m sure, in that role, he can improve further<br /><br /><a href="arthur-melo.html">Arthur Melo</a> is a <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> player and I don’t want to talk about him.</p>

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri says <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Gonzalo Higuain</a> was especially touched by the events of the coronavirus pandemic]</b> <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> is a very sensitive person, he’s been touched in a particular way from the events of the world and from his personal experiences. At the time of his return he thought it was not even right to go back to playing, while in addition he had this little injury. Now it seems to me that he is finding that desire he had at the beginning. For us, his return is important<br /><br />The games are all difficult as physical conditions are not optimal. We’ll need to be ready. We should not be looking at the other games but, instead, at our performances, which in the end will bring us the results. The league advantage isn’t substantial as there are still 33 points up for grabs. We need to have the right mentality, always</p>

  <p><b>[Sarri not worried about <a href="miralem-pjanic.html">Pjanic</a>’s <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> future]</b> I don’t know if <a href="miralem-pjanic.html">Pjanic</a> will no longer play with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, I have not received any communication. These are not things that interest us, the market only starts in September. Miralem’s a professional, he understands situations quickly. I don’t know anything at the moment, but I’m not worried. He’ll be with us until the end of August. I hope he’ll stay with us even beyond that, but these are decisions that will be made at a later stage<br /><br /><b>[Sarri was particularly happy for <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> given how the coronavirus crisis has affected the Argentine striker, an issue he had spoken about pre-game]</b> He had a difficult time on a personal and global level, because the coronavirus emergency hit him a lot and left a mark on him. He has returned, had a minor injury and is now getting back into shape. I am happy that he scored immediately, he is a player who will give us a lot in this season finale</p>

  <p><b>[Improving <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> needs to play a lot for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> now can play with a good fit. He needs to improve after the break and he is doing so match after match. He needs to play a lot. In the future we will find the way to preserve him across matches or for some matches. He is great in listening to himself and he will realise when he will need to stop and rest. But now I think he fits quite well.<br /><br /><b>[Amid doubts and criticism over <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a>]</b> For us he is very important. He is powerful, one of the strongest centre forward in the world right now. He can be decisive for us at the end of the season. He had a difficult time on a personal and global level, because the coronavirus emergency hit him a lot and left a mark on him. He has returned, had a minor injury and is now getting back into shape.

  <p><b>[Sarri cautious over continuing to start <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a>]</b> It’s likely that they can start again <b>[against Genoa]</b>.

The boy can be happy with this solution, I am peaceful because he is serious and intelligent. The possibility that he doesn’t give us 101 per cent, I don’t see it. It’s good for both that they focus on what they have to do now. The opening of the market is two months away, they still have to play some important games. Talking about the market doesn’t give me pleasure. Some of the staff will certainly study Arthur thoroughly to get the clearest ideas, for now let’s enjoy <a href="miralem-pjanic.html">Pjanic</a> in this season finale</p>
