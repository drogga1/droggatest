  <p><b>[Sarri says Abramovich wanted me for attacking football]</b> But I think he <b>[Abramovich]</b> knows it <b>[will take time]</b>. If they called me 40 days ago, I think it’s because they wanted to see my football here. It’s not easy, but I have to try.<br /><br />It’s important if I like it, first of all. I want to enjoy, I want to have fun, press the ball. Then, if I enjoy the game, maybe the supporters enjoy the game. And I think that, if the team enjoy the game, they’ll have a lot of opportunities to win the match.<br /><br />It will take two or three months. But I think, in this case, with this team, there are very intelligent players<br /><br /><b>[Sarri isn’t known for compromising his beliefs and spoke about his challenge, after last week growing worried with a 15 minute period against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, where he side lost control of the game]</b> I don’t know. Maybe I have to do that <b>[compromise my beliefs in future]</b>, but I am better when I play my football, my way of football. I don’t know if I’m as good of a coach if I teach another way of football<br /><br />It’s not so easy to change the player’s mind <b>[when defending too]</b>. If you are used to defending by looking at the man and I ask you to defend by looking only at the ball, I think if you are 18 it’s maybe easier. If you are 28 and, for 10 years, you’ve played the other way, it’s not so easy. So you have to change completely the mind.<br /><br />I think it’s better. I think, if you arrive to think in this way, then it’s very easy. It depends only on you. You are not depending on the opponent. I think it’s very easy and if you defend by looking only at the ball, you can stay very high up the pitch. In the other way, you defend on the movements of the opponent.<br /><br /><b>[The forward line will normally be no more than 15 metres away from the defensive line and Sarri rubbished the assertion that his players are struggling to cope physically with his methods]</b> No. I don’t think so. If you defend forward, you only have to do 10-15m. If you have the ball inside, you have to back for 50m. I think we can press for 90 minutes, only if we have the right distances between the players, we stay very high. Otherwise it’s a problem, of course<br /><br />No. I don’t think so. If you defend forward, you only have to do 10-15m. If you have the ball inside, you have to back for 50m. I think we can press for 90 minutes, only if we have the right distances between the players, we stay very high. Otherwise it’s a problem, of course<br /><br />I am not able to switch off. I have spent only one day in London in 40 days here. But the moment was difficult. We had to prepare the season without players, so it was difficult the first part of the season for me. But I’m not able to switch off, me. Never.<br /><br />I am thinking always about my team and about the match, or the next match. It’s my way to work in football. After the match with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> I remained in London, only a long walk in the centre of London. And I found a lot of people of Naples</p>

  <p><b>[Sarri says <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> should give <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> a ‘gift’ as he chases new milestones]</b> He is an active player, and so not much thinking is needed. This is a great achievement, but he must immediately chase after new goals. But we know <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> and we know that he will be like that. It is a cue for his team-mates to give him a gift<br /><br />It will be a beautiful match. It is clear that Juventus-Inter is the most prestigious match in Serie A: for the history, and this year, for the standings. After two important transfer windows, I think Inter has become one of the favourites for the league title, like us. Therefore, it is important for the rankings. I hope it will be a beautiful game, and I hope we enjoy it. It will surely be a difficult game but also beautiful to play. Given their way of playing, a problem, for us, may be the size of the opponents. However, both teams have the characteristics that can put the opponent in danger. And so, it will be a difficult game for us, and one where preparation is needed. But, of course, it will also be difficult for our opponents</p>

  <p><b>[Sarri impressed with Ramsey after <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> edge Inter]</b> He <b>[Ramsey]</b> maintains that he needs to see more of the pitch in front of him, or he gets a little lost. He is doing well in this role, although in fairness he’s also in much better physical condition now than he was when playing as a trequartista. I was about to introduce <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> a minute before we scored with Ramsey, but I decided to put him on anyway, as I felt that was the moment we could finish the game. Inter tried to press us high in the first half and probably used up a lot of energy doing that. The inertia of the game changed after our goal, we had a very strong 20 minutes after that and gained confidence, whereas Inter lost it at the same moment. It’s very positive that we barely allowed a quality side like Inter a single shot on goal<br /><br />We tried to stay in their slipstream, but must learn from defeat and take the lessons of comparison to grow in terms of character, quality and strength. It’s a loss that must help us to grow and understand how far away we are. It certainly shouldn’t make us distraught, as we knew there was a gap and we lost both meetings with them. The results speak clearly, they won two and we got zero points. We must grow in terms of character if we want to compete at the highest level. It’s also about characteristics, as there are players who are stronger in personality and others less so. We all need to do better in that sense and be more determined</p>

I was very surprised and satisfied with our opening 30 minutes, as we moved the ball so quickly and totally dominated the game, even before the red card. After that, we slowly dropped our tempo, intensity and mental determination, but that is a risk in an empty stadium. We had been doing so well, playing one and two-touch football, but then we slowed down and lost some sharpness, focused more on individual moves and taking two touches. The positive is that we didn’t allow the opponents to play at all. It’s going to take a while to get the fitness and mentality back to 100 per cent. If you compare it to a pre-season game, it’d be early July, but this is worse than pre-season, because it was a much longer break.

We’ve played for seven months, and then have had a long break in order to play these remaining matches. Therefore, we’ll have to give everything that we have and give that little bit more to win as many trophies as possible. Apart from a few games that haven’t gone our way the results have been good so far. We have an excellent points average so we can be pleased with that, but now we want to transform it into something concrete</p>
