All the time he’s becoming more of a midfielder than an attacker! He is incredible. Every day he demonstrates that he’s the best. In training he does things that amaze you. His ambition surprised me. He always wants to win. If he’s losing <b>[a training game]</b> he gets the ball, goes past three and puts the ball in the goal and relaxes a little. I focused on him the first few days in the changing room, he’s very close <b>[to his teammates]</b> and thinks about everyone</p>

Like I said when I came back to Barca, I will fight to stay here for many years and to be a first team regular.<br /><br />Madrid don’t have a better squad. The difference is their second line of players participated more than ours. At the end of the season they rotated a lot, but they aren’t at a superior level</p>

I really don’t know what is going to happen but I wish he can come.<br /><br />Both Sergi Roberto and Aleix Vidal have had amazing seasons in that role but if, finally, Bellerin is coming he would challenge with them to be picked in the starting line-up, but Bellerin and Roberto can play in other roles; it is not easy replacing the best right-back ever.<br /><br />I have spoken to him <b>[Bellerin]</b> and from one side he wants to join Barca, but from the other he feels very attached to Arsenal. It is a hard situation and I am nobody to be speaking about this, but I wish he can come.</p>

  <p><b>[How Arsenal could line up with Denis Suarez]</b> Unai Emery is one of the best coaches around. He really gets the best out of us. He considers each and every one of his players and always puts those who are in the best possible shape in his starting lineup. I have been playing for him for a year and I am really happy. He always talks to you, both in good moments - to prevent you being distracted - and bad, to help you recover. The way he treats players is exceptional.<br /><br />Why not? Players have to evolve. He has to improve. Iniesta is Harry Potter, he makes magic, and it is difficult to find another. But Denis is on the right path and I hope he can be Iniesta’s heir. Denis is the youngest player in the squad and one of the few players to leave Barca B and be able to return. That is because of taking care of the ball but also working hard off the ball, which some players forget about. You have the ball for a minute or a minute-and-a-half in the game, so if you do not do well without it, you have no chance at this level. Denis understands that and he is well loved by his team-mates</p>

I used to watch Bergkamp and Henry - they’re both legends of the club and hopefully we can follow in their footsteps.<br /><br /><b>[On Unai Emery]</b> I have a very good relationship with him. I spent a year with him at Sevilla when we won the Europa League. I think he’s a very demanding coach and one of the best coaches in the world right now - I’ve been saying that for a while. I’m really happy to have the chance to work with him again and I hope that the rest of the season is successful for me and the club<br /><br />I’ve come here to play as much as possible and try to help the team qualify for the Champions League. I’d like to win the Europa League with Arsenal too - why not? It’s a trophy I won under Unai Emery at Sevilla and I’d love to win it again here</p>

After various medical consultations the conclusion has been reached that I cannot keep on pushing it and I have started a period of treatment that cannot be done alongside competitive football. I am sorry that all of the effort and sacrifice made to come to Arsenal hasn’t come to fruition as hoped and you can’t even imagine how angry I am about it, but health comes first. I want to give my thanks again to such a big club for trusting in me although things haven’t gone as we pictured they would. I am stepping aside but I am grateful for the messages of care and support that you all have sent to me every day.

I went to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> with great hopes. I made my debut against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> but in our first away game I got injured.

Just imagine going to a club that had called you a month before, with all the hope in the world and not being able to do anything from the second week onward apart from trying to train with huge pain. There was a point where I said: ‘enough’. I played three or four games but it was as if I didn’t because I wasn’t even at 50 per cent. But the injury is now behind me and despite sometimes feeling a bit of discomfort I am working day and night for it to go away</p>

  <p><b>[Denis Suarez admits he was fit for one week during injury-hit ‘bad loan’ at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> Obviously it was a bad loan because I did not play.

The truth is I rejected other teams: <a href="real-betis.html">Real Betis</a>, <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a>, <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> all wanted me. I took the risk of going on a loan. I could have signed for those other clubs on a four- or five-year deal. That’s how much I wanted it to work at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>.

I had too much pain in my groin. I did tests and scans and nothing was in my groin, but there was a big edema (build-up of fluid) around the pubic bone.

That is life. I cannot control this. Nobody wanted to play more than me but the situation was unsustainable. I wanted to live up to their expectations. I am sorry because I do not think <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> supporters truly understand the situation I was experiencing. They didn’t see me play, so it is hard to evaluate the loan. Of course it was bad - I didn’t play - but there were circumstances. For example, I played in a friendly match for 90 minutes (against Al Nasr in Dubai during the March international break) and the next day I could barely move for the pain. That was the reality. To recover, my injury needed rest, strength and muscle exercises for two or three months</p>
