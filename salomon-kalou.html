  <p><b>[Kalou accuses Hertha manager <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Klinsmann</a> of lack of respect]</b> It’s not like I’ve only been here for five days or months. I’ve spent almost six years here and have always scored my goals. I don’t need special treatment because of that. But it’s about respect, and there’s currently a massive lack of it. I’m fit and ready to play. If the team needs me, I’ll do my job. I’ve never experienced anything like this before. Not even at the great Chelsea<br /><br />I will always remember Hertha as a wonderful place. I have a good relationship with <b>[sporting director]</b> Michael Preetz</p>

  <p><b>[Kalou suspended by Hertha after ignoring coronavirus safety rules in video]</b> I am sorry if I gave the impression that I am not taking Coronavirus seriously. I apologise for this. The opposite is the case, because I am especially worried about the people in Africa, where medical care there is nowhere near as good as in Germany. I didn’t really think and was happy that everyone’s tests were negative and I also want to apologise to those who appeared in the video without knowing</p>
