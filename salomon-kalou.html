  <p><b>[Salomon Kalou believes that Victor Moses was always going to make it at Stamford Bridge]</b> I’m not surprised by Moses’s form. He never had a big chance like this before. He never really had this chance to show off. A big player has to have the chance to play. It is difficult to show your skills when you don’t play, and this season he has shown the quality that you need at this level; I am not surprised. He is a fast and technical player with great stamina to go forward and then to come back. Chelsea have supported him very well <b>[this season]</b> and that is why I am not surprised that we are seeing the best of him. He will have a great season in a blue shirt.</p>

  <p><b>[Salomon Kalou is hoping to see Ivory Coast stage another successful bid for Africa Cup of Nations honours two years on from their last success in Equatorial Guinea]</b> I think we are very fortunate to go and defend, with honour, trophies for our country. We love to wear the shirt. So let’s do it and I am looking forward to it because we have a great team with potential to keep our trophy. I can’t wait to go and do it. It took a long time to get it last time so let’s hope this next one comes sooner. Gabon is a beautiful country with beautiful cities and beautiful people so I’m excited. I believe that our team can have an great tournament and I have no doubt that we will be fully prepared to retain the trophy when the time comes.</p>

  <p><b>[Hertha Berlin star Salomon Kalou has explained that his side knelt before a Bundesliga game in protest against racism]</b> Taking a knee has nothing to do with the flag, but rather showing that we are one as people and that we going to rise together. A human heart is too tiny to have a place for hate, because hate is such a horrible thing to put in your heart. I feel bad for people who have a lot of hate in their heart.<br /><br />Some people will see it the wrong way, see it as a PR campaign. I think that if you are against <b>[racism]</b> then you should do something about it. Or if you’re not <b>[doing something about it]</b>, you should not be criticising people who do something about it. Those people who say that you should do something about it: They can’t deny that this kind of behaviour exists. If you say that about people who do this then you should do something to show that you are against that way of behaviour. For me racism is like terrorism<br /><br />I have people who I know who have been through this kind of situation, and that’s sad. It’s sad that people in 2017 are still thinking that kind of way because I think we are way past the time that this was OK. I don’t think that’s acceptable that this kind of people try to come to football and show their way of thinking</p>

  <p><b>[Kalou accuses <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha</a> manager <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Klinsmann</a> of lack of respect]</b> It’s not like I’ve only been here for five days or months. I’ve spent almost six years here and have always scored my goals. I don’t need special treatment because of that. But it’s about respect, and there’s currently a massive lack of it. I’m fit and ready to play. If the team needs me, I’ll do my job. I’ve never experienced anything like this before. Not even at the great Chelsea<br /><br />I will always remember <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha</a> as a wonderful place. I have a good relationship with <b>[sporting director]</b> Michael Preetz</p>

  <p><b>[Kalou suspended by <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha</a> after ignoring coronavirus safety rules in video]</b> I am sorry if I gave the impression that I am not taking Coronavirus seriously. I apologise for this. The opposite is the case, because I am especially worried about the people in Africa, where medical care there is nowhere near as good as in Germany. I didn’t really think and was happy that everyone’s tests were negative and I also want to apologise to those who appeared in the video without knowing</p>
