  <p><b>[Naby Keita has been the subject of a surprising fitness update from Guinea]</b> He consulted his doctor in Switzerland, as I said at the beginning. He is in treatment with his doctor. He has started on the bike there <b>[at Liverpool]</b> and it is said that he will maybe in two weeks resume with the squad. It is even possible that he is in the squad for the Champions League final, if what I have been told is true. We will see. We will wait and remain realistic. This is not the time to scream or panic. We have to wait and see how it goes</p>
