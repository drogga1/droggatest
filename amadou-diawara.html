  <p><b>[Roma’s Amadou Diawara names ex-Manchester City midfielder <a href="yaya-toure.html">Yaya Toure</a> as role model]</b> <a href="yaya-toure.html">Yaya Toure</a>. I’d watch him on TV at home during his <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> days and I also followed his journey with the Ivory Coast. The Africa Cup of Nations is very important to us and we all sit in front of the TV to watch it. He was my idol, so while I watched Guinea’s games and got behind my country, I also supported him. He had incredible vision and played in the same position as me. I dreamt of becoming a player like him<br /><br /><b>[Diawara also pointed to Roma legend <a href="daniele-de-rossi.html">Danielle De Rossi</a> as his role model in Italy]</b> As for Italian football, I really liked <a href="daniele-de-rossi.html">Daniele De Rossi</a> and would watch plenty of Roma matches in order to see him in action. He would simply bowl me over. I loved the way he covered the pitch, his vision and first touch, what a player!<br /><br /><b>[It was within that period the Guinean switched to Roma]</b> I think that it was <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a> who wanted me at <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>. I’m grateful to him for that because he really made me improve as a footballer. He taught me how to play the game and selected me in important games straight away, showing how much faith he had in me. We then took different paths, but I’m thankful to him for how much he made me develop as a player and as a man.<br /><br />When <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> took over, I didn’t know if I’d stay at <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, but he called me to say that I was in his plans. It didn’t quite pan out that way in the end. He’s a great man, but it didn’t work out that well between us. He’s an excellent coach, who’s quite similar to <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>. He always wants us to bring the ball out at our feet and make good use of our midfielders, which is something I very much like.<br /><br />This new adventure is another step forward in my career and I have to make the most of it. After the Africa Cup of Nations last summer, I came back before the holidays to meet the coach and my team-mates. I couldn’t wait for the season to get going<br /><br /><b>[The Syli Nationale reached the Round of 16 but lost out 3-0 to eventual champions Algeria]</b> Playing for Guinea makes me feel something that I can’t put into words. It brings a tear to my eye when the fans sing the national anthem. It was my first Africa Cup of Nations and I was so excited to compete in it. It was an incredible experience</p>
