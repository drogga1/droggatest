<blockquote>
  <p>[Manchester United goalkeeper Sam Johnstone says that he is becoming to come around to the notion that he will have to leave Old Trafford if he is to reach his potential] If you leave, then the one downside is that you haven’t played despite being there since you were 10. I’d have liked to have done it. But you’ve got the world’s best goalkeeper, David de Gea, at the club and you can’t wait around forever. [Being on loan has] been fun getting games in and getting different experiences but I’m 25 now and ready to settle. Hopefully Villa get promoted and we’ll take things from there<br /><br />You realise you might have to take the example of someone like Michael Keane, who went to Burnley and has gone from strength to strength. When we were younger Michael wasn’t really in the frame, he was probably a late developer but then he kicked on and progressed quickly. He’s always been a very good player but he went on loan, got games, then decided to leave and carry on that progression. If you choose to leave, you have to choose the right club, the one where you’ll play the most games. Ultimately that’s what whoever picks the England team looks at. I have to create my own career. You want to be challenging to get into the England setup. Nick Pope gets into the Burnley team because of an injury, does very well and then gets his call-up. It just shows the manager [Gareth Southgate] is watching and hopefully he has me in mind even though I’m in the Championship</p>

  <p>[Manchester United goalkeeper Sam Johnstone has completed a £6.5 million transfer to West Brom] I’m happy to be here. I’ve spoken to a lot of people about the club and heard nothing but good things. It’s good to get through the door. I’ve played Championship games and won a promotion from League One with Preston but always seemed to end back at Manchester United or going somewhere else. Now it’s time to settle down and take my game up to the next level which I believe I can do here.</p>
