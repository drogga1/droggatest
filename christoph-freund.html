  <p><b>[Red Bull Salzburg sporting director Christoph Freund says the Austrian side are not worried about losing coach <a href="jesse-marsch.html">Jesse Marsch</a> to Borussia Dortmund]</b> I have a contract here and my focus is 100 per cent here in Salzburg. It’s not necessary to speak about it, and I have to say that I haven’t been in contact with <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. It is nice when it is rumored that a coach we have will go to such a large club. It is not currently an issue. Jesse has a long-term contract, the decision is clearly up to us. No one has spoken to him yet.<br /><br /><b>[Freund believes the latest rumours shows his club have hired the right people in recent seasons]</b> This confirms that we have good coaches. <a href="marco-rose.html">Marco Rose</a> wasn’t that big of a name before, <a href="adi-hutter.html">Adi Hutter</a> is doing an outstanding job, <b>[Wolfsburg coach]</b> Oliver Glasner was our assistant coach and now Jesse has already made a name for himself. I think that’s a cool story</p>
