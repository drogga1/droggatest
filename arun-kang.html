<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Sporting Equals chief executive Arun Kang says change must come from the top down]</b> If we don’t have that representation you don’t have the knowledge and expertise or even empathy on what the challenges these communities are facing because some of the challenges are very different to other communities. So South Asians a lot of the time, and we’ve been doing some surveys on this, a lot of South Asian communities are saying that the coaches have a perception that they can’t play football. Recently a parent spoke to me about their child who was released from an academy and was told by the coach that he’s a great footballer but said I’m not putting my career on the line for a South Asian footballer because they’ve never made it. So this is the sort of perception we need to work against and if we don’t have diversity within our coaches and across the workforce to understand the challenges facing these communities, then these perceptions are going to carry on</p>
