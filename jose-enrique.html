He’s given a lot of assists, contributed to the team offensively and defensively as well. He has been, for me, one of the best players for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> this year<br /><br /><b>[He has been forced to retire at just 33 years of age]</b> It’s an amazing feeling, it’s been a very difficult year for me and my family. On the 12th it’s going to be a year since my operation. So a year later, I’m here, I’m alive and I can play football. I’m really happy about that. To get the chance to come to Hong Kong, somewhere I have never been, and play for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> again is very, very nice</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Enrique says <a href="andy-robertson.html">Andy Robertson</a> was the best left-back in the world last season]</b> He is unbelievable. I’ve said it before, for me, last year he was the best left-back in the world. I know that was given to <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> but that was not fair in my opinion. Not just because <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> won the Champions League but because he has been an amazing player for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. He gives so much to that side. And him and <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane together <b>[on <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s left]</b> - I wouldn’t want to be on the right side for the other team<br /><br /><b>[The next opponents to take on that challenge will be <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> due at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> on Sunday]</b> It still is <b>[the biggest game of the season]</b> even if United is not doing as well now. For the players, for the fans, it is still the biggest game. Even <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s rivalry with City, even with the way they are doing <b>[pales in comparison]</b>. The rivalry between United and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is different. The preparation is the same. The only thing when you play this game is in your mind you are more nervous than other games - that is obvious. It’s another game, it’s <b>[potentially]</b> three points more, but for the fans and the players it means more. So if you win it, you have a good night after the game!</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> defender Jose Enrique has admitted that <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> footballers cannot be given complete assurances over their health if football does return imminently]</b> For me, health is the most important thing. But if I was a player, I would be happy to play. Obviously, everyone will say you’re not playing anymore, and it’s easy to say - but I believe I would do. Other ex-players agree with me, and I believe the players will be more controlled. They will be having tests almost every day. If something happens and a player gets coronavirus, they are already planning for how they are going to handle it. They can assure you it will be as safe as possible - but they can’t assure you it will be 100 per cent safe. But they can do as many tests as possible, before and after games - these players have families as well - you go home and have your kids there. So it’s not just your health, but also your family. So try to get as many tests as possible, and if they have it, go into quarantine for two weeks. I believe that’s the way to go<br /><br />It’s not just the players who are suffering, it’s the clubs who are suffering economically, the fans who are suffering mentally if they can’t support and watch the team. In my opinion, I believe they should do everything to restart the game. But if things don’t go well, and you have to stop it again, then fair enough.</p>

  <p><b>[former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> defender Jose Enrique says Robertson and <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a> are the best full backs in the world]</b> Definitely. In the last two seasons, definitely. For me, he has everything. He has energy, the energy he has he makes you tired just looking at him sometimes in the games! How much he goes up and down the wing is unbelievable. The intensity, I love the intensity <b>[in how]</b> he plays the game, it’s unbelievable as well. And obviously the end product he has is really good as well, his crosses are amazing. He defends well as well, so he’s the full package really and I believe he’s the best left-back in the world for the last two years, definitely<br /><br />The same as I say with <a href="andy-robertson.html">Andy Robertson</a>, I say with Trent: he’s the best right-back in the world for the last two years as well and he’s only 21 still. So many people want to know, ‘Let’s see if he can play in midfield’ and everything, and I say, ‘Why do you want to change him when he is the best already in his position, he’s still only 21 and he can improve so much in the position?!’. Because he can still improve a lot, so imagine when he improves!</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> full-back Jose Enrique has named <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> as the toughest opponent he ever faced in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> I have to say <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> - the second best player in the world! I loved <b>[Didier]</b> <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a>, he was unbelievable. But I usually faced right wingers and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> was brilliant. In his prime, <b>[Hatem]</b> <a href="hatem-ben-arfa.html">Ben Arfa</a> was very difficult to play against, <b>[Theo]</b> Walcott, Aaron Lennon when he was at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. Aaron was so fast, it was very difficult. But I was never scared. If you’re scared, you’re not ready to play for a team like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. That’s the reality. You want to play against big players. When I played against <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> <b>[…]</b> You know, I always say to young players that when you face a guy like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, you have nothing to lose. If he beats you one-on-one, it’s <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, you know. But if you do well, you do well against one of the best players in the world. You have to be extra motivated. You have to love playing against big players<br /><br />This is my own opinion of course, this is not coming from him. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> was his dream and he left <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> because <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> was in a better position than <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> at that time, that was a reality. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> weren’t winning trophies and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> was one of the best teams in the world. But I’ve been invited to watch him play at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> and we had some conversations that I’m not going to talk about. And I remember him playing at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, fans singing his name for 80 minutes. He doesn’t have this in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, not even <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has it. They might sing to Leo two or three times during games and he’s the best player in history!</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> star Jose Enrique has encouraged active players to put more consideration into what they will do once they retire from football]</b> When people think of footballers, they think of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> players. But there are players in League One, League Two, they’re footballers too, even though they don’t live the life a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> player lives. I’m talking about players from the big leagues. I lived in a bubble. You do what you love, get paid well, receive so much attention, everyone treats you so good wherever you go. And then, all of a sudden, it stops. Now my partner tells me, ‘Jose, go and clean the sh*t off the car’. And I go and clean it. I used to do it anyway but as a footballer, you have your cleaners, it’s a completely different life. When it all stops, the bubble just bursts. I talked to Jorge Lopez, a former <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> player, two days ago. He told me the same thing. You’re still young when you retire. So you say, ‘Well, what do I do now?’ That’s why I tell all the players, ‘Prepare yourself for the post-football life’. I didn’t<br /><br />Someone told me recently, ‘If I was a former footballer, I would just live the holiday life’. Listen, after the first month, you’re already bored of it. Alright, give it a year, no problem. But after that? I’m still 34. When I retired, I was 31-32. What do I want? Do I want to be on holiday for the rest of my life? No, I don’t. You want to be something as a human being. You want to work, you want to do something that makes you feel proud of yourself. I feel proud being an agent. Humans need to work, you can’t be on holidays all the time. It’s very important to have a plan before you retire</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Enrique says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will have to spend money to keep winning trophies]</b> You have to keep spending. It’s very difficult bringing people in with this starting line-up, knowing that they are going to be a substitute from the start, but that is the key for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to keep winning things in the next few years. They need to strengthen the squad because when one of the starting line-up doesn’t play, you feel the difference<br /><br />To win titles is very, very difficult but to win them every single year is even harder. More so in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. You can see with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, they’ve already spent so much money signing two players for next season, so they are going to try to be there. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> already have an amazing team and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are probably going to sign some big players because they want to get up there again</p>
