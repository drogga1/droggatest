  <p><b>[<a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> coach Michel on his side’s lack of scoring threats beyond 22-year-old Belgian <a href="michy-batshuayi.html">Michy Batshuayi</a>]</b> I’ve written to Father Christmas to ask for a striker. But what I really want over the transfer window is for Michy to score lots of goals</p>

  <p><b>[Former Real Madrid player and ex-Sevilla coach Michel says he would never apply to be the coach of Barcelona, but admits the club is the right one for his former midfielder Ivan Rakitic]</b> I would never send Barcelona my CV unless it were All Saints day <b>[December 28th]</b>. That wouldn’t be good for either party.<br /><br />I think Rakitic will stay at Barcelona and won’t make the mistake of leaving. Rakitic is a fantastic 12th man because if you are ever missing anyone, he can play as a No. 10, as a defensive midfielder, or at right or left midfield. He is great in second balls from midfield and is good at heading the ball too. I spoke to Luis Enrique when I was still coaching Oympiakos at the time Rakitic made the move to tell them <b>[Barcelona]</b> that they had made a great signing</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid fans will always jeer their own players despite their 40-game unbeaten run]</b> Real are a demanding club and always will be, so there have always been instances of whistling from the stadium. It doesn’t matter how far ahead in the table they are, or if they’ve gone 40 unbeaten, what matters is the end of the season.</p>

  <p><b>[Alvaro Morata paying for mistake]</b> I don’t know why he left, if it was because he wanted to play more, if it was because he wanted a better contract and because he wanted to play in the English league. At the end of the day he is in a similar situation as to when he was at Real Madrid, he will know personally why he took the decision. I’m of those who think that if you’re at Real Madrid the best thing is to not leave but I don’t know what his thinking is<br /><br />He’s playing less at Chelsea, Giroud is playing more. The most informed one on this is the coach and he knows exactly why he took one decision of another. He’s a good player but any of them are too. It’s a sensitive decision, if you made a list of 50 then number 51 and 52 would miss out too, you have to accept it, respect it and support it</p>

  <p><b>[Rayo Vallecano boss Michel may have seen his side lose their last five matches, but has drawn confidence from Ajax’s stunning 4-1 win over Real Madrid at Santiago Bernabeu in midweek]</b> They went there with nothing to lose, and that’s how we are going to Camp Nou. The last two games are the ones that have hurt us the most. The three promoted teams are the in the fight to go down, but our initial aim this season was to survive and we’re still in a position to achieve it</p>

  <p><b>[Pumas enjoying hot start but have long road ahead for Apertura success]</b> We’re really happy. We’re satisfied and why not say that at times we’re even euphoric, but we’re translating that in a way that the players, we realize what the what the path is. Nothing has changed. I’m sure you don’t qualify to the Liguilla with six points. It would be something historic. A Guinness record! I haven’t seen the players celebrate because there’s nothing to celebrate<br /><br /><b>[Michel said when asked about playing young players]</b> I’m proud to put my confidence in the players who have skills. I don’t look at their passport or where they live, I just look to see if they’re good players, players who can help us</p>
