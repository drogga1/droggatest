  <p><b>[Lianne Sanderson on <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>]</b> I saw him in the room and I remember thinking, ‘I have to speak to him’, but I needed to pick the right moment. I didn’t want to be rude. There was a moment where he was walking towards me as I was heading to the bathroom and I said, ‘Sir <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a>, sorry to interrupt but I just wanted to say Hi’. He was great. We actually spoke for probably three-to-five minutes. It may not seem very long, but we engaged in an actual conversation and he was genuinely interested in my footballing career. It was unbelievable. After the conversation, I had to go into the bathroom, have a moment and calm down. I looked into the mirror and said to myself, ‘Did that really just happen?’</p>

  <p><b>[Orlando Pride forward Lianne Sanderson describes catching the Houston Dash defense unawares and scoring on a quickly taken free-kick in Pride’s NWSL season opener]</b> In my career I’ve scored about three goals like that in England. I always ask if I can take it early, and the officials say, ‘No.’ But I know the rules and if you ask, then you can take (the free-kick) quickly. As I put the ball down I heard people telling me ‘Calm down Lianne, calm down.’ I know exactly what I was going to do … Those are the rules. I’m sure Houston felt a bit hard done by on that, but that’s how it is. I was thinking a bit further ahead</p>

For me this was a little bit disrespectful. I could be wrong but it’s based upon playing against England and we love our tea in England, I’m not a tea drinker but that’s what we’re connected with.</p>

  <p><b>[England forward Lianne Sanderson has weighed in on Alex Morgan’s ‘disrespectful’ tea-drinking celebration during the USA’s Women’s World Cup semi-final win over England]</b> I think tonight I expected Alex to grab a goal, but I’m not that happy with that celebration. You can celebrate however you want but that for me is a bit distasteful and I don’t think she needs to do that. She can celebrate however she wants and I’m a big believer in the Americans and how they celebrate, but for me this was a little bit disrespectful<br /><br /><b>[Morgan was also celebrating her 30th birthday on Tuesday, with some fans believing that her actions after scoring were innocuous and not meant to be directed towards England]</b> Maybe that’s why she celebrated like that. I could be wrong but it’s based upon playing against England and we love our tea in England. I’m not a tea drinker but that’s what we’re connected with so I think it’s a little bit distasteful</p>

  <p><b>[About her experiences of racism in the game, former England forward Lianne Sanderson said]</b> Everyone knows what <a href="eniola-aluko.html">Eniola Aluko</a> went through and that wasn’t a nice moment for anyone. The players scored and they celebrated with <a href="mark-sampson.html">Mark Sampson</a> and that still makes me sick to my stomach to think about now. I don’t think the girls realised how much that hurt myself, Eni and Anita <b>[Asante]</b>. It almost became them against us when it didn’t need to be that way<br /><br />I definitely think the girls could have done more in that situation. I don’t hold it against them but this comes down to enabling. Those girls didn’t think they’d be picked again if they went against him. After a few conversations with the players, they say they didn’t really know what was going on</p>

  <p><b>[The former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> striker Lianne Sanderson has played all over the world during her glittering career having come out as gay 11 years ago]</b> When I signed for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, they did a massive interview about me and my girlfriend at the time being on the same team. I’ve done a lot in my career, but sometimes when I sign for a team the first interview I do is about being gay. I hope we get to a point where the interview isn’t about ‘here’s Lianne, the gay footballer’, and instead it’s ‘Lianne’s a footballer who happens to be gay.<br /><br />It gets a bit tiring. I consciously make the decision to go to these countries, but when you’re constantly the person speaking out about LGBTQ+ stuff, sometimes I just want to play football. It almost takes over my career, and I’ve done a lot. Progress depends on which country you go to; we’re talking cultures of thousands of years we’re trying to change. When I was in Spain or Italy, I wouldn’t feel comfortable holding my girlfriend’s hand because of the way people would stare at us. But then people would recognise us and think: ‘Oh she plays for Juventus’. I would be in a restaurant with my girlfriend and they would bring us dessert for free. I want LGBT people who don’t play for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> to be in Italy and be treated well, because they are human. I played with my girlfriend on the same team at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and it wasn’t as if we walked around the training ground kissing and holding hands. We’re professionals<br /><br />In the women’s game, there is a stereotype that everyone is gay; in the men 9484afd5836d307b314a404d745a9a68, they can’t be gay because they play football. There are obviously gay players, but people don’t think there are which blows my mind. It’s such an old stereotype, and I feel sorry for the players because it is a massive weight to carry around. No players have come up to me from the men’s game to say they are gay, but you look at the ratio, there’s a high percentage there will be two or three in every team. People look at me when I say that and ask, ‘Do you really think so?’, but look at the world now, why would football be any different? I live in hope someone will come out in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> when they feel safe and protected, as it can be life changing. It would be so powerful if one player could do it, but I completely understand why they don’t. Their team-mates do know - it is more accepted now in the team, and I’m sure they know and the manager knows<br /><br /><b>[<a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> captain <a href="troy-deeney.html">Troy Deeney</a> set tongues wagging earlier this month with his view that every top-flight team has at least one gay player]</b> I like <a href="troy-deeney.html">Deeney</a>, I’m a big fan, and I don’t think his comments were offensive. Other people have gone down the route of making people feel forced. There have been front pages of newspapers saying: ‘Premier League players ready to come out’. Imagine being one of those players, seeing those headlines and thinking, ‘oh my God, everybody knows.’ How do you sleep at night, how does that affect your mental health? I think Deeney’s got a good point and trying to educate in a way he knows how, but certain tabloids and TV programmes have really made it seem like people should be forced<br /><br />I would always be open to speaking to <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players if they want to speak to me, if they want someone to confide in. I’ve had people come up to me at events and say: ‘You know that player you like, he’s gay’. When I ask how they know it’s: ‘Oh, such and such told me<br /><br />These are the reasons players don’t come out. That particular player they’re talking about might not even be gay. There have been rumours for years and it’s not nice - just let people live their truth</p>
