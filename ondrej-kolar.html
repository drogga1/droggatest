  <p><b>[Slavia Prague hero Ondrej Kolar was left disappointed that some of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s star names didn’t stop to shake hands or swap shirts after their 0-0 Champions League draw on Tuesday]</b> He was waiting for me inside the tunnel. He stopped me and said he hadn’t seen such a good goalkeeping performance for a long time and that it was a pleasure to watch me play well with my feet. He waited for me after the match, which I take as the ultimate award. To hear such praise from such a good goalkeeper, I had goosebumps. It was an amazing experience, but some of the other players… <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and the others just left - some of them didn’t even shake our hands. It was sad. We were all looking forward to meeting these big players, we wanted to swap jerseys after the match, but they didn’t behave very well<br /><br /><b>[Regardless of the hosts’ apparent behaviour, Kolar still had one of the greatest nights of his life]</b> I live for football, playing at stadiums like this is the greatest thing for me. We were all looking forward to it – it’s every boy’s dream. And to have such a good game here? Amazing. To keep a team like this from scoring doesn’t happen to everyone. We’re the first team in a long time to keep a clean sheet here, everyone knows that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> is a goal factory. We survived a few hectic moments but it’s a pity that we didn’t score. I felt like we could have won</p>
