Yet did his heroics in the League and FA Cup create even a ripple at Old Trafford? Was Steve, a great competitor and wonderful player for United, even considered for the <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> job?<br /><br />OK, a few times in his career it hasn’t worked out but that would be true of Van Gaal, too, if he had spent his managerial life at clubs like <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield Town</a> or Hull<br /><br />I don’t understand why owners suddenly lost faith in British managers. Unless <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> or <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> gets the job, do you really see Roman Abramovich appointing an Englishman to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>?

He was another of those players, like <a href="denis-law.html">Denis Law</a> or Bobby Moore, who at 15 probably looked as if he wouldn’t make it. Too small, you would think – can’t run, dumpy little ginger nut – but then the ball would come to him and he would dazzle you. He was the best footballer in that <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> midfield, better than <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> and Roy Keane<br /><br /><b>[Patrick Vieira’s rivalry with <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>]</b> <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> tells a story about those two warriors. Roy had just started his career as a pundit with ITV and was covering a <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> match. The presenter told Roy there was a special guest he might remember from his playing days<br /><br />Gareth could see <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Vieira</a> walking towards them, in his new role as a City ambassador. <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth</a> says the change in Keane’s demeanour was terrifying: his mood darkened, his eyes narrowed, he stiffened and his grip on the table was almost white-knuckle. Nearly 10 years after they had last played each other, Roy had gone into battle mode. It looked as if it could backfire horribly, but the first words out of Patrick’s mouth were so complimentary towards Roy it just defused the situation<br /><br /><b>[<a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> the manager]</b> <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> is working in the game at <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> and Ireland, but it seems a real shame to have a man of his stature outside United. Would they have come seventh last season if Keane had been around to pull the players up?<br /><br />He would have been after them as he always was in the peak years, when there were no short-cuts at United and those messages were passed from Sir Alex, through Keane. There is a story of him laying into <a href="mark-bosnich.html">Mark Bosnich</a>, the goalkeeper, for turning up late on his first day of training. <a href="mark-bosnich.html">Bosnich</a> said he’d got lost. Keane’s point was that on his own first day at the club, he got up early, hired a taxi and followed it to the training ground in his car to ensure he arrived on time<br /><br />I know Roy had a reputation for being high maintenance but I never found him that way. He was as good as gold as a manager and if you asked him about players you always got excellent, straight opinions<br /><br /><b>[Arsene Wenger: Suddenly all the talk was about his revolutionary new training methods]</b> The arrival of <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> in 1996 certainly heralded a change in English football. He was very successful very quickly, and suddenly all the talk was about his revolutionary new training methods. He only trains for an hour … does everything on the stopwatch … the players are wearing heart monitors at training … he gives them supplements … Prozone is one of the biggest changes<br /><br />Last season, when QPR were due to play Blackpool, our most recent scout’s report had them operating with four at the back and two holding midfield players. In the old days, that would have been all that was available<br /><br /><b>[If <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> ever lose faith in <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a>, I’d take him like a shot]</b> Terry is another influential player. He’s one of those that change a club. If we could take him to QPR from <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> I would feel very confident, just with that one signing alone, that we would stay up<br /><br />He gets people at it, he’s a talker, he takes charge of the dressing-room. It’s hard to find leaders, though I’m lucky enough to have <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a> with me. It’s hard to find talkers, organisers. I don’t know why, but it is so hard to find a player prepared to speak his mind<br /><br />Everyone sits there with headphones, looking at an iPad or playing a computer game. Is it any wonder modern players lack communication skills? Terry is a throwback in the way he bosses a team<br /><br />The modern <a href="tony-adams.html">Tony Adams</a> – I can’t pay him a higher compliment than that. Some people may think John is a dubious role model, but I would have no hesitation in saying to any of the young academy defenders at QPR: ‘Go and watch <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> tonight, go and watch Terry, study him all game’</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Redknapp believes Frank Lampard would not be able to turn down the Chelsea job]</b> Now is the time. If Frank gets offered it, it’s all about timing. I know you can turn it down and then it may never come again. I’m sorry for Derby, it has been great with Frank and Derby is a really good club. Frank is a legend here, the fans would absolutely love having him back here. This place would erupt the first day he comes back. He has been here and done it, what hasn’t he done for Chelsea? No-one can question what he has done or what he has been. And he knows the game. There are no secrets in the game. You just need a bit of common sense and good players.<br /><br />If the players train half as hard as he did, he is the best trainer I have ever seen in my life, I have never seen anything like it. He was incredible at the training ground, everyday practice, practice, practice. If the kids here do the same and take that on board, it can only benefit them. I was here when Derby played Chelsea and the home crowd sang his name for 90 minutes, it was unbelievable.<br /><br /><b>[Undoubtedly, it would be a big step up for Lampard]</b> He just is ready, he knows the game, he is a very clever guy, a bright boy. It is all about players, good players. If he comes here it is going to be hard, they have got a transfer embargo but there is lots of good young talent here. He has the determination to be successful; nothing is going to stop him. He is very single-minded and he will work all day and night to be successful. He knows the kids; if Jody comes here with him, he will know the kids. We will see whether the young players they have got here that everyone talks about are good enough because he would give them a chance. They keep going out on loan and doing well, stick them in and let’s see what they can do.<br /><br />I think there is every chance that Frank would do that. He is a massive loss obviously (Hazard), but I still believe there are lots of good players here everyone is talking about as being fantastic - Hudson-Odoi, Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount, he loves Mount. Let them play, get out and play, let’s see what they can do - who knows. It could be a blessing in disguise; it could be a good thing for Chelsea all these young kids coming in with lots of energy, love the club who have come through the youth policy. Who knows what they would do here. It will be exciting<br /><br /><b>[Redknapp described how he helped get the goal scoring midfielder’s first job in management]</b> I rung the chairman to tell him to give Frank the job. I wouldn’t be in a position to do that at Chelsea because I don’t know the people. But I was very close with Mel Morris, who lives near me. I get on very well with him so when the job came up I rung him. To be honest, at first he wasn’t really interested ‘Oh no, I need experience’. After about ten minutes of me battering him on the phone, I said meet him, and when you meet him, he is unbelievable. So he met him, and he rung me straight after the meeting to say he had given him the job because he was so fantastic. I’m sorry for Mel Morris and Derby County, he has been great with Frank and Derby is a real good club</p>

But it’s a great move; he’s absolutely idolised at Chelsea - a genuine legend there. He knows the game, he knows what it’s about, he’s got a touch of class … it will be great. He has a squad there that for sure will finish top six.<br /><br /><b>[Redknapp feels the current squad will still manage to earn a top-four finish next term]</b> I see them next season finishing, at the best, third, probably fourth; around where they were last season. But it’s going to be tougher as they’ve lost their best player, but it might be a great opportunity to give these kids a game. They win everything at Under-16, Under-18, and Under-21 tournaments … let’s see them play! Throw them in!. Tammy Abraham has been out on loan at Aston Villa and did fantastic in the Championship.

Anything in the top six would be OK, but <b>[qualifying for]</b> the Champions League would be a good season. No one is expecting him to finish first or second, third maybe.

  <p><b>[Harry Redknapp says Manchester United and Arsenal are in danger of missing out on top-six finishes in the Premier League next season]</b> I think next season we might see one of the big six dropping out. I’m not sure how strong Arsenal are defensively and, unless they bring some players in, I don’t see where they’re going to be next year, I honestly think Manchester United are the same. Aaron Wan-Bissaka has a big future, but I think they need four, five, maybe even six players. I think they’re miles away. Man United need to bring in good players to give Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the chance to be successful and, looking at it at the moment, I wouldn’t see them making the top four.<br /><br />They need to restructure that team, there’s an awful lot of work that needs to be done there to get them challenging for the title again. Someone might creep into that top six next year, it would make a good change, wouldn’t it? I think maybe Everton, they finished strongly last year, and West Ham will be closer this year. West Ham have made a couple of good signings and they could be a team that could certainly get closer. Even Wolves, they had a great season, they’ve got some fantastic players and they could be one of the teams getting in there</p>

He is a very educated boy. He is the best trainer I have seen in all my years of football. I have never seen anyone work so hard on the training ground. I am sure you can ask Jose Mourinho, you can ask Claudio Ranieri, you can ask anybody who worked with him - he trained like nobody you have ever seen. He will expect the same level of effort and commitment from the players at Chelsea. He will demand it.

It came out suddenly he (Bale) wasn’t wanted around the place and he’s not the type of lad that you would treat like that because he’s not a problem. He’s not a lad who’s in the dressing room causing you problems or upsetting the rest of the spirit in the team, he’s not one of them lads, so I don’t know why you would treat Gareth like that.

I managed him for four years and he’s absolutely low maintenance, not a problem to anybody, gets on with his football, so I’m surprised really the way it’s evolved at Real Madrid, surprised at how Zidane came out and suddenly said he’s not wanted here. It wasn’t the ideal way to deal with it and Gareth’s not going to be pushed into or rushed into going somewhere he doesn’t want to go.

So somebody will give him a big signing-on fee plus his wages, so he is really going to set himself up for life by hanging on now. He has gone this far. It’s a once in a lifetime opportunity.

  <p><b>[Harry Redknapp thinks that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> will now be able to attract the best young talent in football after <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>’s implementation of a youth-first policy at Stamford Bridge]</b> The young kids now in football will think ‘hang on, this is the club to come to. We get the chance here’. That’s important. At some clubs, if you were a great schoolboy player I would say it isn’t worth going there because they never play the kids<br /><br /><a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> do, it has changed. If you are a superstar youngster at school level and a lot of clubs including <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> want you, then you go to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> because you get a chance here. I think he <b>[Lampard]</b> gives confidence to the young kids coming in. They have got loads of great kids at Chelsea<br /><br />It has been fantastic. I had no doubts he was going to be a success. He is such a clever boy, he was a great player, he was the best trainer, the best professional I have ever met in my life. I have never seen anyone I worked with come a million miles close to him on the training ground. I worked with some great players but with training, I never saw anyone like him. Every single day, out there practising extra things after training. It was incredible. The players at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have only got to look at him and see that he is a true legend at the club.<br /><br />The goals, the way he played and trained. The kids look at him and see that he has done everything. I had no doubts that he would come in and be brilliant. The most important thing as a manager is to have good players and get the best out of them. That’s what he has done. He has gone in and seen the kids. He had Mount and <a href="fikayo-tomori.html">Tomori</a> with him at Derby. He knows them. He knew <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a>. He knew he was good enough. <b>[Olivier]</b> <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a> can’t get in the team and he still plays for France, the world champions.<br /><br /><a href="fikayo-tomori.html">Tomori</a> has got pace, he looks a really good player. Frank is not picking players on their reputations. He is picking them on their merits. It is good to see the kids coming through. It is like when Frank came through. I am enjoying it and I think the fans are enjoying it as well. It is fantastic. I follow every result and I like to get there and watch them play when I can</p>

Jose has gone in there, we know his record, it’s incredible, but no-one’s got a magic wand and at the moment it seems the team just doesn’t look right.

They are the best team and they’re well clear. They thoroughly deserve it.</p>
