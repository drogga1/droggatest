  <p><b>[Yacine Adli is regarded as the gem of the Paris Saint-Germain academy]</b> I don’t think these awards have changed my status. It’s payback for the work that I do daily. These are nice distinctions but I can’t stop here. Like I say, there’s a lot of work to do and I have to look higher.<br /><br />I’ll take it as it comes. My first goal is to progress and to adapt little by little to the top level. Now, if there’s a chance to play, I’ll take it.<br /><br />It was a very good apprenticeship. I think I’ve become more mature, largely thanks to my integration into the adult game with the reserves, certain training sessions with the professionals. I’ve also improved technically, tactically thanks to David Hernandez, who I’ve watched a lot of videos with, which has really helped me. But I think there are still some aspects I can improve. I’m aiming higher, so I’m full of things that can make me better<br /><br /><b>[On facing Barcelona]</b> That kind of match allows you to evaluate your level a little, but it’s not an end point. Sometimes those matches can pass you by. For example, in that game, we didn’t get a chance to play our usual game. That shows us something about playing at a higher level and allows us to learn. Barca are a club that have put things in place for a number of years, but PSG’s still young in this regard and we’ll learn little by little.</p>
