Wayne Rooney found himself at the centre of VAR controversy for DC United last night when his straight red card was overturned. The former England international’s side found themselves 1-0 down against Dallas on Thursday evening and looked to have been reduced to 10 men after Rooney’s lunge on Michael Barrios saw him receive a straight red card from referee Nima Saghafi. However, in dramatic fashion VAR was utilised in order to review the incident, and upon a second viewing Saghafi opted to overturn his decision and show the forward a yellow card and keep him on the pitch</p>

Not only in Liverpool, but also in Dortmund. This guy really has it. And he has his best years still upon him</p>

I am looking forward to joining Phillip Cocu, his coaching staff and the first-team squad from the start of January. I am sure I can make a big contribution and can’t wait to meet everyone, especially the supporters. I am equally excited to begin my coaching career at Derby County working with both the first team and Academy. I must also take this opportunity to thank DC United, their owners, executives and supporters who have been superb to work with. I want them to know that I will give my all in support of our push for the play-offs</p>

Firstly, I’m a player. I feel I’ve a lot of qualities I can bring to the squad. I want to come in and play and help the team.

It’s what I want to do and I don’t want to keep talking about it but my main focus is playing and learning. With any new role, the first thing you want to do is learn that role and learn the best things to do and the things not to do. So I think that’ll be what I’m doing for the next 18 months and trying to learn good habits which coaches do. Of course I’ve played under some great managers - certainly towards the last five years you try to look at things in different ways with one eye on going into that role. I’ll keep trying to learn and give my best on the pitch. I was lucky enough to have some very good, experienced players who helped me when I was a young player, so that’s a natural progression in football and now I’m at the end where I can hopefully help them and guide them<br /><br /><b>[Rooney was also linked with Burnley]</b> There were options there - there were other clubs making offers and enquiring about me, but I made the decision to come here and that was it.

  <p><b>[Coronavirus: Rooney criticises authorities for treating footballers like ‘guinea pigs’]</b> After the emergency meeting, at last the right decision was made. Until then it almost felt like footballers in England were being treated like guinea pigs. The rest of sport - tennis, Formula One, rugby, golf, football in other countries - was closing down and we were being told to carry on.<br /><br />At <a href="derby-county.html">Derby County</a>, we sat at training on Thursday waiting for <a href="boris-johnson.html">Boris Johnson</a> to speak. People were anxious. Thankfully football made the right call in the end. We had to put the season on hold. Some people won’t be happy but I just think, in this case, football has to come second. It’s a sport. It’s just a sport.<br /><br />If people’s lives are at risk, that has to come first - regardless of whether you’re going to win the league title, whether you’re trying to get into Europe or whether you’re going to get relegated or promoted.<br /><br />We’re happy to play until September if the season extends to then, if that’s how it has to be. That’s our job. As long as we know we’re safe to play and it’s a safe environment for spectators, we’ll play.<br /><br />The next World Cup is in November and December 2022, so you could actually use this situation as an opportunity and say we’re going to finish the 2019-20 season later this year, then prepare for 2022 by having the next two seasons starting in winter</p>

  <p><b>[Rooney wouldn’t be surprised if season isn’t finished until end of 2020 due to coronavirus]</b> The world is facing something serious and we in football should not be different from the rest of the population. Football is what everybody - especially in Britain - wakes up thinking about, but it has to take a back seat. This crisis is so much bigger than our game. The one thing missing from all the announcements last week was <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> ruling that every club should keep their players at home and not put anyone at risk, instead of leaving it to individual clubs to decide. I’d like to have seen that. But otherwise we now know where we’re going. The FA helped to clarify that the league season will finish and that is fair.<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. <b>[They]</b> have been fantastic. They have put so much work in. They deserve this title. Can you imagine waiting 30 years and then having it taken away like this? The right decision has been made. It’s also right in terms of promotion and relegation and Champions League places. These issues are so big for the clubs involved that I imagine there would be a lot of legal fights if the season was just abandoned. The fair thing is to finish 2019-20 - even if we have to lose next season in the process. It wouldn’t surprise me if finishing the season takes until the end of 2020. Football, like every other industry, is in unknown territory and, just like every other industry, has to listen to the advice and take all necessary precautions. For me, that rules out finishing the season behind closed doors. When you play behind closed doors it still means bringing together a fairly large group of people. You need ambulances, doctors, paramedics. They’re mandatory. Police may be needed too. Why bring them all to a football match when in this crisis they will be needed elsewhere for things that are far more important? I wouldn’t be comfortable playing a game knowing there were people dying or very sick because of coronavirus and we’re taking those workers away from the front line</p>

The England armband means your behaviour is judged differently<br /><br />After my last competitive international, v Scotland in 2016, there were headlines about me having a drink in The Grove Hotel yet the truth was it was a Saturday, we’d played on Friday and it was already decided I wouldn’t be involved - not even on the bench - in a match on Tuesday versus Spain.<br /><br />I could have gone home. Gareth and I agreed, though, that as captain it would be good if I stayed around the camp and attended the game. As happened during my whole England career when there was a break, players were given the evening off and permission to let their hair down, even have a drink. Some players headed into London but I knew it would get more attention if I accompanied them, so I stayed in the hotel along with a few others, including staff, and had a drink<br /><br />On reflection I could have made a different decision but what followed was way over the top. In the aftermath, <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> was too scared of the reaction to defend me and so the coverage went overboard. I had to be strong and deal with the situation. I’ve dealt with it my whole career</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney has leapt to the defence of former team-mate <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> over his now-infamous interview with <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s TV station that is believed to have hastened his departure from Old Trafford 15 years ago]</b> <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> was vocal. He had an aura. I remember my first United training session thinking, ‘I need to impress him.’ Not the manager. Him. I was at United when he gave his infamous MUTV interview but disagree with how it’s portrayed. Roy was supposedly too critical of his team-mates but I’ve watched the video and there’s nothing wrong with it at all. He said that players can’t pass the ball ten yards and they’re playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and it’s not good enough. Well, he’s right<br /><br />Captains set the example through performances. They don’t have to be the best player, but they have to be consistent. They can’t show weakness. They have to always show belief. If you go a goal down you have to keep encouraging, demonstrating your calmness to everyone. The best captains I played for had different personalities but shared those traits. <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> was quiet, but it was an iconic time when he was captain of England because of his status in the game. He led through his attitude and work rate. <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Stevie Gerrard</a> brought drive and determination. He wasn’t the most vocal, but you knew by one of his tackles what he was saying. <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> was very good too; <a href="duncan-ferguson.html">Duncan Ferguson</a> was really quiet off the pitch but on it was all heart and fight</p>

  <p><b>[Rooney reveals he advised <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> to sign Gueye a month after re-joining Everton]</b> Everyone talks about his tackling and energy but what surprised me was his quality on the ball - he always looked to play it forward and to your feet. After a month playing with him, I spoke to people at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> saying he was good enough for them. I wasn’t shocked when <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> signed him.<br /><br /><b>[Rooney added on Fellaini]</b> He was an absolute handful. He didn’t mean to, but he’d always catch you with a knee or elbow; he scored goals, was always threatening and never got the credit he deserved. He was such a nice person and when he was getting stick at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> it was hard for him. I admired the character he showed to get through that and win fans around a bit.</p>

  <p><b>[Rooney says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> can dominate for a decade if manager stays]</b> <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s squad is young and all the key players are tied down on long contracts. They have huge potential to win more trophies. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> says it’s impossible for any club to dominate like United once did but he is wrong. There’s a simple way for Liverpool: let <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> go on and on. United dominated because <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> stayed so long. I think if <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, who is only 53, stayed at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> for the next 10 years <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> would win at least five <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> titles. He could keep building great sides because, as I mentioned, players join clubs to work with managers as good as him. If I were one of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s owners, I would be doing everything in my power to tie him down for many years</p>

  <p><b>[Rebekah Vardy suing Coleen Rooney for libel over Instagram leak claims]</b> For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories. There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family - all without my permission or knowledge. After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion. To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram Stories except one account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven’t had stories there for a while). Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into The Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about basement flooding in my new house<br /><br />It’s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it’s come from. It… Rebekah <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Vardy</a>’s account</p>
