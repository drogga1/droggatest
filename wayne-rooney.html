I am always very demanding of myself in what I expect. Playing for your country, every player has to give their all. It’s a great honour to captain my country and I want to be a successful captain. I’m sure all the team want that, we’re working hard to try and get there and tomorrow is the start of a new chapter. Last summer we were all disappointed, we went in with high hopes, we were expecting better but we have to move on, there is no point looking back. We’ve had retirements but young players coming in and it’s exciting</p>

It’s the first game after the World Cup and it was important that we got the win tonight, especially going into the game on Monday. In the first half we moved quite well but they made it difficult for us; sat back and created a few opportunities. In the second half we started really sloppily and that was disappointing, as we wanted to go out and really take the game to them. We got the win in the end and there are a lot of young players in this team. They are still learning.</p>

He is quick, he can score goals and I am sure with him getting the move to Arsenal now, hopefully he can play up front for Arsenal. That will really help him with England. He is a Manchester lad and I spoke to him a few times. It was a really tough decision for him to move, but for his professional career, he felt he had to. Hopefully he can get a few games up front which would benefit him for England.</p>

We’re a tight-knit group and we’re working hard together to get the best out of each other. We’ve got a lot of quality in the team and it’s about that quality coming together. It’s a nice game to play in. It’s probably the most difficult game of the group and we want to do well and come out of it with a good result. We are ready. We’ve had a bit more time through the week to prepare for the game and we’re excited. It’s going to be big test but we feel we have the quality to do well. The whole team, if we get a positive result, it will give everyone a lot of confidence to go on and do well in the group.<br /><br />Four years ago was a long time ago. It was a completely different team and we have to look to the future. There’s no point looking back - it was a good result and good performance four years ago but we’re focused on <b>[Monday]</b> and that game is irrelevant</p>

He has the potential to be as good as Overmars. Raheem is a fantastic and quite an unusual player. He can play right across the front line, out wide. Although he’s a small lad, he’s really strong. The potential he’s shown is incredible. He’ll be a massive player for us over the next 10 to 15 years and, unfortunately, for Liverpool.</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney believes England’s ability to counter attack quickly was key to their 2-0 victory over Switzerland]</b> We played some great stuff today. We defended well as a team which was important. We caught them well on the break with the speed we’ve been talking about. Danny got two great goals, I’m delighted for him.<br /><br />I think we all knew the game of Wednesday night was going to be difficult coming off the back of a world cup. We got the victory, it wasn’t the best of performances, but tonight was more important, we was focusing more or this than Wednesday night. We’ve put the work in. Worked on our defensive shape when we haven’t got the ball and then springing from defence to attack, which you saw with the two goals tonight. We’re pleased. The things we’ve worked on the training ground have paid off, so it’s a happy performance for us.</p>

We have had meetings amongst ourselves - just players in the rooms - watching videos and discussing how we can do better as a team. In the meetings, you’re having players speak up who wouldn’t normally when coaches are there. They’ve been good and I think the players have really stood up <b>[against Switzerland]</b>. Obviously after the <b>[Norway]</b> game last Wednesday it has been quite difficult at times, but we’ve worked hard.</p>

It’s not something going into the game <b>[I’m]</b> thinking: ‘Oh, I’ve got to beat Jimmy Greaves’ record to get close to Bobby Charlton’.

At that age you don’t look beyond the next game. You are lucky and it is a privilege to play for England in the games that I have clocked up, and it is there now, just two more games. I have always said that I don’t want to stop playing for England after I get 100 caps, I want to get many more after that and try to do my best for the team. I love playing for England and I feel I have many more years playing for England. Unless told otherwise by the coaches I will always be available for selection.</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney insists he is still driven by the desire to achieve success with England as he prepares to reach 100 international caps]</b> It’s a special moment for me, but I don’t just want to be remembered as one of the players who gets 100 caps or more. You want to be successful. That would mean so much more than getting to 100 caps.<br /><br /><b>[When asked to assign his England career to date a mark out of 10]</b> I can’t say it’s a ‘three’ or an ‘eight’. You just have to look at how successful you’ve been and we haven’t been successful. It hasn’t always been great but it’s always been a magical moment to play for my country. Being captain of both United and England, there’s going to be pressure. But I feel that over the years I’ve matured as a person and as a footballer and I’m ready for that pressure, ready to deal with it<br /><br />I always work hard. I understand the manager has decisions to make. I want to take that decision out of the manager’s hands with my own form. I don’t want to be plodding along, waiting for a decision to be made. You finish playing football at a young age, so I never want to cut my career short by deciding not to play for England. If I get picked to go to the <b>[2018]</b> World Cup, I’d be more than happy to do that.</p>

We knew it was going to be a tough night and even tougher after they scored but the character we showed was great. That winning mentality is with us and we believe we’re going to win every game. It was a good day in the end. It was tough because they took the lead and we had to show our character and that’ll be good for us as a team. We haven’t faced that, so going behind, it was a great reaction from the players and we’re delighted with that. We could’ve done better before they went 1-0 up and I think after that it really woke us up and we went on to show what a good team we are.<br /><br /><b>[Rooney became England’s latest centurion at Wembley]</b> It’s a special night for me. It’s a great honour to represent England 100 times now and hopefully many more to come. To walk out with my two boys is something no one can ever take away from me.<br /><br /><b>[On Danny Welbeck]</b> He <b>[Welbeck]</b> doesn’t have to prove anything to anyone. He’s shown he’s a top forward and, the more games he plays, he’s getting better. He’s scoring goals for Arsenal and England and he deserves all the credit he gets</p>

When you get to a certain age, you almost feel like you have to do it, to extend your club career, but she <b>[Coleen]</b> was actually very good. She was the one who said to me: ‘It’s a short career, you have got plenty of time to have your time off with us as a family when you finish playing and you will regret it if you do <b>[retire from international football]</b>. I obviously thought ‘yes, I would’. Football is what I love doing. Playing for my country I love, I would regret it. I don’t think I ever would walk away.</p>

Ask Roy Hodgson. He’s had differences with players over the years, too. That’s part of football. I’m not the only person who had differences with Sir Alex Ferguson but I can still sit here and say he was the greatest manager of all time. I still see Sir Alex quite a bit at games and he travels away to European games with us. It’s not that we don’t like each other. We just had differences. That’s normal.<br /><br />Realistically 2018 is a target for me, to go and play that World Cup, and then we will see what happens in terms of the manager or myself. I’ll listen to my body but, if I still feel 100 per cent fit for England and I can do my job then we will see what happens after that. If I feel I can carry on, I’ll try. But I won’t be one to say I’m not available for selection. I’m sure it’ll probably be the manager’s choice more than mine. It’s a huge honour to play for England and I imagine it’ll be difficult to say I’m ready not to play</p>

It’s a great feeling <b>[being England’s record goalscorer]</b>. Obviously I’ve known I’ve been close to it the last few England games to finally do it is a dream come true.

I’m happy it’s done and hopefully we can kick on from here and concentrate on the team and hopefully have success in the future.<br /><br />You play each game and each year as it comes really and I went through a spell round about 2008 where I didn’t score for a couple of years I think for England.

Being the country’s all-time leading goalscorer before the age of 30 is something I could never have dreamt of, and I’m just extremely proud of tonight<br /><br />I knew myself it was a big moment for me and I just picked my corner and put my boot through it, to get as much power on it as possible and make it hard for the goalkeeper.

It happens. Of course you’re going to make mistakes. I told him to have an impact and a few moments that people will remember - and he certainly did that<br /><br />I’m not jealous. I’m a fan now. I’ve had my time. Are you jealous of me because I’m younger than you? Of course I’m excited for him. I’m excited for all of them, I’m excited for England. This is a great opportunity for this group of players to make that next step. They’ve already got to a World Cup semi-final, but they can’t sit back and be happy about doing what the 1990 team did. They have got the potential to go further. This is a young group of players, but I can see the mentality is right and they’ll be pushing for more</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney has challenged the likes of Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku to prove that they are big characters for Manchester United]</b> Jose can do what I know he’ll be doing - he’ll be working with the team and setting them up. But I think a lot of the responsibility has to go on the players’ shoulders. They go on the pitch, they have to take that responsibility and they have to thrive on it. There will be tough moments throughout games, that is where the big characters have to lead by example on the pitch and almost drag the team through some games. You have got players like <b>[Anthony]</b> Martial, Pogba, <b>[Marcus]</b> Rashford and Lukaku. When games aren’t going well, they need to be the players who can just get that goal which wins you the game and calms everyone down.<br /><br />The Christmas period in the Premier League always determines how well you’re going to do for the rest of the season. I think it’s an important four to six weeks coming up for United. You have these games and it’s important to take advantage of them. You can either fall away, which would make it almost impossible to get to where you want to be, or you can build momentum and keep closing that gap. If you close it to a point where you are putting pressure on the leaders, it can make them look back and think ‘oh, they are on a great run’. Hopefully United can do that and then we’ll see where they go from there</p>

It’s what I want to do and I don’t want to keep talking about it but my main focus is playing and learning. With any new role, the first thing you want to do is learn that role and learn the best things to do and the things not to do. So I think that’ll be what I’m doing for the next 18 months and trying to learn good habits which coaches do. Of course I’ve played under some great managers - certainly towards the last five years you try to look at things in different ways with one eye on going into that role. I’ll keep trying to learn and give my best on the pitch. I was lucky enough to have some very good, experienced players who helped me when I was a young player, so that’s a natural progression in football and now I’m at the end where I can hopefully help them and guide them<br /><br /><b>[Rooney was also linked with <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a>]</b> There were options there - there were other clubs making offers and enquiring about me, but I made the decision to come here and that was it.

  <p><b>[Rooney wouldn’t be surprised if season isn’t finished until end of 2020 due to coronavirus]</b> The world is facing something serious and we in football should not be different from the rest of the population. Football is what everybody - especially in Britain - wakes up thinking about, but it has to take a back seat. This crisis is so much bigger than our game. The one thing missing from all the announcements last week was <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> ruling that every club should keep their players at home and not put anyone at risk, instead of leaving it to individual clubs to decide. I’d like to have seen that. But otherwise we now know where we’re going. <a href="fa.html">The FA</a> helped to clarify that the league season will finish and that is fair.<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. <b>[They]</b> have been fantastic. They have put so much work in. They deserve this title. Can you imagine waiting 30 years and then having it taken away like this? The right decision has been made. It’s also right in terms of promotion and relegation and Champions League places. These issues are so big for the clubs involved that I imagine there would be a lot of legal fights if the season was just abandoned. The fair thing is to finish 2019-20 - even if we have to lose next season in the process. It wouldn’t surprise me if finishing the season takes until the end of 2020. Football, like every other industry, is in unknown territory and, just like every other industry, has to listen to the advice and take all necessary precautions. For me, that rules out finishing the season behind closed doors. When you play behind closed doors it still means bringing together a fairly large group of people. You need ambulances, doctors, paramedics. They’re mandatory. Police may be needed too. Why bring them all to a football match when in this crisis they will be needed elsewhere for things that are far more important? I wouldn’t be comfortable playing a game knowing there were people dying or very sick because of coronavirus and we’re taking those workers away from the front line</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney has leapt to the defence of former team-mate <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> over his now-infamous interview with <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s TV station that is believed to have hastened his departure from <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> 15 years ago]</b> <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> was vocal. He had an aura. I remember my first United training session thinking, ‘I need to impress him.’ Not the manager. Him. I was at United when he gave his infamous MUTV interview but disagree with how it’s portrayed. Roy was supposedly too critical of his team-mates but I’ve watched the video and there’s nothing wrong with it at all. He said that players can’t pass the ball ten yards and they’re playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and it’s not good enough. Well, he’s right<br /><br />Captains set the example through performances. They don’t have to be the best player, but they have to be consistent. They can’t show weakness. They have to always show belief. If you go a goal down you have to keep encouraging, demonstrating your calmness to everyone. The best captains I played for had different personalities but shared those traits. <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> was quiet, but it was an iconic time when he was captain of England because of his status in the game. He led through his attitude and work rate. <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Stevie Gerrard</a> brought drive and determination. He wasn’t the most vocal, but you knew by one of his tackles what he was saying. <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> was very good too; <a href="duncan-ferguson.html">Duncan Ferguson</a> was really quiet off the pitch but on it was all heart and fight</p>

  <p><b>[Rooney reveals he advised <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> to sign Gueye a month after re-joining <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>]</b> Everyone talks about his tackling and energy but what surprised me was his quality on the ball - he always looked to play it forward and to your feet. After a month playing with him, I spoke to people at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> saying he was good enough for them. I wasn’t shocked when <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> signed him.<br /><br /><b>[Rooney added on <a href="marouane-fellaini.html">Fellaini</a>]</b> He was an absolute handful. He didn’t mean to, but he’d always catch you with a knee or elbow; he scored goals, was always threatening and never got the credit he deserved. He was such a nice person and when he was getting stick at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> it was hard for him. I admired the character he showed to get through that and win fans around a bit.</p>

  <p><b>[Rooney says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> can dominate for a decade if manager stays]</b> <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s squad is young and all the key players are tied down on long contracts. They have huge potential to win more trophies. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> says it’s impossible for any club to dominate like United once did but he is wrong. There’s a simple way for Liverpool: let <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> go on and on. United dominated because <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> stayed so long. I think if <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, who is only 53, stayed at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> for the next 10 years <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> would win at least five <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> titles. He could keep building great sides because, as I mentioned, players join clubs to work with managers as good as him. If I were one of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s owners, I would be doing everything in my power to tie him down for many years</p>

  <p><b>[Rebekah <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Vardy</a> suing Coleen Rooney for libel over Instagram leak claims]</b> For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories. There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family - all without my permission or knowledge. After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion. To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram Stories except one account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven’t had stories there for a while). Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into The Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about basement flooding in my new house<br /><br />It’s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it’s come from. It… Rebekah <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Vardy</a>’s account</p>
