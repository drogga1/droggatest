  <p><b>[Victor Moses, Nigeria international, is quickly making a name for himself at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>]</b> The three goals that I have scored so far have been great. We noticed that he was not really good at crosses and fortunately i scored from Mata’s corner kick.<br /><br /><b>[And with the game against <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> now very crucial]</b> As the games come now, all of them are like cup finals and we just have to take these games as they come and hopefully we will get the win again.</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Moses speaks about the Super Eagles’ World Cup draw pairing them with Argentina, Iceland and Croatia]</b> We keep getting Argentina for some reason. We don’t want to play against <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, but it is what it is. We’ve got to go and play our football and see what happens. After what Iceland did last year <b>[beating England in the last 16 of the Euros]</b>, football nowadays, there’s no easy game. Argentina are going to be scared of us as well. It’s all about football at the end of the day</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Moses is hopeful he can have a positive impact on this season’s FA Cup final]</b> Yes, definitely, it was the worst feeling ever that I’ve experienced in my career, and in a final as well. I wanted to be on the pitch to help my team-mates. It played on my mind a little bit, but apart from that it’s happened and there’s nothing I can do about it. It would be a dream <b>[to score the winning goal]</b>, but the most important thing is that it’s all about the team and the team effort. We need to work hard, stick together and, hopefully, if we can do that, we can overcome anyone. I can’t rewind it back, to try and not get a red card, it is what it is, it’s football. We just want to get it right this time. We know we have Man United in the final, but it won’t be easy. If we can win it, it will be a great bonus, but we just want to finish strong.<br /><br />Every single one of us wants to stay disciplined and focused, and do what the manager asks of us on the pitch and make sure that we win. The most important thing is that we just have to motivate ourselves to win it. Obviously, last year, I got a red card, but we want to try and get it right this time. But that’s gone now, we have another final on May 19 against Manchester United to look forward to and we want to win it..<br /><br />Definitely, there is competition everywhere, good players everywhere, so whenever you start, you have got to enjoy it. If you take your foot off the gas, that’s you out. I just want to work hard, that’s the most important thing, help my team-mates, and win as many games as we can<br /><br />No, to be honest, I just want to play my football, it’s got nothing to do with Jose. It’s only about that I’m a Chelsea player, I want to win the final, that’s the most important thing</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea winger Victor Moses has announced his international retirement from Nigeria]</b> I have experienced some of the best moments of my life wearing the Super Eagles shirt and have memories with me that will last a lifetime. However I feel that now is the right time to step away in order to be able to focus fully on club career and my young family as well as to allow the next generation of Super Eagle stars the opportunity to step up and to flourish</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Moses says he needed to play football after a lack of game time at Chelsea prompted an 18-month January loan move to Fenerbahce]</b> It’s tough, as Chelsea’s a very special place for me and I’ve always had a great relationship with the fans but it became very obvious that I was not in the manager’s plans. I have achieved great things there but I just needed to play football and that’s why I got the move to Fenerbahce.<br /><br />When I came here, everyone was a little bit shocked by the position they were in and that was the main reason why I came, as a big club like Fenerbahce should not be in a position like that.<br /><br />In the stadium the atmosphere is a lot different <b>[to England]</b>. It’s unlike anything I have ever experienced in football, every game is a must-win game and they are so passionate as they just want us to win and make everybody happy. It’s not just football, it’s a way of life here. It’s a massive experience, playing against Galatasaray and Besiktas, you can feel the atmosphere, it feels like the stadium is going to fall down due to the fans singing and bouncing. The atmosphere is amazing, you can easily tell the passion they’ve got for football here is crazy. They just love football and want the team to win, that’s why they support the team<br /><br />I am here with my wife and two kids. My kids are going to school here and my wife has settled down. It has made it a lot easier for me to go to work and come home to see the kids, it feels like I am still back in London</p>

  <p><b>[Inter have confirmed the signing of Victor Moses from <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> after his loan spell with Fenerbahce was brought to an abrupt end]</b> It’s an honour for me to be here and be an Inter player. I’d like to thank everyone for the welcome I’ve been given, I can’t wait to start<br /><br /><b>[Commenting on his reunion with <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>]</b> Having the opportunity to work with <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> again is something I’m really happy about. I’ve spoken to him and he’s already explained the club’s project to me. I want to be part of it, I’m happy to be here. I’ll give my all and want to help the team. There’s a lot of quality here, I want to make my contribution out on the pitch and enjoy myself. That’s the most important thing<br /><br /><b>[On the city of Milan]</b> It seems like a nice city, I’ve liked what I’ve seen up to now. I think I’ll enjoy it here and we’ll have a great future together. I have positive feelings. I’m going to need time to find my feet but I want to help the team win as many games as possible. We’ll do all that we can to achieve our objectives and make our fans proud</p>
