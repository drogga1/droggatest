  <p><b>[Victor Moses, Nigeria international, is quickly making a name for himself at Stamford Bridge]</b> The three goals that I have scored so far have been great. We noticed that he was not really good at crosses and fortunately i scored from Mata’s corner kick.<br /><br /><b>[And with the game against <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> now very crucial]</b> As the games come now, all of them are like cup finals and we just have to take these games as they come and hopefully we will get the win again.</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Moses speaks about the Super Eagles’ World Cup draw pairing them with Argentina, Iceland and Croatia]</b> We keep getting Argentina for some reason. We don’t want to play against <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, but it is what it is. We’ve got to go and play our football and see what happens. After what Iceland did last year <b>[beating England in the last 16 of the Euros]</b>, football nowadays, there’s no easy game. Argentina are going to be scared of us as well. It’s all about football at the end of the day</p>

I’d like to thank everyone for the welcome I’ve been given, I can’t wait to start<br /><br /><b>[Commenting on his reunion with Conte]</b> Having the opportunity to work with <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> again is something I’m really happy about. I’ve spoken to him and he’s already explained the club’s project to me. I want to be part of it, I’m happy to be here. I’ll give my all and want to help the team. There’s a lot of quality here, I want to make my contribution out on the pitch and enjoy myself. That’s the most important thing<br /><br /><b>[On the city of Milan]</b> It seems like a nice city, I’ve liked what I’ve seen up to now. I think I’ll enjoy it here and we’ll have a great future together. I have positive feelings. I’m going to need time to find my feet but I want to help the team win as many games as possible. We’ll do all that we can to achieve our objectives and make our fans proud</p>
