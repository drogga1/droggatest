  <p><b>[Victor Moses, Nigeria international, is quickly making a name for himself at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>]</b> The three goals that I have scored so far have been great. We noticed that he was not really good at crosses and fortunately i scored from Mata’s corner kick.<br /><br /><b>[And with the game against <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> now very crucial]</b> As the games come now, all of them are like cup finals and we just have to take these games as they come and hopefully we will get the win again.</p>

  <p><b>[The Victor Moses story: From the Gareth Bale of youth football to a main man at Chelsea. His first manager, Tony Loizi, described him]</b> He was like Gareth Bale, when he plays for Wales. Without Bale, Wales are an ordinary or average side and without Moses, Cosmos 90 FC were worse than ordinary!.<br /><br />A moment that I remember was when Victor goes up to the goalkeeper, puts the ball through his legs, turns around chips it back over his head and then beats him again. The kid was in tears as he absolutely humiliated him. Then the mother of the child comes on and starts hitting him over his head with her handbag as he humiliated him. I said to him after that, it doesn’t matter how good you are, you have got to be humble. So many clubs were after him and then Crystal Palace came in. I said to him; ‘look Victor there’s no way I would hold you back’ and I asked him to come to Crystal Palace with me</p>

I just want to keep on working hard and helping my team-mates out.<br /><br />We’re not looking at the table at the moment, we still have 12 matches to play and we just need to take each game as it comes. We just want to stay grounded and win as many games as we can between now and the end of the season. We’re going to stay focused and keep working hard together as a team, as everyone can see we’re doing</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea star Victor Moses has signed a new contract with the club that will take him through to 2021]</b> I feel very excited. I’m delighted to be here for another few years now and to sign a new deal. Now it’s time to concentrate on the team and keep working hard to make sure we win games and try to win the Premier League this season. We’re having a great season, I’m enjoying my football and we have a good manager here that has given every single one of us confidence. I just want to keep on enjoying it and working hard for the team</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Moses says he was not consulted by Antonio Conte before he started playing him as a right wing-back]</b> He didn’t say to me: ‘Do you fancy playing wing-back?’ He just put me in there. After that he just kept on encouraging me and went through it with me, what the position was all about, mostly in training. And constantly he was talking to me in training to make sure I was improving in it, talking me through it. I took that in and I didn’t look back. I have always believed in the ability that I have got. I have always known that I’ve got the ability to play in a big club like Chelsea. I have proved that. We have got a manager here that is willing to give everybody an opportunity.<br /><br />To be honest, I just wanted to play football. It was at Hull that it all started. I really enjoyed it and I took everything in. I kept watching the video of myself after the Hull game, to make sure I was in the right place, and after that I took it in and kept on improving.</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Moses has revealed that Chelsea have no specific plans to stop Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez in Saturday’s FA Cup]</b> I haven’t got a plan to stop him! He’s had a great season, he’s done well for Arsenal but whether he’s injured or not we’re just going to play our football. We came back to training on Tuesday and we want to get ourselves ready. It’s going to be a very hard game for us on Saturday. Arsenal are a good team with good players that can win them games. But we’re just concentrating on ourselves at the moment, working hard in training and hopefully we’ll go and do the job.<br /><br />We’ve got the league title and they’re going to want to win because they missed out on top four. We’re going to try and stop them because we want the double. We don’t feel any pressure. If he <b>[Antonio Conte]</b> says Arsenal are the favourites, then… I don’t know, but we’ve got good players that can win us games. We think we’re good enough to beat Arsenal but it’s not going to be an easy game.<br /><br /><b>[Conte switched formations after the loss]</b> Yeah, we still think about it. We lost two games in a row against Liverpool and Arsenal. We felt very sad after that game but we played them at Stamford Bridge and won 3-1. We beat them once and they beat us once. They’re going to want revenge but we’ll stick to our tactics and try and make sure we win<br /><br />Yeah, it’s my first time <b>[playing in an FA Cup final]</b>. I’m looking forward to it so that’ll be a great honour for me. It’s a massive cup and everyone knows about it in England and all over the world so everyone’s going to be watching the final. It would be a great achievement for me <b>[to win it]</b>. We’ve got a new manager here who’s willing to give everyone an opportunity. He gave me that opportunity and I didn’t look back after that. I’m very pleased with that and I just want to keep improving in every game I play. It’s a new role for me and I’m still getting used to it. It’s the last game of the season on Saturday and hopefully next season we’ll continue from here</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Moses says Azpilicueta has helped me become one of Africa’s best players]</b> Yes, it is amazing. I am pleased with the position I am in today. My manager and team-mates helped me and encouraged me. It shows how hard I worked last year but it isn’t about being nominated but winning <b>[the award]</b>. Whatever the outcome is, I know that I have had a great year at the club and with the national team as well. I was part of the first African team to qualify for the World Cup as well which was good for us. I am pleased to follow in <b>[the former Chelsea players’]</b> footsteps; now I want to take my football to the next level.<br /><br />Every season I want to be the best I can to be Africa’s best player. I will do the best I can. To be honest with you, it is just about hard work. Once you put in the hard work then everything else falls into place. I am a player that will always look up to Didier <b>[Drogba]</b>. He is a legend, not just Africa and Chelsea, but the whole world. Didier is a great player. He scores goals, assists and he’s got everything that you’d ask for in a striker. We as African players are all proud of what Didier achieved as a player. The way he holds himself is unbelievable. Mikel and Essien have been nominated too. I am proud that we were nominated for the same awards</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Moses says Chelsea have no fear of Manchester City]</b> think we have done well. We as a team, whatever happens, we stick together as a team and do the best we can. I think people have been a bit too harsh but we as players don’t need to think about that or concentrate on what people have been saying.<br /><br />These criticisms are the kinds of things that makes a player stronger. We know that we just need to believe in ourselves and prove them wrong then win as many games as I can. We are 100 per cent together. We are like brothers here and we are all sticking together and working hard together.<br /><br />Even after losing against Roma, we believe in ourselves collectively and individually. We have great players. We just take each game as it comes. We beat Manchester United, now everyone is saying that we’re the best. Football is like this. We believe in ourselves and work hard together as a team.<br /><br />Why can’t we compete with City, United or any other club? Our players are good enough to compete with anyone. We have a lot of games to go so you can’t tell who’s going to win the league. We are nine points from Man City but we believe in ourselves and we believe that something can happen further down the line and that we will find ourselves back at the top.<br /><br />We still believe in ourselves and in the manager we have got so we will keep working hard and see where it takes us. Yes, this season is going to be harder than last season now we’re in the Champions League as well. We are playing Tuesday, Saturday or Sunday on most weeks, but as players we are not looking at that.<br /><br />We are just trying to play as many games as possible and trying to win football matches. If we can win all the trophies then that would be a great bonus for us. We don’t need to compete with City alone.<br /><br />We beat them home and away last season and we are the champions of England so we can believe in ourselves and we all want to win every trophy this season. We are still in the Champions League, Premier League and Carabao Cup, then there’s the FA Cup as well. We want to try to win all trophies. We try to do that and then going into the World Cup, that would give you more confidence going into the World Cup to help your nation<br /><br />Definitely, it gave me even more of a boost to go out there and enjoy my football. The new deal gave me a lot more confidence to say this is where I belong, this is where I want to play, this is where I want to help my team and to win trophies.<br /><br />Chelsea is one of the biggest football clubs in the world. I am happy here and enjoying it. I have always believed in myself. As a footballer it is essential to have that belief. I had been on loan three times. I always said to myself that I wanted to break into this team, to do the best I can for this football club.<br /><br />The right manager came in and recognised how hard I had worked. It isn’t just myself. The other lads who have been on loan have had their chances, all played games. I am pleased to see a manager that gives everyone an opportunity to express themselves and play football.<br /><br />Yes, it isn’t just me. Andreas Christensen has worked hard for himself and the manager has seen that as well. He is getting the opportunity to play and is doing well at the moment. It is good for a manager to believe in the ability that you’ve got and give you the confidence to go out and enjoy your football.<br /><br />He did it last season with me and is doing it this season. We had a manager that came here and gave everyone an opportunity to express themselves. In pre-season, I worked hard. He realised that straight away and he gave me the opportunity to express myself last season.<br /><br />I took the opportunity with both hands and then I didn’t look back. As a footballer, if you work hard, then everything else falls into place<br /><br /><b>[Michael Emenalo]</b> He is someone that has always believed in the ability that I have got. He has always stuck by me and he’s always believed that I am going to achieve something at this club. As you can see last season, I did the best I can to help my team-mates and to make sure that we win the league.<br /><br />He is someone who has always encouraged me to make sure I get to the next level. Even when I was on loan, he was always encouraging me, speaking to me. To make sure I am doing the right thing, making sure I am enjoying my football and making sure I reach my best level in the future.<br /><br />He believed that I had a future here at Chelsea. He helped me from the very first day that I got here so I want to wish him all the best in his career. I want to wish him and all his family the best as well</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Moses is out for at least another week]</b> The rehab has been going very well and hopefully I can just take my time to get myself as fit as possible to go back out there and enjoy my football again. It is always frustrating when you watch the lads and you want to go in there yourself to try to help, to do the best you can to help the lads. Apart from that, it is always frustrating to watch from the sidelines when you just want to go out there and play football. You have to be disciplined, you don’t get to spend much time with the players. I am always by myself with the physio, trying to concentrate on my rehab to get back as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Moses is hopeful he can have a positive impact on this season’s FA Cup final]</b> Yes, definitely, it was the worst feeling ever that I’ve experienced in my career, and in a final as well. I wanted to be on the pitch to help my team-mates. It played on my mind a little bit, but apart from that it’s happened and there’s nothing I can do about it. It would be a dream <b>[to score the winning goal]</b>, but the most important thing is that it’s all about the team and the team effort. We need to work hard, stick together and, hopefully, if we can do that, we can overcome anyone. I can’t rewind it back, to try and not get a red card, it is what it is, it’s football. We just want to get it right this time. We know we have Man United in the final, but it won’t be easy. If we can win it, it will be a great bonus, but we just want to finish strong.<br /><br />Every single one of us wants to stay disciplined and focused, and do what the manager asks of us on the pitch and make sure that we win. The most important thing is that we just have to motivate ourselves to win it. Obviously, last year, I got a red card, but we want to try and get it right this time. But that’s gone now, we have another final on May 19 against Manchester United to look forward to and we want to win it..<br /><br />Definitely, there is competition everywhere, good players everywhere, so whenever you start, you have got to enjoy it. If you take your foot off the gas, that’s you out. I just want to work hard, that’s the most important thing, help my team-mates, and win as many games as we can<br /><br />No, to be honest, I just want to play my football, it’s got nothing to do with Jose. It’s only about that I’m a Chelsea player, I want to win the final, that’s the most important thing</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Moses says he needed to play football after a lack of game time at Chelsea prompted an 18-month January loan move to Fenerbahce]</b> It’s tough, as Chelsea’s a very special place for me and I’ve always had a great relationship with the fans but it became very obvious that I was not in the manager’s plans. I have achieved great things there but I just needed to play football and that’s why I got the move to Fenerbahce.<br /><br />When I came here, everyone was a little bit shocked by the position they were in and that was the main reason why I came, as a big club like Fenerbahce should not be in a position like that.<br /><br />In the stadium the atmosphere is a lot different <b>[to England]</b>. It’s unlike anything I have ever experienced in football, every game is a must-win game and they are so passionate as they just want us to win and make everybody happy. It’s not just football, it’s a way of life here. It’s a massive experience, playing against Galatasaray and Besiktas, you can feel the atmosphere, it feels like the stadium is going to fall down due to the fans singing and bouncing. The atmosphere is amazing, you can easily tell the passion they’ve got for football here is crazy. They just love football and want the team to win, that’s why they support the team<br /><br />I am here with my wife and two kids. My kids are going to school here and my wife has settled down. It has made it a lot easier for me to go to work and come home to see the kids, it feels like I am still back in London</p>
