  <p><b>[Victor Moses, Nigeria international, is quickly making a name for himself at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>]</b> The three goals that I have scored so far have been great. We noticed that he was not really good at crosses and fortunately i scored from Mata’s corner kick.<br /><br /><b>[And with the game against <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> now very crucial]</b> As the games come now, all of them are like cup finals and we just have to take these games as they come and hopefully we will get the win again.</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Moses is relishing being a regular at Chelsea]</b> I’ve always wanted to play for this big club, it’s one of the best clubs in the world at the moment and I’m enjoying every single minute. I just want to keep on working hard and helping my team-mates out.<br /><br />We’re not looking at the table at the moment, we still have 12 matches to play and we just need to take each game as it comes. We just want to stay grounded and win as many games as we can between now and the end of the season. We’re going to stay focused and keep working hard together as a team, as everyone can see we’re doing</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea star Victor Moses has signed a new contract with the club that will take him through to 2021]</b> I feel very excited. I’m delighted to be here for another few years now and to sign a new deal. Now it’s time to concentrate on the team and keep working hard to make sure we win games and try to win the Premier League this season. We’re having a great season, I’m enjoying my football and we have a good manager here that has given every single one of us confidence. I just want to keep on enjoying it and working hard for the team</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Moses says he was not consulted by Antonio Conte before he started playing him as a right wing-back]</b> He didn’t say to me: ‘Do you fancy playing wing-back?’ He just put me in there. After that he just kept on encouraging me and went through it with me, what the position was all about, mostly in training. And constantly he was talking to me in training to make sure I was improving in it, talking me through it. I took that in and I didn’t look back. I have always believed in the ability that I have got. I have always known that I’ve got the ability to play in a big club like Chelsea. I have proved that. We have got a manager here that is willing to give everybody an opportunity.<br /><br />To be honest, I just wanted to play football. It was at Hull that it all started. I really enjoyed it and I took everything in. I kept watching the video of myself after the Hull game, to make sure I was in the right place, and after that I took it in and kept on improving.</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Moses has revealed that Chelsea have no specific plans to stop Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez in Saturday’s FA Cup]</b> I haven’t got a plan to stop him! He’s had a great season, he’s done well for Arsenal but whether he’s injured or not we’re just going to play our football. We came back to training on Tuesday and we want to get ourselves ready. It’s going to be a very hard game for us on Saturday. Arsenal are a good team with good players that can win them games. But we’re just concentrating on ourselves at the moment, working hard in training and hopefully we’ll go and do the job.<br /><br />We’ve got the league title and they’re going to want to win because they missed out on top four. We’re going to try and stop them because we want the double. We don’t feel any pressure. If he <b>[Antonio Conte]</b> says Arsenal are the favourites, then… I don’t know, but we’ve got good players that can win us games. We think we’re good enough to beat Arsenal but it’s not going to be an easy game.<br /><br /><b>[Conte switched formations after the loss]</b> Yeah, we still think about it. We lost two games in a row against Liverpool and Arsenal. We felt very sad after that game but we played them at Stamford Bridge and won 3-1. We beat them once and they beat us once. They’re going to want revenge but we’ll stick to our tactics and try and make sure we win<br /><br />Yeah, it’s my first time <b>[playing in an FA Cup final]</b>. I’m looking forward to it so that’ll be a great honour for me. It’s a massive cup and everyone knows about it in England and all over the world so everyone’s going to be watching the final. It would be a great achievement for me <b>[to win it]</b>. We’ve got a new manager here who’s willing to give everyone an opportunity. He gave me that opportunity and I didn’t look back after that. I’m very pleased with that and I just want to keep improving in every game I play. It’s a new role for me and I’m still getting used to it. It’s the last game of the season on Saturday and hopefully next season we’ll continue from here</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Moses speaks about the Super Eagles’ World Cup draw pairing them with Argentina, Iceland and Croatia]</b> We keep getting Argentina for some reason. We don’t want to play against <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, but it is what it is. We’ve got to go and play our football and see what happens. After what Iceland did last year <b>[beating England in the last 16 of the Euros]</b>, football nowadays, there’s no easy game. Argentina are going to be scared of us as well. It’s all about football at the end of the day</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Moses is hopeful he can have a positive impact on this season’s FA Cup final]</b> Yes, definitely, it was the worst feeling ever that I’ve experienced in my career, and in a final as well. I wanted to be on the pitch to help my team-mates. It played on my mind a little bit, but apart from that it’s happened and there’s nothing I can do about it. It would be a dream <b>[to score the winning goal]</b>, but the most important thing is that it’s all about the team and the team effort. We need to work hard, stick together and, hopefully, if we can do that, we can overcome anyone. I can’t rewind it back, to try and not get a red card, it is what it is, it’s football. We just want to get it right this time. We know we have Man United in the final, but it won’t be easy. If we can win it, it will be a great bonus, but we just want to finish strong.<br /><br />Every single one of us wants to stay disciplined and focused, and do what the manager asks of us on the pitch and make sure that we win. The most important thing is that we just have to motivate ourselves to win it. Obviously, last year, I got a red card, but we want to try and get it right this time. But that’s gone now, we have another final on May 19 against Manchester United to look forward to and we want to win it..<br /><br />Definitely, there is competition everywhere, good players everywhere, so whenever you start, you have got to enjoy it. If you take your foot off the gas, that’s you out. I just want to work hard, that’s the most important thing, help my team-mates, and win as many games as we can<br /><br />No, to be honest, I just want to play my football, it’s got nothing to do with Jose. It’s only about that I’m a Chelsea player, I want to win the final, that’s the most important thing</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Moses says he needed to play football after a lack of game time at Chelsea prompted an 18-month January loan move to Fenerbahce]</b> It’s tough, as Chelsea’s a very special place for me and I’ve always had a great relationship with the fans but it became very obvious that I was not in the manager’s plans. I have achieved great things there but I just needed to play football and that’s why I got the move to Fenerbahce.<br /><br />When I came here, everyone was a little bit shocked by the position they were in and that was the main reason why I came, as a big club like Fenerbahce should not be in a position like that.<br /><br />In the stadium the atmosphere is a lot different <b>[to England]</b>. It’s unlike anything I have ever experienced in football, every game is a must-win game and they are so passionate as they just want us to win and make everybody happy. It’s not just football, it’s a way of life here. It’s a massive experience, playing against Galatasaray and Besiktas, you can feel the atmosphere, it feels like the stadium is going to fall down due to the fans singing and bouncing. The atmosphere is amazing, you can easily tell the passion they’ve got for football here is crazy. They just love football and want the team to win, that’s why they support the team<br /><br />I am here with my wife and two kids. My kids are going to school here and my wife has settled down. It has made it a lot easier for me to go to work and come home to see the kids, it feels like I am still back in London</p>

I’ve spoken to him and he’s already explained the club’s project to me. I want to be part of it, I’m happy to be here. I’ll give my all and want to help the team. There’s a lot of quality here, I want to make my contribution out on the pitch and enjoy myself. That’s the most important thing<br /><br /><b>[On the city of Milan]</b> It seems like a nice city, I’ve liked what I’ve seen up to now. I think I’ll enjoy it here and we’ll have a great future together. I have positive feelings. I’m going to need time to find my feet but I want to help the team win as many games as possible. We’ll do all that we can to achieve our objectives and make our fans proud</p>
