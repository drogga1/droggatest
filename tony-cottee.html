  <p><b>[West Ham legend Tony Cottee says Manchester rivals United and City would want Declan Rice]</b> I do like him <b>[Rice]</b> as a centre-back. I think he will end up there. That’s what you are buying. You’re buying a holding midfielder player, but you are also buying a player that can play centre-half in a back four and in a back three as well. So, you are getting a really, really top player. I am sure <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> would want him. I am sure <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> would want him in that holding role, though they have just bought <a href="rodri.html">Rodri</a>. Of course, let’s not forget, he did grow up as a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fan. Maybe once their embargo <b>[is lifted]</b>, they’ll be looking as well. There are many, many teams that will be interested in Dec, but I want him to stay at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>. And to do that they need to win <b>[a]</b> cup or get into Europe.<br /><br /><b>[Phil <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a> is not getting the necessary game time to further his development]</b> I’m really frustrated with <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a>. He is an unbelievable, outstanding young footballer but he’s got to play! If you’re sitting on the bench, yes people will say he’s training with the first team, but it’s not the same as playing. You have to get the game time and experience. He needs to play. This is a big season for him, and he’s not playing!<br /><br />If I was <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a>, I would be banging on that door every single week and saying, ‘I want to play and if you’re not going to play me, I’m going out on loan’. The young lad <a href="bobby-duncan.html">Bobby Duncan</a> has just left <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> because he wants to play football - these young kids have to play, they’ve got to learn they’re trade and <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a> is not learning it on the bench. He’s 19 now and your career goes so quickly. You need to be in the first team and you’ve got to be playing.<br /><br />I understand it’s a great team and who does he replace, I understand that, but he’s such a wonderful talent. I think <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a> has a place in that England team. We talk about the balance of that midfield and needing a creative player and <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a> is that. He’s an outstanding talent and we need him in that England team. But unless he’s playing, which he’s not, he’s not going to get in it</p>

  <p><b>[Tony Cottee is worried that his former club will struggle to hold on to <a href="declan-rice.html">Declan Rice</a> in the long term]</b> In terms of where he will be in two or three seasons, a lot depends on <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> and where they go. They need stability. For any player in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, it is not about the money as such. Players get good money whether they are at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> nowadays. It comes down to two things; can <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> get into Europe or win cups? It is getting harder and harder even to win the cups. Realistically, they can’t win the league or get in the Champions League at the moment. It will come down to a personal decision for Dec: does he want to win cups or play in Europe? I got frustrated at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> because I got frustrated after the 1986 season <b>[where <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> were close to winning the league]</b>. I left to try and chase glory and European football with <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. Ultimately, I didn’t succeed. I didn’t achieve what I wanted to but you reach that crossroads. No <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> fan wants him to leave and I don’t want him to leave. But your career does go so quickly. You have only 15 years to do what you can</p>
