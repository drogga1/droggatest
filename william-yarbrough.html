<blockquote>
  <p>[William Yarbrough aims for Leon revival to spark USMNT return] Obviously, Rodolfo is an excellent goalkeeper. I’ve known him for several years, since the Pachuca youth system. Whatever player comes to this club to make it better is welcome. In this case, the question of the goal comes up. The competition is really good. It makes both of us grow and makes sure Club Leon’s goal is in good hands. [The competition] is really important, that’s good. Personally, I’ve grown as a person and also on the field. As long as the competition is healthy like it is right now, it’s welcomed.<br /><br />I’m a person who lives in the day-to-day, who lives in the present. In the last few weeks, I got back the starting spot. Now the idea is to stay in that spot and with that the national team could come from there. I know that they’re watching me, but I have to be playing [with Leon] and getting positive results to be called to the national team again. Right now, I’m 100 percent focused on Club Leon, focused on my present here because I know that what I do here will determine if I’m called there<br /><br />I think it’s a really intelligent federation. They’ve taken their time making this decision because they’re thinking about a long-term project. I applaud that, that they’re believing in the process, believing in the long-term. They’ve called in really young players, important players. What’s important is that whoever comes in has the time to work with the national team. If they have to speak English or not, that’s not my decision. Those decisions are made by the federation, by the higher-ups, but I’m calm in knowing that the decision they make will be the right one</p>
