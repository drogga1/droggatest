  <p><b>[<a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> starlet Dejan Kulusevski set for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> medical]</b> I like to have the ball at my feet. I used to dribble a lot when I was a kid but I have got better at moving the ball more quickly. I have developed my defensive game, that was a weakness before, and that has made me a more complete player</p>

  <p><b>[New <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> signing Dejan Kulusevski says he chose a move to <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a> over Inter for tactical reasons]</b> Exactly. With <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>, the movements are different in terms of the tactical set-up. And I had doubts about that. <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> was nice, he put me at ease. I knew his <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> team and his style of play. This is also why I chose Juventus<br /><br /><b>[Speaking about the day he signed for <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>]</b> What a thrill that day at the stadium was - a unique atmosphere. And <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> said to me ‘welcome Dejan, how are you?’ (Gianluigi) <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a> and (Giorgio) <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Chiellini</a> were also nice to me. It was an immense joy for a boy who had only seen them on TV. I can’t wait to link up with (Paulo) <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> and his magical left foot. In any case, I now know how to play in multiple roles and I plan to carve out a spot for myself in <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a> too.<br /><br /><b>[Kulusevski is grateful to <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> for giving him the chance of regular first-team football]</b> In the summer, when the sporting director <a href="daniele-faggiano.html">Faggiano</a> and (Parma head coach Roberto) D’Aversa offered me this opportunity, they showed great confidence in me. It has been an extraordinary season for me and I want to close it well<br /><br />My debut at <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a> against Inter - a magnificent stadium. I looked calm but at half-time I threw up from the stress. It was an unforgettable 2-2 draw</p>

He entered the pitch with an incredible personality, even though it was his first professional game. I said to my dad that I wanted to be like that, I wanted play that way. I got attached to that number, read a few things and fell in love<br /><br /><b>[on Kevin De Bruyne]</b> He is one of the top five players in the world. I study him a lot because he is a phenomenal player and because I want to become like him. One of my habits is to watch many games, because I learn a lot from my colleagues</p>
