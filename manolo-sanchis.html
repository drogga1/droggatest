  <p><b>[Madrid lucky to have <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> but Di Stefano comparisons are pointless]</b> Is <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> reaching Di Stefano’s importance in Real’s history? Comparisons are pointless. I had very professional team-mates in 18 seasons as a player. And the ones I’m seeing now as a spectator, and the ones I saw when I was little, too. Imagine how many players I have seen. And now we’re thinking that one is going to be better than another – why?<br /><br />It is clear that <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is among the greatest in club history and in this sport. But why say if one player is better or worse than <a href="alfredo-di-stefano.html">Alfredo Di Stefano</a>, or better or worse than <a href="emilio-butragueno.html">Emilio Butragueno</a>, Amancio Amaro? It is clear that <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is among the greatest in club history and in this sport. But why say if one player is better or worse than <a href="alfredo-di-stefano.html">Alfredo Di Stefano</a>, or better or worse than <a href="emilio-butragueno.html">Emilio Butragueno</a>, Amancio Amaro?<br /><br /><b>[It is clear that <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is among the greatest in club history and in this sport.

But it’s also about where and when it happens: against <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, against <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a>, and with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> pushing and losing 0-1 on the scoreboard<br /><br />It’s an important goal at an important moment, and in the best place to get it. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> got a great result and it was the demonstration of how a player is capable of influencing what happens in a match on his own. In Madrid, we are lucky to have <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> with us.<br /><br />How to explain <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s DNA in the Champions League? It’s something that new investors in this sport, people who come from being very successful in other business activities, do not understand properly. They are used to being able to buy practically everything with money. But not this. You cannot buy the 116 years of history that <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> has, nor the legacy that so many superb players have left</p>
