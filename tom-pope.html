  <p><b>[Tom Pope quipped that he thought City’s players game him a wide berth for his comments when he went to swap shirts after the match]</b> I managed to get Oleksandr Zinchenko’s - the rest of them pied me off. I never dreamed I would score and would have been happy to have a few touches</p>

  <p><b>[The last thing <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a> wanted to see during <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>’s FA Cup clash with Port Vale was Tom Pope wheeling away in celebration]</b> I’d just like to say I was completely wrong and bang out of order to say I’d score 40 a season ….. it’s more like 50<br /><br /><b>[Stones didn’t appear to see the funny side of the attention]</b> I don’t think he’s happy. We went in the dressing room after and I spoke to <a href="benjamin-mendy.html">Benjamin Mendy</a> and he said the lads have abused him for weeks, so I think it’s played on his mind a little bit. So I don’t think he was overly happy, no. It was like the Grim Reaper going in, they all ran the other way<br /><br /><b>[Pope’s more realistic assessment, he was praised as being far better than the striker claimed in his banterous judgement on social media]</b> Well you can’t get near him. I think I had one cross and scored one goal, but that was it. He’s just so good on the ball, he makes it look easy and it’s difficult to press them when you’ve got 10 men behind the ball, so it’s very hard to try and have an impact, offensively, when you’ve got so many players on the edge of your own box. They’re different class. That’s why they’ve won <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> the past two years and it was a difficult afternoon for us</p>
