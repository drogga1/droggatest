  <p><b>[<a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> Starlet Ciro Immobile Pleased With Seasonal Debut]</b> Yes, I was really fired up and I am happy because I did my job. Of course, I also hoped to grab a goal. I went close with that header. And then after some good play, my shot was blocked by their defenders. But I am still happy because the team won. I have been in the squad for the past three games now. I was not overly excited and my legs were not shaking. I was more excited when I debuted against Bologna</p>

  <p><b>[Ciro Immobile finally broke his drought for Italy, scoring his first international goal in two years to give his side a 59th-minute lead]</b> It was weighing on me so much, not scoring with this jersey. So much has been said over the last two years, but I was calm and knew my moment would come. People always tried to cause controversy around me, including with the coach, but there was no issue there. It wasn’t easy to get a victory here, but after the disappointment of <b>[failing to qualify for]</b> the World Cup, we are back on track with Italy</p>

I hope they can do the same at the Euros. We’re curious to see who we get in the draw and will all be in front of the TV. We’re a great group, we’ve got the belief, the quality and everything it takes to do well. We’ve proved we can do good things over the last two months and I hope that we can win something next summer. This team deserves it and I thank the coach for giving me the opportunity to play with them</p>

He’s a guy that deserves it for everything he gives us. I had already left one for <a href="felipe.html">Felipe</a> Caicedo and <a href="joaquin.html">Joaquin</a> Correa, so only Luis was missing. The important thing is that he unlocks himself with a goal and not only all of the assists. Everyone deserves to score and to play because of how we’re training. We’re a very united group<br /><br /><b>[When coach <a href="simone-inzaghi.html">Simone Inzaghi</a> elected to replace him midway through the second half, Immobile was visibly furious]</b> It’s obvious that there are sometimes moments of disagreement, as with all people that you love.

We met at the wrong time in our careers at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> and I wish he’d been able to work with the real Ciro. Despite that, we were still able to win the DFB-Supercup. We feel proud, that’s the right word, of the way people are talking about <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a>. It shows that hard work does pay off. As team-mates, we really just get along and like spending time together, enjoy each other’s company. We’ve been able to build a family unit here. At times we have a go at each other, but that’s only natural, we make up and everything is even better than before. We started from pre-season training with so many dreams, now we are enjoying ourselves. We are a family chasing a dream</p>

Everyone has their own. It would be nice. It’s like the Easter egg. We’ll see what the surprise will be when we get back on the field. I’ll do my best.<br /><br />The ambitions remain.

  <p><b>[Ciro Immobile believes that Emery was the main culprit for making his <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> stay fall flat]</b> I felt bad, I didn’t have many chances. In January I thought of leaving but Emery asked me to stay.

Let’s just say that when you don’t feel like part of a group, everything is useless<br /><br /><b>[He may have had to replace a club legend like Germany idol <a href="miroslav-klose.html">Miroslav Klose</a>, but the striker could not wait to move to Rome]</b> I wanted the Biancocelesti at all costs, I was happy.

I knew that he’d forgive me, but it wasn’t right to show that reaction to people. <a href="simone-inzaghi.html">Inzaghi</a> managed it very well, benching me against Inter was right.
