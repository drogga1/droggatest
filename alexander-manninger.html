  <p><b>[Alexander Manninger was fill in admirably and the former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> custodian has claimed he is ready to do so again]</b> If <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a> had to leave <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, I would be ready to replace him. My goal has always been to play. I do not feel and have never felt like the twelfth man here. I hope to remain at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> for a long time</p>

  <p><b>[Alexander Manninger is preparing to make his first appearance of the season for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> against Catania this weekend as he replaces undisputed first choice <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Gianluigi Buffon</a>, who is recovering from meniscus surgery]</b> Yes, I am a second choice but only compared to ‘Gigi’. Still, with such a shot-stopper ahead of me, I can’t have any pretensions. I can only learn from him, even though I am now edging closer to quitting football.<br /><br /><b>[The 32-year-old has been at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> since 2008 and the <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a> are going through one of their most difficult patches since his arrival, losing two games on the trot between <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> and the Champions League]</b> In these moments you can see the solidity of a team. We will get out of this very soon</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus goalkeeper Alexander Manninger has insisted that the <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a>’s <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> title hopes are still alive after their hard-fought 2-1 win away to <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> on Wednesday brought an end to a dismal run of five defeats in six outings]</b> We needed that kind of different start to the new year, because three straight defeats are unacceptable at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>. We played well at Bari and yet we lost. We did fairly well against Catania but conceded a goal three minutes from time to lose 2-1. That’s why we really needed a victory and this will boost our morale<br /><br /><b>[Second-placed Milan travel to the Olimpico this weekend and <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> have a chance to move back into second place and continue their chase of leaders Inter, who are nine points ahead of the Turin giants at the top of the table]</b> Milan are in fine form, but we have now rediscovered our grit and it showed at <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a>. Our chances to catch up with Inter are twenty, because that’s how many games are left to play. We will try and win them all. We can’t make any more mistakes.</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus goalkeeper Alexander Manninger has insisted that the <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a> will not settle for a draw when they travel to <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> tomorrow night]</b> We want to win, simple as that. We will go for it with all our energy. I liked it in Florence and got along well with the people and the fans. It’s a city that lives for football and anxiously awaits this clash. It is a showpiece event in Florence which takes them back 20 years when they were fighting to win the title. Their fans keenly feel this game</p>

  <p><b>[Despite Sunday’s home defeat to Palermo, <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> appear to have turned the tide in the league since Alberto Zaccheroni took over from <a href="ciro-ferrara.html">Ciro Ferrara</a> at the end of January]</b> Well, I could never compare the two of themFerrara was a gamble, one that we unfortunately lost. We are talking about a coach who was a rookie. While Zaccheroni is a safe bet. He is competent and I’m sure we’ll be successful. We want a top-four finish and will try and win the Europa League</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus Keeper Alex Manninger Rues ‘Dirty’ Fulham Goal]</b> It was a bad situation, a dirty goal. It’s a loose ball, your opponent shoots, it hits something, a knee or an ankle, and it goes into the corner. Unfortunately, it happens. Unfortunately, it went in. But we reacted very well by netting a third goal and seeing out this home clash very well, because we know that it will be a bit of a war in London</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool goalkeeper Manninger announces retirement]</b> I thought about it a couple of months ago and I was keen to decide myself, not wait again for the summer and whether I receive a phone call or not. I tried to listen to myself, to my body, and then I said ‘no, that is enough’. I did not want to go too far and let my body decide, or the phone decide if it does not ring, so that is why I came to the decision of that being it for me. I feel good, I finished at a high level I never dreamed of. If I played for big clubs at my peak, that is one thing, but to have had this experience now with the staff, coaches and players of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is fantastic. I have had one of the greatest experiences in my career here, but it is time</p>
