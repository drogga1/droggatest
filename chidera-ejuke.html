  <p><b>[Heerenveen winger Chidera Ejuke has opened up on how he missed a chance to feature for <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> giants, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> four years ago]</b> When I was just 18-years-old and still living in Nigeria, there was a scouting programme on the other side of the country. I was picked out together with three peers by a scout from England. We were allowed to have a trial at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. It was the first time that I left my country and then also for an internship in my dream competition. We were warmly welcomed at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. We did an internship there for a few weeks, it went pretty well, but I probably wasn’t good enough. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was not interested and so we had to return to Nigeria. That was just as tough. This was the opportunity I had been dreaming about all these years and if it doesn’t work out, it’s bitter. It felt like I had let down my agent and my family. If I had taken that chance, it would have been a different story, but it was a good experience. That missed opportunity became a source of motivation for me and it helped me grow as a player. I had tasted Europe and now I wanted more.</p>
