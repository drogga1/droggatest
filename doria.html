<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Marseille defender Doria has hailed Dimitri Payet is one of the best players in the world]</b> Payet is one of the best players in the world. I already knew him from my first spell. He’s a very funny guy, and he’s a determined player with a lot of technique. I’m glad to see him come back. Mainly, I’m glad that he succeeded after leaving and then returned while still at the same level. I think it’s important<br /><br />I think everyone realises we have a better chance of finishing in a better position with players who already have international experience, who have already been champions with their national teams and at big clubs. I think the fact that <b>[Payet and Evra]</b> are part of the group solidifies our team. And we recognise that we can get even further than we originally imagined<br /><br />We can see with the recruitment of Evra and Payet that the new owners came to change things and achieve great victories. I believe the change also came with the new coach. The difference is his mentality, he wants to win all the time and passes it to the players. We want to be champions of France and to be back in the Champions League. This is the most important over the next five years</p>
