  <p><b>[Dominik Szoboszlai says We are going to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> to win]</b> <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> has opened a new chapter in the club’s history. They are great to watch and I am very much looking forward to facing them at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. It is a historically huge club - their dramatic win versus <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> (in the 2005 Champions League final) was definitely impressive. Their whole squad is great but <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> is someone special. They are a top team with an unbelievable coach leading them. <b>[The Premier League]</b> is one of the best leagues in the world now, without question. We will do our best at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> and try to play for a win. We have a lot of confidence in ourselves. We are a young, highly-motivated team with a lot of quality and good characters. That makes us very strong and unique. I’m sure that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is very much aware of that<br /><br />Every child today starts to play football with the dream of playing in this competition at least once. Besides the Hungarian national team, playing in the Champions League was one of my biggest targets. It is fantastic to have achieved it at just 18. Scoring is always great. It doesn’t matter where. I don’t think I could’ve dreamt about a better Champions League debut. Our club is fantastic - people don’t even realise how much yet. Our first game was incredible, but we still need to improve to compete with the biggest teams in Europe. We are in a very good way, facing the upcoming challenges with full confidence. We don’t really plan things that much ahead <b>[in terms of targets in the competition]</b>. We want to show our qualities and achieve as much as possible in every competition<br /><br /><b>[Szoboszlai’s debut display in Europe’s top club competition immediately led to speculation that he could be set for a transfer in the near future]</b> I am not really looking that far ahead now. I am focusing on the next game and try to develop as much as I can from day to day. That is my absolute priority now. All of the other stuff belongs to my agent. I am lucky enough to be able to focus only on playing football<br /><br /><b>[Szoboszlai is expecting big things from <a href="erling-haland.html">Erling Braut Haaland</a> in the future]</b> <a href="erling-haland.html">Erling Braut Haaland</a> is a great player with a huge character. I have no doubts about his future. For me he is, more importantly, a great team-mate and a big friend. Our new system fits our squad perfectly. I think that’s visible on the pitch. We enjoy the games, that’s the most important factor leading to success</p>

  <p><b>[The Robin to <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a>’s Batman, playmaker Dominik Szoboszlai is far smaller in stature than his imposing team-mate, but their relationship within the final third has been key to Salzburg’s dominance domestically so far this season]</b> <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> is a great player with a huge character. I have no doubts about his future. For me he is, more importantly, a great team-mate and a big friend<br /><br /><b>[Szoboszlai, though, insists that he is not thinking about leaving Salzburg at the moment]</b> I am not really looking that far ahead. I am focusing on the next game and try to develop as much as I can from day to day. That is my absolute priority now. All of the other stuff belongs to my agent.
