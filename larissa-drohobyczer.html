<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Ronaldo urged to hand over evidence after claim key documents were fabricated in rape allegation]</b> We thank Cristiano Ronaldo’s latest lawyer for confirming and admitting in his October 10, 2018 statement that the ‘Football Leaks’ documents were obtained from Cristiano Ronaldo or individuals acting on his behalf.<br /><br />We look forward to reviewing any evidence that tends to prove, as Mr Ronaldo’s lawyer asserts, that some of the ‘Football Leaks’ documents were altered, fabricated, or contain false/inaccurate information.<br /><br />In both civil and criminal cases, disputes regarding the accuracy of documents are generally questions of fact to be decided by the jury. A jury determines the accuracy of disputed documents by: 1) Comparing of the different versions of the disputed documents; 2) Listening to the testimony of the individuals who wrote, prepared, transmitted, and stored the disputed documents; 3) Considering the circumstances under which the documents were written, prepared, transmitted, stored and maintained; and 4) Listening to the testimony of forensic experts who have examined the disputed documents, and the devices upon which the documents were written, prepared, transmitted, and stored.<br /><br />In a civil case, discovery is conducted to obtain evidence regarding these matters through the exchange of disputed documents, the forensic examination of disputed documents and devices, and the examination of witnesses under oath. In criminal cases, the prosecutors rely upon investigator’s review of disputed documents, the forensic examination of devices and disputed documents, and questioning of witnesses.<br /><br />Any document or information under the control or in the possession of Cristiano Ronaldo should be immediately turned over to the appropriate law enforcement agencies and the offices of Stovall &amp; Associates to expedite the investigation and resolution of the alleged discrepancies in the ‘Football Leaks’ documents</p>
