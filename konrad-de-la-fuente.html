  <p><b>[At La Masia, De la Fuente has been given a footballing education unlike any in the world, all while growing up in close proximity to a rotating cast of legendary figures, including perhaps the greatest to ever play the game]</b> It was a dream. Every weekend I would be watching <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a>, he was my idol. At the time he was playing at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. I was like, ‘Man, I would wanna get there’, you know? I have always dreamed and worked hard since I was a little kid to make it come true<br /><br />Once we came here, I always knew that this was a great opportunity for me to get scouted. I knew they had scouts all over the place. It was just a matter of me playing well and them seeing me. I’m glad I got the chance<br /><br /><b>[Konrad De la Fuente’s dream]</b> In the near future, I want to become a professional player as soon as possible. In the long term, I want to win a World Cup with the USA and be the best player in the world</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> winger De La Fuente sees Lakers star as biggest influence]</b> My favorite player is LeBron. He’s my idol. I’m just a LeBron fan, probably the biggest fan in the world. I play basketball as a hobby, and I’m not that good at it, but it’s incredible how much I like him. I just like the way he plays, his work ethic, how he is off the field, his ambition to improve even though he is the best. It’s incredible and I really admire it. Even though I am not a basketball player, but I want to be like that in the soccer world. In that sense, <b>[he’s a bigger influence than <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> for me]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[Like any <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> up-and-comer, the American looks up to the Argentinian star and recalls how nervous he was the first time he got to meet <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> in person]</b> He <b>[<a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>]</b> was having an interview at La Masia and I was there. When the interview was over I went to go take a picture of him.<br /><br />And as I’m walking up to him – I’m with two of my other friends – I’m like ‘Oh, it’s <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, it’s great.’ I’m like almost shaking. And I asked him if I could take a picture and he goes: ‘Yeah,’ and I have my phone in my hand, and I’m looking down at my hand is trembling<br /><br />It was crazy. I’ve never felt like that in my life. It’s not that I’m used to <b>[seeing <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> now]</b> but I still get a little starstruck but not like that. The first time I trained with the first team, I got into the locker room and I turned to go into it and run into someone. And I looked and I see it’s <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. I said: ‘Hi,’ and shook his hand and everything. And then as I walked past him I said: ‘Oh my God I just <b>[ran into]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>.’ But there was just that moment and that’s it. And then it was just normal</p>
