  <p><b>[Fran Kirby speaks about the Lionesses’ aspirations at <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Women’s EURO 2017]</b> It’s about knowing that pressure and dealing with that pressure. Even against Germany in the match for third place, it was that pressure of ‘if we don’t win this game, we go home without a medal’. Awfully, we did get knocked out in the semi-finals and we know how much that hurts. We don’t want that to happen again</p>

  <p><b>[England midfielder Fran Kirby described Lucy Bronze as ‘one of the best players in the world’ after she starred in the Lionesses’ 3-0 win over Norway in the Women’s World Cup quarter-finals]</b> Lucy is absolutely fantastic, one of the best players in the world. It’s fantastic to have her on our team. When she gets the ball and she’s driving with it, there’s not many that can stop her. If she continues to play as she has done throughout the tournament, it’s exciting for us.<br /><br />Lucy has been consistent throughout her career and to have someone like that in your team, who can grab the game by the scruff of the neck and do one of those powerful drives forward is exciting. It’s the way we want to play. When she is scoring goals like that, you just have to bow down to her. She’s absolutely one of the best players in the world<br /><br /><b>[But, while reaching yet another semi-final is a fantastic achievement, Kirby doesn’t want to dwell on that]</b> We want to go one better. We’ve been to two semi-finals and we don’t want to feel that hurt again. We can’t focus on being in three semi-finals. We need to go one better, get to that final and come away with a World Cup winners’ medal. This team is onto something special. It’s really exciting to be a part of. We have to build momentum and we’re doing that game-by-game</p>
