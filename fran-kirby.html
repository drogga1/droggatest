<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Fran Kirby speaks about the Lionesses’ aspirations at <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Women’s EURO 2017]</b> It’s about knowing that pressure and dealing with that pressure. Even against Germany in the match for third place, it was that pressure of ‘if we don’t win this game, we go home without a medal’. Awfully, we did get knocked out in the semi-finals and we know how much that hurts. We don’t want that to happen again</p>
