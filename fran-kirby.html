  <p><b>[Fran Kirby speaks about the Lionesses’ aspirations at <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Women’s EURO 2017]</b> It’s about knowing that pressure and dealing with that pressure. Even against Germany in the match for third place, it was that pressure of ‘if we don’t win this game, we go home without a medal’. Awfully, we did get knocked out in the semi-finals and we know how much that hurts. We don’t want that to happen again</p>

  <p><b>[Fran Kirby burst onto the international scene at the 2015 Women’s World Cup in Canada]</b> I didn’t have much international experience going into the last World Cu. I probably didn’t relax and enjoy it as much as I should have, I was quite new to the team still and trying to find my feet a little bit. <b>[This time]</b> I’m just going to go out there, enjoy it, play my heart out and hopefully come away with a trophy!<br /><br />I just want to play as well as I can. If I get the comparisons, that’s great, but I want to be Fran Kirb. That’s the most important thing. I want to make sure I’m a role model for young girls and play the best I can for my team and my country<br /><br />It’s what every kid dreams of, winning a World Cup for your country. There’s nothing that will ever, ever beat that or even compare to it<br /><br />Women’s sport is growing, becoming powerful, and we want to continue to raise that platform for the young girls at home. We want them to see that you can have a career <b>[in sport]</b> and it can be a really, really good career</p>

  <p><b>[England midfielder Fran Kirby described <a href="lucy-bronze.html">Lucy Bronze</a> as ‘one of the best players in the world’ after she starred in the Lionesses’ 3-0 win over Norway in the Women’s World Cup quarter-finals]</b> Lucy is absolutely fantastic, one of the best players in the world. It’s fantastic to have her on our team. When she gets the ball and she’s driving with it, there’s not many that can stop her. If she continues to play as she has done throughout the tournament, it’s exciting for us.<br /><br />Lucy has been consistent throughout her career and to have someone like that in your team, who can grab the game by the scruff of the neck and do one of those powerful drives forward is exciting. It’s the way we want to play. When she is scoring goals like that, you just have to bow down to her. She’s absolutely one of the best players in the world<br /><br /><b>[But, while reaching yet another semi-final is a fantastic achievement, Kirby doesn’t want to dwell on that]</b> We want to go one better. We’ve been to two semi-finals and we don’t want to feel that hurt again. We can’t focus on being in three semi-finals. We need to go one better, get to that final and come away with a World Cup winners’ medal. This team is onto something special. It’s really exciting to be a part of. We have to build momentum and we’re doing that game-by-game</p>
