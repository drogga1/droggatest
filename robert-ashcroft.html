  <p><b>[Adidas Predator 18 pushes boundaries of boot innovation once more]</b> Football has changed considerably since Predator’s first introduction, both on and off the pitch. The demands are a lot higher now, consumer tastes have changed completely and playing styles have evolved. Innovation and materials have taken centre stage, so naturally the requirements of a football boot are a lot more complex<br /><br />The game has become a lot faster, so lightweight has now become a pre-requisite across all boot types. The biggest challenge is ensuring we deliver innovative materials that give the relevant fit and support without compromising overall performance or weight. From a design perspective all of our concepts are born from culture, they are built for purpose yet have to remain daringly simple in their execution. So the main challenge we face today is trying to find a balance between all of these key facets. With Predator 18 we feel we have delivered just that, a modern take on a true classic which meets all the demands of the modern game<br /><br /><b>[The 2018 World Cup in Russia was a prime example of how Adidas delved into the past]</b> Remixing the past and combining this with the future to maintain a specific product DNA which builds on its past and meets the demands of the modern game. Predator has a very deep-rooted status in the word of football, representing some of the most iconic players and iconic moments over the past 25 years. We wanted to stay true to its roots and ensure we maintained a lot of that DNA in both our product design and also colour stories<br /><br />We understand that players have different needs, different playing styles and different mindsets, which is why we offer different product franchises and different colour combinations to meet all of those variables. Whilst playing styles have evolved, so have consumer tastes and what is deemed interesting or desirable. The Predator has been a huge catalyst of this change, gradually introducing a lot more colour in a time when black and white was seen as traditional and simply accepted as the norm. Given that the game has changed considerably and we now see a more diverse spectrum of playing styles and player types, there is a clear need to utilise a more diverse colour palette in order to further compliment these variables<br /><br />Being built for purpose is the foundation we use for all of our product concepts, so with that we understand there is a broad spectrum of player types who have different requirements and different playing styles. You only need to look at Messi on the pitch to see he has a playing style different to most and therefore will have different performance needs. Predator is designed to deliver 360-degree control, so it is aimed at those players who base a lot of their game on this aspect. It is not specific to a position on a field, but more specific to how they perform on pitch and the playing style they adopt. Mesut Ozil and Pogba are prime examples of this, both of them showcasing the ability and desire to constantly control the ball and dictate play, whether it be controlling the ball out of the air or playing that killer cross field pass that stretches a team and opens up a defence</p>
