  <p><b>[Diego Lainez and Roberto Alvarado look to convert from Mexico’s future to Mexico’s present]</b> Happy for my debut, and even better that it came on my birthday. I can’t think of a better gift, but this result wasn’t positive for us. At the same time, I’m going home happy and will keep working to get better<br /><br />We’re always talking and have been waiting for this moment. Now we have to enjoy it, have fun with it, obviously with respect, and we have to take advantage of this moment to keep being kept in mind for each call-up</p>

  <p><b>[Tata Martino accomplishes Mexico mission with big wins]</b> I think we have only been a few days, but, yeah, we’ve understood the manager’s style of play. I think everyone worked really well and did things as well as possible. That’s what the manager really is asking for.</p>

  <p><b>[Jonathan dos Santos’ MOTM showing vs. Paraguay adds to Mexico midfield logjam]</b> I feel that the competition there is now is really good, really healthy. I think my teammates, whoever is asked, is going to do things well. If you’re not, you’re going to support the whole group. I think that’s important, that there can be a healthy competition and it’s going to help us a lot.</p>
