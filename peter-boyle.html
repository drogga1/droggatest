<blockquote>
  <p>Dr <a href="pavin-chachavalpongpun.html">Pavin Chachavalpongpun</a> is an associate professor at the Centre for Southeast Asian Studies at Kyoto University. He has authored several books including Reinventing Thailand: Thaksin and His Foreign Policy and the forthcoming Coup, King, Crisis: Time of a Critical Interregnum in Thailand. Since 2014 he has been branded an ‘enemy of the state’ by Thai authorities<br /><br /><a href="pavin-chachavalpongpun.html">Pavin Chachavalpongpun</a> was forced to seek political asylum in Japan. Yet, even with this protection, he told Green Left Weekly that he is not safe from the Thai regime’s violent persecution of dissidents<br /><br />At about 4am on July 8, a man dressed in black broke into <a href="pavin-chachavalpongpun.html">Pavin Chachavalpongpun</a>’s apartment in Kyoto and attacked him and his partner with a chemical spray. They confronted the attacker, who then fled. Pavin believes the attack was ordered by the Thai government because of his criticism of the monarchy<br /><br />In May, Thai dissident Praphan Pipithnamporn, who had fled to Malaysia, was deported back to Thailand<br /><br />The Thai state used the 2014 coup as an opportunity to undermine its critics, Pavin added. While he was working in Japan, the Thai authorities summonsed him twice for ‘attitude adjustment’<br /><br />In Thailand, people can be jailed for social media posts. The authorities target any criticism of the monarchy and Thais can be charged with lese majeste - defined by Article 112 of Thailand’s Criminal Code as anyone who criticises the monarchy - and they can be jailed for up to 15 years</p>
