  <p><b>[Steve Nicol says Liverpool should be open to the idea of re-signing Philippe Coutinho from Barcelona]</b> You’re always looking for more goalscorers. Somebody like a Coutinho I think would be ideal for Liverpool. You’ve got a front three right now in Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah who are fantastic. But they need a break, they need to be able to step off the field to keep themselves fresh for the challenge ahead. Now, I threw in Coutinho’s name there, the problem is could they afford him? Would they pay £100m for him? But I’ll tell you what, if they did, what an option that would be<br /><br />I don’t believe he’s worth what Barcelona paid for him. I certainly believe he’s worth upwards of £90m. This is a guy who’s proven in the Premier League. This is a guy, right now, who’s being criticised but this guy who’s been criticised carries the hopes of Brazil in the Copa America right now. He’s the go-to guy for creation and for goals. So, when you buy Coutinho, yes, you’re buying a guy who’s been criticised at Barcelona recently, but you’re buying quality. Of course Liverpool need to strengthen, they need strength in depth and when I say depth, they need real quality. That’s what Coutinho would give them</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Nicol says Philippe Coutinho would be a perfect addition for Liverpool]</b> I’ve been banging on and complaining about re-signing Divock Origi because the levels drop when he’s on the pitch. Somebody like Coutinho would be perfect. The ideal situation for Liverpool is to have four guys - Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane and Coutinho. Then you’ve got to pick three of them. Coutinho, he did previously play as one of the three, so he could play there. It’s ideal for Liverpool to have somebody who - if they weren’t starting - could be brought on and the levels don’t drop<br /><br /><b>[Champions League-winning hero Origi has been tied to fresh terms]</b> Right now I’m not concerned, no, I’m not. Had everybody else gone out and been spending money and bringing in players left, right and centre then, yes <b>[I would have been concerned]</b>. Then my argument would be ‘hold on, everybody else is going and strengthening’ but the truth is they’re not. Right now, because of where Liverpool are, it’s not a case of going out and just signing anybody. They have to be careful, they have to make sure they sign the right ones. Now I will say that I think they’ve made a bad start by re-signing Divock Origi. But I guess there will be a time where they do need numbers in the League Cup, your FA Cup. But no, I’m not panicking yet</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Nicol says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> needs to do something with <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> and Sadio Mane]</b> I wouldn’t say it’s a concern, I would say maybe I think <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> needs to try and do something with particularly Salah and Mane. Going forward, they lose the ball too often. It’s one thing to try and go at defenders quickly and try to break quickly. But it’s another thing to do it in some sort of … it’s like manic the way they do it. If they can just slow it down a little bit, take a little bit more time and think about it a little more then I think the goals will start coming more for those two, if they do that<br /><br /><b>[Nicol has also admitted to seeing <a href="joel-matip.html">Joel Matip</a> as a flaw in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s system]</b> That <b>[understanding with Van Dijk]</b> comes with time. They’ve, not just the start of the season but the end of last season, spent a lot of time playing together. Again, <a href="joel-matip.html">Matip</a>, I think if there was a flaw in the back it would be around the <a href="joel-matip.html">Matip</a> area, but the last couple of weeks he’s been fantastic. So yeah at the back that’s a real good partnership right now<br /><br /><b>[Van Dijk and <a href="joel-matip.html">Matip</a> helped <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to another clean sheet in their latest outing]</b> It shows a strength. As we’ve seen in the last couple of weeks, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> last weekend and <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> this weekend, they haven’t been at their best. But do you know what, sometimes you’ve got to dig it out and dig the result out and that’s what pretty much they’ve ended up doing both weekends. If you can win a game by a street and score loads of goals and play silky soccer, then that’s fantastic. But sometimes you’ve got to fight it and tough it out, and they did it</p>

So personally I wouldn’t give it to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, I think you see the season out, considering there’s what, nine, 10 games of the season left.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool urged to land <a href="timo-werner.html">Werner</a> over <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Koulibaly</a> as Nicol looks for attack to be prioritised]</b> Listen, if I had a wish list then I would wish to have <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Koulibaly</a> alongside Van Dijk. But if you’re saying I can only have one choice, I’m going to go with <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a>. I think the front three need a lot more rotation than the backline. The way <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> play, the way that front three presses when they play together, eventually it’s going to catch up with them. They’ve been unbelievable for the last 18 months but you cannot keep that up for six, seven years. You need a break. I think defensively <b>[Joe]</b> Gomez has done enough to make <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> be comfortable.

  <p><b>[Liverpool legend Nicol refutes big billing]</b> I think it’s very difficult to turn around and say he’s the best centre-back ever in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> history because the problem is right now he’s current and that’s what Kompany’s focusing on. I think the other thing you have to remember is that it was such an obvious problem <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> had, it was such a gaping hole in the back, the reason they couldn’t get across the line is because they were losing goals. The best guy around in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at Southampton was Van Dijk and he’s come in and he has been superb. He right now, no question, is the top centre-back in world football, never mind just in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. It’s a short space at the very top with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, two seasons, so I’m not quite ready to say he’s the best one ever. He’s certainly up there in the argument but just a little early for me to be throwing that sort of accolade around</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Nicol says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> can get <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> if they are Europe’s top team]</b> In five years time we don’t know who is going to be top of the tree. Whoever it is, that’s the move for him because what he has shown us up until now is he looks like the real deal. He is like the heir to the throne of the best forward in the world and that means you play for the best team. Hopefully it is <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in four or five years, I don’t know if they can sustain what they are doing now. He will go to the very top team<br /><br />It would be great for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> but I don’t think it would be particularly great for <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a>. I think that’s ultimately why he didn’t go. If the situation at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> had been 10 or 15 years ago where they were top of the league and in the Champions League then it would have been a tougher decision. I think where United are right now and where <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> and <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> are, it was kind of the perfect fit. It was a smart move</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Nicol says Van Dijk could beat up anybody, including Drogba]</b> Well I’m interested to know which part of his game he’s not happy with because if you’re looking for a physical battle, are you telling me that Van Dijk couldn’t beat anybody up physically? Even <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a>? It would be great to watch but don’t tell me that <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> would walk all over him physically. Pace-wise I don’t remember seeing anybody, whether it’s <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> or the Champions League, running past this guy. So that’s not a problem. Can he pass the ball? Yes, he can pass the ball. I’d love to know which part of Van Dijk’s game he thinks would be susceptible to any of these strikers that he was talking about</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Nicol says Henderson’s made more of an impact than Alonso]</b> Well you have to say that Henderson’s been more effective because <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have won the Champions League and he’s pushed them, he’s one of the main reasons why they’re going to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. As great a footballer as Alonso was, I think the influence that Henderson has had on this team has been bigger than Alonso had. Listen, as football players, Alonso’s a better technician than <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a>. I don’t think that’s in question. So it becomes the biggest impact and I think no doubt Henderson’s made a bigger impact in this <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> side than Alonso did for the team he played for.</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Nicol says Landing <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> in a cut-price deal would be a no-brainer for Liverpool]</b> Absolutely. Why wouldn’t you? I can’t think of one reason why you wouldn’t. The only place he’s excelled at is <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. The place loves him, he loves the place. Can you imagine adding <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> to a squad that, right now are still champions of Europe even though they’re out of this year’s competition, and are going to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>? You’re going to add a player with the ability of <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a>, who is going to come in and be in the same situation as a <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> for example, where he is there to fight to get in the starting XI. If it’s cut-price, yeah. Listen, this guy’s making over £13m clear a year. He’s going to have to take a hit. The price to buy him is going to have to take a hit but if the money’s right, <b>[it’s an]</b> absolute no-brainer. If the money’s right, this would be absolutely fantastic for Liverpool<br /><br />I’d take him - for the right price. When he last was at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, he didn’t only play wide in a front three, he played wide as one of three in the middle of the park. Do I think he could do that today? No. He just seems to have completely lost his way. I didn’t expect him to be able to do it at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, and he did, which was fantastic. But he seems to have lost his way. If he was to come back to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, it would take some time to get back in the swing of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Nicol says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> making a mistake missing out on Werner]</b> I think it is <b>[a mistake]</b>, yes. Regardless of how good you are, you have to make sure you stay where you are at the very least. That means you need competition for places. No question, Werner would have given the front three - as great as they are and have been - it would have kept them on their toes. The front three of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> can now breathe a little easier. I think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have slipped up here. Saying that, I wouldn’t be surprised if Werner had something to do with this. At the end of the day, if you want to go somewhere you can make it happen. It looks to me like Werner has changed his mind.</p>
