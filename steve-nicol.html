  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho sits below Jurgen Klopp, Pep Guardiola and Antonio Conte on the list of the world’s best coaches]</b> The reason Klopp is ahead of Mourinho, is because Jose Mourinho went out and spent over £200million last season and took his side to sixth in the Premier League. Jurgen Klopp, with I would suggest less talent, turned Liverpool into a top four side. So you tell me why Jose Mourinho would be in this list.<br /><br />When Jose Mourinho went to Real Madrid many moons ago, he no question was the man, but he turned them into a defensive side. He went to Chelsea, won the league and all of a sudden he’s on the up again. The following year, complete and utter dismay and then he turned Manchester United into a side that finished sixth. Man United under Fergie were about winning Champions League titles and winning Premier League titles.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool need a new goalkeeper]</b> To be honest I think Liverpool should go and see if they can either get a No. 1 or have somebody who’s on a level with Karius. Mignolet isn’t, he’s clearly the No 2 and I think what Mignolet’s doing is waiting to see if he can get a game in the World Cup. <b>[Thibaut]</b> Courtois has had a couple of injury nicks recently and a good World Cup would mean Mignolet is in the shop window and he could get himself a good move.<br /><br />Liverpool’s problems were always the defensive unit and by that, more importantly, the centre-back position and the goalkeeper. They’ve certainly made a difference signing Van Dijk in the centre-back position. Karius, as good as the last couple of months he has had, are we really 100 per cent relying on him? I’m not ready for that yet. That means Liverpool, in my opinion, have to go out and get a recognised No 1. I would have no problem with him <b>[Roma keeper Alisson]</b>, I would have no problem if they can get the likes of Donnarumma who would be a goalkeeper for the next decade. But I think definitely it’s a priority now for Liverpool. It is a weak spot, again as good as Karius has been recently, he’s not the finished article by a long way</p>

My goodness did he make a difference. This team was transformed with Van Dijk in it. So imagine what would happen if they got Alisson. If you want to go for the big prizes you need to have good players and good players cost money. But you know what? Liverpool have the money. If you’ve got it, you spend it tomorrow, or in 10 minutes’ time, if you’ve got the opportunity. Do you buy two average players or one great player? You buy the great player.</p>

He commands his area and he’s vocal. What can this guy not do? I don’t really see a flaw.</p>

He’s got another couple of seasons left in him and the guy is just an out-and-out defender who organises a defence.<br /><br />They got to the Champions League final last year - who got further last season, Liverpool or Atletico Madrid? How many times have Atletico Madrid won it? Zero. How many times have Liverpool won it? Five. It’s not a step down<br /><br /><b>[On Nabil Fekir]</b> I like him. He’s got ability, he scores goals.

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane are firing blanks for Liverpool]</b> Unfortunately going forward the front three are firing blanks. I can’t remember them ever being, the three of them, so poor at the same time. Salah’s had spells when he didn’t score at the start of the year and Firmino sometimes hasn’t knitted it together as well. But every single thing is going wrong for the three of them now, including Mane. The front three have got to find form. If you’re not scoring goals, it doesn’t matter who you’re playing against.<br /><br />There’s no goals coming from the middle of the park. Fabinho, as great a job as he does, is not going to score you goals, <b>[Jordan]</b> Henderson’s not going to score you goals, <b>[Gini]</b> Wijnaldum may get you the odd goal. It’s basically the front three. If they’re not scoring, which right now the three of them are out of form, it’s going to be a little worrying. It’s so hit and miss <b>[with Salah]</b> right now. Unfortunately the guy on the other side, Mane, is a little bit the same as well. Right now you see <b>[Manchester]</b> City winning more games than Liverpool.</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp’s use of forward Xherdan Shaqiri has bamboozled former Liverpool defender Steve Nicol]</b> I would love to know <b>[what Shaqiri’s done wrong]</b>. I can’t believe that <b>[Divock]</b> Origi started <b>[against Everton]</b>. I can’t believe that, after taking him off, you put <b>[Adam]</b> Lallana on before you put Shaqiri on. So, I am absolutely bamboozled what he’s done wrong. I thought he should have brought Shaqiri on against <b>[Manchester]</b> United, instead he brings <b>[Daniel]</b> Sturridge on <b>[first]</b>. So, I have no idea what Shaqiri’s done, because any time he’s stepped on the field for Liverpool, he’s made a difference. He’s either scored goals, he’s either offered up chances for team-mates, or at the very least he’s actually got the team going. That energy and that enthusiasm that he’s shown when he’s come on, we’ve seen it and anybody else who’s come on for Liverpool recently hasn’t changed the game whatsoever<br /><br />Most players want to follow a pattern, especially when they’re doing well, and when it goes wrong, they start looking for other patterns to do. Now, whether that makes any difference I don’t know, but psychologically it does. So, maybe he has to change training, maybe he calms training down for a couple of days and then gets it going towards the end of the week. Or maybe he goes the other way around. That’s part of Jurgen Klopp’s job, is to psychologically find out how to get his players playing. He knows that he can do it one way and it works, but you have to find another way. Because you have to have a Plan B.<br /><br />Since Christmas, they have been so inconsistent. I think they’ve dropped nine points in 11 games and we’ve only got nine games left. That’s not what you want to be doing this time of year. This time of year is about getting three points</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah has been struggling since Christmas but deserves time at Liverpool]</b> Considering what he’s done the last 18 months, you have to let him ride this out. Strikers go through periods where they just can’t do anything right - that’s exactly what he’s going through now. Benching him isn’t going to make it any better, taking him off isn’t going to make it any better. He’s earned the right to have the time to sort this out. This is the business time of the season so it needs to be sorted out pretty quickly. I know he scored in February but, for me, since Christmas, he’s been struggling. The worst thing is his touch, his touch has deserted him. When your touch goes, it starts biting into your confidence as well. For me, really since Christmas, he has been struggling. Fortunately for Liverpool particularly <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane has been the man who has been finding the back of the net. Nice to see <b>[Roberto]</b> Firmino getting a couple of goals <b>[against Burnley]</b>, that should get him kick-started again.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool may have claimed the notable scalp of Bayern Munich]</b> I would love to say that Liverpool came and were just too clever and sat in a great spot. But the truth is that I don’t think Bayern knew what they wanted to do. Clearly in the first leg they sat and gave nothing away. But at home, and the reason we all thought they were favourites, you’d expect them to be pushing again, but they didn’t. They didn’t go forward, they just sort of sat and waited. If you look at the stats, the only reason they had more possession was because Liverpool kept giving them the ball. That had nothing to do with what they were doing. Liverpool on the ball in this game overall, I thought they were atrocious. I thought they were as bad as I’ve ever seen. But it goes to show you stats don’t mean anything, and the only thing that matters is the scoreline, and Liverpool won 3-1.</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah’s head has gone at Liverpool]</b> His head has gone. And he shouldn’t say he’s had a bad season because he hasn’t had a bad season. He’s had a bad second part of the season. As good as he was in the first part of the season, he’s been as bad in the second.<br /><br />When he goes through now, the first thing in your head is ‘he’s not scoring’. I was praying he was going to pass the ball to Mane, I was praying. Because I thought if he doesn’t pass it, this isn’t going in the back of the net. The worrying thing I have now thinking about Liverpool is where their goals are going to come from. The way Liverpool are set up, <b>[Jurgen]</b> Klopp’s best three in the middle of the park are there to be workers, basically. They’re not there to play fancy passes through the defences and score goals, they’re there to get the ball to the front three. We have a situation right now where you basically have a front two, and that’s Firmino and Mane, you’re down to two players that you think are going to put the ball in the back of the net. You look across to Manchester City, who have got an abundance of players who can put the ball in the back of the net. That’s the difference for me right now why City will win it and Liverpool won’t</p>

So yes, he’s going to leave. Where does he go? I guess it’s up to him. If he wants to move for money, he will go for the highest bidder regardless. But if he wants trophies, and you’ve got someone like <b>[Raphael]</b> Varane wanting to leave Real Madrid, I wouldn’t be shocked if that was where he turns up.

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp will be a little bit disappointed at Naby Keita’s return on Liverpool’s £53 million investment]</b> Let’s be honest, we’ve got five games left and we’re saying he’s starting to pick it up. I mean, he hasn’t done particularly well. He’s had a couple of games where he’s played back to back but other than that he’s pretty much not been seen much this season. I think in all honesty Klopp will be a little disappointed with what he’s got this season from Keita. There’s no question he fits the mould of Liverpool’s middle three. He will get around the field, he will close the ball down, he will get the ball to the front three. But when they bought this guy, the idea was then for him to chip in with some goals as well. He got 14 goals in 57 games in the Bundesliga, that’s a great record for a midfield player. But he’s not been able to do that, not to season in the Premier League. Yes he’s got two in two recently, but it’s a little bit late. So maybe he’s going to be one of those players who will take a season to figure it out, fit in, and then maybe next year we’ll see what Klopp thought he was getting from Naby Keita. And that is goals as well as performance.</p>

So for Liverpool, would this guy fit? Can you imagine him sat beside Van Dijk? I certainly can envision it. However, I’m not quite so sure that Liverpool would turn round and spend the type of money that it would cost for this guy. The fact that they have Gomez, they’re probably looking at him as the future. So, unfortunately, I don’t think he’s going to go to Liverpool. But my goodness I would love to have him there</p>

  <p><b>[James Maddison would be a welcome addition at Liverpool]</b> Klopp’s recent three in the middle of the park for Liverpool, over the last couple of years particularly, has been about gaining possession back, about closing the opposition back, about working really hard and then getting the ball to the front three. I would love to see a little change in that with somebody like Maddison, who no question has already shown in the Premier League, from the middle of the park, he can open defences up, he can create chances. I think he will eventually score more goals than he is doing right now. I would love to see this. It would be a little change in the way that Klopp operated. But I think this would be a great signing.<br /><br />James Milner’s coming to the end of his top-flight career. Father Time catches up with us all. Declan Rice would have been ideal before they signed Fabinho. I just see Declan Rice as being the same as Fabinho. It’s good to have a great squad, as Man City will attest to, but I’m not sure that he’s better than Fabinho. I don’t think he’ll <b>[Klopp]</b> go and sign another player like that.

You’re responsible for everything. You’re responsible for how the team plays, if they don’t turn up you’re responsible for that, your job is to get them playing. If you lose a game, you’re responsible ultimately because you’re the one who would get the sack if you lose too many, not the players. There are a whole load of different pressures that go with being the head coach, manager, whatever you want to call it. And everybody who’s done it, there are times when it becomes too much and you need some sort of break while you figure out how you de-stress, if you want.

He’s 29 years old, he’s been around, he knows what it’s like to be playing at the lower level so his feet will be firmly on the ground. He’ll look at this as, ‘This solidifies my family’s future.

Now Barnesy, with the ball at his feet dribbling, at his best, was better than Mane. Unfortunately for Barnesy he had to do a lot more work in a game because one of his responsibilities was to defend, to get back behind the ball and be in a defensive position. As great as <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> is, <a href="john-barnes.html">John Barnes</a> is one of the best players I have ever played with - and I’ve played with a lot of good players at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Barnesy was absolutely fantastic, unplayable sometimes - actually, most of the time until he unfortunately tore his Achilles and that curtailed him a little. Before that, absolute lights out</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Nicol admits <a href="naby-keita.html">Naby Keita</a> may have failed to live up to expectations at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> Yes I think it is <b>[early to call Keita a flop]</b>. I think because of the strength in depth <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s got in the middle of the midfield, when <a href="naby-keita.html">Naby Keita</a> initially came in and didn’t settle very quickly, then you don’t play him because you can play other players. Certain teams can bring a player in and even though they’re not hitting the heights they thought, they have to stick with him and they have to give them time. So I think <a href="naby-keita.html">Naby Keita</a>, yes he hasn’t lived up to what we thought he could be just yet, I think he still can, but he will certainly need more time. So I’m not ready to call him a flop yet<br /><br /><b>[Nicol hopes <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> can get over the line by finishing their schedule]</b> No I don’t <b>[think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> should be awarded the title]</b>. I think when everybody’s clear to start playing then you see out the season, that’s always been my stance. And actually, regardless of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, I think it’s even more important for the relegation battles because if you’re going to decide to give the title to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> then clearly you’re going to decide who comes up, who comes down, and the reasons behind that, which is never going to work. So personally I wouldn’t give it to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, I think you see the season out, considering there’s what, nine, 10 games of the season left.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> legend Nicol refutes big billing]</b> I think it’s very difficult to turn around and say he’s the best centre-back ever in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> history because the problem is right now he’s current and that’s what Kompany’s focusing on. I think the other thing you have to remember is that it was such an obvious problem <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> had, it was such a gaping hole in the back, the reason they couldn’t get across the line is because they were losing goals. The best guy around in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> was <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a> and he’s come in and he has been superb. He right now, no question, is the top centre-back in world football, never mind just in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. It’s a short space at the very top with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, two seasons, so I’m not quite ready to say he’s the best one ever. He’s certainly up there in the argument but just a little early for me to be throwing that sort of accolade around</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Nicol says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> can get <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> if they are Europe’s top team]</b> In five years time we don’t know who is going to be top of the tree. Whoever it is, that’s the move for him because what he has shown us up until now is he looks like the real deal. He is like the heir to the throne of the best forward in the world and that means you play for the best team. Hopefully it is <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in four or five years, I don’t know if they can sustain what they are doing now. He will go to the very top team<br /><br />It would be great for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> but I don’t think it would be particularly great for <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a>. I think that’s ultimately why he didn’t go. If the situation at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> had been 10 or 15 years ago where they were top of the league and in the Champions League then it would have been a tougher decision. I think where United are right now and where <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> and <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> are, it was kind of the perfect fit. It was a smart move</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Nicol says Henderson’s made more of an impact than Alonso]</b> Well you have to say that Henderson’s been more effective because <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have won the Champions League and he’s pushed them, he’s one of the main reasons why they’re going to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. As great a footballer as Alonso was, I think the influence that Henderson has had on this team has been bigger than Alonso had. Listen, as football players, Alonso’s a better technician than <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a>. I don’t think that’s in question. So it becomes the biggest impact and I think no doubt Henderson’s made a bigger impact in this <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> side than Alonso did for the team he played for.</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Nicol says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> making a mistake missing out on Werner]</b> I think it is <b>[a mistake]</b>, yes. Regardless of how good you are, you have to make sure you stay where you are at the very least. That means you need competition for places. No question, Werner would have given the front three - as great as they are and have been - it would have kept them on their toes. The front three of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> can now breathe a little easier. I think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have slipped up here. Saying that, I wouldn’t be surprised if Werner had something to do with this. At the end of the day, if you want to go somewhere you can make it happen. It looks to me like Werner has changed his mind.</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Nicol says Landing <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> in a cut-price deal would be a no-brainer for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> Absolutely. Why wouldn’t you? I can’t think of one reason why you wouldn’t. The only place he’s excelled at is <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. The place loves him, he loves the place. Can you imagine adding <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> to a squad that, right now are still champions of Europe even though they’re out of this year’s competition, and are going to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>? You’re going to add a player with the ability of <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a>, who is going to come in and be in the same situation as a <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> for example, where he is there to fight to get in the starting XI. If it’s cut-price, yeah. Listen, this guy’s making over £13m clear a year. He’s going to have to take a hit. The price to buy him is going to have to take a hit but if the money’s right, <b>[it’s an]</b> absolute no-brainer. If the money’s right, this would be absolutely fantastic for Liverpool<br /><br />I’d take him - for the right price. When he last was at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, he didn’t only play wide in a front three, he played wide as one of three in the middle of the park. Do I think he could do that today? No. He just seems to have completely lost his way. I didn’t expect him to be able to do it at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, and he did, which was fantastic. But he seems to have lost his way. If he was to come back to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, it would take some time to get back in the swing of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.</p>
