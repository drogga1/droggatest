<blockquote>
  <p>[Marco Farfan tuning out the chatter after Portland Timbers breakout] When I’m in class, I just focus on school and forget about soccer. When I’m in soccer, I just forget about school and do my thing.<br /><br />By the time I was 10 years old. I really wanted to become a professional soccer player<br /><br />[Farfan said of the MLS level] It’s a lot faster physically and technically. You really have to be on top of the little things, like your first touch. At first it was a hard transition, going in from T2 to preseason with the first team, but after a couple first-team trainings I felt like I started getting those things down<br /><br />I thought I was going to be training with the first team and then get minutes with T2, like I did last year. I never expected to make my debut the second game into the season<br /><br />I feel like this is an opportunity for me to get better, and show the Timbers what I can do. Honestly, to me right now, I don’t think I’ve made it yet</p>
