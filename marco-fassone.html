  <p><b>[Milan CEO Fassone backs <a href="vincenzo-montella.html">Montella</a> after derby loss]</b> We certainly go along with Vincenzo. When we are reconstructing our <b>[club]</b> we need to give time and tools. Now we see the first positive signs. <a href="vincenzo-montella.html">Montella</a> will absolutely have the time to continue working<br /><br />Derbies are always an amazing thing. This time it turned badly for us and they celebrated with their fans. The next time, I am convinced it will be nice for our fans. The second half seemed like a completely different game and, with quality and attitude, we closed Inter in their half of the field.<br /><br /><b>[Tenth in the table]</b> is not a position for Milan and we have to roll our sleeves up, but we have received good indications</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former AC Milan chief executive Marco Fassone claimed Cristiano Ronaldo was open to moving to San Siro before eventually joining Serie A champions Juventus last season]</b> The president wanted Cristiano Ronaldo, but the figures told us this was inadvisable. Ronaldo was open to evaluating the opportunity, as Milan are a famous club and there was enthusiasm around us. However, we never went beyond some internal calculations and seeing if he was potentially open to it.<br /><br /><b>[Bonucci only spent one season in Milan before the Italy defender returned to Turin and Fassone admitted the deal was ill-advised]</b> Bonucci was a mistake. When we signed Bonucci from Juventus, we’d already made eight or nine buys. The strategy was to create a squad suited to 4-3-3, so we already had the defenders and really didn’t need another. What we were missing was a centre-forward, for whom we had €70m set aside. The choice we made in the end was to reduce the budget for the striker and sign a leader for the dressing room. With hindsight, if we had just invested in a top forward as was the plan, it would’ve gone differently<br /><br /><b>[Milan signed Portuguese forward Silva from Porto that window, and they were also linked with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang before he left Borussia Dortmund for Arsenal]</b> Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was a target, as Mirabelli was always a fan. However, it’s complicated to deal with German clubs. The demands were higher than his real value on the market</p>
