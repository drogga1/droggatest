  <p><b>[AC Milan have announced that Gianluigi Donnarumma has rejected their offer of a new contract]</b> Mino Raiola has informed me of Donnarumma’s decision not to renew his contract with AC Milan. It’s a final decision taken by the player. I remember that 10 days ago we made an important offer to the player - even more important that what the newspapers have written. The player made his technical, economical and personal considerations and has decided to reject it. He will end his relationship with AC Milan on June 30, 2018.</p>

  <p><b>[AC Milan are confident about signing Gianluigi Donnarumma to a new contract after meeting with the goalkeeper’s representatives and family]</b> I think that the part of the deal regarding the player and family is close, the other is more complicated. It is a large package deal involving salary, benefits, clauses, a commission, possible clauses on future sales of the player.</p>

  <p><b>[For Vincenzo Montella, Antonio Conte could not have picked a worse week to confess that he misses Italy]</b> Today we are angry and I have come to talk because these defeats should not be considered as routine. There should have been confidence but we didn’t see it on the pitch. Milan are stronger than Samp and need to approach the match in a different way. We’ve heard some alarm bells here today. We expected obstacles and we expected the first six months to be hard. The players are new and the second half of the journey, in theory, will be easier. But today we didn’t like the attitude. There shouldn’t be excuses and it needs to be changed quickly<br /><br /><b>[On Vincenzo Montella]</b> He wasn’t the problem, but we had some differences and I didn’t feel supported by him. I had to make a painful decision but I wish him all the best. But there was no longer complete harmony between us</p>

  <p><b>[Milan CEO Fassone backs <a href="vincenzo-montella.html">Montella</a> after derby loss]</b> We certainly go along with Vincenzo. When we are reconstructing our <b>[club]</b> we need to give time and tools. Now we see the first positive signs. <a href="vincenzo-montella.html">Montella</a> will absolutely have the time to continue working<br /><br />Derbies are always an amazing thing. This time it turned badly for us and they celebrated with their fans. The next time, I am convinced it will be nice for our fans. The second half seemed like a completely different game and, with quality and attitude, we closed Inter in their half of the field.<br /><br /><b>[Tenth in the table]</b> is not a position for Milan and we have to roll our sleeves up, but we have received good indications</p>

  <p><b>[Milan held Cristiano Ronaldo talks but were convinced to give up the dream]</b> It’s true, Li Yonghong wanted Cristiano Ronaldo at Milan. Mr Li wanted Ronaldo at the Rossoneri because he believed he had great strength in the Chinese market. The player wanted to leave Madrid. We met in July 2017 with his agent <b>[Jorge]</b> Mendes to check the costs and his availability. It was then that I convinced him to give up the dream: Ronaldo was too expensive.<br /><br />I think Milan were led by an excellent board of directors. We made €20m more turnover. That €126m debt included €45m extraordinary costs, covered entirely by Elliott and were due to write-downs of players like <b>[Nikola]</b> Kalinic and provisions for myself and the five other directors who left the club. I don’t hear from Li anymore, although sometimes I do from his right-hand man <b>[David]</b> Han Li. I don’t know where the money came from, but prestigious advisors were involved in the deal so why should I have doubted him?</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> chief executive Marco Fassone claimed <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> was open to moving to <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a> before eventually joining <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> champions <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> last season]</b> The president wanted <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, but the figures told us this was inadvisable. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> was open to evaluating the opportunity, as Milan are a famous club and there was enthusiasm around us. However, we never went beyond some internal calculations and seeing if he was potentially open to it.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Bonucci</a> only spent one season in Milan before the Italy defender returned to <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a> and Fassone admitted the deal was ill-advised]</b> <a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Bonucci</a> was a mistake. When we signed <a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Bonucci</a> from <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, we’d already made eight or nine buys. The strategy was to create a squad suited to 4-3-3, so we already had the defenders and really didn’t need another. What we were missing was a centre-forward, for whom we had €70m set aside. The choice we made in the end was to reduce the budget for the striker and sign a leader for the dressing room. With hindsight, if we had just invested in a top forward as was the plan, it would’ve gone differently<br /><br /><b>[Milan signed Portuguese forward Silva from <a href="porto-fc.html">Porto</a> that window, and they were also linked with <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> before he left <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> was a target, as Mirabelli was always a fan. However, it’s complicated to deal with German clubs. The demands were higher than his real value on the market</p>
