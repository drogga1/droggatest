Terrence is a player that we’ve tracked for years during his time with the U.S. National Team and in Germany. He is an experienced, attacking player that is capable of scoring goals in MLS. We’re looking forward to him joining our preseason and integrating himself into the group.</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto FC have announced the signing of Spanish midfielder Alejandro Pozuelo from Belgian side KRC Genk]</b> Alejandro is an excellent player that has the ability to both create and score goals. He is the best player on the best team in Belgium’s top division. Obviously, and for so many reasons, we would like him to join us now, but we look forward to his arrival on March 18. We are very excited for the 2019 season and adding another important piece to a group that already has a lot of quality only makes us stronger.</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto FC has signed United States international defender Omar Gonzalez from Liga MX club Atlas]</b> Omar has won numerous championships and has played on the biggest stage in world football. He is an experienced defender with over 200 appearances in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, including 25 playoff matches where he won five trophies in seven years. His experience as a player but equally as important, who he is as a person will be a welcomed addition to our group here in Toronto</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="michael-bradley.html">Michael Bradley</a> could return early from injury if his rehabilitation goes well]</b> We are going to be careful and cautious about this. But we’re confident that once he has the surgery that he’ll be able to return to play. It’ll take probably approximately four months. Now that could be shorter or it could be lengthier depending on how we manage that process</p>

  <p><b>[Canadian international Richie Laryea has signed a new deal with Toronto FC]</b> Richie has been terrific since he joined us. He played a valuable role, both for TFC, and the Canadian Men’s National Team last year. Off the field, Richie’s character and personality is tremendous. He earned this new contract in many ways, and we are excited for he, his family, and what he will bring to TFC moving forward</p>
