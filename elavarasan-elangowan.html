  <p><b>[Elavarasan Elangowan has blamed his midfield after they suffered a 3-1 defeat to Kelantan]</b> I could see the weakness in our midfield. Although we have good strikers, but when we reach the middle third, we cannot get the ball to our strikers. Overall, it was not so good. We could not supply the ball to our strikers. When the engine room didn’t function, the whole team can’t play well.<br /><br />This is only the second game. As newcomers, when we play in the Super League, you will go up against teams that have been here for many years. They have the experience and their performance is always consistent. In the Premier League, you don’t play strong teams every week. But it is different in the Super League. State teams are strong, despite their off-field problems and they are always consistent. To break the barrier, we need more time</p>

  <p><b>[Elavarasan Elangowan is determined to get a win in order to improve their position in the league]</b> We want to improve our position in the table. I can see some positive signs during the game against JDT and Kedah so I hope we can bring back three points</p>
