<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Graham Arnold’s current side ahead of any he played with at the Harbour City club]</b> I played there for five years and this team, in my eyes, is by far the best Sydney FC team there’s been. If they win the grand final, they will go down in history as the best team over the course of one season. No doubt about that. This team, the way they’ve performed this season, is beyond <b>[any other Sydney side]</b>. You combine the team effort and the individuals they have and that’s why they are where they are.<br /><br />The real question is can Melbourne Victory find a way to win? That’s the real question. It’s a hard one because their lead-in has really been below their best this season. So huge room for improvement everywhere but I think what they can hang their hat on for this match is the way they defended as a team, as a unit in the <b>[semi-final]</b> against Brisbane. It was just a high intensity defensive effort, which just suppressed Roar into submission<br /><br />He played even deeper at times throughout the season, you know, just in front of the back four, which you remember Dwight Yorke at Man United - he’s just banging in the goals - so to see him drift backwards was a bit strange but he controlled the middle of the park. He was so cool and calm on the ball, rarely did he lose the ball, so it worked beautifully. In the <b>[grand]</b> final, when we needed someone to be creative - because we were poor first half - it was no surprise it was the biggest player the A-League had seen at that time that stood up<br /><br />Like every other time I faced a Kevin Muscat penalty, I was fully expecting it to hit the back of the net. I remember the penalty. I dived the wrong way as I normally did with a Kevin Muscat penalty. I don’t know, he just disguised it particularly well and I just thought ‘next stop, back of the net’. Heard the sound and I’ve said this many times but there’s not many sensory memories I have from football but that sound - that ball hitting the post in a hushed moment in Etihad <b>[Stadium]</b> - it just rang so loudly. I was sort of stunned but then instantly I was thinking ‘where’s that ball going?’ because it could still have hit the back of the net, it could have hit me, so I was looking for it straight away and I soon as I saw that it hadn’t gone into the back of the net, my instant thought was ‘this is our day<br /><br />The last <b>[championship]</b> I won, the second one with Sydney, was huge personally because halfway through that season I was being moved on from the club and I knew but I still had the job to do. So I see that as a real accomplishment that I was able to get through that season, do the business and go on and win something</p>
