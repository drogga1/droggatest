  <p><b>[Bayern Munich youngster Chris Richards has given some insight into his first weeks at the club after joining from FC Dallas]</b> One of my first weeks here, pre-season, I got ripped into by <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a>. He rips into everybody. He rips into <b>[Robert]</b> <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a>, he rips into <b>[Jerome]</b> Boateng… I wasn’t doing a drill right, messed up a few times, and he just ripped into me. I was like, ‘Wow, this is a scary moment’. He’s scary<br /><br />Everybody holds each other accountable, nobody’s going to let you slack off in training. They’re going to rip into you if they think you’re not giving your best and that shows on the field. You’ve seen Bayern, they’ve won the title for the last six, maybe seven years. Everybody owns up to their mistakes, you’re doing it to win titles, to be the best team in the world. When you’re giving 100 per cent and you see someone slacking off it’s not very fun to see<br /><br /><a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a> is unstoppable, he’s great with both feet and if you give him even a yard of space he’s going to rock you. But I’ve come up against <a href="serge-gnabry.html">Serge Gnabry</a> and <a href="kingsley-coman.html">Kingsley Coman</a> in training as well and if you’re not right up there on them they’re going to blow past you. I think <a href="serge-gnabry.html">Serge Gnabry</a> <b>[is probably the toughest]</b>. You saw him tear up <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> in that one game and he definitely does it in training as well. He’s so quick and has such great skill - he’s not a weak player either, he’s really strong. He’s definitely one of the toughest to guard in training</p>

  <p><b>[How the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> became USMNT players’ league of choice]</b> I want to start getting some minutes on the field with the first team next year. There are still center-backs here who are world class. I’m not taking anything away from them, but I think it’s time for me to start getting my shot at showing people what I have and hopefully one day becoming a Bayern legend</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich defender Chris Richards has spoken about his first glimpse of life with the club]</b> It was maybe my second day here at Bayern and I was paired up with <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a>, and he expects perfection on every go. If you pass it a yard away from him, he’s not necessarily going to be happy with you. I think there may have been two or three passes in a row where it wasn’t necessarily to his right foot and he yells at me and he’s like, ‘Hey, pick it up, we need to do better this and that,’ and he was ripping into me. I was like, ‘Wow this is scary!’ Because <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a> but also, it’s kind of cool because not many people can say <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a> yelled at you!<br /><br />They passed the ball to <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a> and I promise you his back was turned to me and I maybe gave him a yard, and he turned and hit it left foot upper 90. <b>[Manuel]</b> <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Neuer</a> was like, ‘You have to stay tighter to him than that’ and I was like, ‘It was only a yard!’ How did he get a shot up that quick with that much power and that much accuracy? It was one of those things where I was like, I know this is one of the best strikers in the world but I definitely have some work to do</p>
