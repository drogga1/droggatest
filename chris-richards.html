  <p><b>[USA defender Chris Richards ‘super ecstatic’ after first Bayern Munich start]</b> I learned around lunchtime and I was super ecstatic. I knew Javi’s knee wasn’t feeling too well so I knew there was a good chance of me starting. Once I got the shot, I was ecstatic.<br /><br /><b>[On David Alaba]</b> It’s amazing. He’s a world-class player. A lot of my friends here are fans of him. It’s weird being able to sit and talk with him, and all my friends are fanboying over him. It’s been a great experience and he’s a great person and a player. It’s pretty hard, but you just have to know that you’re here for the same reason. You can give them respect, but don’t be a fanboy<br /><br />I’m starting off with the U-19 team, but there’s always a chance to go forward depending on my progression. The goal, by December, is to at least maybe get on the roster with the first team for a Bundesliga match, but whatever happens happens</p>

  <p><b>[Beating Mexico the ultimate prize for USMNT U-20s]</b> You see what it means with the first team, and it trickles down to all the age groups. Everybody wants to beat Mexico, and of course everyone knows Dos a Cero, but it doesn’t matter if it’s 2-0, 3-0, 4-0. We have a special type of hate for Mexico and we have to show them we’re the best team in Concacaf.</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Chris Richards? The USMNT center back prospect who has joined Bayern Munich]</b> was tough hearing. I thought my world was going to end. That was my first time not making a team. I was devastated. I was crying. I wasn’t good at rejection.<br /><br />Once Houston gave me the call and told me they’d be playing FC Dallas I thought this was easy, I have to go to Houston<br /><br />Every team when they play Dallas in the <b>[Development Academy]</b> it’s like the World Cup for them. I had extra motivation because of what happened in the summer. As soon as I got the schedule I circled FC Dallas.<br /><br />I walk into the locker room and the first player I see is Arjen Robben and I’m thinking, ‘There’s no way this is real. I was playing FIFA with him a few days ago. This doesn’t happen every day’. We were jogging around and I’m like, ‘These are the guys you see on TV at the highest level.’ But once we started playing I felt more comfortable and got over the nerves<br /><br />You can learn a lot from just watching how they play and how they act on the field. Whether it’s the speed of play, or how fast they do things. Their vision, they’re seeing things two and three steps beyond what a regular player sees</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> youngster Chris Richards has given some insight into his first weeks at the club after joining from FC Dallas]</b> One of my first weeks here, pre-season, I got ripped into by <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a>. He rips into everybody. He rips into <b>[Robert]</b> <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a>, he rips into <b>[Jerome]</b> Boateng… I wasn’t doing a drill right, messed up a few times, and he just ripped into me. I was like, ‘Wow, this is a scary moment’. He’s scary<br /><br />Everybody holds each other accountable, nobody’s going to let you slack off in training. They’re going to rip into you if they think you’re not giving your best and that shows on the field. You’ve seen <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, they’ve won the title for the last six, maybe seven years. Everybody owns up to their mistakes, you’re doing it to win titles, to be the best team in the world. When you’re giving 100 per cent and you see someone slacking off it’s not very fun to see<br /><br /><a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a> is unstoppable, he’s great with both feet and if you give him even a yard of space he’s going to rock you. But I’ve come up against <a href="serge-gnabry.html">Serge Gnabry</a> and <a href="kingsley-coman.html">Kingsley Coman</a> in training as well and if you’re not right up there on them they’re going to blow past you. I think <a href="serge-gnabry.html">Serge Gnabry</a> <b>[is probably the toughest]</b>. You saw him tear up <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> in that one game and he definitely does it in training as well. He’s so quick and has such great skill - he’s not a weak player either, he’s really strong. He’s definitely one of the toughest to guard in training</p>

  <p><b>[How the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> became USMNT players’ league of choice]</b> I want to start getting some minutes on the field with the first team next year. There are still center-backs here who are world class. I’m not taking anything away from them, but I think it’s time for me to start getting my shot at showing people what I have and hopefully one day becoming a <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> legend</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> defender Chris Richards has spoken about his first glimpse of life with the club]</b> It was maybe my second day here at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> and I was paired up with <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a>, and he expects perfection on every go. If you pass it a yard away from him, he’s not necessarily going to be happy with you. I think there may have been two or three passes in a row where it wasn’t necessarily to his right foot and he yells at me and he’s like, ‘Hey, pick it up, we need to do better this and that,’ and he was ripping into me. I was like, ‘Wow this is scary!’ Because <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a> but also, it’s kind of cool because not many people can say <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a> yelled at you!<br /><br />They passed the ball to <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a> and I promise you his back was turned to me and I maybe gave him a yard, and he turned and hit it left foot upper 90. <b>[Manuel]</b> <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Neuer</a> was like, ‘You have to stay tighter to him than that’ and I was like, ‘It was only a yard!’ How did he get a shot up that quick with that much power and that much accuracy? It was one of those things where I was like, I know this is one of the best strikers in the world but I definitely have some work to do</p>
