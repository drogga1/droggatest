If you brought Matic in and said ‘sit there and protect the back four or back three and break up the play’ maybe that wouldn’t be such a loss with Kante out of the team as Dele Alli scoring goals so I would always go with the man that pops up and gets the odd vital goal.</p>

  <p><b>[Winning the Europa League is unlikely to convince contract rebels Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil to stay at Arsenal]</b> I do not think it would persuade them to stay if they won the Europa League. Jose Mourinho at one stage in the season went ‘I’ll put all my eggs in one basket’, and it paid off. That’s not always going to be the case. I think for Arsene Wenger he could go both ways. He is playing a totally different 11 in the Europa League anyway, it’s not like he’s mixing and matching. I think he will go that way for as long as possible. I think if they are in seventh position with no chance of getting into the Champions League spots then yes, he will probably do that <b>[play his strongest side]</b> in the latter stages, if they are still there.</p>

  <p><b>[Alan Smith of the opinion that Wenger’s longevity deserves greater recognition in the modern era]</b> Managers are getting sacked after four games in the Premier League, so patience has worn more than thin. To retain that work ethic and desire is amazing. Whatever you say about the rights and wrongs of him still being in the job, you can’t take away from that achievement.<br /><br />He’s taken more on his shoulders than Sir Alex did. Sir Alex delegated more, spent time overlooking the training ground rather than being down there. A succession of assistants slowly changed training, different voices, different methods. Whereas Arsene, he’s had Pat Rice and <b>[Steve]</b> Bouldy, but he likes to oversee everything: that’s extra pressure.</p>

  <p><b>[Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang looks ‘a shadow of the player’ he was at Dortmund]</b> He looked a shadow of the player he was at Dortmund. Even he, in the short time he’s been at Arsenal, has been affected by the mood. He got his goal with a little flick, but he’s not the player I hoped he would be. I’m not saying he’s a bad player, but it’s a malaise through the dressing room and he’s been affected.<br /><br />We haven’t seen anything from Mkhitaryan in an Arsenal shirt yet and this is when you need your big players, in an attacking sense, to get you back into a game<br /><br />I always think with Arsenal that when they concede the first goal, like they did, then they lose their heads a little bit. They can’t just go back into their shape and keep it tight for 10 or 15 minutes and work their way back into a game</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil is set to pose Unai Emery with one of his biggest challenges at Arsenal manager]</b> For me, this is a relationship that could go one of two ways - whether Ozil responds to Emery or whether he doesn’t. There have been times in recent years when Ozil seems to have switched off and lost the ball, and the team have lost the ball and the team have suffered. It’s going to be fascinating how Emery deals with that. Ozil is a player who signed for fortunes and he is expected to play. That is going to be one of the most interesting things to watch. How is Ozil going to fit in with the new regime? He has had a turbulent summer with all that went on, then the World Cup, which was a disaster for Germany. He needs to settle down now. I’m sure he will be desperate to do well. And Arsenal need him. He is one of the key creative players. On his day, there are not many like him in the Premier League. Emery has to get hold of Ozil, try to get the best out of him, get him on board<br /><br />It was obvious that there needed to be change this summer at Arsenal. The place had grown stale. Now the fans are going into the new season with optimism and that is a difference this year. Everyone is intrigued about how it is going to go. To an extent, Emery came out of nowhere. He was not on the original shortlist. His track record at Sevilla though was very good and he had far more experience than Mikel Arteta. Emery is a Basque and they are a tough people. He will be a taskmaster. Chalk and cheese really to Wenger. The pre-season training will have been hard for the players. They will have found that out by now<br /><br />I think Arsenal will be more organised this year, tougher at the back. But it will take time to get used to what Emery wants. Arsenal will score goals - they have the players for that. But the key is in defence. There was a lack of accountability in the team last season and the same players kept getting picked. It drove everybody mad. They have to be more difficult to break down this season, more solid</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Iwobi was once ponderous]</b> It has been enlightening and heartening to watch Alex Iwobi shine this season. Though not a regular Premier League starter, the youth product, by featuring in the cup competitions, has given us a glimpse of the promise first seen on initially emerging two years ago. Since then, however, Iwobi’s progress has stalled, leading to some Arsenal fans getting on his back. Ponderous in possession, first touch often heavy, you could see the uncertainty in everything he did. I wondered if he would ever bounce back to reach full potential.<br /><br />Lately, though, it has been the exact opposite. The 22-year-old looks powerful and positive with or without the ball, as if he understands his role. We hear he feels confident under Unai Emery, suggesting the new manager has devoted some time to improving the attacker. This all adds up to good news for the team as a whole, since Iwobi’s game can provide something different when Emery sees fit</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal legend suggests Ramsey may be running away from Ozil battle]</b> I think we all hoped this kind of situation would cease to happen with <b>[head of recruitment Sven]</b> Mislintat coming and <b>[head of football Raul]</b> Sanllehi. Maybe they arrived a little too late. I don’t know. It’s difficult to really speak without knowing the details but maybe Mesut Ozil’s vast salary is the reason they’re not prepared to put Ramsey anywhere near it and he’s not prepared to sign. But then again who is going to give him that money? I don’t know. Where would he go? You would imagine his agent has already spoken to a few clubs so he’s got half an idea where he might end up. It would be a shame to lose him, it would be such a shame. I think, like a few players there, he can be developed into a top player. He’s pretty good as it is and he’s got this knack of scoring goals on the big stage and in important matches. It would be a blow if we lost him.<br /><br />If you’re Ramsey, it’s your mission to make sure you are first choice ahead of Ozil and do everything you possibly can. He’s obviously going to work harder in terms of covering the ground so he offers something different to the German but I don’t think you can ever say they can’t possibly play in the same team. There’s always a way round it but maybe Ramsey feels he’s not going to be a regular choice and that’s what’s influencing his decision and it sounds like the contract offer has been withdrawn now</p>

I don’t see that as a goer.</p>

He has such a good attitude, even when he plays as a substitute. It’s what any manager wants from a player. He has a wonderful attitude, skill, goal scoring abilities. It’s great for Spurs to have him now.<br /><br />The great thing from him is that he can play in so many different positions. It means he understands the game, especially the positional side of the things. When Kane is not there, Son can play there. He can also go to the left, and right.<br /><br />Also, he can finish chances with both feet, which is a great asset for any striker. Of course, confidence is a massive part. It seems he’s flying at the moment. He’s a very quick player and I believe, physically, we’re seeing the best from him now.<br /><br />He had a great appetite for the game. He didn’t look like he’s scared of anything. In his first season, everything wasn’t clicking and his confidence looked low but still, you could see the ability was there. He already showed that in Germany</p>

How much will he play though as you imagine he may be a bit of a squad player? Unai Emery knows him from Sevilla, he is versatile, while another young lad in Smith Rowe has gone out to Germany to get some game time. I do not think Emery would have given up on him and it will be good for his education, so hopefully he can come back a better player.</p>

  <p><b>[Alexandre Lacazette is starring as Arsenal’s No. 9 and doing the shirt proud]</b> Arsenal fans absolutely love a prolific centre-forward, especially when he has a close attachment to the club. And I think that’s true just now of Alexandre Lacazette, a character who seems to genuinely care for the fortunes of his employer. Yes, plenty passionately kiss the badge before angling for a move. Plenty go through the motions to garner support. But Lacazette does most of his talking with clever feet forcefully backed up by fierce determination. You could see that in the way he surged infield against Cardiff to rifle home the goal that effectively sealed the result. The Frenchman wouldn’t be denied. This was all about pace, power and a hammer blow of a shot. His superb take against Chelsea involved a lot more skill in shifting the ball swiftly in a tight space. But again, the goalkeeper was beaten by a sweet piledriver. Not many hit the ball as hard as Lacazette. If nothing else, such outstanding form gives Arsenal half a chance against Manchester City on Sunday.<br /><br />As was shown against Newcastle, the champions can be vulnerable when asked to defend. At St James’ Park the other night, a whiff of complacency also hung in the air. In truth, though, I can’t see that continuing. Pep Guardiola will be getting stuck into his players over the next couple of days to try and prevent any kind of repeat. And if City play like they can on the front foot, their defensive weaknesses are unlikely to be exposed. That said, Lacazette doesn’t need many invitations just now. Arsenal’s latest No. 9 is doing the shirt proud</p>

You can play in the Champions League. You can attract Champions League players which is important. Yes, winning the Europa League would be brilliant not least because it would get them into the Champions League if they could do it. But a finish in the top four says something different. It’s a statement of intent, it says you’re not a cup team, it says you’re one of the best four teams in the country. That’s where Arsenal have been for an awfully long time before the last couple of years and that’s where they need to get back to</p>

Picking <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a>, <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Alexandre Lacazette</a> and new-boy <a href="nicolas-pepe.html">Nicolas Pepe</a> might be a step too far. For a start, it may grant too much encouragement to the home side’s free-running full-backs, <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> and <a href="andy-robertson.html">Andy Robertson</a>. Constantly tracking back with this pair wouldn’t suit <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> and Pepe. One option is to play <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> through the middle, from where he did so well in the opener at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>.<br /><br />I couldn’t help but admire the striker’s clever runs off the ball to offer a target. We all know he’s fast, but there was a cunning to his movement that made life tough for his opponents. Drifting off shoulders, staying out of eye lines, he offered a constant threat. While leading the line on his own doesn’t come naturally, <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>’s movement could be used against a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> backline that seems to be defending a little higher this season. Such a combination would lead to several offside calls, which is where the present way of officiating leaves me frustrated.<br /><br />I’m not talking about VAR deciding whether a goal should be chalked off for offside - that’s fairly clear cut - but if <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> escapes down the left, for instance, and the linesman incorrectly thinks he’s off, the flag will go up and everyone stops. But who can say whether that move would have led to a goal? Because VAR doesn’t get involved here, you could argue that the new system takes away more than it gives</p>

  <p><b>[Alan Smith says <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> capable of following in <a href="mike-ashley.html">Ashley</a> Cole’s footsteps]</b> I’ve got to mention <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a>’s contribution <b>[against Liege]</b> because the way he has performed in his first two appearances for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> suggest the left-back is capable of following in the footsteps of greats like Kenny Sansom, <a href="nigel-winterburn.html">Nigel Winterburn</a> and <a href="mike-ashley.html">Ashley</a> Cole. Swift, skilful and tough, the young Scotsman’s crossing ability especially appeals.<br /><br />For any striker, it’s very handy to know when the ball is coming in so you can make your run with real confidence. <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Tierney</a> doesn’t mess about. A sharp shift and whip has become a trademark already. It reminded me of the wonderful service provided by Brian Marwood in our 1988-89 title-winning season. Brian didn’t always feel the need to beat his man. He’d chop the ball inside before curling in a beauty, a move that created lots of goals that year for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s No.9. And similar service from <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Tierney</a> wouldn’t have escaped <b>[Pierre-Emerick]</b> <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>’s attention<br /><br /><b>[Brazilian starlet <a href="gabriel-martinelli.html">Gabriel Martinelli</a> maintaining his fine start to life in England with a brace in a 4-0 win]</b> It’s not as if <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are desperate for striking alternatives just now. <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> is in the form of his life, tucking away chances with magnificent assurance. Factor in the excellent <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Alexandre Lacazette</a>, once fit, and <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> isn’t short of quality options through the middle. <a href="gabriel-martinelli.html">Gabriel Martinelli</a>, however, is quickly providing a choice. Following on from his brace against <a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a>, another two goals to soften up Standard Liege spoke of a teenager going places fast. We hear he is better suited long term to a role on the wing, the position where he made his name at Ituano in Brazil. But his clever movement here suggested otherwise. The near-post dash across his marker to glance home a marvellous header. The skilful shimmy and shot to curl in the second. These aren’t the hallmarks of a winger filling in. They point to a front man with natural goalscoring instincts. At 18, <a href="gabriel-martinelli.html">Martinelli</a> obviously has much to learn. Pitted against better defenders, his hold-up play will need to gain nous. He’ll have to get stronger to protect the ball. But the basic ingredients are in place. He doesn’t need telling how to find space in the box - a wonderful asset for the challenge ahead</p>

He’s young, has a good attitude, and has the good makings of a centre-half. He used three at the back again, which seems to give him some stability. <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Tierney</a> is the big plus point; he’s been unlucky with injury since arriving at the club, but he strikes me as an old-school type defender, a young lad that will only get better. There’s obviously loads to do at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, a great deal to do, but as with any good team you have to start from the back, and that’s what <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> will be trying to do to give them some stability in results. I think under <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> they have shown a bit more steel and backbone at times, but it’s a long old job. Of course <a href="william-saliba.html">Saliba</a> is going to arrive at the club before too long, and from what I hear, scouts at Europe’s biggest clubs can’t believe he escaped the net, they can’t believe they didn’t get him instead of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, so that bodes well. He’s been excellent for St Etienne in the <b>[Virgil]</b> <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">van Dijk</a> mold, in terms of his ability on the ball<br /><br />I think it’s the way forward for Arsenal; they can’t buy ready-made talent, they need to nurture players and improve them on the training field, which I believe <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> can do. Players with potential like <a href="william-saliba.html">Saliba</a>, <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Tierney</a>, Holding, plus Bellerin can get better, so they are the back four as well as those other characters you’ve got; Luiz, Sokratis <b>[<a href="sokratis-papastathopoulos.html">Papastathopoulos</a>]</b>, <b>[Shkodran]</b> <a href="shkodran-mustafi.html">Mustafi</a>, so there is something to go on there. You just want them to have a free run now, without injury problems</p>

  <p><b>[What is going on with <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a>?]</b> It seems that <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> wants to draw a line under it, and convince the players he’s not part of the plans, and he’s passed the buck to <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> and said: ‘What do you want to do about it?’ Hopefully leave the club would be <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a>’s reasoning. That would free up a bit of money in terms of his wages<br /><br />It’s always going to be a talking point for as long as <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>’s at the club. I don’t know whether anything could happen in this transfer window, there aren’t too many links with any clubs. We might end up having this situation for another year until his contract runs out.

He’s got enough on his plate, without constant questions about the German’s future. But <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> is decisive; if he decides somebody doesn’t fit in going forward, no matter how much they’re earning, he’s not going to pick them. That’s strong management, and I think <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> need that<br /><br />Can he fit in at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>? No, I don’t think so. This is an era at the club where everybody has to really dig in and work incredibly hard off the ball. <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> is too long in the tooth to change his game now, and I don’t think physically he is capable of doing what <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> wants him to do, either<br /><br />It might be another year before he leaves the club, but I can’t see much of a future there for him</p>
