  <p><b>[Shrewsbury manager Sam Ricketts felt his side could have pushed for a winner until <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> sent on <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> and <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> in the closing stages]</b> For five, 10 minutes I was thinking, ‘Let’s go and get this’. As the game goes on and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> bring on <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> and <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>, it changed a little bit, alarm bells were ringing. I said to the lads, ‘You could have won it, but you all wanted to go to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, didn’t you!</p>

  <p><b>[Shrewsbury manager Sam Ricketts praise his side as the League One outfit fought back from two goals down to earn an FA Cup replay against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> They were excellent, they really were. I told the players at half time that the game was there for them. The belief within the group is unbelievable, for a new group they have a never say die attitude<br /><br />Jason Cummings came on and he’s a goalscorer. I was waiting and waiting to put him on then I finally did and he gets the chances and takes them. If we’d won it definitely would have been the biggest moment of my career. The game was there for us but I couldn’t ask for any more, they’ve taken a team that’s very, very good all the way. I can count on one hands the amount of the times we’ve not turned up this season. We have to take this belief and use it to help us grow. I’ve been here 18 months but the club is six months into a long-term project. We do everything within our means, we’re just trying to build a squad to challenge higher up from a solid base</p>

  <p><b>[Shrewsbury manager Sam Ricketts has revealed that he offered <a href="joe-hart.html">Joe Hart</a> a chance to return to the club after the former <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> star was released by <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> following a two-year spell at Turf Moor]</b> In terms of interest, from our part yes. Joe would have an interest, but not so much as in coming back to play. He’s still at a level where he can play at a much higher level, not just in this country but abroad as well. It’s something that I put to him and his people, I said ‘do you fancy coming back?’. But he’s ready to continue his career at the highest possible level. He has interest from top-level teams so it’s not going to be one for us. Sentiment doesn’t rule the head on this one</p>
