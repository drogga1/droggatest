<blockquote>
  <p>[Manchester City star Kevin De Bruyne is determined to replace Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo at the top of the world game] He hated to lose and sometimes it was not easy for other players. He sees everything quicker and he always did. He would complain because other players were not at the level. Now he has the players around him and he will get better. You see him growing. Maybe he doesn’t say it - and it’s good that he doesn’t - but I think he wants to be the best. Everybody’s talking about Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi of course, and you see their statistics for goals and assists but he wants to be close and he will keep going. Messi and Ronaldo will start to fade in a few years and Kevin will still be on his way to the top. I think this is a target. He doesn’t talk too much about it. When he talks he’s calm and relaxed. He doesn’t say stupid things - he’s not a man who talks big - but he works hard and, in his heart, he knows what he wants.</p>
