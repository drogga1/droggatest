  <p>[Mohamed Salah is an exceptional player but not a world-class football star] He is an exceptional player, but [he is] not a world-class football star who can compete for the [World Cup] Golden Boot. Right now [the contenders for the award] are Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar and maybe [Harry] Kane. Liverpool uses Salah properly, here, in the Egyptian national team, things will be different.<br /><br />The team is getting ready for Egypt. I played against [Egypt head coach Hector] Cuper’s teams before, he is the most tactical coach, you never know how to approach his teams. Any chance we might have we should use [in that match]</p>

  <p>[Denis Cheryshev - From Real Madrid flop to Russia’s World Cup hero] My son is happy. He is experiencing the happy side of football after everything that has happened. Now it is time to enjoy, but also to work harder. He has always believed in his abilities.</p>

  <p>[Denis Cheryshev’s father is open to his son making a return to Real Madrid] Today, I’m pleased to see that Denis has confidence in himself, and that at every match, his level of investment and work is increasing. He is taking more and more initiative and he’s trying to do even more work, both defensive and finishing. For me, and I speak as a coach and not as a father, I am satisfied with 90 per cent of the work he does this season.<br /><br />The World Cup helped him, and by scoring a lot of goals in the finest competition, every football player feels his wings growing. So those of Denis have grown and today he believes in himself and in his abilities<br /><br />You know, when he belonged to Real Madrid, he was often on loan and as soon as he signed his first contract he was loaned out because there was little opportunity to play. At one point, he came back and began to accumulate playing time. But in the middle of the season, he realised that in order to deal with Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale and other stars of the team, there is a need to play and prove his value. Having had very little opportunities, it was difficult for him to compete. But what I see is that every time Denis was loaned, he always came back to Real. Because the club did not want to let him go. At one point, they decided to let him go to Villarreal once and for all. In this team, he played a year but as the club was in an unstable situation, that’s why they released him also. But, sure if he had only played in one club during this period, there would have been consistency and it would have been profitable. A come back to Real Madrid in the future? In Russian language, we always say ‘never say never’</p>
