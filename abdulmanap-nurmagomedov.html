  <p><b>[Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov explains how he prepares Shamil Zavurov for his future fight]</b> High mountain training, 1700 meters above sea level in a pine forest. Dagestan is a mountainous country. It presents its own challenges and benefits. In the elevation of the mountains, we train for 45 days; this helps prepare Shamil and get him into as best as shape as possible<br /><br /><b>[Coach Nurmagomedov sees big things in Shamil’s future]</b> I feel the main things needed to be a successful fighter are a high level of commitment, an education, eagerness to learn all facets of the sport and a good upbringing. He has very few weaknesses if any. He’s incredibly disciplined and gifted with natural speed and genetics</p>

  <p><b>[Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov explains Khabib will likely require surgery and will be sidelined for a total of five months]</b> Khabib injured his meniscus. The diagnosis is confirmed. They will operate in the next few days in Los Angeles. He can fight again only in five months; two months for recovery after surgery and another three for a training camp<br /><br /><b>[Abdulmanap also confirmed that Khabib injured his right knee, which is the same one that troubled him last year]</b> In July, he had torn anterior ligament and medial meniscus. Now the meniscus is damaged. I do not know whether internal or external<br /><br /><b>[The long-time coach expressed his disappointment with the situation, as he believes Khabib was perfectly prepared for his encounter later this month]</b> He weighs 80 kg right now. He was perfectly prepared. He always worked with his doctor to take the injection for his knee. Two 15-minute sparring sessions with rotating sparing partners - Khabib was working at a very good pace</p>

  <p><b>[Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov discusses his son’s recovery and whether ican Kickboxing Academy is to blame for the injuries]</b> Khabib’s recovery is normal, according to the plan. He was treated in Las Vegas. In the meantime, he carries out only the work that is available in his physical state. After a month or two, I hope we will be able to start with Khabib’s full training<br /><br /><b>[While Abdulmanap won’t deny that ican Kickboxing Academy has some ‘traumatic’ sparring sessions, he believes it is the price one must pay to have a gym full of champions and title contenders]</b> Yes, I agree that there is a lot of sparring at AKA. Yes, it can be traumatic, even that you cannot argue. But, look in this room, there are two UFC champions - Cain Velasquez and Daniel Cormier, a contender for the middleweight belt, Luke Rokhold, and Khabib close to the fight for the title. That is a selection that no other gym can boast. They have to continue to train in the same vein</p>

We’ll wait for three months and at the fourth, we need an opponent. Let them give us any opponent. Even at 77 kgs <b>[welterweight]</b>. At this moment, it is better to fight with <a href="tony-ferguson.html">Tony Ferguson</a> – just to nail this thing down</p>

  <p><b>[Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov claim that <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> was never seen as a serious threat to his son’s UFC lightweight crown]</b> <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> never seemed like a tough opponent to me. He was a showman. My favorite fight of his is with Rafael dos Anjos. I’ll explain why: Before the dos Anjos fight, we trained for three months in the mountains. We put in the most work of our lives in those mountains. Khabib was ready as ever<br /><br />I tell him: ‘Khabib, if you win, I’ll be making conclusions for you and myself’<br />He says: ‘What conclusions?’<br />I tell him: ‘He’s a real championship contender’<br />He says: ‘Let him go through me, then he’ll be champion’<br /><br />He <b>[Khabib Nurmagomedov]</b> was then out of action for two years. He had four surgeries, then a broken rib. He didn’t perform for more than two years<br /><br />Dos Anjos became champion, then later Khabib became champion. It turned out it was a fight between two champions, and Khabib had full advantage. They were in their prime<br /><br />After dos Anjos lost his belt, Khabib went from fourth to second place in the rankings. He didn’t even fight for two years. Dos Anjos dominated everyone he fought against and became champion. That’s why I think it’s his best fight</p>

At the moment we have our most crucial moment, when he have to hold the best fight in the history of the UFC. Twelve against 12 in a series of victories <b>[in the UFC]</b> and all the fans are waiting for this fight. We’ve been preparing for this fight for more than a year. Five months and the fight <b>[with Tony Ferguson]</b> should take place. First of all we will need to do some boxing training and we need a camp - with Lomachenko Sr for half a year. Why not!</p>
