  <p><b>[He’s moving around everywhere, he finds that back line. The chances he has are incredible. He always finds himself at the right place at the right time]</b> Dom was moving off the ball very well so I was always looking for him. He moves very well off the ball and I think that makes everything easier for me so I love playing with someone like that.</p>

  <p><b>[USA’s win against Ghana]</b> They were pressing a lot on our No. 6 and our No. 8, Kellyn and Dax. That’s when I had the opportunity to move in behind them and look for little spaces. That’s where I was trying to look. Dom was moving off the ball very well, so I was always looking for him.<br /><br />I think my short-term goals have come very fast. Coming back to Tijuana helped me a lot. This past season we had a great run. Just being back with the national team is exciting. I feel a little more mature, and I’m just excited</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a> midfielder Joe Corona says that it was a privilege to play alongside <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> Ibrahimovic]</b> <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> is a personality. Unique. He had his moments like we all do. From my point of view, it was a privilege to play alongside a player who’s a soccer legend. To be his teammate you have stories that you remember and you can laugh about<br /><br /><b>[Even in victory, the Swedish star always called for more from his <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a> teammates]</b> I think it was a game that we won, something like 3-0. The game was over and he came in and scolded all of us. We had won and we all played really well. So he’s a player who demanded a lot. There were times that he was in a good mood and on some days he didn’t even give you a good morning. We all knew him. That’s how he was and that’s what his personality was. On a personal level I never had a problem with him. On the field he demanded a lot. But we always had a great relationship. And it was a privilege to play with him</p>
