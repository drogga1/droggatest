  <dd>Brave Young Lions undone by defensive mistakes and strange selections. England’s dramatic 4-2 loss to Romania on Friday may not mathematically spell the end of their European Under-21 Championship hopes - but it is only a matter of time, with France only needing a draw against Croatia later in the evening to confirm the Young Lions’s elimination</dd>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[The girlfriend of Romania Under-21 international Cristian Manea was hospitalised following a brawl after the European Championship clash with France in Cesena on Monday night]</b> There was an incident at the end of the game. Cristian Manea was going to his girlfriend when someone pushed her away to take a photo with him. His girlfriend’s brother wanted to help her but he was punched by an unknown attacker. Manea’s girlfriend was also knocked over during the incident and suffered an injury to her face. She was immediately taken to the hospital but was soon released and is okay now. Manea wasn’t involved in the fighting at all. The police are investigating the incident, though, and they are presently looking for the person or persons who punched the brother of Manea’s girlfriend</p>
