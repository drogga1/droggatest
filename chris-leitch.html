  <p><b>[On Nick Lima]</b> First and foremost he’s a competitor. The kid can out-jump most anyone, and speed wise you’re not going to outdo him. Those things are going to make sure he can compete in this league, but the thing that’s going to make him shine is that he also has really good quality on the ball. He’s got a midfielder’s touch and vision, a forward’s shot, and he can cross like an out-and-out winger</p>

  <p><b>[On Tommy Thompson]</b> I think if you’re going to have a player like Tommy on the ball in the final third, you have to also be OK with him taking risks. If you can communicate that with that player: when to take risks versus when to play it safe, and give him the liberty to try stuff and to express himself in dangerous parts of the field … I think that’s hopefully what an attacking player would want to hear.<br /><br />You’re seeing what he always possessed. You’re seeing what I’ve always known he possesses, which is, especially for an American player, this really unique and great ability in the attacking third</p>
