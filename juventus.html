  <p><b>[Juventus fan Kevin Prota tattoos club logo on his back]</b> For me Juventus is a passion, a feeling. One day I found myself thinking how I could make the bond even stronger, and I said to myself: ‘Why not get a tattoo of the logo?’. And in the end I did it! I have not thought much about other people’s thoughts, the body is mine - I think I am allowed to tattoo something that belongs to me.<br /><br />I found out by chance. I received a message from a friend in a Whatsapp group saying to me, ‘Kevin, look, Juventus have a new logo!’. At first I did not want to believe it, I thought it was one of those pissed on the internet. <b>[On Tuesday]</b> morning, when I opened the app that I use to keep me updated on the team’s news, however, I realised that they really had changed the logo. After a moment of disbelief I was able to laugh, so what’s done is done. Also, my right shoulder is still free, so there is still room for the new emblem. I honestly prefer the old, but I’ll have no choice but to get used to it<br /><br />Andrea, next time maybe do an interview before <b>[the announcement]</b>, give me a call, write me a letter or send a fax so I might wait a moment and not be behind the times</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus have completed a €10 million deal to sign Riccardo Orsolini from Ascoli]</b> With strong technique, physicality, positional sense and dribbling ability all in his locker, the left-footed winger Orsolini has emerged as one of the revelations of this Serie B season. Born in Rotella, a village within the province of Ascoli Piceno, the 19-year-old has risen through Ascoli’s youth ranks to become an ever-present in the first team so far in 2016/17. Orsolini exploded onto the scene last season with Ascoli’s Primavera, netting 17 times in 21 league appearances, as well as bagging a further three in the Viareggio Cup and two in the Coppa Italia. Such form saw him instantly promoted to the first team for the second half of the 2015/16 campaign and he has taken his game to another level still this term scoring four goals and providing four assists from his wide forward position.</p>
