  <p><b>[Juventus fan Kevin Prota tattoos club logo on his back]</b> For me Juventus is a passion, a feeling. One day I found myself thinking how I could make the bond even stronger, and I said to myself: ‘Why not get a tattoo of the logo?’. And in the end I did it! I have not thought much about other people’s thoughts, the body is mine - I think I am allowed to tattoo something that belongs to me.<br /><br />I found out by chance. I received a message from a friend in a Whatsapp group saying to me, ‘Kevin, look, Juventus have a new logo!’. At first I did not want to believe it, I thought it was one of those p***** on the internet. <b>[On Tuesday]</b> morning, when I opened the app that I use to keep me updated on the team’s news, however, I realised that they really had changed the logo. After a moment of disbelief I was able to laugh, so what’s done is done. Also, my right shoulder is still free, so there is still room for the new emblem. I honestly prefer the old, but I’ll have no choice but to get used to it<br /><br />Andrea, next time maybe do an interview before <b>[the announcement]</b>, give me a call, write me a letter or send a fax so I might wait a moment and not be behind the times</p>
