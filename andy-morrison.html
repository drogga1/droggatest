  <p><b>[Andy Morrison says <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> centre-forward <a href="gabriel-jesus.html">Gabriel Jesus</a> can be one of the best in the world if he continues on his current trajectory]</b> I think he can be one of the best in the world, I really do. Look at his age - his all-round play has improved since he came in, and I think he’s got it all. His work rate has improved. I don’t think he’s a scorer of great goals, he just scores a lot of goals. It doesn’t really matter how he gets them; tap ins, he’s an instinctive finisher, close range, he’s very sharp in the box<br /><br />I can’t picture a goal where he’s stepped past a couple of players and banged one in the top corner the way <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> does, but he gets goals. He’s quick, he’s strong, and he’s very instinctive. Everything is there, and the run of games he has is a great opportunity. What he does have is an unbelievable inner belief. He thinks he should be in the team, he thinks he’s the best striker in the league and that’s a testament to his character. Now it’s just up to him to prove that</p>

  <p><b>[Andy Morrison says <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a> is the standout candidate to inherit <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s armband]</b> It’s not just what you see on the pitch on a matchday, it’s how players carry themselves, that humility. Being humble is a trait. I don’t know the characters of the players to say ‘he’s got outstanding captain’s qualities’ but I’ve always been incredibly fond of <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a>. He’s not just an outstanding footballer but the way he conducts himself. He’s got such a strong mentality and he’s a proper man. When I look at him, he’s a player everyone at the club would follow, the players would follow him. I’ve often said it’s not about the title of captain that players follow, it’s the courage. <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a>’s got that in abundance and for me he would be a standout candidate<br /><br />He’s been incredible. I’m not sure how long he’s been at the club now, but I spoke very early on about the strength he brought and over the last two, three years every pundit is talking about him being one of the best holding midfielders in world football. I said that seven, eight years ago, just how good he was. It’s nice that he’s now getting the praise he absolutely deserves. He is an absolutely incredible footballer. His intelligence, his reading of the game, he’s seconds ahead of anybody else. We talk about <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a>, <b>[Sergio]</b> <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a>, but <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a>’s always been my favourite player at the club<br /><br />With a club the size of City, the expectations are so great now. We’ve got a manager we want to keep going forward, so we’ve got to go out and target the best players. We’ve got to find a way of getting them to be able to keep the appetite of the manager. He wants to go out and win the Champions League, <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, he wants to win cups. So targeting the best players out there and available and always looking to improve in every area. That’s irrelevant of whether they are left-wing, centre-back, left-back, if a player is available and can improve us, and working within a structured budget, we have to show the manager we’re working hard to bring in the very best players</p>
