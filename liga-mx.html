  <p><b>[The Club Tijuana superfan was on a tour of the city of Queretaro. Juan Jesus Corona said]</b> We’re taking advantage of the trip because we’re already here. We went to the stadium and took some photos with our tickets in hand, just to show that we were there and had tickets to go the day there was supposed to be a game in this stadium - of course we were outside the stadium! And then we took in the sights in the beautiful city of Queretaro, learning a bit of the history of our country. It’s been a nice time. Of course, we didn’t come for this, we came for football, but since there was no football we took advantage of the chance to do other things.</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin Lopez, who traveled from the Houston suburb of Spring, Texas, to Monterrey with his family in hopes of seeing his first Liga MX match in person]</b> I had already been here before, but no matter what I did my mind was still thinking, like, ‘What if the game hadn’t been canceled?’.<br /><br />Well, when I was packing my bags I read that the Friday game had been canceled and that there was rumors about the whole jornada being suspended. I was optimistic and thought, ‘They’ll make a deal. They’ll find the middle ground and only the Friday game will be canceled. There’s no fucking way our greedy FMF will let all of these games be canceled’.<br /><br />I already have plane tickets for the next game, which is in Guadalajara, I have them for the game also in Tuxtla Gutierrez against Chiapas, I have a flight for Monterrey. Those are the three games we close with. If this continues, I have the tickets bought, the hotels paid for, they’re not going to refund me, so, well, what am I left going to do? Nothing more to do than enjoy the trip. There’s a lot to see in our country, a lot of beautiful cities. So I’d take advantage of that. It’s a risk we’ve already taken</p>

  <p><b>[Facebook Live offers American fans new access to MLS and Liga MX. Eric Ratchman, executive vice president of content distribution at Univision, said]</b> We’ve been experimenting with digital platforms for a while and I really see this as the next wave of television. Facebook is making a push into live TV now with sports. They started experimenting last year and they did a few things but now they are really making a push into live events.<br /><br />Liga MX is the No. 1 soccer league in this country and the focus has been on Spanish up to this point. I just don’t think that anybody has really looked to explore building the audience around English up to this point and I think that we are the first to do that<br /><br />A fun part about this platform is that our users get to engage directly with the content, with fellow fans and with us<br /><br />There will be the opportunity to generate advertising revenue down the road. Facebook is still building out their capabilities in the advertising space</p>
