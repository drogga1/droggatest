  <p><b>[Attacking midfielder Jackson Irvine has scored nine goals to help Burton Albion in their quest to stave off relegation from the English Championship]</b> Each gap between each camp gives you the chance to go back to your club and find a new vein of form that will make you available for selection and hopefully be a part of the boss’s plans for the games. My approach has always been the same; just try and keep playing as many games as possible and try and learn and develop and if that sees me be a part of the Socceroos squad and starting team then that’s a reward for your form.<br /><br /><b>[Irvine also speak about the national team’s growing quality on the world stage]</b> It’s a testament to how Australian football’s come that it’s an expectation now that we should be there. We’ve sort of proven ourselves at that level now and we need to keep pushing. It’s not just about qualifying for World Cups now, we need to do well and progress and go further than any Australian team has before. That’s got to be the goal. As difficult as it is, you need to believe that if you keep playing the right way and believing in the system that we have that it will get us to the next level</p>

  <p><b>[Jackson Irvine delighted to debut, disappointed with draw]</b> I was incredibly pleased and honoured to make my first start. It’s something you dream about as a kid and something I’ve given everything to try to achieve over the last 12 months. I’m obviously delighted from a personal point of view that’s come today for myself and my family and friends. Such a short time after the game, the over-riding feeling is still disappointment, but I’m sure I’ll grasp the magnitude of what I’ve achieved personally, but it’s hard to enjoy it at this time. That feeling will probably sink in a little bit later on.<br /><br />If we’d carried on and got the second before half-time or straight after half-time, it might have killed the game a little bit more. We offered them a chance to come back into the game and a team with nothing to lose can throw everything at you and that’s what they did and that led to them getting the equaliser. We’re disappointed overall, but there are a few good signs to take from the game<br /><br />We’ve got an incredibly strong squad with a lot of boys in the same position as me, ready and willing and firing to step in and do a job. I thought Jimmy <b>[Troisi]</b> did a really good job when he came off the bench and we’ve got Millsy <b>[Mark Milligan]</b> who can step forward into midfield and Musti <b>[Mustafa Amini]</b> and Riley <b>[McGree]</b> as well. There are plenty of options and everyone will be chomping to get that starting spot because it’s looking like a must-win game now</p>

  <p><b>[Socceroos midfielder Jackson Irvine labelled his maiden goal for Australia an incredibly special moment]</b> To get us off the mark with a goal was perfect. We’ve shown how lethal we can be from set plays over the course of this qualification campaign. Absolutely delighted. Such a proud moment, especially to do it on home soil in front of my family. An incredibly special moment<br /><br />We focus on set plays massively but not more than we focus on the rest of our play. Both corners come from the football we like to play. However the goals come, they’re all from the training ground, they’re by design. Nothing we do happens by chance<br /><br />We just keep going about our business the same that we have been. There’s been a lot of white noise from the outside this week for us but we’ve all been calm and focusing on what we’re trying to do. We played three at the back at Burton for the first half of the season - formations are formations, it doesn’t take away from our style, the principals of what we try to do. Whatever shape we play we know the principals stay the same</p>

  <p><b>[Jackson Irvine named Burton Albion’s best player]</b> I am so unbelievably honoured and pleased to be given the three awards. To be held in such high regard by players and fans is so overwhelming, I got quite emotional up there on the stage. When you see your season played out in front of you, you see what you’ve been through together. To be given the individual plaudits is pleasing but you could see how much it meant to everybody involved. I couldn’t be more delighted.</p>

  <p><b>[Jackson Irvine is relishing his transformation into a goal-scoring midfielder over the past season]</b> They tweaked my position in that way to push me a little more advanced and I never really saw myself as much of a goal threat. I didn’t see that as being my main contribution to the team but it turned out that way.<br /><br />Probably should have had another couple if I’d managed to find the corner with a couple more headers but it’s absolutely - every time I get out there - that’s my main threat, to get in the box and try and score goals, but also get in those holes and play between the thirds and try and be a threat creatively as well<br /><br />I think a lot of people saw <b>[joining Burton]</b> as a bit of a gamble, as much as my move to Ross County before that - people probably saw it in that way as well. Probably not the most glamorous moves and clubs that people haven’t heard a lot about but these clubs have done absolute wonders for me, and they’ve definitely pushed my career forward so much and playing regularly games - I think I’ve played 100 games in two seasons now - and that’s been so vital for my development</p>
