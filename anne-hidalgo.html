  <p><b>[Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo revealed that Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland fans are set to receive the Medal of the City of Paris]</b> The supporters from Ireland and Northern Ireland have distinguished themselves by their exemplary attitude, fair play and good mood. They had a very positive attitude, cheerful. They have been exemplary. We wanted to say ‘thank you’.</p>

  <p><b>[French capital’s mayor calls on wantaway <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> to knuckle down]</b> I’m going to have to help you win. I like football and I like this team. I support them thoroughly and we turn the Eiffel Tower red and blue - the colours of Paris and <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. We love you a lot. You’ll have to give your all to help us win the Champions League<br /><br /><b>[Hidalgo, though, is still hanging her hopes on the 27-year-old forward, but believes he has to improve his attitude and get the fans on his side]</b> He has to come back down to earth a little bit. He has to help the team that signed him. Paris has received him well, and he may have a few issues with the supporters, but if <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> gives us what we know he can give I think that everything will be forgiven</p>
