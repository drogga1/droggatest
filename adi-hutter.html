  <p><b>[Frankfurt coach Adi Hutter comments on Ante Rebic]</b> It may be that <b>[Ante Rebic]</b> is looking for a new challenge and wants to take the next step</p>

Reds manager Klopp is now a three-time Coach of the Year winner in Germany - a feat previously only achieved by Felix Magath. The European champion made for an obvious choice as he finished 44 votes clear of second-placed Friedhelm Funkel, the mastermind behind Fortuna Dusseldorf’s unexpected 10th-place finish in the Bundesliga. Eintracht Frankfurt head coach Adi Hutter pipped Bayern Munich boss Niko Kovac to third</p>

  <p><b>[Eintracht Frankfurt manager Adi Hutter has issued an ultimatum to forward Ante Rebic after a poor showing in his side’s surprise 1-0 defeat to Strasbourg]</b> If he wants to stay here, I want him to show it. If not, we have to find a solution. When you play for Eintracht Frankfurt, I want you to give everything you’ve got. I didn’t see that from him today. We’ll sit down with him and talk plainly</p>

  <p><b>[An own goal from Strasbourg’s Stefan Mitrovic in the 26th minute levelled the play-off tie on aggregate at Commerzbank-Arena. Eintracht were dealt a blow on the stroke of half-time when star Ante Rebic was sent off, but the hosts still managed to prevail thanks to Filip Kostic’s stunning free-kick and a Danny da Costa strike after Dimitri Lienard saw red for Strasbourg]</b> It’s important for Eintracht Frankfurt to be in the draw. The sense of unity between the fans, the coaching staff and the players is what got us through. Filip played brilliantly and showed just how valuable he is. Ante also had a very good game. Daichi Kamada deserves praise too</p>

  <p><b>[Eintracht head coach Adi Hutter that if Ante Rebic wished to remain with the club, he needed to show it on the field]</b> It was Ante’s wish to join a big club, and all involved are happy about the situation</p>

  <p><b>[Adi Hütter on Timothy Chandler]</b> It seems strange to say it like this, but he’s a cool guy, simple as that! Timmy has a lot of experience and, alongside Marco Russ and Kevin Trapp, he’s got the dressing room under control. Sometimes he’s like a little kid who’s just having fun. He’s a really nice guy and keeps everyone entertained. But when he’s out on the pitch he knows when to turn it on<br /><br />When you play with four at the back and one of the full-backs goes forward then you still have three defenders at the back. Previously we only used to have two staying back a lot of the time, and that was sometimes quite risky<br /><br />Other teams analyse us and have obviously seen that we’re brilliant down the left with Filip Kostic, so they close down the spaces really well on that side of the pitch<br /><br />You could see that in the friendly against Hertha Berlin during our winter training camp, and <a href="timothy-chandler.html">Timothy Chandler</a>’s scored three goals since then. It’s really impressive to see how he’s fought back from a long injury lay-off and how he’s developed. I’m delighted for him.</p>
