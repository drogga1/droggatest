  <p><b>[Frankfurt’s forward trio more potent than Liverpool trident]</b> There are players who need relatively few scoring chances. Luka Jovic, for example, scores four times out of every five chances because he’s a poacher and, when he’s in the box, he knows where the goal is. You always have to be careful with superlatives. But for me he has the potential to become a world-class striker.</p>

That’s good, it provides peace and security</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea vs Eintracht Frankfurt]</b> I believe that as a footballer there is nothing more beautiful than these international games. On Thursday I think that we are getting our heads free again. Of course we will speak about the defeat as well. With the way we played, we have little chance on Thursday. But I am convinced that the team will show a different side again</p>

  <p><b>[An own goal from Strasbourg’s Stefan Mitrovic in the 26th minute levelled the play-off tie on aggregate at Commerzbank-Arena. <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Eintracht</a> were dealt a blow on the stroke of half-time when star Ante Rebic was sent off, but the hosts still managed to prevail thanks to Filip Kostic’s stunning free-kick and a Danny da Costa strike after Dimitri Lienard saw red for Strasbourg]</b> It’s important for <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> to be in the draw. The sense of unity between the fans, the coaching staff and the players is what got us through. Filip played brilliantly and showed just how valuable he is. Ante also had a very good game. Daichi Kamada deserves praise too</p>

  <p><b>[Adi Hütter on <a href="timothy-chandler.html">Timothy Chandler</a>]</b> It seems strange to say it like this, but he’s a cool guy, simple as that! Timmy has a lot of experience and, alongside Marco Russ and <a href="kevin-trapp.html">Kevin Trapp</a>, he’s got the dressing room under control. Sometimes he’s like a little kid who’s just having fun. He’s a really nice guy and keeps everyone entertained. But when he’s out on the pitch he knows when to turn it on<br /><br />When you play with four at the back and one of the full-backs goes forward then you still have three defenders at the back. Previously we only used to have two staying back a lot of the time, and that was sometimes quite risky<br /><br />Other teams analyse us and have obviously seen that we’re brilliant down the left with Filip Kostic, so they close down the spaces really well on that side of the pitch<br /><br />You could see that in the friendly against <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha Berlin</a> during our winter training camp, and <a href="timothy-chandler.html">Timothy Chandler</a>’s scored three goals since then. It’s really impressive to see how he’s fought back from a long injury lay-off and how he’s developed. I’m delighted for him.</p>
