  <p><b>[Laura Coombs says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> struggles shaped me into player I am now]</b> That’s really shaped me into who I am now. Obviously, we had some tough times at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and those do really push you. It wasn’t always easy for us in games, so it taught me a lot positionally, technically, tactically, as well<br /><br />That’s one of the main reasons I felt the time was right to leave <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I wanted to be back playing and competing in finals and title races. I felt like it was the right time in my career to do that and I’m really happy to be here<br /><br /><a href="nick-cushing.html">Nick Cushing</a>’s always been really good with me. He’s kept me in the loop, given me things that I could work on when I wasn’t fit and given me pointers for what he expects of my position. Before I joined <b>[Man City]</b>, when I was thinking about it, I spoke to past and present players and they all spoke really highly of him and it definitely edged my decision. At the end of the day, most players just want to improve or better themselves and everyone said, whether they’re here now or they’ve left, they’re a better player than they were when they came here. I came here to be better and I knew it would maybe take some time and I’m going to be patient with it, but I’m not here to make up the numbers. Nick is a great coach. He’s technically, tactically, one of the best I’ve worked with and I’m learning a lot from him<br /><br /><b>[Coombs says of a competitive and hungry dressing room]</b> It’s dog eat dog. Everyone pushes each other every day and everyone wants to be on the pitch and that reflects in training. Everyone does get on very well, but on the pitch it’s all business<br /><br />I really enjoyed my time at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I was a young player and it was great to get experience there. I went out on loan to continue that experience and get increased playing time, so I feel like it’s all been good to lead me to where I am today. I think everyone is pretty calm but focused <b>[ahead of Sunday]</b>. To us, it’s just a game, that kind of thing. It’s going to be tough, we know it’s going to be tough, but there are no easy games anymore or any given points. It should be a really good game. Whether you’re playing <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, any team in the league, it’s the teams who compete and want it more who win the game, more often than not. It doesn’t really matter if it’s your old team<br /><br /><b>[And as for any nerves or fear going into Sunday? Not a chance]</b> If you’re in a team like this, you have to really look forward to these games because they can have a big impact on who wins the title. I definitely look forward to these games</p>
