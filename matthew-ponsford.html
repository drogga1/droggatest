<blockquote>
  <p>For <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Fabio Cannavaro</a>, this legendary status was hard earned. At just 5 foot 9 inches tall, he wasn’t built to be the world’s greatest center back. And he certainly never expected to be named the world’s best player<br /><br />‘My parents every day said, ‘Ah, it’s better you go to school, it’s very important for your future’. But inside myself, I said: ‘I think the good way is follow the football’. Holding high the World Cup trophy at Berlin’s Olympiastadion eight years ago, his conviction had paid off<br /><br />The Azzurri defense, marshaled by <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Cannavaro</a>, yielded only two goals throughout the tournament – equaling the record set in 1998 by that night’s final opponent France – and fought doggedly through a scrappy match that was tied at 1-1 at the end of 90 minutes<br /><br /><a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Fabio Cannavaro</a> took part in four World Cup tournaments, first appearing as a 24-year-old:<br />- France ‘98: Quarterfinals (losing to France on penalties)<br />- Korea Japan 2002: Round of 16 (losing controversially to South Korea in extra time)<br />- Germany 2006: Champions (beating France on penalties)<br />- South Africa 2010: Group stages (finishing bottom in a weak group)<br /><br />Italy had exited three of the previous four World Cups on lost penalty shootouts (losing to Brazil in 1994 in the tournament’s only other final to be decided by penalties) but this time stepped up and slotted home all five chances from the spot</p>
