<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Manchester United have completed the signing of 15-year-old Coventry City starlet Charlie McCann]</b> When a big football club come knocking, and it is the club that Charlie supports, you must let him go and have that experience. We did not want to sell him, we did not need a fee for him even though there was a fee involved. He has been unbelievable for us, even making his England debut back in August.<br /><br />Charlie goes with complete support from me and the rest of the staff from the Academy. I have spent a lot of time with Charlie and I love the boy to pieces. I also have a lot of time for his family who are incredibly supportive. We will keep an eye on him and be here if he needs us. His parents told me that if it would have been any other club it would have been a firm no, but when it is the club that Charlie supports, that is football. Charlie goes with our full support</p>
