  <p><b>[<a href="cardiff-city-fc.html">Cardiff City</a> striker Craig Bellamy has revealed he is struggling to come to terms with the death of ex-team-mate and close friend <a href="gary-speed.html">Gary Speed</a>]</b> Losing my best mate has affected everything. I can’t believe how hard it is. It has had an effect on everything. He was the best mate I’ve ever had. All I know is that my best mate has gone. I’m struggling. I can’t lie.<br /><br />It’s sad but unfortunately it got to my marriage. I’m here and she’s there. I don’t know if that’s it for us. I’ve been living on my own for eight weeks now. There’s no one else involved. I wish there was. I wish I had someone and I wish she <b>[Claire]</b> had someone. That would make it easier. It’s hit me hard. It’s nothing to do with football and it’s nothing to do with me as a footballer. I couldn’t give a s*** about football. It’s about real people, human beings, kids and families. I can’t tell you how hard it is. It’s the worst time in my life ever</p>

  <p><b>[Craig Bellamy wrote in his autobiography about <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>]</b> What makes him so good? Well, there is nothing he can’t do. He is clever. He sees the game quicker than anyone else. He sees the picture. He can play the ball first time round corners that aren’t even there. He has got intelligence. He has got physical attributes. He can bomb past people. He is quick. He is a proper, powerful athlete. Give him a header, he will score. He can play in behind the front man. He can get the ball off the back four and control the game from the quarterback position. He is just an immense all-round footballer. I have never seen anyone put it all together like him, never seen someone with so many qualities. I have played with a lot of talented players, but he was better than any of them</p>

  <p><b>[Riyad Mahrez has been backed by Craig Bellamy]</b> He’s been a top player, he’s done a great job at Leicester. It’s a great time for him to move on. He’s just another option. I know it’s difficult obviously because of the money that they’ve spent but it was going to take that type of money to get him out of there. These players, attacking-wise, are costing that kind of money now. He just adds another dimension to what is already a fierce attack. But I’m just interested because I believe Guardiola is the best coach in the world at this present moment. I think he’s been the best coach in the world over the last six, seven, eight years. I’m interested to see how he improves Mahrez. The best thing with Guardiola, he improves players, he makes them better. Can he get Mahrez another level again? And if he can, that’s exciting for Man City.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United will be priced out of any move for Gareth Bale by the Real Madrid star’s wages]</b> Where could he go? Man United can’t pay his wages, nobody can. There’s only one club that can pay his wages. That’s the world he’s in at this moment. The wages he is he’ll have to take a massive wage cut to go elsewhere. And I’m sure he would do but realistically then is someone then going to go and buy him? How can a club go and spend £80m, £90m? I know Juventus did for Ronaldo but Ronaldo’s a different purpose, that’s a different world of business. But Gareth, how can you go and spend £80m,£90m, £100m for a player you’re not going to get any return on? Maybe as part of a part-exchange deal but Gareth won’t be part of any part-exchange deals, he’s too good a player for that. So I just don’t see it being a possible move for anyone to get anywhere near<br /><br /><b>[Bellamy also believes that Bale will benefit from Ronaldo’s departure]</b> It’s changed with Ronaldo going, I think it opens up. He needs to be the main man in a team and he deserves to be the main man in a team. I just believe now with Ronaldo going this might give him that opportunity to be that main man at that team. One of the greatest teams in the world, probably the greatest team in the world at this present moment because they’ve won three European Cups in a row. I don’t think any other club could get anywhere near trying to break the bank to get him, I think he’s out of everyone’s reach unless he decides to rip his contract up at Real Madrid but I just don’t see it being realistic</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal have already lost Aaron Ramsey]</b> I think they’ve lost him already - I think he’s gone. Come January or the summer, he’ll be going somewhere else. Four or five years ago, every club wanted him - Manchester City, Barcelona. I think it’s time for him to move on. He’s become conscious of some players that have stayed too long at Arsenal and not got the best out of their ability. He’s a tremendous footballer that has had injuries. Unai Emery will be a good manager for him but he needs a change. He’ll have a better chance of going to those top-end clubs if he’s on a free transfer.<br /><br />Arsenal have got to ask themselves some serious questions. It’s a great club, but whoever is letting people’s contracts run down is an absolute joke. You have to sign him. He brings goals to the midfield - he takes the pressure off the strikers. It’s Arsenal’s fault, they’ve allowed this to happen. In January, he’ll have clubs queuing up to sign him</p>

  <p><b>[Craig Bellamy has backed Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling to score as much as 30-40 goals in one season]</b> He’s going to get more goals. He’s going to get better. We were saying it last year when he was going through that period of missing opportunities, but he was still scoring a lot. He will get a big amount of goals again this year and there will be a season when he will get to 30 or 40 goals. I’m telling you now, he definitely will do. As long as he stays fit and everything goes well with his health, he will have a season where he just takes off.<br /><br />He gets unnecessary and unwarranted criticism, especially when he goes away with England, but Manchester City are better than England. When all of a sudden, you go away with England, it will obviously be a little bit more difficult because you haven’t got a Sergio Aguero or David Silva next to you or a Kevin De Bruyne who is going to be playing those passes through. Even at times at the World Cup, people were questioning what he was doing. If he’s not scoring, then he’s not doing anything - well I disagree with that completely. It’s unbelievable</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool can keep their Champions League dream alive]</b> The special nights that this club has been able to recreate time and time again at this special ground gives you hope straight away. This Napoli team is a very good team with a lot of very good footballers, but it is Anfield - and the Napoli players will be aware of that as well. I knew as soon as they lost the Red Star game it was going to come back to haunt them because PSG are an outstanding team. You don’t go and spend nearly £200m each on Kylian Mbappe and Neymar without being a game for anyone, especially on their home patch. I thought Liverpool did okay <b>[against PSG]</b>. They had a lot of possession and didn’t quite create the chances we know they’re capable of, especially with the forward line they have. But you know PSG are always dangerous on the counter-attack, so you can’t throw everyone at them. The Red Star game was the disappointing result. The loss was huge and I always thought the Napoli game at home was going to be the deciding game because of the quality of the teams in the group. It’s very rare you get three teams of the quality of Napoli, PSG and Liverpool all in the same group. I knew it was going to be a tough ask, but I have a lot of confidence because it’s Liverpool and they are at Anfield.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City are the right club and Pep Guardiola the right manager for Phil Foden]</b> He’s definitely with the right manager. He is getting game time, he is involved with the squad. He isn’t maybe getting enough games but he’s 18. How many 18-year-olds, at the level Manchester City are this present moment, are really getting regular game time, breaking into their teams? You always get the odd one, the odd two exceptions. You know <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi can go in and hold down his position but these are once-in-a-lifetime types of players. I do believe he has a future at Manchester City, with the players he’s training with and the manager. He’s going to learn so much and actually I do believe he’s going to come through the Man City ranks, get more game time as the season goes on. I wouldn’t say next year, I’d say the year after he’d be looking to hopefully establish himself in the first team.</p>

  <p><b>[Craig Bellamy says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> nowhere near <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> &amp; <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> Coronavirus hit, and it seemed to be quite a good time at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, everyone is talking about <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, but they are nowhere near these two clubs. Nowhere near. And it’s going to take a good three or four years to get near. The balance <b>[City and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> have in the team, the way they play, the intensity they play at, the pressing and understanding of what they’re doing, takes them well ahead. These two teams are a big gap ahead of anyone else<br /><br /><b>[Bellamy believes <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>’s men have missed <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a>]</b> The one player I think <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> has missed so much is <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a>. Just for the balance of the team, not just his pace, but don’t underestimate his pressing, how good he is at that. He’s been a big, big miss this season</p>
