  <p><b>[Yuto Nagatomo Thanks ‘Role Model’ <a href="javier-zanetti.html">Javier Zanetti</a> After Scoring First Goal For <a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a>]</b> I am the one who should be thanking Inter for this opportunity and everything they have given me during this period. I also thank the supporters, as my work is principally in defence and I’m not supposed to score goals, so what happened is a wonderful gift that I give to the club and the fans. <a href="leonardo.html">Leonardo</a> is a great coach, so I wanted to thank him by bringing over my joy for everything that he has done since I came here. When I arrived at Inter, communication was a little difficult but now everything is almost perfect and I am taking a lot of satisfaction from playing here. <a href="javier-zanetti.html">Zanetti</a> is my point of reference, my model to follow, the person who takes care of me, gives me advice and tells me the way</p>

  <p><b>[Yuto Nagatomo says Japan have to be wary of Qatar’s counterattack]</b> Qatar is a really good team. South Korea had more possession but Qatar hit on the counter as they defended in numbers. It was the same against UAE. We have to pay attention to the counterattacks. They are very fast and pacy and we need to keep an eye on it<br /><br /><b>[Nagatomo mentioned that his team have learnt their lesson on defending counterattacks the hard way and they will be ready to face the Qatar threat]</b> When we are attacking, the opposition can hit us on the counter. That is what we have learnt against Belgium. We made a mistake on the counter against them. We are certainly more experienced in how to deal with the threat of counterattacks<br /><br /><b>[The former <a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a> defender put up a strong performance against Iran in the semi-finals where he kept Alireza Jahanbaksh quiet for most parts]</b> I didn’t let him go free. I don’t want to lose an opponent in one-on-one situations especially in the final against Qatar. Iran didn’t like the running by Japan. I think it is very important to run throughout.</p>
