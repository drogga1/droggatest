  <p><b>[Fabian Castillo rediscovering form in Tijuana after regrettable FC Dallas departure]</b> I’m really thankful to God for giving me this position, the return. I was in a tough time in my career, I was a bit confused about what I really wanted and what I really could give to Xolos. Fortunately, (Pareja) arrived, and I think I’m rediscovering my level. I’m really thankful for the opportunities he’s given to me, and I have to respond to the confidence with good results and by supporting the team.<br /><br />Yes, yes, yes, yes. If I could turn back time, I think I would have stayed six more months in Dallas. But you can’t regret anything in life. It was a great challenge and now I’m here in Xolos enjoying my talents coming back and that’s really the only thing that’s important<br /><br />I’m really thankful to the coaching staff for giving me this chance. The important thing was the team, trying to get the result. I think we bounced back really well after such a tough loss against Pachuca. We had to find ourselves again, and I think this result helps show us we’re a good team and can fight for the league<br /><br />I felt good. At the end, I was talking with the manager. He told me he was going to give me five minutes more. We’d planned to do 75 minutes because I felt like I couldn’t do everything he was asking. He made the change, but I did all I could. Now I want to take advantage of the break that’s coming to get on the right path back</p>
