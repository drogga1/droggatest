  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> may be monitoring Jude Bellingham, but <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a> coach James Beattie has warned that potential is a dangerous word and the 16-year-old will dictate his own future]</b> Jude’s a very good player. He’s a very nice young man as well, which is very important. He’s a good person - but potential is a dangerous word. I think if Jude keeps his feet on the ground and keeps developing, then he’ll be a very, very good player. I just think there’s a lot of pressure on him at the moment. He handles it very well and I just think he needs the right sort of people around him giving him the right sort of advice. Like I say, if he keeps his feet on the ground and his head strong, which he’s more than capable of doing<br /><br />Jude’s best advice is to just concentrate on his football, let that do the talking, and then when it comes to the decision, makes sure it’s a decision that he’s happy with, and that he’s not making the decision on behalf of somebody else.</p>
