  <p><b>[q: What is your overall evaluation of <a href="yuto-nagatomo.html">Yuto Nagatomo</a>?]</b> <a href="yuto-nagatomo.html">Nagatomo</a> is an excellent player. Among the Japanese I have seen in Italy, only <b>[Hidetoshi]</b> <a href="hidetoshi-nakata.html">Nakata</a> at his peak was as impressive. I am not surprised that Inter hired him after the Asian Cup; <a href="yuto-nagatomo.html">Nagatomo</a> plays mostly in a role, left full-back, that at the moment sees very few top players worldwide. We don’t see many <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a> around anymore, right … ?<br /><br /><b>[q: do you think <a href="yuto-nagatomo.html">Nagatomo</a> is one of the best at the moment in that position?]</b> Absolutely, on the left flank he is one of the top 10 in the world, possibly top five. It is, of course, also a matter of tastes and also we need to consider how positions are more fluid nowadays. For example, <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> seemed to be the greatest rising star at left-back, but now he plays in a more offensive position<br /><br /><b>[q: Which of <a href="yuto-nagatomo.html">Nagatomo</a>’s characteristics justify the fact that he plays for a top club such as Inter?]</b> His most impressive feat is his speed and his capacity to cover the whole side. He often attacks, but he is also unbelievably quick in recovering his position in the back. Not many can do that so well<br /><br /><b>[q: It seems that he has adapted quickly to the demanding Italian league. What do you think about his mental attitude?]</b> Mentally, he is clearly very strong. He arrived at Inter in a difficult moment for the club, but he did very well, basically becoming a regular starter. The latest is now that Cristian Chivu will move to Genoa in the winter, upon being relegated to a role on the bench at Inter after <a href="yuto-nagatomo.html">Nagatomo</a>’s arrival<br /><br /><b>[q: You are a good friend of Japanese national team manager Alberto Zaccheroni. What does he tell you about <a href="yuto-nagatomo.html">Nagatomo</a>?]</b> Zac always speaks very highly of <a href="yuto-nagatomo.html">Nagatomo</a>. When we talked during the Asian Cup, back in January, he told me that the player was ready for a big club, and hoped he might transfer soon to a top team in Italy. As we all know, that went exactly as Zaccheroni hoped<br /><br /><b>[q: You’re in Japan for the Fifa Club World Cup, and had a chance to watch Kashiwa Reysol playing Santos. What was your impression of the new Japanese wonderboy, right-back Hiroki Sakai? Is he good enough to play in Europe?]</b> Actually, I was mostly looking at <b>[Naoya]</b> Kondo, because he basically has the same last name as me! (laughs) Well, apart from the jokes, I was really impressed by Sakai. I think he could do very well in Italy. He is not as fast as <a href="yuto-nagatomo.html">Nagatomo</a>, but stronger physically, and seeing how good he is in the air, I think he might also do well as a centre-back<br /><br /><b>[q: You follow world football and know players in Asia very well. Despite having so much talent, why do so few Asian players get offers from Europe compared, for example, to South Americans?]</b> It was the same with the African players a few decades ago. The market for foreign players in Italy is in the hands of agents, and they have not found yet a way to profit from Asian athletes. It will take some time, but it will change</p>
