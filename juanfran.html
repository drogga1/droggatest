  <p>[Juanfran said an emotional goodbye to Atletico Madrid as he prepares to leave when his contract expires in June] These are my last few days at Atletico, I hope to return soon, this is my home. They have been wonderful years, the best of my career. It is an honour to be considered a legend of this club and it is incredible that people think I’m one of them.<br /><br />I came from a <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> past, a <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> father [but] I quickly changed to Atletico Madrid. The other day I read ‘he arrived a Viking, he left an Indian’, and that’s how it is. I leave as an Indian after feeling the magic of Atletico, the values and all those people who have let me give them all the heart I have. I have had wonderful colleagues who have made me be the good person and good professional that I am<br /><br />Thank you very much for loving me, being proud of me, chanting my name in the Calderon and Metropolitano. That is much bigger than these titles. People want titles but before this there’s love and respect. Los Rojiblancos are my family. I thank them from the bottom of my heart. I will return soon to try and make us better. It’s a moment of change, of transition. Others are staying to continue to pick up the slack. Koke is staying to be captain, there is no one better than him. I have lots of hopes for Atletico in the years to come. We will return to being champions</p>

  <p>[The 34-year-old was offered a new deal with Atletico, having signed a one-year extension last year, but he opted to move on after falling out of favour at the <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Wanda Metropolitano</a>, and says he wants the experience of playing in Brazil] I was born, raised and have played all my life in Spain. I wanted to live this dream of playing in Brazil</p>
