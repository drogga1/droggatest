<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Selangor state government will not hand over a building complex that the Selangor FA claims is theirs]</b> FAS has many assets but they were invested by certain parties. As a result of the state’s efforts, the complex was built and handed over to us. It is better for us to decide its future, rather than letting it go to waste.<br /><br /><b>[He also warned FAS against claiming that the complex has been ‘stolen’ from them, and against politicising the issue]</b> After the complex was upgraded, all of a sudden they claimed that it is theirs. Nothing had been stolen as it is ours. Do not politicise football. If they want to play it the old way, go ahead and good luck</p>

  <p><b>[Feel free to find another training ground, Selangor state government tells FAS]</b> We are more than happy to take the field back. There is no problem, they can hand it over to us again. FAS can leave and find another pitch that is more suitable. The state had let them use it out of charity, so we have no intention of pressuring them and making drastic changes.<br /><br /><b>[Amirudin also responded that the maintenance of the pitch is actually the responsibility of FAS]</b> If they say it is in poor condition, it is because of FAS themselves because they are maintaining it. If they find it unsuitable, then the state is ready to take it back. We can let other more-deserving associations use it, or as a center for football development in the state</p>
