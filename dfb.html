  <p><b>[Hebert Weber said]</b> What happened in the 2014 World Cup was totally out of the ordinary. While Germany was the favourite for the World Cup, just as they still are today, Brazil have never had a national team that conceded seven goals. The first three really shook the Brazilian team that day, who, in my view, knew the game was up after that. I’m really looking forward to Tuesday’s match because, no matter how much they deny it, Brazil will be desperate to make up for it</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> suspension extended to April 30 due to coronavirus outbreak]</b> The presidium <b>[of the DFL]</b> is aware that all scenarios and options for action also depend on external factors, on the development of which the DFL and clubs have only limited or no influence at all: among other things, the further spread of the virus and the assessment of the situation by politics. Against this background, the presidium of the General Assembly will recommend a further suspension of game operations in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and 2.<a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> until at least April 30<br /><br />In view of the potentially existential situation of some clubs and because of responsibility for an industry with 56,000 direct and indirect employees, we unanimously target the goal of wanting to finish the season by June 30, as far as this is legally permissible and of course health-justifiable. In this regard, the DFL is currently working intensively on concepts to play games at a given time - due to the situation - even without stadium spectators and with a minimal use of workers in the areas of sport, general organisation and the media. In contrast to amateur and grassroots sports or other leisure events, only the stadium staff would be employed at this place of work</p>

  <p><b>[DFL confirms 10 positive coronavirus test results in <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and 2.<a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>]</b> As part of a first wave, a total of 1,724 coronavirus tests have been carried out at the 36 <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and 2nd <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> clubs since Thursday. Samples from players and other team personnel such as coaching staff and physiotherapists were taken and examined by five specialist laboratory groups across Germany. Ten cases of infection were identified and reported to the health authorities. The respective measures, for example, the isolation of the people affected, including environmental diagnostics, were carried out directly by the respective clubs in accordance with the requirements of the local health authorities. A second wave of tests will be carried out this week - here too there may be isolated positive test results, especially since one of the tasks of this second round is to reduce the likelihood of ‘false negative’ findings that can never be completely ruled out. The DFL will continue to report on the results after this second test wave. The tests carried out in the past few days have served their purpose of providing additional security and thus protecting the players as best as possible from infection in team training or game operations. In the coming weeks and months, it will continue to be a matter of consistently implementing the agreed measures in everyday club life as well as in the private sphere. In the event of positive test results, the decision about the measures to be taken lies with the local health authorities</p>

If there is extra time in the second leg of the relegation play-offs, both teams are given a fourth opportunity to change players, which they can use in the interruption between regular time and extra time or in the half-time period of extra time. The DFL ‘Football Commission’ recommends that a maximum of two players be substituted at the same time. In the event that the season has to be abandoned prematurely, a regulation regarding the sporting classification is to be developed within the next two weeks. There will also be the possibility of a match being played in another stadium at short notice for overriding compelling legal, organisational and/or security reasons</p>
