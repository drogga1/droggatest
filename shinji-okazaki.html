  <p><b>[Okazaki discusses the differences he’ve encountered in the transition to living in Germany]</b> In Japan, there is great bustle and movement everywhere. In Germany, however, there is a lot of emphasis on nature. My wife and kids love to walk<br /><br /> In Japan I was a striker through and through. One who played up front and always wanted to score goals. I’m used exactly where I’m most valuable for the team<br /><br /><b>[Okazaki spoke of his surprise at the abilities of manager Bruno Labbadia]</b> Sometimes he goes jogging before or after a workout at a high speed, and sometimes he joins in with our exercises in the weight room. I’ve never seen that in a coach before. He is fit enough to play. He does what he requires of us</p>

  <p><b>[Jamie Vardy and Danny Drinkwater can be key men for England at Euro 2016 if they can replicate their club form]</b> If both are able to play like when they play for Leicester, definitely both could be contributing a lot for England, there is no doubt. I might not be the right person who can assess because they are big players <b>[for Leicester]</b> now. But I can say one thing, the key is whether they can do the same performance <b>[for England]</b> as in Leicester.<br /><br /><b>[On N’Golo Kante who broke into the France national squad in March]</b> He deserved to be called <b>[because he is]</b> the most important player for Leicester City. He is a role model who shows his own character and strength fully every game and gets a good evaluation every time, as every player tries to do so. If Kante plays for France the same as for Leicester, I’m sure he can help France a lot. Kante is in the MVP-class of the Premier League this season. No doubt, if he continues to do so, he can succeed for France. It is without question</p>

  <p><b>[Okazaki, who savoured <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title glory during a stint at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, told of <a href="takumi-minamino.html">Minamino</a>]</b> I watch some of the games on TV and I don’t see negative things. He plays well with and without the ball. He is getting confidence after he changed team. I know <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is the hardest league in the world. Every season they spend a lot of money and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was the last winner of the Champions League and already had quality in their squad. But he can improve himself and I think that’s important for him and Japanese football. At first, he just had quality but now he knows how to fight, he is quicker - he changed his style of play in the last two years<br /><br />The Japanese FA and the fans want to see their players in good teams. Some time ago, we had <a href="shinji-kagawa.html">Shinji Kagawa</a> in Manchester, <a href="yuto-nagatomo.html">Yuto Nagatomo</a> with Inter, <a href="keisuke-honda.html">Keisuke Honda</a> in Milan, but they couldn’t show the best level. Now, we see that it is time for Japanese football to go to the next step. We need players in Europe playing every week in the biggest teams</p>
