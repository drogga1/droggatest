  <p><b>[Is there a better goalkeeper in Europe than Kasper Schmeichel?]</b> Possibly not. We knew the importance of him from the first leg but the importance was there tonight for everyone to see.</p>

  <p><b>[Craig Shakespeare is not concerned with the fact that <a href="leicester-fc.html">the Foxes</a> are the only English club left in Europe’s top club competition this season]</b> My thoughts aren’t about that. It’s about the fact we put in a performance Tuesday, and that’s our aim. Looking forward, we have to make sure we’re competitive, but every game we go into, we try to get a result</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester City coach, Craig Shakespeare has praised Wilfred Ndidi following his impact in their 2-0 victory over Stoke City]</b> <b>[Ndidi]</b> is young and we don’t want to put too much pressure on him. He’s a humble boy and reminds a lot of Kante with his personality. <b>[The]</b> first goal was always going to be crucial and what a goal it was. Ndidi has done that before. He’s got that in his locker.</p>

  <p><b>[on Arsenal]</b> We know we’re coming up against a very talented outfit with some special players. The Emirates in my opinion is a very special stadium as well. We go there full of confidence in terms of the run we’ve been on, but we know it’s a tough game.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> have appointed Craig Shakespeare as the club’s permanent manager on a three-year deal]</b> This is a really exciting opportunity for me to continue along this new path in my career and to continue to work with a club and a group of staff I’ve grown extremely close to. I’m grateful to the owners and the board of directors for their continued faith and support. Our preparations for pre-season and the new <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> campaign have been ongoing for some time, but we can now move on with certainty and ensure we are well equipped to compete at the levels now expected of a club like <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> City</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester City have completed the signing of Sevilla midfielder Vicente Iborra for a reported fee of £10.5 million]</b> I’m absolutely delighted that Vicente has joined us. He’s player with such a good pedigree from his time in Spain with Sevilla and he adds some really strong competition to our squad.</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester City have rejected a transfer offer from Roma for reported Arsenal and Tottenham target Riyad Mahrez]</b> I think I was quoted as saying on the last press day that there had been no bids. There was a bid from Roma I was told after, I’ll put the record straight on that one. It was politely declined on the basis that it was a low offer. What that offer was, don’t ask me because I don’t know and I don’t get involved in that.<br /><br />I think you saw in Riyad’s performance, and I’ve seen a lot of quotes from our own players since, he is a Leicester player and until we’re told otherwise we expect him to perform to the high standards we all set. He’s a team player. Individuals are involved in this team sport so they have to adhere to the rules of the team game. While he does that he’ll be considered for selection.</p>

  <p><b>[AS Roma have seen their second bid of £32 million for Leicester City winger Riyad Mahrez rejected]</b> Riyad is our player until I am told otherwise from the board that a bid has been accepted. He is turning up for training, has been very professional, got about his business and you see that from his performances. Riyad was honest enough to come out at the beginning and say he would like to move to a top six club. He was putting out offers for that. We are aware of the situation and until we get an offer that is suitable, he stays with us</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> trio <a href="andre-gray.html">Andre Gray</a>, Nathaniel Chalobah and Domingos Quina back in contention after party claims]</b> We have got to the bottom of it and they have apologised to staff and players individually and collectively. It was a club decision. For the health and safety of all our players and everybody else, we thought it was the right decision to make at the time. They have apologised and they are back in training with us and they are fit for selection<br /><br />Once we welcomed them back, we try to get on with it as normal. They have admitted they were wrong. They have settled back into it, they know they have made a mistake and want to make up for it. We have drawn a line under it, we have moved on. We have mistakes from individuals during games - they don’t mean to make mistakes, but can we rectify them? Yes, we can. The next chance to rectify it will be against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. And if they play their part, all is well and good</p>
