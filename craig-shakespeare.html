  <p><b>[Craig Shakespeare is not concerned with the fact that the Foxes are the only English club left in Europe’s top club competition this season]</b> My thoughts aren’t about that. It’s about the fact we put in a performance Tuesday, and that’s our aim. Looking forward, we have to make sure we’re competitive, but every game we go into, we try to get a result</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester City have appointed Craig Shakespeare as the club’s permanent manager on a three-year deal]</b> This is a really exciting opportunity for me to continue along this new path in my career and to continue to work with a club and a group of staff I’ve grown extremely close to. I’m grateful to the owners and the board of directors for their continued faith and support. Our preparations for pre-season and the new <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> campaign have been ongoing for some time, but we can now move on with certainty and ensure we are well equipped to compete at the levels now expected of a club like <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> City</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> trio <a href="andre-gray.html">Andre Gray</a>, Nathaniel Chalobah and Domingos Quina back in contention after party claims]</b> We have got to the bottom of it and they have apologised to staff and players individually and collectively. It was a club decision. For the health and safety of all our players and everybody else, we thought it was the right decision to make at the time. They have apologised and they are back in training with us and they are fit for selection<br /><br />Once we welcomed them back, we try to get on with it as normal. They have admitted they were wrong. They have settled back into it, they know they have made a mistake and want to make up for it. We have drawn a line under it, we have moved on. We have mistakes from individuals during games - they don’t mean to make mistakes, but can we rectify them? Yes, we can. The next chance to rectify it will be against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. And if they play their part, all is well and good</p>
