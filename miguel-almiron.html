  <p><b>[On Tata Martino]</b> My conversation with Tata was key in deciding to leave Lanus and try my luck in the MLS. Tata is a great coach, a winner, and I did not doubt for a second when he said he wanted me. I will try to give my best for the team and since the club is new we want to do big things. Personally I am going to try and enjoy this moment and also learn English.</p>

  <p><b>[Miguel Almiron shares about his journey with coach <a href="tata-martino.html">Gerardo Martino</a> to <a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a>]</b> My dad was in the room with me at our home, and we were both sitting by the phone in complete silence. We just sat there. Waiting for it to ring. And then it did. And I picked up. And I spoke to Tata for a few minutes. And it turns out that this legend, this idol … he’s also the nicest guy in the world. He told me he had an offer on the table for this new project in the United States, and that if he was going to go, he wanted me to go with him. ‘Quiero contar contigo, Miguel’. I could barely believe what I was hearing. ‘Coach,’ I said, ‘it is such an honor that you’re even calling me. Of course I want to go to Atlanta with you’. I didn’t know much about <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. I didn’t know where Atlanta was. I didn’t know anything. But Tata was manager, and that was all I needed to know</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United hopes to send off humble, direct Martino with MLS Cup win]</b> I think I’m going to miss everything about Tata. Not just me, but my teammates, the fans in Atlanta. He’s a great person, and as everyone knows he’s a great manager.</p>

  <p><b>[Miguel Almiron’s Atlanta legacy is secure even if MLS Cup was his final match]</b> I’m coming back in the preseason. When I got to Atlanta I didn’t think we would enjoy all this. It’s beautiful what I’ve lived here, and what I am living here. More for the people, you feel the love. I want to thank them for that</p>

  <p><b>[Miguel Almiron has completed his club-record £20 million move to Newcastle]</b> I’m very happy and eager to start and to meet my new team mates. The league is very competitive, this is a historic club, and Rafa Benitez himself were the main reasons why I am here now. I think it is a great responsibility, something beautiful for me, and I will try to offer the best I can to repay the trust the club put in me..</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> forward Miguel Almiron claims to ‘know nothing’ of the rumours linking him with a summer switch to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. Quizzed on the Real talk, Almiron told reporters while away on Copa America duty]</b> I know nothing. I know nothing of it. Of course, for me it is an honour that a team of this size has an interest in my football. But, as I said, I do not know anything and now I’m focused on the Copa America and <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Almiron added on the challenge Paraguay face against the Selecao]</b> As a group, we try to better ourselves every day. It’s a new process, the manager has been here for only four months and we’re doing a wonderful job. I feel good in the team, I don’t feel like a leader but all of us are leaders. We don’t depend on only one player, that’s why we stand out</p>

  <p><b>[Miguel Almiron leaves Lanus for Atlanta United]</b> Everyone thinks that one goes to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> to retire but that is a mistake. The league is growing year on year. I don’t know if we can compare it with others but it is slowly growing and this is important. Young players are arriving who fit in with those who have more experience</p>
