  <p><b>[Miguel Almiron shares about his journey with coach <a href="tata-martino.html">Gerardo Martino</a> to Major League Soccer]</b> My dad was in the room with me at our home, and we were both sitting by the phone in complete silence. We just sat there. Waiting for it to ring. And then it did. And I picked up. And I spoke to Tata for a few minutes. And it turns out that this legend, this idol … he’s also the nicest guy in the world. He told me he had an offer on the table for this new project in the United States, and that if he was going to go, he wanted me to go with him. ‘Quiero contar contigo, Miguel’. I could barely believe what I was hearing. ‘Coach,’ I said, ‘it is such an honor that you’re even calling me. Of course I want to go to Atlanta with you’. I didn’t know much about <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. I didn’t know where Atlanta was. I didn’t know anything. But Tata was manager, and that was all I needed to know</p>

  <p><b>[Miguel Almiron leaves Lanus for Atlanta United]</b> Everyone thinks that one goes to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> to retire but that is a mistake. The league is growing year on year. I don’t know if we can compare it with others but it is slowly growing and this is important. Young players are arriving who fit in with those who have more experience</p>
