  <p><b>[Luciano Spalletti praises <a href="francesco-totti.html">Francesco Totti</a> after the captain scored a 97th-minute penalty against Cesena to reach the Coppa Italia semi-final]</b> When <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> plays, even in training, he’s the Muhammad Ali of football, always looking to land that knockout blow - to swing the punch no-one else can see. If he’s on the pitch, it’s a good idea to give him the ball. The more they get him on the ball, the more they’ll get back in return - you get more back from <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> than the bank. He’s the one who brought the fans back into the stadium from the car park last year</p>

  <p><b>[Sebastiano Esposito - Inter’s record-breaking teen striker sensation]</b> Although he is still very young, he already knows what to do in the penalty area. He must create that armour that allows him to become a champion and a man; that armour that can defend him from external pitfalls. He needs some time.</p>

  <p><b>[Where Did It All Go Wrong for Luciano Spalletti?]</b> It’s been five years that I’ve been talking about balance and instead we’re looking for the next back-heel, the next goal, the next headline. If we don’t win the ball, we don’t win football matches!<br /><br /><b>[Spalletti’s response to that 1997 setback was to persevere. His public reasoning may have echoed as music in Rosella Sensi’s ears much later]</b> My father told me that you have to know how to make do in life, and I’ve always thought that I don’t need to eat more than a steak a day. So I couldn’t give a damn what they do with the cow<br /><br /><b>[Several phone calls came flooding in from Udinese owner Giampaolo Pozzo that May, many of them sent straight to voicemail by Spalletti]</b> No matter what. I feel that my cycle at Udinese is done. I cannot guarantee fourth-place finishes every year.<br /><br />My future? Officially, no one has contacted me</p>

  <p><b>[Spalletti on his relationship with <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> at Roma]</b> My first Roma team was touched by the light of the Roman sunshine, made up of players who could pass the ball without ever creating difficulty for their team-mates. It takes a lot of quality to do that and they had it, as those passing moves made the difference and formed a team that played beautiful football. What I do is talk to the players, find out what their strengths are and make them the protagonists. I tried to find the hidden capabilities of these players. At the time, I had the zero in front, who was <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a>, who’d create spaces and make sure he always got away from the opposition defenders. He was a master in occupying the space<br /><br />I think our rapport remained the same, but the two phases required a different attitude. The results of the team are the most important thing for a coach and I have to work on that. I have always been the same, it’s just that different things happened requiring me to behave differently, but always for the good of the team. I hope that <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> has a great career as an agent and I am sure we’ll cross paths in future during our work</p>
