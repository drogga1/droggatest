  <p><b>[Luciano Spalletti praises <a href="francesco-totti.html">Francesco Totti</a> after the captain scored a 97th-minute penalty against Cesena to reach the Coppa Italia semi-final]</b> When <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> plays, even in training, he’s the Muhammad Ali of football, always looking to land that knockout blow - to swing the punch no-one else can see. If he’s on the pitch, it’s a good idea to give him the ball. The more they get him on the ball, the more they’ll get back in return - you get more back from <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> than the bank. He’s the one who brought the fans back into the stadium from the car park last year</p>

  <p><b>[Luciano Spalletti insists neither he nor his team will be affected by speculation suggesting <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> is set for Inter as they chase Champions League qualification]</b> The newspapers have been writing for months that I won’t be Inter coach next season and they must have their reasons for that, because that’s how the game works. That doesn’t change one iota what our goal is this season. I’d happily open the doors to our training sessions to prove just how well the players are training. There is only one route forward for us, which is to win matches and to secure Inter’s place in the Champions League once again. That is the future. End of story. The players aren’t thinking about Spalletti or other coaches, there is only Inter on their minds. The same goes for me. We want to qualify for the Champions League this season, just as we did last term. That would be a significant objective.<br /><br />I’m not bothered and nor are the players with regards to me or my future. The players are not worried about what Inter will look like next season, because everyone is focused on how the team is doing at the moment. There will be 60,000 in tomorrow <b>[Monday]</b> night, not to keep the seat warm for next season but to drive the team on towards victory. No one is getting ahead of themselves. We are focused on today’s training session <b>[and]</b> on tomorrow night’s match. Monday’s game is crucial. That would allow us to experience another season in the Champions League</p>

  <p><b>[Luciano Spalletti has labelled Inter’s final day <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> clash with Empoli as a cup final]</b> There are similarities (to last season) because the match has the same importance. This fixture is essentially a knockout game, a cup final, a crucial match, and clearly it becomes the key event of the season. It’s all about getting the result that you need. But we are used to the importance of this match, because we work in this industry. It appeared when I used to coach Roma that we played in six finals against Inter, so these situations do tend to crop up on a regular basis. I think the team has learned lessons from the last two seasons in terms of the matches that we played. That will help us to prepare for tomorrow night.<br /><br />I am well aware of that, but there are a number of matches in which we played very well. I therefore expect my players to be prepared for moments like this, to show all of the different components that they need and that they have displayed in a number of different fixtures. My players and I feel very good because, once again, we have the target of qualifying for a second straight Champions League within touching distance. We are focused on what we have to do. Our eyes are on the prize, as opposed to what you have reminded us of - namely, the matches we didn’t perform well in</p>

  <p><b>[Luciano Spalletti does not know if he will leave <a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a>. Spalletti delivered Champions League qualification for the second successive season thanks to Sunday’s 2-1 win over Empoli]</b> I wasn’t surprised, we had a good game. There was so much tension and pressure in getting to this game. This stadium is used to victories and connects everything to memories of the past, but tonight we had to suffer and we put in heart. I’m sorry for Empoli, I have ties and friends there. They certainly deserved to stay up, but we also deserved to reach the Champions League. When decisions are made, everyone reacts in their own way. Problems come when situations leave you hanging on, not when you face them. I don’t know if I’ll leave Inter. <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> was called into question at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> after the game against <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> <b>[in the Champions League]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[When reminded <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> champions <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> had parted with coach <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Massimiliano Allegri</a>, despite both parties insisting a change would not be made]</b> But <b>[<a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> president]</b> Andrea <a href="gianni-agnelli.html">Agnelli</a> said at a press conference the next day that he wouldn’t touch anything and then made a change. For me, you can learn from that behaviour. But I’m in the perfect role that I want to be in and I’m behaving the way I want to. I’m calm</p>

  <p><b>[Where Did It All Go Wrong for Luciano Spalletti?]</b> It’s been five years that I’ve been talking about balance and instead we’re looking for the next back-heel, the next goal, the next headline.

His public reasoning may have echoed as music in Rosella Sensi’s ears much later]</b> My father told me that you have to know how to make do in life, and I’ve always thought that I don’t need to eat more than a steak a day. So I couldn’t give a damn what they do with the cow<br /><br /><b>[Several phone calls came flooding in from Udinese owner Giampaolo Pozzo that May, many of them sent straight to voicemail by Spalletti]</b> No matter what.

  <p><b>[Spalletti on his relationship with <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> at Roma]</b> My first Roma team was touched by the light of the Roman sunshine, made up of players who could pass the ball without ever creating difficulty for their team-mates. It takes a lot of quality to do that and they had it, as those passing moves made the difference and formed a team that played beautiful football. What I do is talk to the players, find out what their strengths are and make them the protagonists. I tried to find the hidden capabilities of these players. At the time, I had the zero in front, who was <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a>, who’d create spaces and make sure he always got away from the opposition defenders. He was a master in occupying the space<br /><br />I think our rapport remained the same, but the two phases required a different attitude. The results of the team are the most important thing for a coach and I have to work on that. I have always been the same, it’s just that different things happened requiring me to behave differently, but always for the good of the team. I hope that <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> has a great career as an agent and I am sure we’ll cross paths in future during our work</p>
