  <p><b>[Roma coach Luciano Spalletti admits it seems impossible for his side to beat Juventus to the Serie A title this season]</b> We must be realistic. It was difficult before, now it’s almost impossible.<br /><br />They were much better in the first half at moving the ball quickly, whereas we hardly ever managed to raise the tempo or get into the right positions. They also made us really suffer to win back the ball. You need the sharpness to make those two or three passes in a row to open up spaces and Napoli did it far better. We improved in the second half and it was a whole other game, although we were rather unlucky with the woodwork. I don’t think it’s right to talk about fatigue, as that makes the situation worse. You can talk about it, but don’t involve me, especially as towards the end the team had a completely different attitude, so they can’t have been tired<br /><br />We could not have played like that in the final minutes if we were fatigued. On Wednesday we didn’t play that well, but we weren’t dominated by Lazio at all. We knew how they’d play and did not adjust accordingly. When we made it more one-against-one in the second half, we saw a team with a more spirit and fluidity. I decided to give more space to Stephan El Shaarawy and Diego Perotti, but the whole team didn’t step up at the right times, so they weren’t given the chance to make more of an impact. If you find the right through ball, it can make all the difference. Unfortunately, we tended to play it badly and were not calm, courageous or precise enough.</p>

  <p><b>[Luciano Spalletti feels Roma were somewhat unlucky in Sunday’s 3-1 defeat to Lazio]</b> Ugly incidents led to an ugly Roma. We started off playing the way we thought that we had to play and created chances, but Lazio scored with their first attempt. Of course it was a psychological blow, you make mistakes and it becomes a wide open game. We were no longer the team we know that we are. I opted to go with three at the back after a while, as Lazio were dangerous on the counter and lacked sharpness. Then Lazio scored again with a deflection, so we were unlucky.<br /><br />If you look at the game today, we were weaker in defence. After a result like this, you have to accept all the criticism. We lost sharpness, made bad decisions, were unlucky on the incidents, as both the first and second goal were deflected shots from the edge of the box. We created six or seven chances that we failed to convert. We should’ve kept more possession, as we did in the opening 10 minutes, and that would’ve worn Lazio down, making it easier for us to break them down. Instead, by taking the lead, Lazio could simply counter.</p>

  <p><b>[Luciano Spalletti didn’t even attempt to hide his contempt for Mauro Icardi’s habit of addressing private issues in the public domain]</b> The fans are the ones who suffer because the media sends out a message that Inter is in the hands of children rather than professionals. But that is absolutely not the case, as we have a group of exemplary professionals. Obviously, it’s also worth noting that social media sagas can disturb our work and reaching our objective. We must, therefore, be careful. But, in this case, there was nothing unusual happening. There are no problems between the players. But I say this because bringing home matters into the locker room should not happen and there has to be a detachment when talking about personal issues. But these things gave us a good laugh and, in fact, paradoxically united us, as we all laughed together.<br /><br />The club do not want to spend and the environment is always one step away from madness, like at Roma. It’s a balancing act. At times, it’s a depressed environment<br /><br />Clearly a little worry does set in, because we don’t see many improvements, even after changes. We’re below-par in more or less every area. We must work to find some certainties through daily training to give us a clear idea how to progress</p>

  <p><b>[Inter boss Luciano Spalletti insists Ivan Perisic was conned]</b> We’ve got to get Perisic back on track, but also Nainggolan, as he had injuries, setbacks and various issues. He needs time on the field and patience. As for Perisic, there was this story on the market, but he is a professional, understands his role and yesterday it was already a very different mood. These things happen in the transfer window, the player received an impressive proposal and was tempted. However, he then realised it was not a true offer, that he’d been conned, and took a step back. Now he’ll resume training and as soon as his mind is back fully on Inter, we’ll let him play.<br /><br />You should do me a favour and ask someone else to say if that was a penalty. If the free-kick hasn’t been taken yet and someone punches somebody in the box, it’s still a penalty. It’s better to talk about the development of the game. I am not in any position to analyse these incidents. We started a bit tense, but the game started to develop, we were in it all the way, but then got a bit frenetic and that doesn’t work against Lazio. We lacked some sharpness in our passing and when Lazio welcomed us forward, we had to move it from right to left and back again, otherwise they’d have five defenders behind the ball. You’ll never hurt them without doing that. It seemed to be a game totally in the balance and could only be decided on penalties</p>

If you treat it with more quality, it’s within your control. Even when moving the ball between spaces, we never created anything of note. The early goal just cranked up the tension and made us feel as if there was no chance. We lost it straight away. We had plenty of time to deal with the situation intelligently.

I think he could’ve played 20-30 minutes, even half a game, but that’s not the point. Those who are in the locker room need to play instead. You need to have credibility in a group. I have had credibility for 22 years in my career and I have credibility with my players. This mediation is humiliating for Inter fans and for those who love Inter. The need to mediate with someone just to get him to pull on the shirt that they love. It’s humiliating. What, do I need to email 20 lawyers and ask them if I can call someone up?! People say we lost games without Icardi. Inter didn’t get into the Champions League for years with Icardi. Inter lost worse games than this with Icardi. Lionel Messi makes the difference, not Icardi, with all due respect. Professionalism and self-respect are everything. Discipline is everything. I’ve left players out for far less in my time. You must have respect and behave in the locker room. Let’s find an Inter fan and ask him if he likes a player negotiating to pull on the Inter shirt.<br /><br />No-one comes out as a winner, but a point of reference was needed to start over. And that point is the table. We’ll start over from third place with all our available power, which will allow us to fight for our objective until the end of the season. Mauro’s able to drag the team forward when he’s in it. From the outside, no. In these last few training sessions and without sending messages on social media, he’s regained his place in the squad</p>

There is only one route forward for us, which is to win matches and to secure Inter’s place in the Champions League once again. That is the future. End of story. The players aren’t thinking about Spalletti or other coaches, there is only Inter on their minds. The same goes for me. We want to qualify for the Champions League this season, just as we did last term. That would be a significant objective</p>

  <p><b>[Intermilan head coach Luciano Spalletti hit out at sections of the Italian press over reports that Antonio Conte is set to replace him at the Serie A club]</b> For three months, the same things have been said. La Gazzetta dello Sport has written the same for three months. If someone says it’ll rain tomorrow every day, eventually it will probably rain. You keep asking me the same things every week and I don’t want to be rude by not responding. If La Gazzetta dello Sport have written the same thing for two years, and over the last three months it was every single day, then they must know something.<br /><br />They are also pretty insulting, with headlines saying you’re spent, you’re empty, a flop, that in the end weighs on you. It’s not about me, anyway, because this sort of rumour mill has been particularly strong around Inter for seven years. It’s also nasty and offensive in its language and that is not the same way with other clubs. I don’t know if there are some sort of family and friendship issues here, but it is different with Inter. It’s only right that <b>[chief executive Giuseppe]</b> Marotta goes to seek out the best for Inter, so it’s not about that.<br /><br /><b>[Inter’s win over Chievo ended a three-match streak without a league victory]</b> I saw maturity, clear heads, sharpness and the awareness to avoid making silly mistakes. We moved the ball side to side because Chievo’s attitude was forcing us into that, but it is true our passing didn’t have the right quality to break them down. We can do better.</p>

  <p><b>[Luciano Spalletti challenged his Inter players to prove they have the gumption to ‘wear the shirt’]</b> It’s a final for us, we need to be ready to play it. We need to maintain the composure of those who know how to assess things. The team played poorly <b>[against Napoli]</b>, but our destiny is in our own hands. We need to take to the pitch to win because it’s a crucial match for us, we’ll either be in or out. We need to have the substance, composure and strength that an Inter side should have. You have to know how to withstand this kind of pressure if you wear this shirt</p>

  <p><b>[Luciano Spalletti has labelled Inter’s final day <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> clash with Empoli as a cup final]</b> There are similarities (to last season) because the match has the same importance. This fixture is essentially a knockout game, a cup final, a crucial match, and clearly it becomes the key event of the season. It’s all about getting the result that you need. But we are used to the importance of this match, because we work in this industry. It appeared when I used to coach Roma that we played in six finals against Inter, so these situations do tend to crop up on a regular basis. I think the team has learned lessons from the last two seasons in terms of the matches that we played. That will help us to prepare for tomorrow night.<br /><br />I am well aware of that, but there are a number of matches in which we played very well. I therefore expect my players to be prepared for moments like this, to show all of the different components that they need and that they have displayed in a number of different fixtures. My players and I feel very good because, once again, we have the target of qualifying for a second straight Champions League within touching distance. We are focused on what we have to do. Our eyes are on the prize, as opposed to what you have reminded us of - namely, the matches we didn’t perform well in</p>

Spalletti delivered Champions League qualification for the second successive season thanks to Sunday’s 2-1 win over Empoli]</b> I wasn’t surprised, we had a good game. There was so much tension and pressure in getting to this game. This stadium is used to victories and connects everything to memories of the past, but tonight we had to suffer and we put in heart. I’m sorry for Empoli, I have ties and friends there. They certainly deserved to stay up, but we also deserved to reach the Champions League. When decisions are made, everyone reacts in their own way.

  <p><b>[Spalletti on his relationship with <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> at Roma]</b> My first Roma team was touched by the light of the Roman sunshine, made up of players who could pass the ball without ever creating difficulty for their team-mates. It takes a lot of quality to do that and they had it, as those passing moves made the difference and formed a team that played beautiful football. What I do is talk to the players, find out what their strengths are and make them the protagonists. I tried to find the hidden capabilities of these players. At the time, I had the zero in front, who was <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a>, who’d create spaces and make sure he always got away from the opposition defenders. He was a master in occupying the space<br /><br />I think our rapport remained the same, but the two phases required a different attitude. The results of the team are the most important thing for a coach and I have to work on that. I have always been the same, it’s just that different things happened requiring me to behave differently, but always for the good of the team. I hope that <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> has a great career as an agent and I am sure we’ll cross paths in future during our work</p>
