  <p><b>[Andy Carroll insists the uncertainty surrounding Dimitri Payet’s future at West Ham will not be allowed to destroy anything]</b> No one player is going to destroy anything. Our response <b>[to the Payet situation]</b> just proves what the lads have got deep down in themselves. Our passion for football, for the manager and for our club - it’s everything. I think the fight that the lads have got, the fans standing behind us, it’s all been great. It is a very tight-knit group, certainly the tightest since I joined West Ham. It’s great just walking into the dressing room every morning. The lads have always got a smile on their face, even when the manager has dragged us in on a Sunday morning and we don’t really want to be there because we’re supposed to be off.</p>

  <p><b>[Andy Carroll has admitted he did not feel ready to join Liverpool and had to Google the names of some of the players at the club]</b> Jamie, when I was leaving Newcastle for Liverpool, I was in the helicopter on the way down and I had to go to Google to find out who their players were, looking on the phone. I was signing and I didn’t know who my team-mates would be! I knew Stevie and some of the others but not all of them. And I loved it at Newcastle. I wasn’t ready to leave. It came as a shock. I’d had a season ticket, it was my club and it was a shock to move. I was 22. I could never get a grip at Liverpool<br /><br /><b>[Carroll felt relieved to finally put his days on Merseyside behind him by signing for West Ham]</b> I walked in and I felt at home. It was a good feeling. The fans welcomed me and I felt the same as I did at Newcastle, as if I was with a group of lads I liked and had grown up with<br /><br /><b>[When asked to mark his achievements so far out of 10]</b> Newcastle, yeah good. Liverpool: never really happened. Here? In spells, yes. Not really done what I know I can do and believe I will do. There’s a lot more. Yes, I’ll give myself six. Nine caps for England, there are more caps in me. I’ve always thought I could play for England if I am on my game - if I am fit</p>

  <p><b>[Carroll says I could only name two <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> players when I joined from <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> in 2011
]</b> When I was here <b>[<a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>]</b>, I’d go home, mess about with my mates, play football, go out, whatever, but I’d never watch football, I never knew any players.<br /><br />I’d come in on the Friday or wake up on the Saturday morning saying, ‘who are we playing?’ It was just completely oblivious to all the football that was going on. I would work at the training ground and knew my tactics, but until we had a meeting I didn’t know who we were playing, unless I asked someone.<br /><br />When I was in the helicopter down to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, I was like, ‘I know Stevie G<b>[errard]</b>, I know <b>[Jamie]</b> <a href="jamie-carragher.html">Carragher</a>. Who else?’ My agent at the time had to tell me, and I would get it on Google and find out the team.<br /><br />So that’s actually a true story. It’s bad because it’s <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> players, but it’s not disrespectful - I just literally didn’t watch football, so I didn’t know<br /><br /><b>[Having represented <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> since joining initially on loan in 2012, Carroll is now back where it all began, and he says is better for his mistakes]</b> I wasn’t ready <b>[for the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> move]</b> at all. But things happen like that. I went down there and it was like a whirlwind.<br /><br />I was happy, just about to sign a new deal, and the next day I was gone. I’d just bought a house and, believe it or not, I’d just got a cat. It was in the house, and I never went back to the house - I left in the helicopter and my brother had to have the cat.<br /><br />I do have a daft side to me, a silly side to me, which will never ever go, and I don’t want it to, you know? I’m still a child at heart. But I’ve grown up massively. I’ve realised my mistakes in the past, and realised what I want to be, and what I am.<br /><br />I was stupid, I was young, and I was carried away with the lifestyle that I had. Now it’s completely different. I’m actually a dad, I’ve grown up, and got responsibilities, so… I’ve got a purpose</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> striker Andy Carroll has hit out at media ‘lies’ which he feels gave him a bad reputation, and insists he is doing his utmost to get back to full fitness]</b> I used to years ago, and then there was so much press, bad press, and I just was like, ‘I can’t even be bothered with it’, because most of it is lies.<br /><br />There was one (story), I think it was last season, that I got injured trying to climb over a balcony drunk on pre-season with <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>, and I fell off the balcony and got injured. In the paper! I’m like, what am I even reading this for? It’s a load of <strong>**</strong><em>*.<br /><br />I won a game of table tennis, jumped on the table, landed, smashed the table and rolled my ankle and I’m injured. What? So I just stopped reading everything.<br /><br />It’s not my fault. I don’t want to be sitting in the gym by myself doing rehab. I want to be outside doing what I love to do, playing football and being with the lads. I’ve been out of it for so long, and I don’t want to be like that.<br /><br />People think you’re getting paid so it doesn’t matter. No - that’s not the case. I haven’t come into this job to get paid. Yeah, it pays well, but I’ve come into it because I love it - there’s a difference.<br /><br />I don’t love being in the gym. Everyone that knows me knows I hate the gym, it’s the worst thing ever. I want to be outside. I’m working my b</em>llocks off to get fit and I was working my b*llocks off when I was injured as well. It’s non-stop<br /><br />I’d be getting phone calls in London saying, ‘you’re out, and you’re drinking this’. No - I’m in a restaurant with my family. ‘Well you’ve been spotted’. Yeah, I’ve been spotted in there because it’s a restaurant! ‘Yeah, but they sell alcohol, so you must have been drinking’. No - I’m with the kids!<br /><br />People just jump on it, thinking ‘oh, Andy’s in the pub’. Yesterday, I went for food with my mate and got a pint of lemonade. I was sitting there and I could see people taking pictures. Because it’s a pint glass, I start getting paranoid with it. I’m drinking lemonade!<br /><br />I was just like, ‘really? Do you need to come over and say that?’ I’m actually talking there nicely, and then he comes over and says that. I’m sat there with my kids. It really annoyed me</p>

  <p><b>[Carroll wanted to fail medical in £35m <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> move after buying house and cat in <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>]</b> Do you know what. I was injured at the time, and all I’m thinking is, ‘Please, just fail the medical’. The minute I got on that helicopter I wanted to come back. I knew it had to happen. Whatever age, I needed to walk back on that pitch and play for <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> again. I remember leaving here (Newcastle’s training ground) in Kevin Nolan’s car because loads of people were outside. We went to his house and watched it on TV. I was like, ‘I’m not going’. I’d just bought a house, and a cat the day before! But then I was told, ‘You’re going’, and that was that. Listen, I would have rather stayed at the time and all the way to the helicopter I’m thinking, ‘What is happening? What am I doing?’. But looking back, and how it shaped me as a player and a person, I would honestly still do it. I probably needed to get out of the city to grow up<br /><br /><b>[Carroll intends to deliver on that remit, saying of his future]</b> I’m only 30, let’s do another interview in five years’ time. I’ll still be playing here, that’s what drives me. This isn’t a one-year thing, I want a new deal</p>
