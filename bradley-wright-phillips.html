  <p><b>[Bradley Wright-Phillips was on a cross-country flight when he received a long text from Dax McCarty]</b> He’s one of them guys. I don’t care what kind of player you bring in. Even if you brought in Messi, you’ll still miss Dax. He’s a lot more than a good football player to our team. There’s time in the season where it was hard, and it was getting tougher, and Dax would get us out of those situations. It’s tough. He’s a great player and a great man, and is just amazing in the dressing room. He’s a born captain. There’s not many players that are supposed to be captains, but Dax is one of them. He’ll definitely be hard to replace.<br /><br /><b>[McCarty was traded on Monday to the Chicago Fire for $400,000 in allocation money]</b> Sean Davis is one of the best youngsters I’ve been around. He’s got an old head on his shoulders and he’s a very good player. It’s obviously going to take him a while to reach those heights, but I do think he has the mentality and the ability to be a Red Bulls captain. I’ve said this, he’s captain material and a very good player<br /><br /><b>[On Tyler Adams]</b> He’s a beast, that guy. You wouldn’t believe his age when he’s around the training ground. Once he gets out onto the field he’s in the zone. He’s not fazed by names or faces, he gets out and he gets the job done. He’s a very good player. I think if Red Bulls can keep Sean Davis and Tyler, they’ve got a bright future ahead of them. Those two in the midfield can be very, very good</p>

  <p><b>[On Success of Alex Muyl and Tyler Adams]</b> It’s a testament to the coaching staff at our club. If you’re young here, you’re very lucky. I’ve been young at places and it’s tough to come in. You’re nervous about proving yourself. Are you good enough? Here, these guys know when they get a chance the coaching staff believes in them. So when they play in games like this it’s almost easy for them</p>

  <p><b>[Tyler Adams earns high praise after star showing in the CCL]</b> Gareth Bale. I saw a similar attitude. Don’t get me wrong, because you guys like to twist things. I’m not saying they’re the same player, or he’s going to have the same career as <b>[Bale]</b>, but they both have a mentality where they know what they’re good at and they’re not afraid when they step out on the field</p>

  <p><b>[Bradley Wright-Phillips has made goals look easy to come by during his time in Major League Soccer]</b> The win today was amazing. We bounced back well from <b>[Real Salt Lake]</b>. It was what we needed, and the boys reacted well. I knew the season before I didn’t come back in the best shape. This season I wanted not just goals, I wanted to feel good, I wanted to play well. It kind of paid off because my offseason I worked hard and it seems like it’s paying off. Goals aside, assists aside, I feel like I’ve come back sharper. I feel like I can get around the pitch easier. I’m enjoying it more, the beginning of the season.<br /><br />I don’t really care. I’m lucky enough to play with great players. I played with <b>[Henry]</b>, he helped me, I played with Sacha and he got a lot of assists for me. There’s players around the world that get assists from number 10s or wingers</p>

  <p><b>[Red Bulls cap record season with another Supporters’ Shield]</b> I know you don’t get credit in this league for winning the Shield, but it’s the hardest thing to win and we’ve won it three times in six years. I’m proud to be on this team.<br /><br />I do think everyone is on the same page when it comes to knowing that, let’s be real, over here you get nothing for the Shield. No one’s really bothered by it. I think anyone connected to MLS, they don’t care. If you don’t win the MLS Cup it doesn’t matter, so we know that the big one is the MLS Cup and we’ll give our all to win it.<br /><br /><b>[Winning three Supporters’ Shields in the past six years]</b> It’s a great club, seen some great players, and they still haven’t had a cup. It annoys me even when I see other fans - I’m a guy that reads comments, and sometimes I’ll see other fans say ‘You’ve been in here like 20 years and you haven’t won anything’. I just can’t wait for them to be able to reply like,’What now?’ It’ll just be nice for the fans to have a comeback</p>

  <p><b>[How Bradley <a href="shaun-wright-phillips.html">Wright-Phillips</a> forged his own legacy in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>]</b> I wasn’t happy with how I left England. I didn’t like where my mind was football wise. I felt like football was coming second. And the only thing I wanted to do was come here and put football first and give it a real shot, and I did that. I’ve always loved football, it wasn’t like losing the love, but I wasn’t putting it first. I was more interested in hanging out with friends or just doing other things. When I got here that was my main focus, to get my head down and get in the team and try and do what I could to put a good case forward, play well and be rated in this league</p>

That was my thinking anyway, like the idiot that I was. Just the standard of the league was impressive, and also I remember when I was coming <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry</a> (Henry) told me ‘Don’t think it’s easy. It’s not easy. A lot of people come here and don’t succeed’.<br /><br />I never tried to leave. They would have had to get rid of me, because by that time I came in the summer and it was amazing. I’d been to the city a lot. I was getting to know everyone on the team. So by that time I was fully enjoying myself, apart from on the field. I was really enjoying myself and my family was happy. I just remember thinking I had a couple of injuries, I didn’t score many goals, and I just wanted the next season to be better. I wanted to show that I had something to offer to this team. I just wanted to have a good preseason. I didn’t have a preseason the year before, so I wanted to get a good preseason in and break into the team. That was the plan.</h4>

  <p><b>[As prolific as Wright-Phillips’ time has been in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, it is easy to forget that he did manage to fashion a solid career in England before making the move. He looks back on his playing career in England fondly and never found himself feeling like he had any unfinished business, even as he reached superstar status in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>]</b> There were several good memories (in England). Making my debut at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, playing with my brother, that was a high point and was amazing. Going to Charlton and winning the League One championship. Even when I was at <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>, my first year there I really enjoyed it. We had a good playoff run. There’s been a few great moments, I don’t hate my career in England. People forget, but that’s what I was saying before. There’s certain people who are going to see things how they want to see them, but that brings me back to not having to prove anything. I know if I look back there’s a lot of things I look back on and feel proud of in England. My time in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> has just been better.</p>

  <p>(Winning <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup) is everything. We’ve won the shield, I’ve broken records. It doesn’t feel complete. I still don’t think we’ve had the big thing to celebrate together as a club with the fans. Even when I’ve been on the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Instagram and then other fans will say to our fans ‘you’ve never won a cup’, I just want our fans to have a reply. When we win it, it’ll be amazing. That’s not how it goes. That said, I’m confident we can do it at home. Since I’ve got here I’ve never wanted to go back (to England). A lot of people ask me from back home do I miss home? Do I miss England? I don’t yet. Not yet</p>

  <p><b>[Red Bulls exorcise some playoff demons, but a tougher test awaits in Atlanta United]</b> Today I couldn’t pick out a bad player, I think everyone played well. We learned from our mistakes last week. We looked dangerous on the attack, the defense was how they’ve been all season.<br /><br />We needed a hero and Danny stepped up today. We just need people to chip in with goals, like they have been all season. I think it’s been spread out quietly throughout the season. Today Danny comes up big. The next game we play a better team, no disrespect to Columbus, but the table doesn’t lie. We’ll play a better team and someone else will have to step up</p>

  <p><b>[Sloppy finishing dooms Red Bulls in CCL once again. On Jonathan Orozco]</b> Credit to him, I think he made some good saves, but I still think it’s more on the finishing. I feel like I owe the team a couple of goals. Let’s see what I can do.<br /><br />I just think today it was a different threat up there for them, two strikers, something that we haven’t really dealt with. They’re good players, credit to them, they gave A-Lo and Tim a good game<br /><br />It’s obviously going to be tough going there. What we did show is that we created chances. If we just finish those it’s obviously a different game. I get confidence from that, and the team has too. We know we can create chances</p>
