  <p><b>[A Ligue 2 match between Nancy and Le Mans was brought to a stop after homophobic chants were heard at the Stade Marcel Picot on Friday night]</b> I <b>[Roxana Maracineanu]</b> extend my congratulations to referee Mehdi Mokhtari and the delegate of the LFP (Ligue de Football Professionnel) Alain <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> who took their responsibilities and decided to interrupt the football match between Nancy and Le Mans for homophobic insults. It’s a first. And a last, I hope</p>

  <p><b>[A Ligue 2 match between Nancy and Le Mans was brought to a stop after homophobic chants were heard at the Stade Marcel Picot. Nancy could now face disciplinary action for the incident with club president Jean-Michel Roussier quick to stress the club won’t support such chants but also pointing out they are powerless to completely stop them]</b> I <b>[Jean-Michel Roussier]</b> strongly condemn the homophobic insults chanted by some spectators at Marcel-Picot. From the half-time of the match, I moved to the fans to ask them to stop their songs against the opponents and the league. I’m going to have a meeting with the different groups this week or sometime next week. It must stop. But at this stage, we can no longer do prevention. You can avoid getting smoke into a stadium, but you can not gag the fans. Homophobic insults, there have been for years in all stages of France and it is not possible to solve the problem in a snap of fingers</p>

  <p><b>[Nancy accidentally wish fans happy New Year with cemetery coordinates]</b> ASNL wishes to reassure its subscribers and partners. The greeting card published on Tuesday evening was an electronic mock-up. When it was created, the stadium was moved on the map and its GPS coordinates were changed. The greeting card that will be sent in the coming days will obviously locate your place at the Stade Marcel-Picot</p>
