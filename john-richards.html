  <p><b>[Wolves legend John Richards says Clubs across Europe will want Raul Jimenez]</b> I think there’s more to come from him to be perfectly honest, and hopefully it will be with <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>. There’s no doubt there’s going to be clubs who have been watching him - top-ranked clubs, not just in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but across Europe. They’ll be thinking ‘let’s get him in’, as he’s the sort of player who would improve any team he goes to. When you watch him play, he’s a natural.<br /><br />I would say he’s got to be doing it for a little bit longer yet, but he’s got all the attributes of a world-class striker. I’m sure there are other clubs keeping an eye on him as getting that ratio of goals in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is just phenomenal, to be honest. To get to that sort of level, you’ve got to do it for four or five seasons. He’s not quite there yet, but the potential is there. He moves beautifully, and I know we lost the game but that goal he scored in the semi-final against <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>, when he took it on his chest, everything was there. Most people would’ve gone for a header, but his balance was brilliant. He scored a goal which most strikers wouldn’t have even thought of scoring</p>

  <p><b>[Wolves legend John Richards says <a href="adama-traore.html">Adama Traore</a> and <a href="raul-jimenez.html">Raul Jimenez</a> may be sparking speculation regarding possible moves to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> but any interest shown in the pair during the next transfer window is likely to be lukewarm]</b> I think <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> are in a good position all-round, to be honest. And if you’re a <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> player now, there’s not a lot of other teams you would want to go to. That’s because they respect the manager. I think <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> were in a strong position, with the squad they’ve got. It’s not the biggest of squads but there’s a lot of quality. I think any interest from elsewhere will be lukewarm as even the teams who could afford those key players are going to be tentative over their spending. If <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> want to try and pick up a gem from the lower leagues, there could be an opportunity there as clubs may need the money.<br /><br /><b>[Highly-rated coach <a href="nuno-espirito-santo.html">Nuno Espirito Santo</a> is only tied to terms through to the summer of 2021]</b> I’m sure he is giving it <b>[his future]</b> a lot of thought. You cannot fault his loyalty and commitment to <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolverhampton</a> so far. I think he’ll get the team playing again and, hopefully, make a commitment over his future to <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>. This is a club moving forward, in a good position. Again, there are not many clubs you’d look at as your next challenge</p>
