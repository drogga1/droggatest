<blockquote>
  <p>If <a href="dani-ceballos.html">Dani Ceballos</a> and the rest of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s loan stars continue to impress, it may help <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>’s pursuit of Kylian Mbappe<br /><br />AS have argued that <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> will not look to completely overhaul his squad in the next two transfer windows, because he’s been so impressed with his loan players. One of those is <a href="dani-ceballos.html">Dani Ceballos</a> and there is hope he will return to the Bernabeu at the end of the season and finally get his <a href="real-madrid.html">Los Blancos</a> career off the ground. When he joined the Gunners, the Spaniard was adamant he did not want to include a buy-out clause because his ambition is still to succeed in Madrid<br /><br />Sergio Reguilon (Sevilla), <a href="achraf-hakimi.html">Archaf Hakimi</a> (Borussia Dortmund) and <a href="takefusa-kubo.html">Takefusa Kubo</a> (Mallorca) have all been shining lights this season at their new temporary clubs. The best of the bunch though has been <a href="martin-odegaard.html">Martin Odegaard</a> (Real Sociedad), who has quite literally been one of the best players in the division.<br /><br /><a href="florentino-perez.html">Florentino Perez</a> is also said to be in favour of the young players out on loan returning to the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> fold. It will help him focus on securing the signing of a new Galactico, with his number one target being Kylian Mbappe<br /><br /><a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> is a player that has been on the club’s radar for quite some time, and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> are said to be ready to step up their pursuit of the Frenchman. During his time at Monaco back in 2013, the forward and his family visited the Santiago Bernabeu and Valdebebas in Madrid. He even met <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> and <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> who was the manager at the time</p>
