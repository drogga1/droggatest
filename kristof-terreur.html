<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Wilfred Ndidi, for example, was spotted by <a href="vincent-janssen.html">Janssen</a> playing in a youth tournament in Lagos, Nigeria in 2013. Bailey joined on trial as a teenager having spent time in Austria, Slovakia and his native Jamaica previously. Milinkovic-Savic was plucked from Vojvodina as a 19-year-old and is now one of Serie Aâ€™s biggest talents]</b> Working with the right agents has helped them. They built up their reputation abroad through the likes of De Bruyne and <a href="thibaut-courtois.html">Courtois</a>, which makes it easier to convince players to join. Technical director Dimi De Conde and head scout Dirk Schoofs work closely together, and they are always looking for specific qualities in players. Over the last two seasons they signed, for instance, two talented Colombian defenders and found a player (Junya Ito) in Japan. They tend to look around in Scandinavia a lot too. The club has become a trampoline for talent<br /><br />It was around 20 years ago that the philosophy changed. Instead of recruiting players in their own province, they sent scouts all over the country and even in Holland. Their attacking style of play attracted loads of youngsters<br /><br />De Bruyne, for instance, lived 140 kilometres from Genk which, considering the size of the country, is a big distance. But he decided to join their youth academy at 14 because of the technical style of play. He could have joined Anderlecht or Club Brugge, closer to home, but he specifically chose Genk</p>
