<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Tuncay Sanli says <a href="radamel-falcao.html">Radamel Falcao</a> has made a slow start since moving to <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a> as the marquee player in the Turkish Super Lig]</b> Of course, he is shocked now a bit because everyone here is looking at him. All the fans at all clubs. He is a really big, big player but only one player isn’t enough. It is important that the whole team comes together to help him. When he is in the 18-yard box, he will score. He is a big player but he still needs time. Everywhere it is the same if you are a big name and that means pressure. It is too early now <b>[to make judgements]</b>. Lots of teams have started poorly. That’s the situation.<br /><br />Fenerbahce have started well. <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a> are distracted by the Champions League and they have only signed players late. That’s the problem. It is too early. Only seven weeks in. They needed the national team break. They can get better. Things are better for Fener now. The financial issues have been the problem, a big problem to me. They are going well, they have made good transfers. They are doing well on the pitch and I think they can be champions. I hope so, anyway. I am a fan of Fener. The new owner is working hard, the fans are back behind the team. Last year they didn’t play well but they are really behind the team again. That’s very important. They are helping the team now because of the president<br /><br /><b>[Fenerbahce should also soon be boosted by the return of <a href="victor-moses.html">Victor Moses</a>, who has been out with a muscle injury suffered in the opening game of the season]</b> He did well as a right wing-back for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He is strong, trying always to score or assist. He is injured and he hasn’t played for a long time. He is a good player and I think the national break will be good for him. He is happy and comfortable</p>
