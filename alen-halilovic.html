  <p><b>[Forgotten wunderkind Alen Halilovic can be Milan’s midfield spark]</b> A surprise signing, a young talent: <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> have signed Alen Halilovic to build on the desire to create a stronger and younger team. Alen has great potential, though his career has not yet flourished. He arrives in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> fully motivated, ready for that boost following his spell in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>. Left-footed, 169cm tall and 69 kilos, he is a creative and technical player with playmaking ability in the tight space, capable of operating throughout the midfield as no.10, winger or holding midfielder offering, therefore, a range of tactical solutions to <a href="gennaro-gattuso.html">Rino Gattuso</a>. The young Croatian tends to move in from the right threatening in the middle with abilities to break through the line. Welcome, Alen!</p>

  <p><b>[Alen Halilovic admits he struggled to live up to his billing as one of world football’s hottest talents during his time at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> but says his top-level experience since then will make him an asset to <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>]</b> I was very young two years ago. I went to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> when I was 19. It’s hard when you’re young and don’t get the chance to play. Now at 22 and having made more than 90 appearances in the biggest leagues in the world I thought it was the right time to take a further step<br /><br /><b>[The Croatia international said that he intended to learn Italian to ease his transition from <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> to <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>]</b> It’s an important step for my career and I want to show everyone what I can do. I’m happy to work with this staff and with my new friends. I’ve spoken to Coach <b>[Gennaro]</b> <a href="gennaro-gattuso.html">Gattuso</a>, I had a good impression, he explained everything to me and I can talk to him later anyway, but my first impression was great. I’ve been talking to the Spanish-speaking players like Suso and <b>[Mateo]</b> Musacchio, I want to learn Italian as soon as possible to make new friends<br /><br />I would like to thank <b>[Kevin-Prince]</b> Boateng and <b>[Alberto]</b> Aquilani, they told me about the history of Milan and the club, they told me that I have to train hard. The most important thing was to go where I had the chance to play, and at the age of 22 I chose Milan and for me it’s a big step forward</p>
