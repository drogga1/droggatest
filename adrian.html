  <p><b>[When asked to compare Van Dijk with his fellow countryman, Real Madrid captain Ramos]</b> It is very difficult. For me they are the two best centre-backs in the world and would make an unstoppable partnership on any team. I think that having them in front of them, in defence, any goalkeeper in the world could be very calm. I had the opportunity to train with Sergio in the national team. He is number one inside and outside the locker room. And what can I say about Virgil that is not already known. He is at a spectacular level. He is a top centre-back. There is talk of him being a candidate to win the Golden Ball. For me, he totally deserves it. It is not easy being a defender in the Premier League and he showing that he has a spectacular level<br /><br /><b>[He is delighted to see his decision to join <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> rewarded]</b> The thing with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> goes way back. The scouts had already contacted my representatives and checked the option to sign me, but it could not be done. I had a contract with <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> and it was in its last year, but things changed. I practically didn’t play in the league and negotiations to renew did not end well. But, finally, my decision to leave was the right one and it allowed me to change clubs. I had several offers from Spain, some of them were advanced and also in other leagues. But when I got the offer from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, there was hardly anything to think about. They told us that they would sell <a href="simon-mignolet.html">Mignolet</a> and I was the first option. If I said yes, they would not continue searching in the market. I just had to introduce myself in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. It was all done very quickly. In just two weeks everything happened</p>

  <p><b>[Alisson is back in full training at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and ready to reclaim his starting berth, but Adrian is not about to give up his place without a fight]</b> I think it was almost fate.

So to have two No.1s in the team is great for both of us. It’s a good decision for the manager because everyone wants to have the best and I think we are here - two No.1s. It’s not my mentality to be a No.2 and even less so when I am 32. Maybe in four, five years time I will tell you differently but it’s much better than being in a comfort zone of one No.1 and the other <b>[goalkeeper]</b> sitting on the bench forever. But I also like to be united and work together. I’m full of confidence to help <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> on the pitch and from the bench when the manager decides that Alisson plays<br /><br /><b>[Alisson has come back into contention ahead of a trip to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> We will have a chat with the manager. Obviously he <b>[Alisson]</b> is fit and training with the team. As I say we are two No.1s now, waiting to see who is going to play. Last season Ali did really well and I’m here to push him and to help <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. It will be the manager’s decision and after that we need to prepare for everything and if that is not in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> <b>[for me]</b> it’s to try and have an opportunity in another competition<br /><br />I feel really proud because if nobody missed the best goalkeeper in the world last season then it’s a good feeling for me. I was more than ready to face that challenge. The team has helped me a lot because it’s really easy to play with those defenders in front of you and we have made a magnificent start to the league: eight from eight.<br /><br />He <b>[Alisson]</b> is a great keeper and a great person, which is the most important thing. We both speak Latin languages and that helps. The goalkeeping group has a good relationship - Andy Lonergan is training really hard, <a href="caoimhin-kelleher.html">Caoimhin Kelleher</a> as well. With the goalkeeper coaches we are a good group. And with the emotion we have to deal with - one is playing, one is not - the group has to be strong and push everyone. It’s much better for us</p>

  <p><b>[Adrian’s patience rewarded by ‘best club’ <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> after shunning offers to head home]</b> The last year started in a difficult moment because, as everyone knows, I was in the last year of my contract with <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>. I spent a good time there, six years playing for them and I really enjoyed that time. We didn’t have an agreement, so I had to decide to step to the side and continue my career <b>[elsewhere]</b>.<br /><br />We are footballers and we don’t know where we are going to be in the next season or the next one, so we have to make sure we are happy doing our job and I took that decision by myself. It was a long summer with many negotiations with different clubs, with Spanish clubs that called me because I was out of contract, but I think the patience I have inside myself gave me the power to take the right decision and finally I think the best club that could have called me was the club who called me. So, I am here right now, I am enjoying the moment.</p>

  <p><b>[Adrian says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> aren’t a machine, they just want to win]</b> We are not a machine, we are human beings - but we have that winning mentality right now. The team has been working together for a few years. When Jurgen came to the club, he started doing many good things. From the end of last season when the team got the Champions League, that mentality has made the team stronger. The bad moment when the team lost the Champions League <b>[in 2018]</b> was really painful, but the year after they came back and won it, then the Super Cup and then the Club World Cup. We are still living the dream everyone started working on a few years ago. We need to enjoy it because we are in great momentum, but we need to keep our feet on the floor. We know we are a long time until we finish the season. Obviously, we want another trophy, to keep going in the Champions League and to start well in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup. There are many competitions ahead and the most important thing right now is to be together like a good family and fight for everything. We want to fight for all the games we have in front of us<br /><br />We are a good squad, we have a great team and we have good personalities in the dressing room, so everyone has his role. Everyone knows in the moment the manager decides you will play you have to give your best, as we always do. Personally, my position is really hard because just one goalkeeper can play and the others have to support. In the beginning I had my opportunity when Ali had bad luck with the injury, but I showed I was ready. Ali came back to play and I was waiting for my next opportunity. Now we start in a new competition, <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup, so I will give my best to show the manager I can help the team if I am selected.

It was just to learn about the things that happened on Saturday. It’s football; like life, sometimes you have good moments and sometimes you have not good moments. Last Saturday was not the best moment for us performing on the pitch. We are much better than that and we want to show that in the next ones, for sure</p>

  <p><b>[Adrian fires Atletico warning ahead of Champions League clash]</b> It was a tough game after a few bad results. The confidence of everyone was a bit down but I think today we showed the winning mentality is back. The team came back after the the early goal from Bournemouth and we showed again that we are here to face the end of the season and face the big challenges that are coming. It was really important to get the three points to get that confidence back again, 100 per cent. I think the experienced players have to show character out on the pitch. I think today we showed character, we came back into the game, we scored two good goals with Sadio <b>[Mane]</b> and Mo <b>[<a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>]</b>. They are back to scoring again and that is very important for the strikers to get confidence<br /><br />On Wednesday we face a big challenge against <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> here at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. We need to come back against the result in Madrid but <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> will be on fire for sure. The fans will be supporting from the first second. I think we know the style of play of Atletico. We have to prepare in the next few days as well as possible to try to keep the ball, be patient, move the ball quickly, because for sure they are going to <b>[try to]</b> defend the result here. But it’s going to be difficult for them to defend again for 95 minutes - here at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> it’s a different history. Madrid was Madrid but now we have the second leg here. We are going to win the game for sure.</p>

  <p><b>[Adrian ‘really happy’ at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as speculation builds regarding summer return to Spain]</b> This club has totally exceeded my expectations. I think coming here was the perfect decision at the perfect time, to come to the best team in the world right now. I am really happy I took that decision, to have that patience in that moment of the summer and to be here.<br /><br />I prepare mentally exactly the same as when I am a No.1 because I never feel that I am a second ‘keeper forever, to sit on the bench and just wait and wait and wait and don’t care about playing. I prepare in every session of training like I was starting because that makes me feel ready - for when any opportunities come, I am ready for everything. I never prepare myself to sit on the bench at the weekend. Obviously Ali knows he is No.1 and he is doing well. He is a top ‘keeper, one of the best in the world, and all the prizes he has got he deserves because he showed that he deserves them. But I think that the competition is great, the healthy competition between us is better for us because it makes us improve. The comfort zone is not good for anyone anywhere in life - you need to improve every day and keep pushing and keep trying to do the best. I think that healthy competition, that good feeling we have between us is great for us, great for the team and great for the manager.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s Adrian not fearing <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> restart]</b> No fear at all. There is respect, a lot of respect and responsibility. It is quite a serious situation, but we are professionals. We are here for what we are<br /><br />This week has been quite important regarding the meetings. There is still one with the captains, managers and coaches of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. They have given us the green light to train starting next Monday in small groups and the league is expected to start in mid-June. But right now the situation is still serious around here. You have to solve the number of deceased</p>

  <p><b>[Adrian credits fellow goalkeeper <a href="jan-oblak.html">Oblak</a> for inspiring <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> to beat <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in Champions League]</b> The first days you eat away at yourself, you don’t accept that was the last game, you get that bad taste in your mouth, quite sour from having lost a tie. When it seems that we have it pretty well on track at home, a game where we had twenty-odd shots on goal, but we lose. The man of the match was definitely <a href="jan-oblak.html">Oblak</a> and, in the end, Atletico played their game, they beat us in both games and they should have progressed because they deserved it<br /><br /><b>[Recalling his debut]</b> It didn’t give me time to think. When Alisson sat on the floor and the doctor gestured to make the change because he couldn’t carry on, I got up quickly. I didn’t have time to warm up or anything. It was the first game, and to go out that way and for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> to receive me like this, everyone getting up in the seats applauding me, after having lost one of the best players of last season, it gave me full confidence. From there my beautiful story began here at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[Adrian has insisted he is happy at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I see myself in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> at the moment. I still have many years of football left, and we will see. I have one more year and another optional one. Right now I wouldn’t change anything to be here in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and enjoy this beautiful moment. After this moment I honestly don’t know, football is a lot of fun. In the summer, being a free agent, I saw the possibility of returning to <a href="real-betis.html">Betis</a> was there, but it vanished. After this moment I honestly don’t know, football is a lot of fun. In the summer, being a free agent, I saw the possibility of returning to <a href="real-betis.html">Betis</a> was there, but it vanished<br /><br />To tell you the truth, now I see it being a little more difficult (to return to the Betis). After six seasons at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> and being free this past summer, it is true that I saw myself closer to returning home or to Spain and continuing my career there. Here I signed two seasons plus an optional one and this has been my first year, which has been fantastic. We hope to finish the season if possible, with total security, on the pitch, but then we don’t know anymore. The future is very uncertain; we can’t plan much more about tomorrow and what we have now. If the opportunity is given in the future, God will say.</p>

And this season everyone wanted to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> from the first second because everyone had the same target. We fight every session of training here <b>[at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a>]</b>, for every ball, for every second that we play, so I think we deserve it and we need to enjoy the moment - but also keep going because we have another seven games to go</p>
