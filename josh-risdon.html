<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Josh Risdon’s push for a World Cup spot]</b> Big goal of mine when I came to the Wanderers was to get back into the national squad and I obviously got involved in those last two qualifiers and the last two friendlies under the new coach so fingers crossed I can get in.<br /><br />Really enjoyed that camp working under him. Good to work with different coaches and different nationalities - you learn different sorts of aspects of coaching. Really enjoyed playing the second game against Colombia, it was probably the sort of opposition we’ll be playing against at the World Cup<br /><br /><b>[Risdon admitting the odds were against Josep Gombau and the Wanderers from the start]</b> He obviously came in under difficult circumstances, obviously inherited a squad he hasn’t picked and all those sorts of things. The club’s obviously looked to go in a different direction. One of those seasons, with the coach leaving a week before the season doesn’t help. But hopefully we can turn it around next season</p>
