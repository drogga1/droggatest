  <p><b>[Football agent Phil Korklin says <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> and EFL clubs need imposed BAME targets]</b> In the In Pursuit of Progress plan at The FA, they made sure that they were appointing a BAME coach to every single age group and some people said it was a tick box exercise. Some people said it wasn’t an open process, but the protests and the Black Lives Matter discussions this week have shown us that we’re way beyond that. The fact is the talent is there, but it’s not getting through, so potentially having a target installed until clubs actually do voluntarily get their levels up, I think is probably the only way<br /><br /><b>[Korklin believes the regulations do not go far enough]</b> If you’re looking at the numbers of footballers from a BAME background it’s between 25 per cent and 30 per cent, but there’s a massive under-representation with managers and in the boardroom. If you’re taking the 14 per cent of BAME communities <b>[according to a 2011 census]</b> making up this country then you’re only looking at six per cent for managers and you’re only looking at two per cent in boardrooms, or even less. So I think there have to be targets installed because otherwise people and clubs don’t do it themselves<br /><br /><b>[Korklin also insists a diversity problem exists in boardrooms at English football clubs, as well as at coaching level]</b> If you’ve got a fully white boardroom, you’ve got a racially closed network. The fact that they may not have relationships outside of that network, or the universities they went to, or the jobs they worked at, means there’s no diversity there. So when they’re looking to appoint someone as a manager, you’re more likely to appoint someone in your own image, within your own relationships and networks. If there’s no diverse voice you’re always going to keep going down that same rabbit hole of appointing the same people over and over again<br /><br />If you look back to 20-30 years ago there would have been a huge stereotyping based on where a black player would be put on a football pitch, and where a white player would be put. There’s a lot of research in America and in England that shows that black players were, completely incorrectly, categorised as having athletic potential, speed and physical assets. But then the white player was seen as a leader and intelligent on the pitch. The unconscious bias that would have developed from then would mean that an athletic player, when they’re then looking to make the transition into the boardroom, management and coaching, would have been seen as players that were on the periphery. They weren’t seen as captains, they weren’t seen as leaders, they weren’t seen as intelligent</p>
