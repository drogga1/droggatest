  <p><b>[Red Star Belgrade have responded with the highest anger and abomination to a report of match-fixing by the club]</b> FC Red Star with the highest anger and abomination rejects the story L’Equipe published today about suspicious result of the PSG vs Red Star match and involvement of anyone from our club in possible wrong doings. The article can harm and bring big damage to our club’s reputation and that is why we insist that UEFA and investigators in Serbia and in France investigate the whole story and get the truth. Today’s technologies and other mechanisms are so improved that it is basically impossible to leave this case unsolved. FC Red Star expects to get the truth at short notice and remove any doubt about our involvement in possible wrongdoing.</p>

  <p><b>[Five Red Star players test positive for Covid-19 days after 18,000 fans attend Proleter clash]</b> The aforementioned players are feeling well, and are in strict isolation as well as constant contact with the club’s medical team. The condition of the players is being carefully monitored and a new test will be performed before the start of the preparations for next season. It is important to point out that all other players, management and staff who were in direct contact with the first team have received a negative result. Red Star is taking all necessary protection measures and we will continue to do so</p>
