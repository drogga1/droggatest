You can’t help but learn from having players like Frank around you when you’re training and playing alongside him every day. I remember my very first training session with the club and we had a break and Frank said: ‘Can I get you some water, do you want a drink?’ It was incredible. As the new guy I felt like I should have been the one to be getting Frank, who has won so many trophies, water. But that is what he was like<br /><br />Having the chance to spend two seasons alongside him, you just learn what an exemplary player and professional he is. You got the feeling that this was a player respected by everybody and everywhere - not just in the club but outside too.<br /><br />I watched how hard Frank was working at training despite having won so much already (11 major trophies with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in all) and knew I had to do the same. As a youngster you can’t help but be inspired by people like Frank. He sustained his career at the highest level till the age of 36 and that is not for any reason.

At <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> I was able to play with one of the best in Costa for three years. I think <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> is one of the best at the moment.<br /><br />He has scored a lot of goals. When you see his career he has done it everywhere, <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. I think he can do the same here.<br /><br />This season we have been playing good but we missed the guy to score just one goal. We have had a few games where we have played well and in the end we finished with zero goals, even though we created chances.<br /><br />It was like that against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>. If we had a striker that could score three goals, the game would have finished 5-1. But that hasn’t been the case. <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> can do that. He is a top scorer, he can score anywhere.<br /><br />Have we missed a striker like Costa since he left? Yes of course. I like playing with <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a> and <a href="alvaro-morata.html">Morata</a>, but when Olivier is playing he is doing his best for the side, he is more of a team player than a striker that just scores goals.<br /><br />Diego was sometimes not the kind of player to play a one-two with, but in the box he was amazing. He just scores one goal, we won and you have the three points. That’s what we need.<br /><br />I think Higuaín is this kind of player, he can also link with the winger with the midfield, and he can also be the proper striker. Can he make a big impact for the rest of the season? Yes, I hope so<br /><br /><b>[Hazard clearly hopes <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a>’s arrival means he won’t be asked to lead the line anymore and added]</b> My position is more winger than No 9. I try to have fun with my striker and the other winger. When the striker is there it’s good for me<br /><br />We all know that I like to play the give and go with my striker so if the forward just goes deep, I’m going to be in trouble. <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a> understands this and that is why I like to play with him. I think <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> is going to do the same<br /><br /><b>[The 28-year-old has also made it clear he has no issues with <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> after the Italian said on the eve of the match that he was not a leader and didn’t do enough]</b> The manager has to say something and he will say it.

We had trouble in the second half and had a bit of luck too. But it’s still the most accomplished thing I have achieved, all teams included. The best result in the history of Belgium. We lost in the semi-finals against France on a corner. I will remember the feeling we left. We were not the best. But all the testimonials that I receive tell me that the most beautiful team was Belgium, I like to emphasise the pleasure and the memory that we have left</p>

  <p><b>[Eden Hazard says he has grown from a baby to a ‘big man’ in his seven years at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> When I came here I was a baby. Now I am a big man. But as a person I didn’t change. I am still the same. As a player I score more goals and I have more experience, but I try to be the same as when I started. And then when I finish I will try to be the same. I was a little bit scared when I first arrived. <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a> had left and when you have <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> in the team for sure you win a trophy. But at the end I played with top players. And if you look at my seven years at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> we did ­something amazing together. We won trophies together and I am just happy. I had a chance to sign for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> but I made the right decision. I spoke with the owner and I had <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> and <a href="joe-cole.html">Joe Cole</a> on the phone telling me this was the best club.<br /><br />I just want to enjoy myself on the pitch and play good. The best example is with ­Belgium. I played my best game against Brazil in the World Cup and I didn’t score or make an ­assist. That is what I like to do. I don’t think about scoring goals or assists. I just want to do my best. In terms of goals and assists this has been my best ­season, but for me a good season is not whether I score 40 goals. I don’t think it is my best ­season overall. I don’t look on just about statistics. I can still improve. You can always improve and you can ­always learn in football, the more you play the more you learn. That is my philosophy here or if I play in another ­country. The main thing is to be happy on the pitch<br /><br />When you play for ­Chelsea, at the start of the ­season people think about which trophy we can have at the end of May. So this one is an important one. We lost the EFL Cup final two months ago, so at the end of the season this is the trophy we can go for. If we win the Europa League, the season can still be good. OK not perfect, because at the end you want to compete for the ­Premier League and FA Cup. But we have improved in the past two months. And if we go to Baku with a strong approach we can do something good there</p>

  <p><b>[Hazard admits he needs more time to recover from ankle surgery despite returning to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> training]</b> I feel very good to be back on the pitch working with my team-mates. Now we have to wait for the matches to come, but I’m very happy. After two months away I need more physical work and more ball work. I just want to be ready for the next game. Now the training is better, we can train the way we like to. The first week was a bit strange, but now we can train again in groups and also attacking the goal. We just want to be all together and try to work as a group<br /><br />My first season at Madrid is bad, but not everything is bad. It is an adaptation season. I will be judged in the second. It is up to me to be in good shape next year. The group is good, I have met new people. For me it is a great experience. I still have four years on my contract, I hope be in good shape.</p>

  <p><b>[Hazard himself admitted with his characteristic modesty, he and his family had it far easier than most people during lockdown]</b> We do what we can and we play a lot in the garden and the children follow school online. We can’t complain. I think there are many people who are having a worse time.<br /><br />It’s been a year of transition. I will be judged on my second season. So, it is up to me to be in good shape next year.</p>
