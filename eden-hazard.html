Some of their players have asked for my jersey during the game but I did not have enough to give them! It is always nice. They have the chance to play against the professionals - we must remember that they are amateurs. We have a lot of respect for them.

  <p><b>[Chelsea forward Eden Hazard lifted the Premier League title under Jose Mourinho]</b> In tactics and training we do more with Conte. We work a lot of tactical positions and we know exactly what we have to do on the pitch, where I have to go and where the defenders have to go. We know exactly what to do. With Mourinho, he put in a system but we didn’t work lots. We know what to do because we play football, but maybe the automatisms were a little bit different. With Mourinho, Nemanja Matic was behind me in the season when we won the title and sometimes I stayed in front and Matic did the job. With Conte it’s different. I close more inside because Marcos Alonso is there as a wing-back. I just need to be ready to counter-attack if we get the ball</p>

You can’t help but learn from having players like Frank around you when you’re training and playing alongside him every day. I remember my very first training session with the club and we had a break and Frank said: ‘Can I get you some water, do you want a drink?’ It was incredible. As the new guy I felt like I should have been the one to be getting Frank, who has won so many trophies, water. But that is what he was like<br /><br />Having the chance to spend two seasons alongside him, you just learn what an exemplary player and professional he is. You got the feeling that this was a player respected by everybody and everywhere - not just in the club but outside too.<br /><br />I watched how hard Frank was working at training despite having won so much already (11 major trophies with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in all) and knew I had to do the same. As a youngster you can’t help but be inspired by people like Frank. He sustained his career at the highest level till the age of 36 and that is not for any reason.

I was always close with him and with Antonio Conte it’s the same.<br /><br />They have different methods. Conte works a great deal on tactics but Mourinho let it be. For me, I had great moments with Mourinho for two years and this year with Conte everything is going very well. I always take the positive from coaches. The two are different managers. They have always won, here and in the past. Many people said I didn’t listen to Mourinho, but that’s not the case. It’s not at all the case, I’ve always had a lot of respect for him</p>

I try to be the best in my style of play and if I can score then it’s good; if I score the winning goals it’s better.

I think we have two very good strikers in Alvaro and Michy. If they are not ready to play I can play striker, so I don’t think we need <b>[another one]</b>. Because we are missing chances people are saying we need another striker, but if we are scoring goals we are the best attack in the league and no one can say we need a striker. It depends on the form of the team and I think we’re happy with the team we have.<br /><br />Who is the best team this year? Man City. The strikers, <b>[Gabriel]</b> Jesus and <b>[Sergio]</b> Aguero, are not big. It’s simple. It depends how you want to play. If you want to play with long balls you need a target man, if you want to keep the ball on the floor you need a small guy. It depends how you want to play. Yes, it sometimes happens. From the first minute until the last one you feel confident. When you score early it’s easier because you have the confidence straight from the start of the game. When you see the second goal with Willian, it’s one of the best of the season because we create movement with one touch, one touch, and then the finishing is good. We want to do more like this. No, no. Maybe one big boy can do that also! Of course we are sharp on the floor, so maybe it’s easier to do the movement we are working on in training</p>

That is not really playing to my qualities. I won some aerial duels against Gerard Pique, and that’s not bad. But if I had to choose, I prefer to play like I did in the last 10 minutes, which was out wide. But it’s the manager who has the final word. On the wing I feel more comfortable. That’s my place<br /><br /><b>[Chelsea will now head to Camp Nou knowing that they have to score]</b> In games like that you have to be 100 per cent focused. One error, one goal. We should have scored more. We complicated it ourselves. A draw is a bad result. We won’t be able to think defensively in Barcelona. If we only think about defending, we’ll be in a lot of trouble. We will go to try to win. We have to win, we have to score</p>

  <p><b>[Eden Hazard has crowned Kevin De Bruyne, Harry Kane and Mohamed Salah as the three best players in the Premier League]</b> I think there are three <b>[best players in the Premier League]</b> - Kevin De Bruyne, Mohamed Salah and Harry Kane. I voted for Kevin De Bruyne. He is the best. I could have also voted for Salah because I played with him and he’s my friend but Salah is more a striker than a player. Kevin has got everything. He defends, crosses the ball, assists and scores goals in big games. For me, he is the best this season.<br /><br />He’s fantastic. He’s clever on and off the pitch. He’s in full confidence as he’s playing in the best team in the Premier League this year. When he’s on the pitch with good players, he’s one of the best in the world. Every time he has the ball at his feet he can do something magic. He doesn’t score a lot of goals but he can create something with just one movement or pass. It’s simple, he’s a special player. City are a team, though - not just one player. I can tell my team-mates to stop De Bruyne or <b>[Sergio]</b> Aguero but they have 11 players, they are not just two players. I’m happy to see Kevin before kick-off but for 90 minutes I’ll try to forget he’s my friend. I like to make jokes with my friends in the tunnel but as soon as the referee blows the whistle I’m focused on the game. After the game - win lose or draw - I will shake his hand and say ‘see you in March with the national team’.</p>

We were better with the ball, but we needed to do that during the whole match. For me personally, it’s hard to play well if you only get the ball three times. But, when we got the ball, we had to use it better - we made the wrong choices.<br /><br />I was trying to jump, but it’s not easy to win duels against Nicolas Otamendi and Aymeric Laporte. We didn’t play to our strengths today. If Morata or Giroud played, it would have been easier to play with long balls. I did my best. Conte put me up front, I tried to do my maximum, but I don’t think we played a good match<br /><br />We have had opportunities against Barcelona, but nothing at all today. It was difficult, especially to get out of their pressing. If you have the ball, you immediately have three, four men on your skin. We also missed easy passes.

  <p><b>[Losing both Eden Hazard and Thibaut Courtois this summer would not be ideal for Chelsea]</b> To be honest, you have got so many great players in the world that if Hazard or Courtois has to leave, you can find a good goalkeeper to replace Courtois. You have good wingers who can replace Eden Hazard. That’s the job of the scouts to find the right players. Sometimes you have to accept your best players have to leave or want to leave. Maybe because they want to play in a different league. Maybe because they have already won the FA Cup, Premier League and Carabao Cup. I don’t think they have won the Champions League with Chelsea, so maybe that’s why they want to leave and go to another club. You have to ask the question which team they supported when they were kids. So many kids will say: ‘I used to support Real Madrid’ or ‘I used to support Barcelona’. So maybe you have to ask that question to Eden Hazard? His dream was to go and play for Real Madrid and maybe you have to accept it. You have to accept it. You don’t have to be upset because he has played for Chelsea for many years. All the time he was playing with that blue shirt and giving everything for that club.<br /><br />At the moment, Manchester City are the best team in the UK and we have to accept it. Maybe they will be the best team in Europe, maybe they are going to win the Champions League, but for next season, I don’t think that City will be champions because every team will know how they play. Teams will play differently against them than this season. I am sure that some clubs will find how they can compete against Manchester City. Chelsea have the opportunity to do something<br /><br />Everything is about money so you have to sign the best players. You have to pay a lot of money, but sometimes you don’t have to pay so much. You have to sign the right players, which is different. You have to sign the players who play in your system. The question is that we don’t know if Antonio Conte will stay for the next season. Even if he doesn’t stay for the next season, Chelsea will have time to chose another manager. They will have time to chose the right players for Chelsea</p>

He is a great manager, but it’s easy to say when you are winning games. We will see in a bad moment. For sure he is a great manager, and he showed that to the world</p>

  <p><b>[Eden Hazard reveals motivation behind wondergoal]</b> I spoke with N’Golo on the bench and he told me he didn’t want to take a penalty, so the only solution was to score!<br /><br />I have scored some goals like that! Not all the time. It is on the top of the list, top 3. I remember around two years ago, the one against Arsenal at Stamford Bridge. That one was nice. This one also is one of the best, especially when you score against a big team and win the game. That’s the most important thing<br /><br /> think this game was more to have the confidence in three days time. We won so in the league we will change some players, they will change some players but we want to win again. Especially in front of our fans at Stamford Bridge. It is going to be a good day for us, I hope</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea talisman Eden Hazard has overtaken Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> Oh God, you see him do that every day in training so you’re not surprised when you see him do it in a game like that - but what a goal. He’s one of the best players in the world and he shows it. He’s been showing it for the last five or six years and he is establishing himself in the top three players in the world. At the minute, he’s probably the best player in the world, the way he is playing.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed further on whether Hazard can be placed above Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> Of course. They are probably a lot more selfish than Eden is. He is not a selfish player. He is happy getting two assists and the team winning. He is adding goals and he keeps improving … At the minute, he is the best player in the world, I believe. He is capable of producing magic at any moment in the game. He keeps defenders on the back foot and sometimes you see him attracting two or three players and that creates space for others, like myself, our other wingers and the strikers. When he gets closed down, he opens up space for others</p>

He had some bad moments last year and two years ago with injury but I think he can reach a fantastic level because he is a fantastic player. I remember that I was watching him at Everton. So, he is still young, I think he is a good player for the future of Chelsea. When you have confidence, you play more often. At the moment, he is playing, he played in the Europa League and today. He is playing 75 minutes. Confidence comes when you play games. So, I think he is a fantastic player. I think Ross, if you give him the freedom to play and the confidence on the pitch that he can be one of the best in the world in midfield. He is strong, powerful, can dribble, he is clever, shoot and score. He has everything to be the best.

  <p><b>[Eden Hazard wants to repay Maurizio Sarri for helping him find his goalscoring touch this season]</b> I think he is a great manager. hen you play football, you want to play for these kinds of managers because the way he wants us to play is the way that I want to play. So I am just thinking about this season. I want to win something with him and then we will think about what happens at the end of the season but now, in my head, it is just play and enjoy football then try to win the games. I think every year it is the same. When teams play against Chelsea, they are a bit scared because we have great players. It is like when you play Liverpool or Man City. This is a big team. For them, it is hard. We need to be focused though because in the Premier League you can lose a game. We drew against West Ham. Today we won 3-0 in the end but we could have conceded a goal in the first half. So you need to be aware of this. That’s the manager. You know, the manager is always saying you need to be focused. No mistakes at the back. Then when we have a chance, we need to score and kill the game.<br /><br />40 is hard, it is hard to reach 40. I think it is possible but it is not in my mind. At the moment, I am just shooting and scoring goals. I don’t think so <b>[that I am shooting more]</b> but when you score goals, you want to score even more goals. I try to shoot but I think at the end of the game I could have shot two or three times more, but chose to pass to Alvaro. I think I just try to do the right thing. When I can shoot, I shoot. When I can pass, I pass. That’s what I am trying to do. It’s true <b>[that Sarri]</b> wants me to defend and then to be ready when I get the ball. So we try to move the ball, then when my team-mates see me free, they try to find good passes and that’s what we are doing at the moment<br /><br /><b>[Hazard said of his former managers Antonio Conte and Jose Mourinho]</b> I had freedom with all of them on the pitch. No, that’s the truth. It is just that when you are winning games, it is easy to say that the manager is giving us freedom. If tomorrow we are losing games then the speech will be different. At the moment we are winning games so, of course, I can score goals and the manager is part of that, for sure. He is very good. He talks a lot with the players. He jokes a lot. When you see him, maybe you think he is a bit focused on the game but he can make some jokes. I think we need that. He is a funny guy but he likes to work. When it is time to enjoy, then he wants us to enjoy. When he is talking about football, the first thing he says is let’s make you enjoy. That’s good</p>

If you win, Mourinho is the best coach you can imagine. Then he is a friend of yours - you can do whatever you want. Want one day off? He gives you two. If everything goes well, Mourinho will experience football like me: with ease. Even his own image of an extremely defensive coach was not too bad.

  <p><b>[Eden Hazard airs future ambition amid Chelsea exit talk]</b> I have never thought about myself; I just try to play for my team-mates. I spend more time in the middle of the pitch now so I am more like a playmaker. Sometimes I am lucky to pass the ball and we score; sometimes not! I want to keep this thing as a part of my football: playing for my team-mates. If everyone can shine it’s good. I’m happy with my form and with what we have done so far this season. For four months now we have been enjoying playing football with the team and the new manager. I know I play for one of the biggest clubs in the world, and I can improve a lot in the future I think. I need to score more goals; we need to win more trophies. I won already a lot with Chelsea, but when you play for Chelsea you want big trophies like the Champions League, and to reach finals.<br /><br />Personally I feel like I went on to another level because of the World Cup. I think before the World Cup people thought I was a good player, but after the World Cup they were saying I was one of the best players in the world. That’s the level I want to reach and stay at. I think since the beginning of the season I have done pretty well</p>

It is good not just to be a target man, but also as a false nine where I can move, I can drop, I can go deep, I can go on the wing. I like to change a lot, but we also have two great strikers. We will see. It depends on who is on the pitch.<br /><br />We do a lot of tactical work, and you can see on the pitch we have improved a lot from last year. We have adapted to the new system. We have brought new players. Jorginho is helping a lot, Kovacic, the new goalkeeper Kepa is already very good. Everything is going well. The manager is talking a lot to us which is good</p>

At <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> I was able to play with one of the best in Costa for three years. I think <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> is one of the best at the moment.<br /><br />He has scored a lot of goals. When you see his career he has done it everywhere, <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. I think he can do the same here.<br /><br />This season we have been playing good but we missed the guy to score just one goal. We have had a few games where we have played well and in the end we finished with zero goals, even though we created chances.<br /><br />It was like that against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>. If we had a striker that could score three goals, the game would have finished 5-1. But that hasn’t been the case. <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> can do that. He is a top scorer, he can score anywhere.<br /><br />Have we missed a striker like Costa since he left? Yes of course. I like playing with <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a> and <a href="alvaro-morata.html">Morata</a>, but when Olivier is playing he is doing his best for the side, he is more of a team player than a striker that just scores goals.<br /><br />Diego was sometimes not the kind of player to play a one-two with, but in the box he was amazing. He just scores one goal, we won and you have the three points. That’s what we need.<br /><br />I think Higuaín is this kind of player, he can also link with the winger with the midfield, and he can also be the proper striker. Can he make a big impact for the rest of the season? Yes, I hope so<br /><br /><b>[Hazard clearly hopes <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a>’s arrival means he won’t be asked to lead the line anymore and added]</b> My position is more winger than No 9.

When the striker is there it’s good for me<br /><br />We all know that I like to play the give and go with my striker so if the forward just goes deep, I’m going to be in trouble. <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a> understands this and that is why I like to play with him.

At the moment we have a bit of pressure because the fans want us to be in the top four, but we’re Chelsea and we can deal with the pressure. We will win games and that’s it. We are there. This is a hard game but we can close the gap a bit on Tottenham. We have the potential to be in the top four but we don’t have to think about that. We just have to think game after game and try to win one more game. We are playing for him <b>[Sarri]</b>, the club, the fans and us. It’s not just about the manager. He puts the players on the pitch and then it’s down to the players to take responsibility. On Sunday we played a fantastic game, we need to look at that and try to repeat it. Then the manager will be happy.<br /><br />He <b>[Higuain]</b> is a top striker. If we talk about how many goals he’s scored, he’s only got two with Chelsea, but you can see around the training ground he’s very intelligent. He’s not talking English a lot but he’s talking to the Spanish guys and Italian guys, and he also knows how the manager wants to play, so for us it’s great to have him in the team. I always say I need a great striker. When Olivier is playing it’s important for me, when Gonzalo is playing it’s important for me. What I want is for them to score goals, that’s it. We have a lot of intensity and when we have the ball we try to be in control of the game. I know the fans want us to go forward and try to find space between the lines but we try. Sometimes we play against compact teams so it’s hard to find solutions. I like the football we are trying to play, with and without the ball, so it can still be a good season</p>

If he wants advice, I can teach him, but you know he has everything already. I think the guy was waiting to start a game in the Premier League, but he is ready. You can see the way he is taking the ball. He is playing with a lot of confidence. He is still young and can improve, of course, but he is already very good. I think he was happy to play today. You know when you are young you just play, and sometimes you try and miss, but the good thing is to give freshness in the team. I think Callum can play three games. He can run, he has the legs for 90 minutes. At 28 we are a bit tired at the end, but I think he is still young. As I said, he can still improve but he is in a good team to learn, and we are happy to help him.<br /><br />I told him if he stays humble at first, for me it is the best thing, to stay humble. Work in training, score goals, and then be happy on the pitch. He can go very far. I was not listening to everything <b>[people said about me]</b>.

But I think if you keep your feet on the floor and train … I think for him it is easy because the players he has around him are quite humble, so if we were all thinking we are the best, for him, it could be hard to stay humble. But he is intelligent and has a family that cares for him<br /><br />It is the decision of the manager. Of course, when we are playing we want young players and also English players because we are in England. But we also have Willian, Pedro, me - we have not only two wingers, but we have four.

  <p><b>[Eden Hazard says he has grown from a baby to a ‘big man’ in his seven years at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> When I came here I was a baby. Now I am a big man. But as a person I didn’t change. I am still the same. As a player I score more goals and I have more experience, but I try to be the same as when I started. And then when I finish I will try to be the same. I was a little bit scared when I first arrived. <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a> had left and when you have <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> in the team for sure you win a trophy. But at the end I played with top players. And if you look at my seven years at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> we did ­something amazing together. We won trophies together and I am just happy. I had a chance to sign for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> but I made the right decision. I spoke with the owner and I had <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> and <a href="joe-cole.html">Joe Cole</a> on the phone telling me this was the best club.<br /><br />I just want to enjoy myself on the pitch and play good. The best example is with ­Belgium. I played my best game against Brazil in the World Cup and I didn’t score or make an ­assist. That is what I like to do. I don’t think about scoring goals or assists. I just want to do my best. In terms of goals and assists this has been my best ­season, but for me a good season is not whether I score 40 goals. I don’t think it is my best ­season overall. I don’t look on just about statistics. I can still improve. You can always improve and you can ­always learn in football, the more you play the more you learn. That is my philosophy here or if I play in another ­country. The main thing is to be happy on the pitch<br /><br />When you play for ­Chelsea, at the start of the ­season people think about which trophy we can have at the end of May. So this one is an important one. We lost the EFL Cup final two months ago, so at the end of the season this is the trophy we can go for. If we win the Europa League, the season can still be good. OK not perfect, because at the end you want to compete for the ­Premier League and FA Cup. But we have improved in the past two months. And if we go to Baku with a strong approach we can do something good there</p>

The second half was more complicated for us, especially at the beginning. When the opponent scores a goal after three minutes it is difficult. But we got three points.

The first two or three months were not as I wanted. He told me to stay calm. ‘Be yourself,’ he repeated. He is a normal guy. He doesn’t complain about anything. He goes straight to the point. He loves his players. You feel that the group is happy that he is the coach. Even those who do not play. This is where you see that he understands what the players feel because he was on this side</p>
