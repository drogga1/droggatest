  <p><b>[Patrik Schick is already planning for life after Roma]</b> Money? I take it as motivation, and I hope that in a few years I can move to an even bigger club where logically I’ll be paid even more - that motivation has always helped me a lot. It’s not really possible to move much higher <b>[than Roma]</b> but there are a few clubs … let’s say Real Madrid, Barcelona or Manchester United.<br /><br />The season ended and I could choose, the offers I liked most came from Rome, Milan and Turin. Finally I decided on Juventus, not least because I was called by <b>[Vice-President]</b> Pavel Nedved and it all sounded so exciting. I was looking forward to it, and frankly in June I felt like a Juventus player, but I wasn’t … <br /><br />I knew it was nothing serious, just some inflammation that would pass soon. I was fine, and I knew there was enough time to rest and everything would be normal, but Juventus delayed my transfer. When I came back from my holiday, Mr <b>[Pavel]</b> Paska <b>[Schick’s agent]</b> said we had to go to Turin for another medical. I told him I wasn’t going anywhere, that it was already getting on my nerves and I’m not flying to Turin, it would be useless.<br /><br />It didn’t matter to me anymore, I was a little bit angry. The deliberations were unnecessary, and in the middle of July my €25 million release clause ceased to apply. So as far as I was concerned the President of Sampdoria <b>[Massimo Ferrero]</b> could name his price and put my value as high as possible. That’s what he did, he eventually got it up to €40m, a billion koruna. When I signed I felt great relief that I could finally concentrate only on my football</p>

  <p><b>[Patrik Schick says he feel very attracted to England]</b> When I left the Czech Republic, my dream was to play in Italy and I achieved that. Now, I feel very attracted to England, to be honest. Leipzig was absolutely the right choice for my career. I had also talked to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>, Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke here in Germany. In England, there were <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>, plus <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> in Spain. I just felt that Leipzig wanted me more, and I was also attracted to the playing style of coach <a href="julian-nagelsmann.html">Julian Nagelsmann</a>. I am sure that I made the right choice</p>
