  <p><b>[Wellington Phoenix should expect an aerial and physical assault from Perth Glory when they take on Kenny Lowe’s troops in Auckland]</b> We’ve got enough quality and enough ability in the team to stay <b>[third in the table]</b> but that’s got to be a personal choice individually, unit-wise and collectively as a team that they make that extra five yards here, five yards there in the game. Whether to stop the ball or score a goal - the choice is theirs.</p>

  <p><b>[Kenny Lowe backs Perth for A-League glory]</b> I’m probably in that majority, too. But does that stop people dreaming? Let’s just all wrap up now then, give it to Sydney and I’ll go on holiday. Crazy things happen, you know? FA Cup Finals - Southampton beating Manchester United - never going to happen; Coventry beating Tottenham - never going to happen. Crazy things happen in football, so hopefully we’ll get some crazy things that’ll put your viewing figures up and everyone will be happy.<br /><br />Why not? It’s feasible if you look at the fixtures - it’s actually possible - so why would you not feel that way? I’d probably feel it was possible even if it was impossible because I’m the eternal optimist. There’s going to be a hell of a lot of twists and turns before the end of the season<br /><br />It’s not all doom and gloom. Some guys are buzzing because they’re getting game time. It’s the end of the season, it’s contract time - why would you not want to play in a home final or even a grand final instead of being on the bench? If you win the next three, you don’t change the team, so people have got opportunities to stay in the team</p>

  <p><b>[Missing the likes of Rostyn Griffiths, Nebojsa Marinkovic and suspended Caltex Socceroo Rhys Williams, Perth Glory were forced to settle for a draw]</b> You want to win to get further up the league but I can’t fault what we did on the night. There are a lot of guys who came in underdone. They were honest in what they did. Lucian <b>[Goian]</b> and Dino <b>[Djulbic]</b> dealing with the big boy up front <b>[Baba Diawara]</b> was difficult but they were game at it. I just thought it was a quality game.<br /><br />We went through it piece-by-piece to be truthful. At the end of the day … you can work on your set plays all day long but if <b>[there]</b> is quality delivery - and that was quality delivery - quality movement, great timing, <b>[it’s]</b> very difficult to defend against</p>

  <p><b>[Kenny Lowe is daring to dream and the charismatic Perth Glory boss is urging his players to do the same ahead of Saturday’s A-League semi-final against premiers Sydney FC]</b> It’s not another league game - it’s a cup game. There’s a lot at stake - before it was three points and you roll to the next game. There’s nothing after this if you get beat. You don’t roll into another game and you don’t go into training next week. It’s game over. We want to extend the season. It’s a cup game and that’s the beauty. There’s a lot of romance in the cup and why can’t there be romance with us - a little bit of a dream and get to the grand final?<br /><br />Sydney want to create history, but why can’t we? <b>[Why can’t we]</b> be the only team outside the top two to go on and win it? It doesn’t mean we’re going to, but it doesn’t stop you having that aspiration and that dream. They <b>[Sydney]</b> want to create history and they’ll be devastated if they don’t. Everyone’s talking about them as being the best team ever and rightly so - they’re a super team - but the bottom line is you’ve got to win something. It’s just two teams - they’ve got two arms, two legs, one head. Anything can happen on the day<br /><br /><b>[Many expect Sydney’s Ninkovic to succeed Glory’s Castro as Johnny Warren medallist this season]</b> If he doesn’t, it’s a bit embarrassing. He’s the best player in the league by a country mile</p>

  <p><b>[Perth Glory manager Kenny Lowe measured in response to VAR decisions]</b> Look, it’s VAR there. Whether I think it’s fairly or unfairly it doesn’t matter. The guys are up there, they look at it and make a decision. I thought maybe on the second one I think there was maybe a block <b>[that stopped]</b> the defender from getting in and making a tackle. But hey, that’s what it’s there for.</p>
