  <p><b>[Alexandre Lacazette leaning on Arsenal legend Henry during learning curve]</b> I talked with Thierry when I arrived and I talk with him regularly. He told me England is not as easy as it is in France, he said it is different. But he trusted and believed in me, and if Thierry can believe like the coach believes in me, that is good.<br /><br />It was really frustrating <b>[being injured]</b> because I love football and I want to play. My team-mates and the coach believe in me and, when you are not as good as you want to be, it is difficult, so now I am happy and everything is alright. The surgery is in my past so now I can play 100 per cent and I am happy. I was playing a few times with pain before the surgery and decided it was the best solution. I don’t regret it. Have Arsenal fans seen the best of me? Not yet, because I know I can do more but I need more time because it is really different than with Lyon. I was in Lyon for some years, but it is better and better every day<br /><br />I think we can play together like Sunday <b>[against Stoke]</b>. The coach will decide but I like how Pierre plays and I think we can be good together. Auba is a nice guy and after the first penalty against Stoke he told me: ‘If there is another one I will give you the ball’ so it was nice from him. It was good for my confidence</p>

When you come off the bench you have to be ready for your team-mates, it is what I tried to do and obviously it helped us to get the win.<br /><br />The manager just told me to play my game and said we will win if I play well. There is a lot of difference under the new manager. You can’t really compare the two coaches - they are their own men when it comes to football.

He is like my brother, every day we talk, we love to work together<br /><br />To talk about the top four is early I think. We have to keep quiet and work like we did before and the season is going well. Just work as we did and we will see at the end of the season. The team spirit is good, of course when you win it is better. We will enjoy it, we are working well and we want to continue like this. It was hard for Fulham because they played well in the first half. They made it hard for us to play but we knew if we kept playing we would score so everyone is happy today. We knew if we lost the first two games it wasn’t the end of the world. We have worked and knew we could go forward so everything is better now</p>

There is no competition like who scores more goals on the weekend. Maybe in training because it is better to improve, but not at the weekend.<br /><br />We just have fun, we laugh, but we work as well. People can see that we smile together, we are a good partnership. But when we have to work, we work. We know when we can work and when we can laugh, and we just enjoy laughing and football together. I’ve known him since we were in France and he knows me too. I know how he plays so our relationship is natural<br /><br />Since the coach took the team we work a lot tactically, offensively, defensively. We work on everything because we know we have to improve every part of our game. So we just work every day and this is the fruit of the work</p>

I needed the next step. A few years ago I talked with Arsenal but it was not a good time. When they came I was so happy and the discussion with Arsenal and the club was so quick, and with me it was so quick. I’m happy because I know now the league, I know my players, my team-mates.

We’re a very tight group and we’re doing everything we can to improve<br /><br />Obviously we’re not at the top of our game at the moment, but we remain leaders in the Europa League, we’re still in the running in the championship.
