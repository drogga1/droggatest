  <p><b>[Alexandre Lacazette says there are no ill feelings between himself and <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a>]</b> Me, I am not jealous of anyone. I just want to win trophies, <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Auba</a> as well. Of course it is always better to play together, but when one plays and the other stays on the bench you just have to help the team when you can. Yeah (it does feel telepathic), but sometimes it is wrong! Sometimes he goes left and I put the ball right. But normally we work a lot to be on the same wavelength. We want to be as perfect as possible. Of course, the coach knows we want to play together but of course he has to make a choice and we have to respect them. Playing with <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Auba</a> is always a pleasure for me.<br /><br /><b>[Lacazette says that partnership formed naturally]</b> It depends on the player, how they think, and we work a lot in training to be quicker and have a good relationship. It’s been different this season because we have had <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Auba</a> for the whole of the season. <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Auba</a> is a really good striker and the defenders find it difficult to take care of him. But we don’t feel it is just because of us, we feel it because we are a good team. We have Mesut <b>[Ozil]</b> and more good players and it’s easier for the team. Even when I don’t play, like against Burnley, the team was good and we played well so I don’t think it’s just because of <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Auba</a> and me. We have a good group and we just want to keep going and play well<br /><br /><b>[Lacazette, who hasn’t played for France since 2017, sees a Champions League place as vital to his international career]</b> Lyon is my club since I was younger so that’s why I enjoyed playing there. But I really wanted to leave my club for a good team where I knew I could feel good. When Arsenal came I knew it would be a good club for me. I would like to be in the French team but I have to respect the manager’s decision. Maybe I need to score 30 or 40 goals, I don’t know. I know it is a really good atmosphere to have the Champions League in your stadium so I want to know it in Emirates. We just have to win the final</p>

He scored two goals for the team, so that is obviously good for us, but he also ran a lot for the team. The team worked a lot for him, so everything is good. I like to play behind the striker, normally it’s <b>[<a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a>]</b> or with Mesut Ozil behind me, but when I play with someone else I have to play deeper.
