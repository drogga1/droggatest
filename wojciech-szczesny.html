I have another four months at Roma. I am thinking about playing well, rather than thinking about where I will be next season. I will choose a club where I will be number one</p>

  <p><b>[Wojciech Szczesny is open to making a permanent move to Roma]</b> Staying at Roma? I’m happy here. I feel I’ve grown as a goalkeeper but for me the time to make a decision will come in the summer. For now I’m an Arsenal player, as soon as my loan finishes, I have to come back <b>[to London]</b>. I’ve always said I’d love to be back there. Like I said, what will happen definitely won’t be decided now but in a month or two months’ time.<br /><br />I came here after a terrible season. I was in a bad moment. It was a good chance for me to re-launch my career. Coming here and having a fresh start, new challenges, new league helped me to mature a little bit as a player. My best season? I’d say so, yeah. In terms of consistency, it definitely is. In terms of quality, I feel at my best. Am I the best goalkeeper in Serie A at the moment? It’s a big statement to make. There are goalkeepers on an unbelievable level here. I wouldn’t dare compare myself to <b>[Gianluigi]</b> Buffon, not as a man and not as a keeper. I’d never make that statement, no</p>

  <p><b>[goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny reveals he has a big career decision to make this summer]</b> The one thing I want to do is make sure I don’t stay still. I was quite still for five years - sometimes I played better, sometimes worse, sometimes phenomenal, sometimes rubbish. You take steps forwards and backwards. It is not very good for your head if you go up and down and up and down. I want to try to keep going up, with my quality and with my decisions that I make. I am 27, the best I have ever been, I still have room to improve and I want to make sure that room doesn’t stay empty. I want to go into that room. It feels like a big moment</p>

I’ve spoken to Gigi Buffon - a true legend of the game. When you join Juve, it’s because you’ve been chosen. I didn’t hesitate one moment before coming here. I’m ready to take on this challenge. Juventus is the best possible choice for my career. I’m 27 years old and I want to win. At this club there’s the right mentality to do so.<br /><br />I hope that we’ll succeed in winning the Champions League</p>

  <p><b>[Wojciech Szczesny admits he wanted to be at Arsenal for my whole career]</b> I wanted to be at Arsenal for my whole career. It is the club I love. It is the club I still support. I gave everything to play there. I regret not having done more there. I won two FA Cups and a Community Shield but I would have liked to win at least one Premier League title. But sometimes you have to think with your brain, not just your heart.<br /><br />My first thought was that sometimes you have to take a step back to take two forward. When I analysed the situation, it wasn’t much of a step back because I knew I was going to play. I got 21 games, which is not bad for a second keeper. I also had the opportunity to learn from one of the best in history and I had one year to prepare for the job of replacing him. It was the best career opportunity I could ever have. I am proud of the way it has worked out. We all have difficult moments in our careers. It is how you react to them that counts. Where I am now hasn’t come out of the blue. I have earned it<br /><br />It is easier because I am not Italian. It means I will never be the next Buffon. I will be the new number one goalkeeper of Juventus and that is it. My only thought process is stopping balls flying into the net. I don’t go into games thinking I can’t make a mistake because everyone is going to miss Buffon</p>

  <p><b>[Aaron Ramsey has been told he will be a great addition for Juventus]</b> He never considered football as a tactical game. He is the guy who runs for the whole 90 minutes. He runs more than any player I’ve played with, 13 kilometres per game with no problem. In my opinion, he’ll be a great addition to Juventus.<br /><br /><b>[On Thierry Henry]</b> The best player in Arsenal’s history. The best player in Premier League history. He was very demanding, especially on the youngsters. The guys always said they were afraid of him in training. When you failed a pass, he got pissed and let you know he’s not happy with you very vocally. Great guy</p>

However after that, he got benched, moved to Turkey and his big career ended.<br /><br /><b>[On Samir Nasri]</b> <b>[Nasri]</b> always thought he was some kind of gangster.

A delicate one, but it’s one of these. First, you laugh and then you are like, ‘I’m playing for Arsenal, and I hear stuff like that’. Before a Chelsea game, I hear this, ‘Watch out, Hazard, when shooting penalties tries to shoot to the corner opposite to the one you dive’. That’s funny, but then you analyse it and say, ‘Holy shit, he was for real.</p>

He’s had five months to prepare and he’s already picked up a little bit <b>[of Italian]</b>. When I took him to dinner, he said more than just a ‘hello’. He partly understood me and that’s a good basis to work from. I’ll take care of the rest to give him a hand.<br /><br />When he’s fit, he’s one of the best and he’ll give us a big hand in achieving our objectives. He came here for treatment <b>[for his hamstring injury]</b>, but here we have the best physiotherapists in the world. Whether he plays as a midfielder or number ten depends on the new coach. For me he can also play at right-back, since he defends very well.
