  <p><b>[goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny reveals he has a big career decision to make this summer]</b> The one thing I want to do is make sure I don’t stay still. I was quite still for five years - sometimes I played better, sometimes worse, sometimes phenomenal, sometimes rubbish. You take steps forwards and backwards. It is not very good for your head if you go up and down and up and down. I want to try to keep going up, with my quality and with my decisions that I make. I am 27, the best I have ever been, I still have room to improve and I want to make sure that room doesn’t stay empty. I want to go into that room. It feels like a big moment</p>

  <p><b>[Wojciech Szczesny reveals the unique experience of working alongside Gianluigi Buffon]</b> It’s incredible <b>[working with Buffon]</b>, I arrived here knowing that he was into his last year or two and I told myself it was an experience that could only come around once in a lifetime. I expected to meet an outstanding goalkeeper, but he’s also an incredible man. <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a> is the big leader of the team, a great friend for everybody. He’s a person we all love. He helps everybody and everybody helps him. He’s an amazing person, and I don’t need to say anything about him as a goalkeeper because we all know everything. It’s a fantastic life experience and I hope that he can carry on <b>[playing]</b>, but only for another year!</p>

Gianluigi Buffon was captain following the departure of Alessandro Del Piero in 2012, while he also donned the number one jersey. He was offered both of those by respective incumbents Giorgio Chiellini and Wojciech Szczesny, but Buffon gratefully declined, adamant he is not back in Turin to step on anyone’s toes</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny has joked that he’s the greatest shot-stopper in history after seeing the legendary <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Gianluigi Buffon</a> become his backup this season]</b> Recently I said that when I was back-up at Roma, it was to the best goalkeeper in the world, Alisson, who’s now at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Now at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> my substitute is one of the greatest players in history. The conclusions are that I’m probably the best in the world and in history. Seriously, an extra year of learning from Gigi is an invaluable experience and I’m glad he’s back. This is a good move for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and for me - the possibility of training with him, talking, watching, sharing insights, can’t be bought. I would have to be very stupid not to use it. I’m delighted. When I came to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> two years ago, I knew I would be his substitute for a year. Now he’s returned aware of his role. Our relationship is still great</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus team-mate Wojciech Szczesny says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>’s angry reaction to being substituted against <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> is normal]</b> I think it is normal for a champion to get a little angry when he leaves the field. He will return in better physical condition and, as he has always done, will make the difference in the decisive phase of the season. In recent weeks he has not trained at 100 per cent, after the international break it will be better. We all know the qualities and personality of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>.</p>

I will look to keep giving my best in the next few years with Juve<br /><br />I am here until 2024 and I want to win everything. This is the objective of the club and the players. We need to sweat, to run and sacrifice to achieve the objectives, which is more trophies and titles. I want to thank all the fans for everything they have given me, the sensations when I go onto the field. I promise to always do my best for this club. Nearly three years have passed <b>[since my debut]</b> and I always look to improve and do my best</p>

  <p><b>[Szczesny reveals truth behind <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> smoking incident and insists there was no bust-up with Wenger]</b> Back at that time I was smoking regularly and the boss knew it very well. He just didn’t want anybody smoking in the dressing rooms and I knew that also.<br /><br />Because of the emotion of the game, I had a cigarette after the game when the team was still in. I went in the corner of the showers, so it was at the other end of the dressing room and nobody could see me, and I lit one up. Somebody saw me, it wasn’t even the boss himself, and just reported it back to the boss. I saw him a couple of days later, he asked me if that was true and I said, ‘yes’. He fined me and that was the end of it. <br /><br />He then said, ‘Look, you’re going to be out of the team for a little bit’ but there was no big bust-ups or big confrontations. I was very professional about it. I was fully expecting to be back in the team a few weeks later but we had a good run of form and <a href="david-ospina.html">David Ospina</a>, who came in goal, played really well for those few games. He stayed in. That meant I was waiting and trying to win my place back in the team, or trying to convince him that I was still the best goalkeeper at the club by going out on loan. That sounds strange but sometimes it’s the best way of doing it</p>

  <p><b>[Ramsey was speaking to former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> team-mate and current <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> colleague Wojciech Szczesny]</b> When you come here you get the feeling of how important it is to win. When you change the club you arrive at some point in your career where you just want to win trophies. It’s good being part of a young project of hopes for the future. But we’re the same age, we’re 29 and at some point you say you’ve got six or seven years of your career left and you just want to win the championship, fight for the Champions League and challenge yourself. It’s not good just playing for the same team for 10 or 20 years and winning nothing. You’ve <b>[Ramsey]</b> won a little bit, you’ve scored a couple of goals at Wembley.</p>
