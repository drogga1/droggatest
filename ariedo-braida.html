  <p><b>[Luis Enrique had indicated as early as September that he would leave Barcelona at the end of the season]</b> Last September he had a little bit announced that he would leave at the end of the season, he has now confirmed well in advance to give the club the opportunity to find a new coach. We don’t know who his successor will be but I can only say that, after doing great things, Luis Enrique has proven to be a great coach and will demonstrate that elsewhere.<br /><br />It is very difficult to recover it 4-0, but with a player like Messi nothing is impossible. We all have belief that we can do it. Barcelona is the perfect place for him. It’s a perfect combination, a perfect marriage. He serves at Barca and vice versa. His life is here, it’s his city. He will not move from here</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona refuse to rule out move for Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri as Luis Enrique successor]</b> Allegri is a friend and we know each other very well, but it’s really not something we can talk about - it’s all top secret. There’s a different name coming out every day in the Spanish media, from <b>[Ernesto]</b> Valverde to <b>[Jorge]</b> Sampaoli, from <b>[Ronald]</b> Koeman to Eusebio, who is coach of Real Sociedad and is a part of the Barcelona family. Everything is possible. It’s something I would prefer not to talk about</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona midfielder Rafinha will be staying put at Camp Nou for the 2018-19 season]</b> Rafinha will probably stay at Barcelona. He’s a lad with great football qualities, he can decide matches with a skilful touch on the ball, and he can do it here or elsewhere.<br /><br />Last year he was coming off a serious knee injury and he did really well at Inter, he’s a very interesting player who is happy at Barcelona</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona director Ariedo Braida has admitted that his club are unlikely to move for Manchester United star Paul Pogba]</b> There are things I can say and there are things that I cannot say, otherwise I will get fined.<br /><br />I don’t think we’re going to move for Pogba, but he’s a great player</p>
