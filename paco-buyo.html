  <p><b>[On Cristiano Ronaldo and Jose Mourinho]</b> I believe that was the moment their relationship went downhill. Ronaldo was unhappy at the criticism from Mourinho - particularly because he was the one scoring most of the goals at the time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Is Cristiano Ronaldo the greatest Real Madrid player of all time?]</b> In the history of Real Madrid, there have been great, great players. It would be unfair of us if we forgot players like <b>[Alfredo]</b> Di Stefano, who is one of the greats not only at Real Madrid, but in football. I think Cristiano is a true Real Madrid legend for everything he has achieved, but I think it is difficult to say he is the best player to have passed through the club. He is surely in the top three.<br /><br />There are many players. There’s <b>[Ferenc]</b> Puskas, <b>[Paco]</b> Gento. Gento won six European Cups! There’s so many. It would be unjust to forget them because football has no memory and we practically don’t remember what has gone before. We focus on the present<br /><br />Cristiano is a star in every sense. He has won it all with Real Madrid, he even won the Euros with his national team and that shows his level. But it will depend on what happens in the coming years, if he wins more Champions Leagues for example. The Real Madrid of Di Stefano, Gento, <b>[Raymond]</b> Kopa, Puskas… they won five European Cups in a row and that is an extraordinary legacy</p>
