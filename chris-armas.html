  <p><b>[Red Bulls honor Wright-Phillips on a night he shows he isn’t just a goal-scorer]</b> To see it end that way, it’s great. The game-winning play he makes, I think it’s really fitting that he puts it in a really good way for Danny. Again, in our world here in professional sports, you don’t always see that; the superstar, the guy, the goal scorer, to work and work so much and run so much for the team. It’s a thing of beauty, really<br /><br /><b>[Despite his success <a href="bradley-wright-phillips.html">Wright-Phillips</a> has remained the unassuming star]</b> Just seeing him have to sit back and accept the recognition for once, because he never wants it, and we forced it on him. I told him before the game, it’s not our fault. You scored the hundred, not me, you know what I mean? So you’ve got to take the recognition.</p>

  <p><b>[Armas sided with his star player, saying that he doesn’t feel <a href="bradley-wright-phillips.html">Wright-Phillips</a> gets the respect from officials that he deserves]</b> I don’t think he gets that benefit of the doubt in these moments. Not when you see the them firsthand four straight years. And there’s probably no better forward over the course of that time. You guys tell us the stats, 20 goals a year, there’s no better – and he’s the most honest one of them all. He doesn’t cheat the game ever. So can the referee manage it in a way – the guy’s frustrated, I understand it - can I hold off on the yellow card?</p>

  <p><b>[New York Red Bulls vs NYCFC. They needed a late equaliser in a thrilling 3-3 draw at Atlanta last weekend and coach Chris Armas hopes the intensity of that game will prove ideal preparation for Sunday’s derby]</b> Does that one help you prepare for what’s ahead? I hope so. To understand the intensity needed, the focus needed, the quality needed at times, and the discipline that those games demand. Even what we said after the game to the guys is that has to be the standard. That shouldn’t be something we can pull out of the hat on certain days. The good thing is we have that in us. The challenge for every team and top players and coaches is to maintain that standard of work all the time</p>
