  <p><b>[New York Red Bulls vs LAFC]</b> When I was 14 years old, <b>[Bradley has]</b> always been supportive of me, as my regional coach. And now these days, it’s just each of us showing support for the other one. Along the way, I’ve been Bob’s biggest fan, watching him coach here or overseas or the World Cup. I think just on that day <b>[I was appointed Red Bulls head coach]</b>, Bob just offered the support back and the best wishes. It’ll be great to see Bob and his staff.</p>

  <p><b>[Red Bulls honor Wright-Phillips on a night he shows he isn’t just a goal-scorer]</b> To see it end that way, it’s great. The game-winning play he makes, I think it’s really fitting that he puts it in a really good way for Danny. Again, in our world here in professional sports, you don’t always see that; the superstar, the guy, the goal scorer, to work and work so much and run so much for the team. It’s a thing of beauty, really<br /><br /><b>[Despite his success <a href="bradley-wright-phillips.html">Wright-Phillips</a> has remained the unassuming star]</b> Just seeing him have to sit back and accept the recognition for once, because he never wants it, and we forced it on him. I told him before the game, it’s not our fault. You scored the hundred, not me, you know what I mean? So you’ve got to take the recognition.</p>

  <p><b>[Armas sided with his star player, saying that he doesn’t feel <a href="bradley-wright-phillips.html">Wright-Phillips</a> gets the respect from officials that he deserves]</b> I don’t think he gets that benefit of the doubt in these moments. Not when you see the them firsthand four straight years. And there’s probably no better forward over the course of that time. You guys tell us the stats, 20 goals a year, there’s no better – and he’s the most honest one of them all. He doesn’t cheat the game ever. So can the referee manage it in a way – the guy’s frustrated, I understand it - can I hold off on the yellow card?</p>

  <p><b>[On Davis and Marc Rzatkowski]</b> They were incredible. So disruptive. I mean Sean Davis, a will to win today. He’s maybe out-matched sometimes in speed and he still wins the race. That is will, that is focus, that is seeing it earlier than the next guy and wanting it more. It’s a big tactical challenge on the day for those guys, but they certainly carried their weight and then some.</p>

  <p><b>[Red Bulls cap record season with another Supporters’ Shield]</b> This is the beginning. I promise you we are going after MLS Cup. We know they want the Cup, and this is the first step. Some say the Supporters’ Shield, it’s amazing, but they want the Cup and that’s the first step.</p>

  <p><b>[Red Bulls head coach Chris Armas insists that the team’s history of playoff letdowns isn’t going to affect his team]</b> We haven’t talked about pressure, expectations, and we won’t start that dialogue now,” Armas said. “We know we defend well, We did again tonight. We really limited their chances, their big chances, so in many ways we felt in control. So the week is going to be about preparing physically, tactically, technically and just getting sharp. Go home and we’ll get ready for the next game with a lot of excitement in front of our home fans. Again, we’ve been very, very good (at home). It hurts a little that we don’t get the perfect result here, but certainly, 90 minutes to get the job done at home, we feel good about that.</p>

  <p><b>[New York Red Bulls head coach Chris Armas was not pleased at the usage of Tyler Adams and Aaron Long for the United States against Italy]</b> Both guys are a little bit tired and a little bit sore so we got to manage that. It’s not ideal, not ideal the way it plays out<br /><br />When you go to the national team, you don’t pick and choose when you play. It’s an honor to get called in and you’ve got to take what you get some times. However in the second game, yeah we’re hoping that you know they could be mindful of how many minutes those guys get. They’ll be flying and ready to go by Sunday. But of course yeah they come back and a little bit little bit beat up</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Atlanta and New York set for historic MLS playoff showdown]</b> Each of those games could have went the other way. As much as we had a grip on game two, Aaron Long makes a recovery run when Almiron gets through and Luis makes a big save. In the first game it’s back and forth. But in each game we were aggressive and we played our way, which is what we want to take from it going into these next games. We’re wise enough to not get ahead of ourselves, understanding how dangerous and explosive Atlanta is, how good they are at home. We’ll have our hands full, but we’ll have to reset for sure.<br /><br />We’ll have to be at our best. We’ll need a number of good performances and not let it slip at all against them because they’re just dangerous</p>

  <p><b>[Red Bulls pay the price for changing their style in costly loss to Atlanta]</b> You score a tying goal that gets called back, yeah it deflates you a little bit, but Atlanta put a lot into it. All of their players fought hard the whole time. It is always a little bit of a letdown if a goal is called back, but we didn’t make enough plays on each side of the field. We let ourselves down that way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Red Bulls and Timbers facing long odds to book MLS Cup places]</b> At home against Atlanta with three goals we have to make up, there are no three-pointers out there. So we have to get one at a time and we’ll go about it the right way and whether we are up high pressing or in a deeper block pressing, we will be aggressive.</p>

  <p><b>[RB Leipzig sign USMNT midfielder Tyler Adams from New York Red Bulls]</b> We’re genuinely happy for Tyler and his family and we know that he is ready for the next step. In these last four years, I’ve learned that he is simply incredible. Tyler has a maturity, fearlessness, work ethic, and desire to win that make him unique..</p>

  <p><b>[Sloppy finishing dooms Red Bulls in CCL once again]</b> I felt on the night it was a little bit self-inflicted at times. We saw that, as a team, they’re not always sprinting at you, and their back-line was always dropping in transitions. There was time and space if we could just calm down a little bit, but there did seem to be some unforced errors that we didn’t get right.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Red Bulls more focused on stopping Ibrahimovic than potential trash talk]</b> If you keep naming names, and throw Ibrahimovic in there, that this is what makes these guys great. That there’s moments where if they’re looking for an edge, or if something doesn’t go the right way, they’re coming at you. When you think of Ibrahimovic and (players like) Thierry (Henry). I know that everyone’s different. These guys have personality and bite. Michael Jordan would trash talk, right, and he’s the greatest ever<br /><br />Look, he’s a competitor. He’s a winner. We know this. Part of it is, yeah, he’s passionate. When things are going, there’s contact, there’s looking for an edge. In so many ways it makes him different. It makes him good</p>

  <p><b>[New York Red Bulls vs NYCFC. They needed a late equaliser in a thrilling 3-3 draw at Atlanta last weekend and coach Chris Armas hopes the intensity of that game will prove ideal preparation for Sunday’s derby]</b> Does that one help you prepare for what’s ahead? I hope so. To understand the intensity needed, the focus needed, the quality needed at times, and the discipline that those games demand. Even what we said after the game to the guys is that has to be the standard. That shouldn’t be something we can pull out of the hat on certain days. The good thing is we have that in us. The challenge for every team and top players and coaches is to maintain that standard of work all the time</p>
