  <p><b>[Alvaro Morata is perfect again]</b> I’m very happy for Alvaro to score again and hopefully that will give him the confidence to score more. Alvaro is a very good player and an important part of our team. It’s important for him to score and to help the side and hopefully he can continue to do that until the end of the season. He had a back injury but now he’s in a very good condition and it’s a good time for him. I think his back is perfect now and hopefully he can keep scoring, because we all know just how good he is.<br /><br />Every game is difficult, for sure, and Southampton will be too. We want to get to the final but first we have to beat Southampton and that won’t be an easy game, we will have to work very hard. For me, it’s very good if we can win this trophy. I haven’t done this in my career and it’s something I want to win with Chelsea, it’s a target for me and my team-mates. It’s a very good competition in England with a lot of history. Now is a good moment because of this win and there is a good atmosphere in the changing room. We have the international break now, so hopefully we can recover a few players that aren’t with their national teams and then come back and prepare well for Spurs. It’s very important for us to try and get the three points against them</p>

  <p><b>[Pedro maintains that he is likely to stay at Chelsea this summer despite seeing a frustrating period cost him a shot at a place in Spain’s World Cup squad]</b> Obviously I have a contract at Chelsea and most likely I will stay. I’m good here. I’m very comfortable with my team-mates and, in football terms I’m very happy for having won the Premier League and the FA Cup in three years. I’m happy because it’s always difficult to win trophies in England. I’m enjoying my holidays right now, getting some rest and spending time with family, and then start the new season in the best way.<br /><br /><b>[he has no complaints at being snubbed by Julen Lopetegui in favour of other attacking options]</b> It was difficult and very unlikely because of how the season had gone. I think he was right in that decision. I have appeared less for the team this year and evidently the best players have to go at all times</p>

  <p><b>[Sarri has Chelsea playing like Guardiola’s Barcelona]</b> The team is better than last season. This coach has a very good idea to press, to attack, to play, to have more ­players between the lines, to create chances, and to play with a lot of possession of the ball. This is very good. With Sarri we are running a lot but it is different because all the time you press really high. With Antonio, we were maybe more compact but we defended always in our own half. That means that when you recover the ball to attack, you have a very long way to the ­opposition goal. With Sarri, when you recover the ball you are in very good position to attack. You are close to the goal to score, to create chances. It is the most important thing and the most important ­difference from last season to this season. It is a very good change for the team. You can see it is ­better from the results we are getting.<br /><br /><b>[Pedro sees similarities between that system and the one implemented at Chelsea]</b> It is really the same idea as Barcelona under Pep Guardiola. They are very similar in their ideas, their attacking ideas are the same</p>

We are happy because he’s a very good striker. He runs a lot and scores goals, now he’s in a very good moment so this is the way for him. Scoring goals is very important for him and the team<br /><br /><b>[Chelsea’s midfield options have also been hailed by Pedro]</b> It’s very difficult for Maurizio to choose the right decision but that’s good for the team, it makes us strong on the pitch. Also it’s good to have options. Ruben is in very good form, also Cesc, Jorginho, Kovacic, Barkley, so it’s very good for the team</p>

  <p><b>[Pep Guardiola has been hailed as complete as a coach]</b> He was the best for me. He put me in the first team. You could straight away see Pep was an amazing coach. I won titles, we played great football - and he went to Bayern and now City, and won more titles. He is complete as a coach. He was a player, so he understands players, but he is complete tactically, and very good at motivation.<br /><br />That first year was probably the most difficult in my career. I had the expectation to win titles. Chelsea were the champions. But we lost games. It was difficult in the dressing room with players not happy. But I learned a lot. Under <b>[Antonio]</b> Conte in the first season I played a lot - he was a different character. It was a good season and to win the Premier League was great<br /><br /><b>[On Maurizio Sarri]</b> The character is different again. But his idea for me is the best, because when you recover the ball you are close to the target<br /><br /><b>[On Carabao Cup final]</b> We are still alive in four competitions. It is good to be in a final. In the league it could be better, and against City it will be tough, but the top four is the target</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea star Pedro has admitted that sometimes his team struggles to put Maurizio Sarri’s high-intensity tactics into practice]</b> All the team follows the idea of Maurizio: press really high, stay compact, and to create chances. With good possession, a lot of the ball. We can do this as a team. But sometimes it’s so difficult to play in this way. It depends upon the opponents. City played very well, so it was so difficult to press, to create between the lines and to defend. But it’s Maurizio’s idea, and I prefer to press high when we recover the ball to create chances, not to wait for 90 minutes to recover the ball and run 60 metres to score the goal. In the last few games it’s not been in very good condition for the results. Now is a good opportunity tomorrow to win and get our best confidence.<br /><br />I think it is always difficult for every manager, when you arrive with good motivation and ambition. It’s not just in the Chelsea dressing-room. For all coaches, it’s difficult. It’s not good for <b>[Sarri]</b> and the team because the results have not been good, but it’s good for us to change this dynamic now. It’s good for us going into the final against City, the FA Cup against United. In the league, it’s difficult for us to hit our targets, but we’re still in four competitions. That’s good for us. It’s too early to analyse the season. We do that at the end of the season. Malmo is a good opportunity</p>

  <p><b>[Pedro admits Chelsea will be in trouble if they fail to bounce back from their 2-0 defeat to Manchester United]</b> It’s a pity because it was a good opportunity for us to continue in this competition. It was a very bad day for us, for all the team. It’s a difficult situation. In the first half we played very well, we created chances to score one goal, but they had two situations and scored two goals. The most important thing was to do a good job creating chances with the ball in the second half, but we couldn’t do it and for this reason it was so difficult for us to come back. There is an important game in the Europa League for us, and, after, the final against City. The most important thing now is to stay calm, train really hard and recover our best football and our best feeling, because if not we are in trouble.</p>

  <p><b>[Pedro insists the Kepa Arrizabalaga saga at Chelsea has not destabilised the club]</b> There has been a lot of talk this week and that always destabilises <b>[things]</b> a little, but the truth is that in the dressing room we are together, as a great team. We have not given much importance to everything that has been talked about and in the end that is the most important thing. We are focused on doing well in every game to get the three points, because from here to the end of the season they will be all finals and we will try to fight to be in the top four. This was a great match for us to gain confidence and stay there <b>[in the fight for the top four]</b>. We have all talked to each other in the dressing room. We’ve also talked to Willy and we’ve talked to the coach. The truth is that we have solved all the problems and I think it has been a <b>[small]</b> incident rather than a serious problem. It always serves to learn. We are with Kepa, with Willy <b>[Cabellero]</b> and with the manager. This is the path that we have to follow. Now we need to get ready very well for the match against Fulham because it is another final.<br /><br />We have always been with him. We have always talked about all the problems we have had. <b>[Sarri]</b> had to make a decision <b>[with Kepa]</b>. He has done that and we simply respect him because we always respect all the managers<br /><br />I think so. We have played very well in the last two games, we were more solid, more compact and we created more chances. Against City we already played a great game. It was a pity that we did not have luck in front of goal. Today we did have that and this is the way to go. We have to keep playing like this against the top teams and against any team every week to try not to drop points and be in the top <b>[four]</b>, because now it is our main goal</p>

I don’t know whether I’ll keep playing here or not. That conversation is still to come. But I have not signed for any other club. I belong to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I have a contract. My wish is to be able to stay here but obviously we don’t know what will happen. I have to speak to the club and let’s see what happens<br /><br />We are working together with a lot of hospitals, not just in the Canary Islands, but also in Madrid, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and other parts of Spain. We have begun some good projects which include distributing protective screens for all the nurses, doctors, security guards and police officers. We’re trying to distribute the biggest possible number of protective masks for all these professionals, not only in <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">the Canaries</a>, but in the areas where there have been the most cases, in Madrid and Catalonia. We’re also trying to help many people through this initiative by supplying food for healthcare workers. Given the long hours they are working, it’s sometimes hard for them to get access to food, so we’re delivering meals to workers at different hospitals in various locations. These are some of the first initiatives we have but we’re open to getting involved with many others. I will try to help the maximum possible number of people, so that once more we can say thank you to all the people who are confronting this situation day after day and who have to contend with the virus, and with the people who have been affected on a daily basis. We want to thank them once more in this way for the work they are doing every day</p>

I know that the contract is concluding, but we have not yet sat down to discuss whether to renew and continue here or not.
