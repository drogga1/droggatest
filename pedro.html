  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s Europa League final victory over <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> has seen Blues winger Pedro add yet another trophy to his now unmatched collection]</b> For us, lifting a title is the best, most satisfying feeling. It means that we have done our job well over the course of the season and ultimately, to have the opportunity to feel that emotion when you lift the trophy is something unique. You have to experience it to know what it feels like because you cannot put it into words. You’re always eager to keep winning titles and to keep winning trophies because it is important for your career and it helps you grow as a player. You can get bored of many things, but never winning. You always want to win as many trophies and titles as possible.</p>

  <p><b>[Pedro clarifies comments on his future after being misquoted in Spanish radio interview]</b> As many people know, my contract is up in May. But I still haven’t spoken to the club about whether or not it will be renewed and whether I’ll carry on. I’ve seen loads of messages from <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans saying goodbye and thanking me for the time I’ve spent here, which I appreciate, but I’d like to tell all the fans simply that my current contract is coming to an end but I still have to talk to the club. I don’t know whether I’ll keep playing here or not. That conversation is still to come. But I have not signed for any other club. I belong to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I have a contract. My wish is to be able to stay here but obviously we don’t know what will happen. I have to speak to the club and let’s see what happens<br /><br />We are working together with a lot of hospitals, not just in the Canary Islands, but also in Madrid, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and other parts of Spain. We have begun some good projects which include distributing protective screens for all the nurses, doctors, security guards and police officers. We’re trying to distribute the biggest possible number of protective masks for all these professionals, not only in <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">the Canaries</a>, but in the areas where there have been the most cases, in Madrid and Catalonia. We’re also trying to help many people through this initiative by supplying food for healthcare workers. Given the long hours they are working, it’s sometimes hard for them to get access to food, so we’re delivering meals to workers at different hospitals in various locations. These are some of the first initiatives we have but we’re open to getting involved with many others. I will try to help the maximum possible number of people, so that once more we can say thank you to all the people who are confronting this situation day after day and who have to contend with the virus, and with the people who have been affected on a daily basis. We want to thank them once more in this way for the work they are doing every day</p>
