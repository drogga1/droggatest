<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Stevenage have defended former England Women’s team manager <a href="mark-sampson.html">Mark Sampson</a> from allegations of racism]</b> Like every professional club, no matter where the complaint comes from, we follow strict procedures, which were followed to the letter. The claimant was offered the chance to make a formal complaint but declined this opportunity, instead choosing to call <a href="fa.html">the FA</a>. Nevertheless, CEO Alex Tunbridge acted immediately to interview and take statements from two individuals the claimant said were witnesses, as well as others that were present in the same meeting, but not mentioned by the claimant.<br /><br />In each case the witnesses did not support the allegations. Given that overwhelming outcome and the circumstances of the allegation, the club concluded there was no case to answer. Both <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> and the Daily Mail were informed of that outcome yesterday. What I find surprising is that the Daily Mail still decided to run a story and <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> decided to acknowledge its existence, when both had been told the evidence did not support the allegation made. Perhaps now that <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> have the evidence, they will make it clear there is no case to answer. Guilt by association – especially when the person is well known - is a common weapon to use against folks in the public eye and when we find it has no foundation, we should be equally clear in making that known</p>
