  <p><b>[Former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> midfielder and manager George Graham does not believe <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>’s <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> can challenge for the <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title]</b> I don’t see United in the title race, even if they get a result on Saturday. A few weeks ago there was talk of United and <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> being added to the mix, but from what I’ve seen I think it will be a tall order this season. Even if <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> win at Old Trafford, Arsene won’t get carried away because there will be a lot of jockeying for positions going on for months to come. It is going to be nip-and-tuck this season. For me it is between <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. They will all go on a run of good results and then have a hiccup. It is good for the <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>, but not for United<br /><br /><a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> will rightly start as favourites. They’ve not lost since the opening day of the season, are scoring plenty of goals and look to have tightened up at the back. They’ve been on a good run and deserve to go top if they win. They look much more physically and mentally strong this season than they have over the past few seasons. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are still a team in progress. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> is an absolutely outstanding manager but I don’t think he knows his best side yet, or at least he hasn’t got it on the pitch. I’m not sure United’s <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> and <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> have got going yet in the same way that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s summer signings <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Granit Xhaka</a> and <a href="shkodran-mustafi.html">Shkodran Mustafi</a> have done<br /><br /><a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> has a great record against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and has got under their skin a bit. He is a very clever tactician and I’m sure he will have something up his sleeve to win the game. But it is on the pitch where it is going to count and I think <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> will be too strong. That does not mean that there will not be more intensity, though. There is some history between the two clubs and the two managers, but there are other teams emerging - City, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. So I don’t think it is a bad thing. It is so good for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I am so excited with the games I’ve seen and those still to come<br /><br /><b>[A win for <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>’s side on Saturday would see them move seven points ahead of United, but Graham is fearful of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in the race for the title]</b> <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have got a very strong squad. I don’t know what their best team is because they change it so much, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Arsene has faith in more than just his starting 11 and that has not always been the case. It is important because there will be times when injuries and suspensions will take hold and that has been a problem in the past. Despite a positive start to the campaign, I don’t think it means they’ve got a better chance than last season, for instance. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are a better outfit, but the competition is stronger than it has ever been. The teams I mentioned will all have a go. It is not going to be easy</p>

  <p><b>[Ozil told he lacks attitude to go with ability by former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> boss]</b> When I was a manager, I probably would have bought <b>[Patrick]</b> Vieira and <b>[Emmanuel]</b> Petit the other side and put <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> in the middle. He’s a real quality player in possession. There’s no question about it. If they can just get him working a bit harder without possession, they’ve got a fantastic player.<br /><br />The modern game now you have to play when you’ve got the ball and you play when you haven’t got the ball. This is the modern way. He’s just got to work a lot harder with the attitude as well as the physical side of the game.<br /><br />He’s never going to fly into tackles like <a href="graeme-souness.html">Graeme Souness</a>, who was excellent on the ball but was tough without it. Nobody expects <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> to do that, but they do expect him, when they lose the ball, to get back into the shape the team is playing<br /><br />The clubs usually, with two years to go on the contract, sit down and start talking. Then you have an indication of whether the player is going to stay or go. Obviously, they’ve made a big mistake I think in letting Ramsey go. He’s a quality player, especially in an attacking sense. He’s not the best in midfield winning the ball back for you but he gets goals and is a great player going forward, not necessarily defending</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal need to find themselves a £70 million version of Virgil van Dijk]</b> They’ve got goals in the team and they’ve proved that this year, the way they’ve scored goals. But they’ve also conceded. I see other teams like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, buying <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> for £70 million. I think if they can do it, can <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> do it. They need that type of quality.<br /><br /><b>[While the Gunners will be without Champions League football for a third successive season in 2019-20, and in need of another refresh, Graham sees signs of encouragement]</b> For me, I think it’s been a good season. If they’d have won the Europa League it would have been very good. The top six was a possibility, and they got that, but to be in the top four would have been an excellent season. They just missed out on that and when you see some of the games you can understand why. I’ve been there when I’ve seen them play well, against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> at home, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> at home, so I’ve seen them perform well. Now they’ve got to do that regularly, which is the problem. From what I’m hearing, he’s <b>[Emery]</b> doing a lot of work on the training pitch. I just think that the last few years the team have been struggling.<br /><br /><b>[Wenger walked away from <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> last summer after 22 years at the helm and Graham concedes that whoever inherited the reins was always going to find it difficult stepping into those shoes and delivering an immediate impact]</b> When Arsene left, whoever was going to take over, they had a big job. And it’s still a big job. There’s a lot to be done at the club.</p>

  <p><b>[George Graham says Neither <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> nor <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> will be challengers until at least 2022]</b> I can’t see either challenging at the top for three seasons at least. Even the top four will be tough for them right now. When standards slip, it’s hard to raise them again, and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> aren’t going anywhere.<br /><br />People talk about a lack of leaders and they have a point, particularly at centre-half. Think about <a href="tony-adams.html">Tony Adams</a>, <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a>, <a href="vincent-kompany.html">Vincent Kompany</a>, <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a>. Every <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> supporter wants a defender like that. United have been looking for years. They’ve signed <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> and hope he’s the answer. But that’s the word: ‘hoping’.<br /><br />United are under greater pressure because expectations there are higher, both for results and the style of play. It could be a good time for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to play them.<br /><br />United will have money to spend. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> will struggle to find the same money. Emery will have to try and improve the players he’s got. For both him and <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>, it’s a waiting game. It may be the top fixture again one day. But I can’t see it happening soon.<br /><br />Emery isn’t afraid to make decisions. If he thinks <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> should come off, he’s off. I like that, it’s the job. I sold <a href="charlie-nicholas.html">Charlie Nicholas</a> who had done his stretch. If the team is struggling, make a decision and if you upset anyone, so what? I’m told the passion is back at the training ground, which is good. But you do need quality as well. There’s not many in the current <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> team I’d have taken. The forward line is clearly the strongest part of their team.</p>

But it was well-documented in the papers. I can understand one side of it and I can understand another. We don’t want that to happen again. I think he will be punished. I can understand why he did it. The players have to be able to handle it. Talented players, young players in the first team, now aged 17 or 18 years old - they have a lot of responsibility. And they have to learn quicker than we did in the past. There have always been occasions like this. That was a surprise as he looks a very calm, controlled player.</p>
