  <p><b>[Roy Makaay says I Could Leave Feyenoord]</b> You’ll never know what happens in the world of football. I prefer to stay at Feyenoord, but everything’s possible. I can not rule out a winter transfer. There are always a lot of rumours when the transfer market re-opens. However, I’ve asked my agent not to get in touch as long as there’s no serious interest and he didn’t call me yet. I’ve read about the alleged interest of Alemannia Aachen and Nuernberg, but I’m not interested in playing in the 2. <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, while Nuernberg are supposedly discussing a transfer with an agent who’s not mine</p>

  <p><b>[Makaay believes that Bayern have what it takes to bring the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Champions League trophy home this time around]</b> I think Bayern have a very good chance. If the team play the way they did in the semi-final, I’m confident they’ll win.<br /><br />It’s a one-off game and you can never tell what might happen, but that said, I’m sure Bayern are going to do it this time. <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> are not bad at all, but Bayern are a little bit better.<br /><br />Every opponent’s awkward in a final, but <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> have nothing to lose. Bayern have got this far for the third time in four years and they lost on both the previous occasions. The pressure’s on them - but then, they’re a club who are used to dealing with pressure</p>

  <p><b>[Roy Makaay wouldn’t be surprised if <a href="bastian-schweinsteiger.html">Bastian Schweinsteiger</a> joined Manchester United]</b> He’s an amazing player, a world champion. If you saw him at the World Cup final he was bleeding everywhere but he came back on the pitch. He and <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">van Gaal</a> had a good relationship so it wouldn’t surprise me <b>[if he joined United]</b>. I hope he stays at Bayern. He’s a kid from the club and he has to stay there. But if he decides to move it wouldn’t be a surprise if he changed to Man United knowing the good relationship he has with the manager.<br /><br />When you listen to Van Gaal, there were players he had a good relationship with. <a href="thomas-muller.html">Thomas Muller</a> <b>[is one]</b>, but he was quite clear and said ‘I’m going to stay at Bayern’ and <a href="bastian-schweinsteiger.html">Schweinsteiger</a>, I don’t know what’s going to happen<br /><br />I know they had a good relationship so if he decides to change it wouldn’t be a big surprise if he changes for here. When we speak about experience, he has that experience. But I hope he stays at Bayern because he is still important for Bayern. He’s been playing there for 18 years, starting from the youth so that’s why I hope he stays there and he finishes his career at Bayern because he’s still an important asset. He still has a year on his contract left but it will be a big blow for the fans if he leaves because he’s the No.1 there. <b>[Arjen]</b> <a href="arjen-robben.html">Robben</a> and <b>[Franck]</b> <a href="franck-ribery.html">Ribery</a> are very popular but <a href="bastian-schweinsteiger.html">Schweinsteiger</a> is the most because he started <b>[at Bayern]</b> from a young age until now.</p>

  <p><b>[Roy Makaay talks about <a href="thomas-muller.html">Thomas Muller</a>’s versatility]</b> The funny thing with <a href="thomas-muller.html">Muller</a> is that nobody really knows whether he is an attacker or a midfielder. I could even imagine him as a goalkeeper, he would still look good there</p>

  <p><b>[Tenerife were terrible all year, flirting with relegation as their new striker hobbled to just seven goals. Makaay struggled with the quality and physicality of Spanish defences]</b> I was forced to act faster and become much smarter <b>[…]</b> you had to show that you’re there yourself, that you’re not too intimidated<br /><br />There is no club in the world that plays one on one against me. There are two, even three defenders trying to prevent me from scoring</p>

  <p><b>[Makaay believes <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a> could become the next striking sensation for Bayern]</b> During his year at Feyenoord <b>[in 2016-17]</b> I had him with me in striker training from time to time. At that time he was 16. He is undoubtedly a very talented player, but also very young. I saw his goals, excellent, beautiful. Now he has to play a lot to get better</p>
