Finishing the season would be the best way not only so the 2019-20 season is not compromised, but also to avoid compromising the 2020-21 season in any way.<br /><br />I hope to play again this season. Finishing the campaign would be a way also of giving joy to the population, because the Italian people are so in love with this sport. I hope that we can get the campaign concluded and be able to close this chapter to slowly get back to normality</p>

One is to organise competitions over a calendar year, but, again, coordination with all European federations is needed. Otherwise, we will have to close the season in May, before the European Championship. The 2021 championship could be played in five months. There are ideas on the table, for example a formula with two or more groups and then play-offs. Exceptional changes, only for one season<br /><br />No, there is not <b>[a date for resumption]</b>. We will go hand in hand with the other European leagues. If they let us play in early June, we have the dates to end in late July, and to follow, the cups.

I cannot be the undertaker of Italian football. I have the responsibility to defend the football movement and the sports movement. We are worried not about stopping today, but we are worried because if football does not start again it has a great negative impact on its future. I ask to be considered as a socio-economic impact movement in our country on a par with any other sector. I talked about June. I hope that Italy in June will have the opportunity to experience a moment of relief different from what we are experiencing at the moment<br /><br />What if the government stops? This is a responsibility that I leave to them. I personally would welcome their choice with relief: you can imagine the drama I am experiencing in holding up this battle of mine. Italian football is not a monad that lives separately from other categories in the country or international institutions, we are part of the European and world federations.

Our medical and scientific commission has drawn up a very rigorous protocol, as did all the other sectors that want to restart, but we’re ready to integrate it and modify it by implanting the guidelines of the commission, CONI <b>[Italian National Olympic Committee]</b> and recognising the FMSI <b>[Italian Sports Medicine Federation]</b> as a scientific reference to harmonise everything</p>

With a total shutdown, the system would lose €700-800 million. If we were to play behind closed doors, the losses would be €300m, and if we restarted with fans, the losses would amount to €100-150m, even though the latter isn’t viable. We have strong contractual responsibilities towards international partners and institutions, such as <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> and FIFA<br /><br />Yes, I would accept it. But I never asked myself the question. Starting the season again disadvantages us in a way. We had made a choice; believing that we could not play on three fronts, we had sacrificed the Europa League, because for timing and transfers it was the most uncomfortable competition. So, we would be able to play once a week while other teams played twice. If we start again, we would all play twice a week, so we would lose that advantage</p>

We made the decision to finish our competitions and we’ll continue on this path. Today, football has shown consistency. I’m convinced there will be great togetherness and that we’ll coordinate like we’ve always done with all our stakeholders, including Lega <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>, which doesn’t come out as the loser in all of this. In the event of a stop, we’ve planned a new format with playoffs and playouts, like <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> asked for. The pitch aside, there’s no better solution than to contest playoffs and playouts. A mini-tournament is always better than an algorithm, which has been clarified anyway: it’s a weighted average that takes into account the weight derived from the average number of points picked up at home and away from home, multiplied by the remaining games.

There are clear rules that allow you to continue activity, isolating an athlete or member of staff, and continuing training. The hope is that soon there will be a re-evaluation, a week before the start of the tournaments. We will send a new proposal in the hope that it can find space in the revision of the rules, which are today creating anxiety and worry in our sport</p>
