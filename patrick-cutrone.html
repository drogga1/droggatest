It means that I’ve done a good thing. Am I disappointed? Well, you have seen yourselves. I have nothing to say. I am always ready and charged. I wish the best for Milan fans and my team-mates. My departure from Milan affects me as well but that’s life and some decisions are taken. I will look to do my best. Now I only think about integrating well and doing well there. I’m ready and excited to join <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>. It’s a big challenge for me</p>

The club really wanted me and being able to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> for <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> is fantastic. I just can’t wait to get started. I’ve come here to play football. I’ll have to settle in initially and I’m looking forward to heading out on to the pitch to play.

It’s always the same story - foreigners are preferred to us.

  <p><b>[<a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> forward Patrick Cutrone believes Ivory Coast forward Christian Kouame will force him to improve his game with a challenge for regular playing minutes]</b> Competition is not a problem, on the contrary, it will stimulate me to always give more to improve and seal a starting place. Today each team must have a certain number of attackers to face different situations that are in a game. For better or worse, all the attackers in purple have different characteristics, so also with Kouame we can play together easily. Obviously it will be up to the coach to decide who to throw onto the pitch according to current form, rather than the opponent we meet</p>
