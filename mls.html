That is a virtually impossible standard<br /><br />The policy also provides for a set schedule of fines and suspensions for players who test positive for performance enhancing substances and that schedule was collectively bargained. Roman’s fine and suspension is in accordance with that collectively bargained schedule, so the length of the suspension and/or amount of fine could not be challenged successfully<br /><br />The problem is that in this country, lawful nutritional supplements that can be purchased over the counter lack sufficient regulation. As a result, they can and often are contaminated with undisclosed ingredients that may cause an adverse test.
