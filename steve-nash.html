  <p><b>[Steve Nash, NBA superstar and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham Hotspur</a> fan]</b> I’d rather <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> stuck around. That is a lot of money, but for me you can’t replace a player like that. You want to keep guys like that. I think we can afford to sign players and keep him. It’s going to be more difficult <b>[to succeed]</b> if you lose him</p>

  <p><b>[NBA legend Steve Nash says <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a> can thrive at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> I love him. Talent-wise, yeah <b>[he’s the best American player ever]</b>. It’s going to be very interesting, because I think he’s been very sharp so far at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. This isn’t a level above him, he can thrive at this level. He’s gifted, he’s quick, he’s got a quick mind, he’s versatile.<br /><br />At these clubs like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, where there’s money, he’s lucky because they’ve got a two-window transfer ban so they can’t recruit over him. These clubs, though, they’re going to have the opportunity to go out and buy a great player, so as much as anything it’s about him finding his spot and his role in this team and own it. He can be a great, great player, but if he doesn’t quite fit and nail down his position in the way that they play, he could flounder. He can be a 10, for sure, in the future. A lot of modern 10s start wide and then come in, <b>[teams]</b> don’t really play with that 10 in the hole that sits behind the striker</p>
