  <p><b>[FFDTV got its big break when young friends <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> and <a href="reiss-nelson.html">Reiss Nelson</a> turned up for a skills session at the age of 14]</b> I knew them from a young age. I said, ‘You guys come down’, I’d seen them do tricks before but we were going to film this one, and the video went viral. I think 40 or 50 media outlets posted it. At that time we knew that we were on to something special. People knew those two in the game. People in academies across England, even across Europe, knew them two. We wanted to express that England have players with the skills that people more associate with South America<br /><br />When we’re playing against clubs, what would win us the game? We can’t go to <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> and out-play <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>, they train four or five times a week, they know patterns of play inside out. We’re here two or three times a week but some boys come once a week, and you can’t work on patterns of play<br /><br /><b>[And right now is pre-pre-season - sessions designed to keep players sharp as they prepare to catch the eye of professional scouts and coaches during the summer]</b> We call it pre-pre-season which will get players prepared for pre-season. It’s not just going into pre-season with a club, we like people to be prepared before they go in. If trials come about, opportunities come about, we want them to be sharp. So it’s an important part of the season, we never switch off here, winter time or summer time it’s work</p>

  <p><b>[Shakeel Morris on his time at FFDTV academy]</b> I’ve been coming here for about eight months now so I’ve played against a lot of different opposition. I would say fitness-wise I have improved 50 per cent. My first touch, receiving it on the half-turn, these kind of aspects of my game have improved.</p>
