I’m focused on things at Roma, but it is especially nice when we are talking about Real Madrid.

  <p><b>[Despite his arrival from Internacional in 2016 as Brazil’s first-choice goalkeeper, then Roma coach Luciano Spalletti stuck with Wojciech Szczesny as his No 1]</b> It did feel a little lonely at first, but then I got to spend more time with my wife. She was pregnant and so I got to focus less on my career. I worked hard in training and learned a lot alongside a great goalkeeper like Szczesny.<br /><br />I wasn’t playing much due to the coach’s decision but I am a calm boy and I don’t like talking. I didn’t feel comfortable going to him and saying things because he chose to have two high-level keepers and he played me in the cups. He used meritocracy because Szczesny had done well during the first year but let’s say that I learned to have a bit of patience<br /><br /><b>[He seriously considered a move elsewhere until it emerged that Szczesny was off to Juventus last season]</b> I didn’t want to leave, but I would have had to think of myself and my targets. Nobody in Brazil, in a World Cup year, has a guaranteed place<br /><br /><b>[He is so popular with the ladies back home]</b> We had just won the title and went to a restaurant to celebrate with other team-mates and their families.

  <p><b>[Alisson has admitted that mistakes may happen as he seeks to embrace Liverpool’s ball-playing philosophies]</b> I try my best to help the team in the build-up. If sometimes there is a situation where there is dribbling, I do it carefully. It could be too risky, but it’s part of the game, we are a team that plays from the back with the ball on the ground. That’s part of the team’s characteristics. Mistakes may happen, but we work hard during the week to do everything correctly during the matches.<br /><br />Hopefully I will keep helping the team, it is a teamwork. I have my contribution, but I am not the main responsibility for the clean sheets. If we do not concede we will be close to winning because our attack is really good. I’m very comfortable at the club in a great environment, with everybody pushing in the same direction to win. We’ve shown what we are capable of and hopefully we can keep on track. The Premier League is very tough and competitive</p>

  <p><b>[Alisson insists he will not be stupid and repeat the mistake which saw Liverpool concede their first Premier League goal of the season at Leicester]</b> It was a bad reaction to a mistake, a defensive mistake. The most important thing was we got the win. I am angry that I made a mistake that put the team in a difficult situation. When one person makes a mistake, it affects everyone and everyone fought back together. We have to improve still but the result is what matters at the moment.<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he will try a similar move again, rather than clear his lines]</b> It was bad judgement. I made a mistake reading the play. I didn’t get a very good pass. We talked about that in the dressing room and I spoke to Virgil. It wasn’t a good pass but I could have just kicked it long. I wanted to keep playing and keep the possession. Now everyone is going to analyse that. I’m not going to be stupid and make the same mistake. We have to learn from our mistakes. It is part of my game <b>[playing with the ball at his feet]</b> but I am not going to be arrogant to stand here and say I’m going to keep doing it. We have to learn from our mistakes. If it is necessary the dribble has to be the last resort. Unfortunately, today, it caused the goal<br /><br /><b>[He said of his tangle with Iheanacho]</b> I actually think it was a foul but I don’t want to blame it on that. In the Premier League it’s not the kind of contact that results in a foul. It’s part of the game. I just have to make sure that doesn’t happen again</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool summer signing Alisson Becker believes his £65 million <b>[€72m/$84m]</b> transfer fee is fully justified]</b> I appreciate some people think that it’s a crazy, absurd amount of money, I understand that, but what is more important for me is the expectation that is placed on me. I’m coming off the best season I’ve ever had and I’m hoping to do even better this season. During that period I was the most expensive goalkeeper in the world and that was quickly followed by Chelsea signing Kepa. I’m calm about it. There is an increasing demand of goalkeepers in world football. It is not just the technical qualities they need but the leadership qualities and communication skills to help out the team. These are all characteristics I believe I possess. Goalkeeper is a very influential position and that is becoming recognised now. I am really happy with the increased recognition that goalkeepers are getting now. I’m glad to be a leading part of that.<br /><br />I am more mature today so I deal better with the mistakes than the many times when I locked myself away in my room and wanted to be alone. But if you look at my professional history as a goalkeeper I’m not somebody who makes many mistakes. My game is characterised by consistency and that is what has brought me to Liverpool and helped me develop</p>

  <p><b>[Alisson has admitted to having cried a lot as he headed for the exits at Roma]</b> Leaving Rome was difficult. I cried a lot, together with my wife. It’s only right that I’m honest about it. I made a professional decision, a step forward in my career and for Roma, who earned a huge sum. I decided with my head to move to Liverpool, but my heart was full of tears. I spent two special years in Rome. My daughter was born there and I have a lot of friends there outside of football. Many times I’d spend the night walking the city streets: the Trevi fountain, in the dark, is so beautiful it moves you, but the Colosseum is my favourite place - you can breathe history there. <b>[Staying]</b> went through my mind a lot because I was so happy in Rome, but when a player decides where to play, it’s a much bigger discussion. I’ve got big ambitions and so do Liverpool, and now I’m playing in the biggest league in the world. <b>[Serie A is]</b> not far behind, it’s just different and less intense.<br /><br />When the two clubs reached an agreement, Klopp called me a few times on FaceTime and he explained to me his project and what we would do together. I’ve admired him for a while, since his Dortmund days. I like being coached by him because he doesn’t say much, but he always knows what to say and how to say it<br /><br /><b>[Klopp’s response to his mistake during a Premier League game at Leicester]</b> He’s an intelligent man with character. <b>[After the game]</b> he came into the dressing room and started joking. He dealt with it in the best way possible, since I already knew I’d embarrassed myself. Then he told me not to lose faith and to carry on playing that way</p>

I’m working really hard to help Liverpool to achieve their goals and also for the Brazil national team.<br /><br />The Premier League has great intensity, you have to be really focused all the time. One thing that is important here is the concentration and focus. They are asking me to be really mentally strong. My team have a really great defence so it is not often the ball comes near my net. But I have one or two opportunities to show my quality, so I need to be focused all the time</p>

  <p><b>[Alisson says he has improved as a player since working with his new goalkeeper coach at Liverpool]</b> John Achterberg has proved to be not just a great goalkeeping coach but a great guy, a great person. Since I arrived I’ve noticed he’s loved by all here. He leaves me very calm and relaxed on a day-to-day basis and we learn from each other’s work. I’ve pointed out some areas that contribute to his work and likewise he has helped me with things I can improve in on the pitch. I believe the relationship between a goalkeeper and the goalkeeping coach needs to be an exchange, with a great deal of trust, and we have been developing this as a team, training together, and I’m getting on great with the other keepers. Simon <b>[Mignolet]</b> has been at Liverpool a long time and a long time in the Premier League. He has been helping me a great deal in the day-to-day training and in games<br /><br /><b>[Alisson says the level of quality in England pushes keepers to up their game]</b> The competition incites us to work harder. The competition between goalkeepers is healthy; we’ll see at the end of the season who has helped their team the most. This benefits the clubs and the Premier League. Every week of games we see wonderful saves by great goalkeepers and I believe I’m the new boy among them so I’ve got a lot to prove in the Premier League. I’ll continue working hard to demonstrate my potential on the pitch, contributing to a winning team</p>

  <p><b>[Alisson admits he was shocked to be joined on the field by Jurgen Klopp after Liverpool’s dramatic derby win over Everton]</b> It’s hard to explain what was happening. It was at the end of the game, I was celebrating. Generally, I prefer not to celebrate too much so I can concentrate on the game and stay level-headed but the goal came at the end of the game so I could let it all out. I ran to the middle of the field and did my usual celebrations, pointing to the heavens, thanking God, and then I looked to one side and I saw Jurgen and I thought, ‘What is he doing?’ It was a great moment and I gave him a big hug. I appreciate it wasn’t the correct thing to do and he has been punished for that - but it was worth it.<br /><br />A save at the end of the game is always great and you feel you have contributed to the game. Of course, an important save in the first minute is as important as a save in the last minute but for the fans it’s the closest thing to scoring a goal in the last minute, like we did in the derby against Everton. But I only managed to make that save with the help of my teammates’ contribution and thank God we got the victory</p>

They cannot go to the pitch and play but… they can do something to move us, to charge us to do something more on the pitch.<br /><br />It’s difficult to play against Liverpool. The quality of the team is amazing. And then the 12th player, outside the pitch, that is the supporters. Last year, I can remember about the semi-finals that they played against us, it was difficult. It was an unbelievable atmosphere. It was incredible. I like to play with supporters of the other team shouting, talking to me, <b>[it gives me incentive]</b>. But here was something different.

I know I have to work hard, I am part of a big club who have big plans and have big goals. I need to take this responsibility and take care of it.

It will be a great game and we are prepared for it<br /><br /><b>[Alisson will have Virgil van Dijk back in front of him]</b> It is great to play with him and all my team-mates. Our team has so many players with a lot of quality but Van Dijk is a very, very important player for us in the way we play, he gives us consistency. Defending high balls at corners and set-pieces, he is important for us. It’s very important he is available for the second game. Fabinho played well at centre-back but it isn’t the same thing, he is a great midfielder and just a good centre-back. If you can have the best in each position that’s always better</p>

I can understand people and I can communicate with my team-mates, which is really important. When I came here I felt that everyone was important for me, not just the Brazilians. Obviously, Roberto Firmino was already here and then Fabinho arrived more or less the same time as I did. All the players are important, be they the local players from the UK or the players from overseas. I admire the strength we have as a team and the quality that every single one of our players has, but the most important thing for me is the team spirit. Above all, I feel at home here. Home is where the heart is and where the family is. My family is here, my daughter and my wife live here and my parents come when they can. My brother lives in Portugal, which is not too far, and comes when he can. That helps when I’m missing them.

So we feel the responsibility yes, but we take it on and try to play as well as we can out on the field.<br /><br />In theory this is beautiful. But the reality is that there is a lot of work ahead of us, it’s not just seven games.

I played here against Liverpool and I experienced the power that the fans gave to the team on the pitch. They put a lot of pressure on you, it’s not easy playing here against our team. Now that I’m playing here I’ve experienced the amazing things that we have achieved in this Champions League, qualifying for the final in the way that we did, returning from a difficult defeat that many thought was impossible. It was achievable through God’s blessing, the work that we put in and a lot of dedication, plus the support from the fans on the night which was incredible</p>

  <p><b>[Alisson Becker admits to having been surprised at becoming a £65 million addition at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, but believes he has started to repay that sizeable investment]</b> When I first signed, I was surprised by the value. I think I’ve given a return to the club. I’ve met the expectation the club had in me through dedication and hard work, but I don’t think I’ve achieved anything yet. I want to write my name in the history of the club by winning titles, and we’ve a great opportunity to do that this Saturday.<br /><br /><b>[Ball-playing ability is considered to be crucial for keepers in the modern era]</b> I don’t think it is the most important thing for a goalkeeper. The most important thing is to make saves. Ability with the ball is just an accessory to help the team. It can be coached, but a goalkeeper first has to have it, and confidence is very important. When the goalkeeper is good with their feet, and has the passing skills to be able to control the ball under pressure, the team can use that and it can be part of a strategy. But if the goalkeeper doesn’t have that ability, skill and confidence, you need to be intelligent and play a different strategy<br /><br />There were only a few moments this season when <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> sat down and spoke about specific technical and tactical aspects of my game. What he wanted from me was more obvious things, to continue the way I was playing with Roma. The communication was very natural, and I found it easy to fit with the team. I settled very quickly because the characteristics of my game are what the team wants. We work a lot, as per our characteristics, to start our attacking play from the moment the ball is at my feet so playing out from the back whenever possible. I think that builds confidence. I don’t think it’s an obligatory tactic. Sometimes you do just have to boot it if necessary, but that’s what <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> incentivises us to do</p>

We are really happy and I am really happy that he could score, it’s important for a striker to score and I’m really happy for everybody and this title<br /><br />I couldn’t be more happy for him that he could score that goal because before the game we spoke about a lot about what this competition means to Brazil, to South American people and especially Brazilian people. And we have two Brazilians and he’s one of them. It means the world to him and it helped us a lot. On top of that, it was a sensational goal, completely calm. You see the last goal helped obviously to bring these things back and I’m really, really delighted for him</p>

  <p><b>[Alisson hopes to help <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> win first domestic title in 30 years]</b> It means a lot. We are in football to make history and to do our best. When I arrived at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, I arrived with the mentality to win everything because the club offered me the opportunity to win everything. We have a strong team, we are fighting for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. We fought for it last year and we are fighting now. We will fight again for the Champions League, now we fought for this title. We just need to keep going, to keep working hard - and I think this is a strong mentality of our team - and we just need to push again<br /><br /><b>[Alisson added on playing a leading role in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s latest triumph]</b> It’s amazing, the first ever club world champion for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. We are really happy to be here and we are really happy that we bring the trophy to our city, to our club. We love football, we love to play and we enjoy every championship that we play and we have more to come now<br /><br /><b>[<a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> has endured a tough time in front of goal at club level of late]</b> It is <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Bobby Firmino</a>’s quality, his moves, and he is really calm in front of goal. He trains like that, so when you train like that and you are concentrating, you arrive on the pitch and you do the right things. I’m really, really happy that he scored, he’s a guy who deserves everything and we are really happy</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s showdown with <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> marks ‘decisive moment’ in title pursuit]</b> There’s a big moment and decisive moment arriving for us in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and you need to stay focused on the moment. You cannot think on the long <b>[term]</b>. You just need to look for what you have in front of you to not miss the moment, to not miss the chances that you have. If you want to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, you need to try to win every game and I think against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> will be the same. They have a great team. They are in a good moment and we just need to give our best on the pitch to try to beat them<br /><br /><b>[When asked if the club’s supporters are willing <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to go one better than last season’s second-place finish]</b> For sure. I think all the players, all the people who work in the club are listening to that because this would be massive for the fans. It would be massive for us. We know how difficult it is to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Last season we were nearly one point in behind and yes, we will try to do our best to make that happen</p>

  <p><b>[Alisson says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have a lot of talismanic performers but <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> may be the most important of the lot]</b> Bobby is one of the most important players in our team - and we have a lot. I think everybody is important but Bobby not only scores when we need him, he makes the team play, he drops to play from behind. This is a good thing and it is something that he likes to do, he likes to help, and I’m really happy that he scored because a striker needs to score to stay confident and he is helping us with the goals<br /><br />We don’t think too much about breaking records but it’s good when you break them. We just want to keep going, to keep playing, to keep doing our best to make the fans happy, to make our family proud, to make the boss proud because we work a lot every day to come here on the pitch on a matchday and win the game. So, we do everything that is in our hands to make it happen and we are really happy with the three points and a clean sheet also<br /><br />As I said before, we don’t look to records, we don’t look to the points. We try just to stay focused on the next game and do our best on the pitch. We celebrate this victory then we have some days off to rest and have time with family. But when we are back in training, we need to be really focused on the next game, which is an important game for us in the continuity of the race for the title. We are doing really well so far, as the boss always says, we are being the best so far and we need only to keep going, keep pushing and do our best</p>

  <p><b>[Alisson claims <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have raised the bar even further]</b> With a lot of hard work. We are a very strong team mentally. This is important to maintain this high level even across so many games. Our squad is very strong both in quantity and quality. So when one comes out of the team and another comes in, the level of the team doesn’t change. This is important for a team that wants to achieve great things in football and it has helped us a lot<br /><br />We’re a team that have been together for a long time and getting better each season, taking it up a level each season. I think the difference from last season, which was already a victorious season, is consistency. Defensive and offensive consistency, and a consistent mentality. Our team have a winning mindset. We always think about the next game, we don’t look too far ahead. We focus upon what is within reach at the time and we do everything possible to make sure we leave the pitch with a win and this has contributed to the great results this season</p>

  <p><b>[Alisson warns rivals relentless <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will not let up in bid to ‘win everything’]</b> We want to win the title and for winning the title, you need to win everything. We are just looking for our main goal and what is behind is behind. We have to focus on our quality. We have an amazing group with amazing players - one goes out, the other comes in. <a href="adrian.html">Adrian</a>, for example, when I got injured, he comes in and performed really, really good. An example of the other boys, Fab goes out and another one comes in and it’s the same. Everybody helps a lot on the pitch<br /><br />We are enjoying this time because it’s good to be on the top. We work for this - to be on the top in a top level. We are enjoying it a lot. For winning you need to enjoy the game. The way we play, you need to enjoy that because if you don’t enjoy that then you cannot play all the games with our intensity. We try to do our best and be happy on the pitch. In Brazil we always say that you need to enjoy the game to be happy playing football because football is happiness. Of course you need to be serious because you are in a competition of a high level, but you need to enjoy</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> goalkeeper Alisson says there is a great desire to win embedded within <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s squad]</b> Despite being young, we have an experienced team with a great desire to win. We tasted victory by winning the Champions League and now we want more. It’s like a shark that smells blood in the water, focuses and attacks. We’ve developed a killer instinct. We feel that we can achieve everything we want - we have a long road, but we’ll continue to persist<br /><br /><b>[Alisson also commented on how <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> gets the best out of players at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>]</b> This is due to his simplicity. It is simple and true. He is convinced of his work methodology. And when it works, it has credibility. He is a very fair and correct guy with everyone</p>

  <p><b>[It has been suggested Alisson could be a contender for the Ballon d’Or if he continues on his current trajectory, and he isn’t willing to rule out such a scenario]</b> Yes <b>[It is possible for a goalkeeper to win the Ballon d’Or]</b>, but it depends on a lot of factors. It’s about consistency. My main objective, after all the collective achievements, is to be the best version of myself, to do better than the past season. Sometimes just maintaining a high level is also a step forward. As much as I have won all these awards, I still have a long way to go. If you look at Dida’s resume, I don’t come anywhere close<br /><br /><b>[Claudio]</b> <a href="claudio-taffarel.html">Taffarel</a> was one of the best and Julio Cesar has had a very successful career and is one of the goalkeepers with the most performances for the national team. I can’t put myself next to them at the moment - maybe after I’ve retired</p>

  <p><b>[Alisson thanks <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> for opportunity to ‘become a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> legend’ and sets sights on more silverware]</b> There’s not many words that I could describe, maybe in Portuguese I can do that better! But yeah, he means, I think, everything for this club, for the squad. He brought us together here, he gave me the opportunity to come to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, he makes me feel special inside. My team-mates make me feel special inside and the supporters also, everybody, but the boss has a special place in everything I think for everybody - for the club and also for the supporters because he gave his life to achieve those things that we are achieving. I will always respect him, have big respect for him, and also be thankful to him for bringing me here and giving me the opportunity to become a legend here for Liverpool<br /><br />We did already something special for this club, but you can see from what every player says inside the dressing room that we want to do more. This is our desire, we want to win more, win more titles for this club, win more individual awards. We want to be the best team and to be the best we can, the best version of ourselves. The sky is the limit so we need to keep pushing, we look forward also for the next challenge. Now the next challenge is the next game, but in a long perspective we have the next season and we will do everything to win that again</p>
