  <p><b>[Alisson Becker admits to having been surprised at becoming a £65 million addition at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, but believes he has started to repay that sizeable investment]</b> When I first signed, I was surprised by the value. I think I’ve given a return to the club. I’ve met the expectation the club had in me through dedication and hard work, but I don’t think I’ve achieved anything yet. I want to write my name in the history of the club by winning titles, and we’ve a great opportunity to do that this Saturday.<br /><br /><b>[Ball-playing ability is considered to be crucial for keepers in the modern era]</b> I don’t think it is the most important thing for a goalkeeper. The most important thing is to make saves. Ability with the ball is just an accessory to help the team. It can be coached, but a goalkeeper first has to have it, and confidence is very important. When the goalkeeper is good with their feet, and has the passing skills to be able to control the ball under pressure, the team can use that and it can be part of a strategy. But if the goalkeeper doesn’t have that ability, skill and confidence, you need to be intelligent and play a different strategy<br /><br />There were only a few moments this season when <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> sat down and spoke about specific technical and tactical aspects of my game. What he wanted from me was more obvious things, to continue the way I was playing with Roma. The communication was very natural, and I found it easy to fit with the team. I settled very quickly because the characteristics of my game are what the team wants. We work a lot, as per our characteristics, to start our attacking play from the moment the ball is at my feet so playing out from the back whenever possible. I think that builds confidence. I don’t think it’s an obligatory tactic. Sometimes you do just have to boot it if necessary, but that’s what <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> incentivises us to do</p>

I hope this season - and I will work this season - to make it more. I’m very happy to be back. I had nice holidays with the family, spending time with my family and friends, but I was missing the pitch, the lads, the staff, everyone. Now I am looking forward to coming back to play and starting to work again. <b>[As a team]</b> we are excited, but we have to keep our feet on the ground, just as we did last season.

For Brazil, it’s been a long time since we won it - the last time was 2007, if I am not mistaken - so it was important for us<br /><br />My first goal is always to win with the team, to win for the club.

Now I’m running, jumping on my right leg that was injured so I’m really happy for that. It’s great.

Actually, I was only the <b>[world’s]</b> most expensive goalkeeper for two weeks! But I knew it was a very big transfer, something out of the ordinary. That generated huge external expectations, but I didn’t demand any more from myself than I normally would - which is already a lot, regardless of my transfer value. For me, the most important thing is always to give your very best to help the team<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on how he plans to remain at the top of his game]</b> Over and above the technical and physical requirements, in which I think I have a high level, for me the most important thing is the mental side. It’s essential for a keeper to be focused throughout the match. You can’t relax for a minute, or it can be fatal. Therefore, what I work on most is my concentration. I really like to watch goals from all the leagues as well so I can analyse what I’d do differently in the same situation. I like to see saves too - I’ve always been very observant.

In Italy, he already had the quality and potential that we all know of, but he did not have the self-belief that he has discovered here. It has all changed. He has grown up enormously, taken on another dimension and this club has a lot to do with it<br /><br />You don’t realise it from the outside but, when you arrive in a club, when you live in this city, you discover that everyone aspires for you to do better. Not only the staff, your coaches, but the entire environment, the media, the fans, everyone who loves this club make it so that it doesn’t resemble any other club in the world. It gives you enormous confidence and strength</p>

And <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> helped me a lot! Against him, I experienced some of my best footballing memories<br /><br />We have always been in competition to be the best. But the luck I’ve had with him is to have him as a big brother. I never considered him a rival but as a support. Sometimes I do not have words to say what he means to me<br /><br />I’ve always had some great competition! I believe that God has put these great players in my path so that I can become better every day</p>

  <p><b>[Alisson reveals key reason behind <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> finally recording back-to-back clean sheets]</b> It was just a matter of time and of focus. The last two games, we were focused for the full game. Even if they had chances we were there, the defenders were there and I was there to help the team. We just need to keep going with this focus because we know our quality and we know what we can do on the pitch when we put in our whole intensity. You need to do that for 90 minutes - it’s hard, we know, but I think we showed we can do this<br /><br />The message was just to keep going and keep working. In the first half they made our job more difficult with the intensity they put in; they had chances, of course, but we neutralised them in the chances, I could make the saves. I’m happy with the result and happy with what we did on the pitch. It was a difficult game for us but we did very well, everybody playing together and moving together, defending in a good way and attacking in a good way. I’m glad about the score, I’m glad about the clean sheet - but the three points were the most important thing we needed</p>

I’m excited to be playing in the Club World Cup final - it is a dream come true. I was a young boy at 14 when I watched my club Internacional win it in 2006 as a fan. Now I’m here with this opportunity to win it with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. It’s big for Brazilians, but I think it’s bigger for the people playing in it.

It is a great competition and they play really good football. In their last game there were more than 10,000 <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a> supporters, but this is not just big for them, it’s big for us also.

And we value him a lot. I think he is one of the most important players for us. He doesn’t just score, but he assists too. He makes the team play from behind, he helps us a lot and makes a difference. We are really happy and I am really happy that he could score, it’s important for a striker to score and I’m really happy for everybody and this title<br /><br />I couldn’t be more happy for him that he could score that goal because before the game we spoke about a lot about what this competition means to Brazil, to South American people and especially Brazilian people. And we have two Brazilians and he’s one of them. It means the world to him and it helped us a lot. On top of that, it was a sensational goal, completely calm. You see the last goal helped obviously to bring these things back and I’m really, really delighted for him</p>

But when we are back in training, we need to be really focused on the next game, which is an important game for us in the continuity of the race for the title.

This is important to maintain this high level even across so many games. Our squad is very strong both in quantity and quality. So when one comes out of the team and another comes in, the level of the team doesn’t change. This is important for a team that wants to achieve great things in football and it has helped us a lot<br /><br />We’re a team that have been together for a long time and getting better each season, taking it up a level each season. I think the difference from last season, which was already a victorious season, is consistency. Defensive and offensive consistency, and a consistent mentality. Our team have a winning mindset. We always think about the next game, we don’t look too far ahead. We focus upon what is within reach at the time and we do everything possible to make sure we leave the pitch with a win and this has contributed to the great results this season</p>

We have an amazing group with amazing players - one goes out, the other comes in. <a href="adrian.html">Adrian</a>, for example, when I got injured, he comes in and performed really, really good.

It’s about consistency. My main objective, after all the collective achievements, is to be the best version of myself, to do better than the past season.
