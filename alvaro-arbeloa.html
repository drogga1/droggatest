  <p><b>[Alvaro Arbeloa on <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a>]</b> <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> is a scandalously good player. I wouldn’t say the media jumped on board too quickly. In fact, you’ve taken your time to realise just how good he is. Then again, we see him in training every day, you only see him once a week. We knew he was special straight away. Sometimes it can seem like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is the only player here, but there are other good players too - and <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> is bueno, bueno</p>

  <p><b>[Alvaro Arbeloa says <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> are clearly better than <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> Madrid are clearly better than <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> because it’s a results business and they’ve been excellent. It’s difficult to win the Champions League without being the best, but to win three in a row or four in five years, you have to be really good and know how to perform in key moments.

He’s a great guy and one of those guys who’s worth <b>[working with]</b>. He made a big impact on me, both professionally and personally.
