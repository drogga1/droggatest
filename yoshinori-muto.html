<blockquote>
  <p>[Yoshinori Muto is preparing to line up against Chelsea for Newcastle] I was 22 when I got the offer from Chelsea. At the time, I didn’t feel the manager of the club really wanted or needed me. I think they wanted to sign the young potential of players and then loan them out to help them progress. Instead of doing that, I wanted to stay at a club to help me progress. I wanted to feel like I could make my own progress step by step, therefore I didn’t take the opportunity.<br /><br />Of course, it is a strange feeling to play against Chelsea. They are obviously a fantastic club, really strong. If we can be united as a team, as one, then they are an opponent we can get a win. We really need the three points. If I contribute by scoring or assisting, it will be a fantastic weekend</p>

  <p>[Newcastle United striker Yoshinori Muto wants his goal against Manchester United to kick start his season] I would like to build my future from the goal at Man United. used on grabbing a good result. I was confident that I could start then my motivation would be sky high because we were against very strong opponents. As a result, scoring a goal against them has given me more confidence.<br /><br />I should have scored another goal with a chance like that. That was the worst possible result for us. But we have to stay focused on the future</p>
