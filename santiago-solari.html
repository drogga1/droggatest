He’s got incredible tactics, he makes his team-mates better and he worked very hard also in defence which I think are fantastic characteristics which say a lot about him.<br /><br />I want to be positive, not negative. I’d love to win every game 7-0 but I know how football is. It is tough and there are moments when the dynamics are better, times when things are delicate and require order, commitment, focus, impetus and competitive desire. Today we showed all of those things. We were patient, persistent and didn’t give up right to the end. We stayed organised in a finely-balanced game</p>

The match could be different, because it depends on the strength. We were not strong in any of the areas. I did not like the second half. I must take responsibility for the team that I fielded and the game I am proposing, with many young guys. It has helped us to give them experience and they need it: young players, players who need rest and those who come back from injury. It is not a path of roses. We do not like the result. We had confidence in a victory.<br /><br /><b>[Solari insists he is not bothered about the crowd’s actions and says he did not see Isco react]</b> I do not care about Isco’s boos.

You can never question our winning character; we showed character today, despite the difficulties. Unforgivable would be to lack that.<br /><br />Nothing went right for us today. The sensation is that we wanted to make up three points and we didn’t. This is football, we lost concentration at the start of the game that cost us a goal and hurt us. The same as in Villarreal <b>[2-2 midweek]</b>, in professional football you cannot have that. Then we did everything possible to turn the result around, despite the difficulties, possible penalties, or penalties, and the sending off. We made chances but the ball just would not go in</p>

There are young people, but also others with a lot of experience.<br /><br />There are 24 players and they are all important, and they will continue to be.

I saw <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> last year and how it grew so much. It was a fantastic campaign for the English teams. There are so many different cultures as well - you have Spanish coaches, German coaches, English coaches, coaches from all over the world who have made it grow.<br /><br />The type of football I like is when the team is the protagonist, offensive football, high tempo and aggressive but in order to achieve that you have to defend high, have fast transitions, and of course talent is a big part of that. The statistics in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> are amazing and confirm things are changing. Fifteen years ago there were just three games where one team averaged 70% of possession. Three years ago that went up to 30 games. Two years ago it was 60 games and last year there were 67 games in which one team had 70% of possession<br /><br /><b>[Solari’s compatriot, <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>, has impressed in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> during spells with <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, with his fine work earning plenty of praise]</b> I am not friends with him but I know him and I admire him and what he has done last year and the year before.
