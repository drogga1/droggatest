  <p><b>[Former Juventus star Paolo Montero believes that it would be no surprise to see top coaches like Antonio Conte or Zinedine Zidane take over for 2019-20 should <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Massimiliano Allegri</a> leave his post]</b> Would I be surprised to see Conte or Zidane next season? Not at all. Juventus have reached a very high level and if they change their coaches, they will certainly take a top one. Zizou and Antonio are two winners, they know the environment very well, they are both important names.<br /><br />Is it difficult to follow the same coach for five years? No, I don’t think so. We had Marcello Lippi for a long time and the focus has always been very high, the strength of the club is very big, and Juve are a very powerful club. Every day at Juventus they make you understand the importance of the club, the goals you need to achieve. You cannot go wrong. If you make a mistake, they immediately buy someone else in your place. It’s a matter of mentality<br /><br /><b>[Montero, though, has no doubt that the Old Lady are capable of springing a memorable comeback]</b> Yes, absolutely <b>[Juve can turn it around]</b>. Juventus are a top team. Of course it wil be a very difficult game because Atletico are a very difficult opponent to beat, but <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> is able to prepare his team in the right way. Juve have everything to find a special night. I really like <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a>, he always find the right solutions for these kind of matches</p>
