  <p><b>[Dino Baggio has stoked the fires ahead of Italy’s European Championships quarter final against Spain by claiming that there must be a good reason why the Azzurri have not lost an official game to la Roja for 88 years]</b> Spain have not beaten Italy for 88 years in an official game. There must be a reason for that. Spain always plays well, but Italy wins more. Italy always has faith, always has heart and never gives up. Spain, like they did in 1994, have a great team, with great players and superb technique. I think what Spain lacks is some directness on occasion. But on quality alone, both their teams are incredible.<br /><br /><b>[Reflecting on the game in the United States 14 years ago, Baggio explained that Julio Salinas had one golden chance to finish Italy off, but when he did not take it the Azzurri came back]</b> Obviously I remember that game. Qualifying for the semi finals of the World Cup and scoring a goal is not something you forget. Each time Italy plays Spain I think about that game and my goal. Salinas missed a clear chance, or should I say, <a href="gianluca-pagliuca.html">Pagliuca</a> saved from him. If they had scored that and gone 2-1 ahead it was over, we were finished, but it was not and <a href="roberto-baggio.html">Roberto Baggio</a> scored our winner</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> midfielder Dino Baggio has looked back on his time at the club, recalling the club’s glory days, which, according to him, were lacking just an Italian league title. However, the former Italian international has hinted that underhand dealings could prevent sides like the Ducali from ever triumphing]</b> <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> is the most beautiful place I’ve been in my career - they were wonderful years in which we only were missing the Scudetto. In a place like Italy, it is impossible for a team like <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> to win the Scudetto because there are other things going on. I remember a goal by <b>[Fabio]</b> <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Cannavaro</a> that was called back and nobody knows why it was cancelled.<br /><br /><b>[He then turned his attention to the current <a href="verona-fc.html">Gialloblu</a> outfit, who gained promotion from Serie B this summer]</b> <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> has a great coach who has done well. I don’t know if they will qualify for Europe, but they will certainly avoid relegation well in advance</p>
