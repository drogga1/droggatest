  <p><b>[Messi’s toughest test yet: Mending broken <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> for Liga title fight with Real Madrid]</b> All of us that knew him and played with him are no longer surprised by the wonderful technical ability he has. but by his ability to adapt so quickly to any given situation<br /><br /><b>[The argument goes that while <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> may be great, he is mentally weak. Giribet sees things differently]</b> He doesn’t know what pressure is. There are many talented players who don’t make it because they can’t handle the pressure. My legs were trembling when I played against 1,500 people but <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> plays the same whether he’s in a Champions League final or in his back garden<br /><br /><b>[Messi has always been a team player, an outstanding individual who understands the importance of the collective]</b> He was always a delight with his team-mates and I think he is still the same. He gives so much confidence to the team because he can always make the difference. But he has also already helped me personally to become a better player with his advice on how he sees football. He is really an inspiration<br /><br /><b>[For now, though, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> just need <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> to be <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. They need him to get the best out of a side still struggling to find its identity under new coach Quique Setien]</b> In every stage of his career, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has been able to determine what his best virtue is and adapt it for the collective, to keep on being the best for more than a decade. Because from the youth teams until now, he has always been the best</p>
