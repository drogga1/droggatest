  <p><b>[Jozy Altidore speaks about advice he’d give his 16-year-old self when he started as a professional footballer]</b> To enjoy it more. When you’re young sometimes a lot of things get put your way and you forget it’s a game and you’re supposed to have fun. Sometimes too quickly it became a job and I didn’t know how to balance everything. That’s probably what I would say to a young Jozy</p>

  <p><b>[Jozy Altidore prepares for his 100th cap serving as one of the U.S. team’s most important players]</b> It was probably my worst camp to date in terms of everything that went wrong. It was my first cap. I checked my cleats in my checked bag, lost my checked bag, it never got to South Africa. I got diarrhea, so I had no cleats and had to go to the mall and buy Copas actually, and played my first cap in Copas from the South African mall, and I still got on the field. So much went into it so I’ll never forget it.<br /><br />It definitely does feel like I’ve had 100 caps, but in a good way. Through the ups and downs, whatever it may be, to get here and to be in such good company is a dream come true. I never would have dreamed I’d be joining a legendary group of players. I’m really honored and excited<br /><br />The energy is different, there’s a new coach, everything is starting over. You’re playing for spots again. Whether or not you’ve played for the coach before you have to show why you deserve to be one of his go-to choices. When I come into January camp it’s all about trying to get a head start on the year. It’s all about using these days to get fit, and not only get ready for March, but for the <b>[MLS]</b> season coming up</p>

Looking back at all the games I’ve been able to play, all the great memories I’ve been able to have with so many great players, so many events and so many competitions … to be able to have that all culminate on Sunday and be able to look back on all those games, I’m so proud and really honored to have had the opportunity.</p>

I thought we weren’t really that dangerous going forward. It’s something we’ve got to work on.<br /><br />It was good to see the ball in the second half a little bit, because the first half was a bit quiet. That’s what it is in this formation - you’re lonely a lot at times<br /><br />We’ve got a few days to get at it, but unfortunately it’ll be a little more of the same. It’s just hard. Some of these guys came off of two months not doing anything, so it’s difficult to kind of just pick it up and be in midseason form. Hopefully we’re more dangerous going forward - I think that’s the key. Defensively we did OK, but I thought we were just a bit toothless up there</p>

We have no shortage of options, so we should be able to get the job done.<br /><br />Clint, I’m so happy he’s back personally. It’s really fun playing with him. He scores a lot of goals, he opens up a lot of space for people. He’s just a good player to play with<br /><br /><b>[Arena could also deploy Altidore as a lone forward in some variation of a 4-5-1]</b> I think it’s no secret, for me I’m better with kind of a partner up there. I’m not a huge fan of a 4-3-3. It’s difficult, you need really dynamic guys to be able to play it. We’ll see how it goes<br /><br /><b>[World Cup qualifiers]</b> are different because I think, especially at home, you’re on the front foot a little bit more. Obviously when you play away the conditions are different, but playing at home I’m sure we’ll be on the front foot more, and we’ll have more of the ball. It’s on us to try and take the game to them, and create holes and create gaps and try to score some goals</p>

He has a good smell for the game and where to be, spots to pop up in. He’s good at running with the ball, so he’s different. He’s dynamic and I think that’s important when you’re playing with attacking midfielders or second strikers. They have to be very dynamic and be able to switch it up, and I think he’s able to do that in a lot of ways.</p>

  <p><b>[USA focused only on beating Trinidad &amp; Tobago]</b> I think it’s definitely one of the better national teams we’ve had in recent years. You have a lot of guys playing at a high level, playing at a good level and playing well. It makes everything that much better. You feel confident as players coming off the bench knowing that the guy ahead of you is doing well and vice versa. I think that’s important for building a team that’s built to last and built to go deep in tournaments. You need that.<br /><br />When you look at our team, I think Bruce, if there’s one thing he’s good at it’s putting teams together. I think it’ll be tough for a lot of guys to play Thursday and then play Sunday, so I think everybody has to be ready<br /><br />When you’re young you probably look at the more attractive game, and <b>[USA-Mexico]</b> obviously maybe to some people the more attractive game. But in a lot of ways the Trinidad game is very important, and attractive in its own way</p>

  <p><b>[On Clint Dempsey]</b> That’s not an easy thing to do. To score at a consistent level over a number of years is never easy. I think he’s just a guy who pops up in good spots. He’s not a No. 9, but he’s got that mentality of a nine, of knowing where the ball is going to pop up. I think that’s what has made him successful over the years. Because you can’t always score the golazos. He’s able to score those grimy goals and that’s why he’s so important to us and I think that’s why he’s done it for such a long time.</p>

The challenge for him, for us, for everybody is to keep pushing him.

I was telling guys on the bench it was unbelievable. His bald head was everywhere. He was all over the field. It’s crazy because you come to expect that, fair or not. You come to expect that flawless performance, and it was another one for the books for him. A game where he covered so much ground, got the team out of trouble. It’s Michael Bradley, it’s what we’ve all come to expect, one of the best players in the history of our program, and this league<br /><br />When he first told me about Toronto, I’ll never forget it. We were in <b>[Jacksonville]</b> playing against Nigeria, and we were getting ready for that game and he said, ‘You should come to Toronto.’ It started off as a joke, but I started to think about it and we talked all the time about it. For me, it was about coming here and making sure we won this thing. Because I know all the pressure, whatever, that was put on him when he first came here. I wanted to come here and take that a little bit away from him, and help him win here. So to be here, and be able to win with him, in the fashion which we did, is great<br /><br />I had Portland, Toronto and New York Red Bulls. Obviously I was close with Mike, but New York was my home, right? That was obviously something that looked good for my family, but the people <b>[at the Red Bulls]</b>, I forget who was in charge, said they wanted to go in a different direction. The decision was easy at that point. I couldn’t go home, so I had to go somewhere there was a new challenge. I didn’t know what to expect, but I came here and from day one these people embraced me with open arms. It was unbelievable and it just made me want to give that much more for the city and for the team.</p>

  <p><b>[MLS Cup crown caps Toronto FC’s transformation from joke to juggernaut]</b> The way <b>[the fans]</b> celebrate our goals, it’s like they’re living and dying with us. I know it’s like that with a lot of fan bases, but these people have suffered for a long time. They’ve had to come watch games where their team is getting dominated, and people who really didn’t care about the city, about what’s being built here, would have left the team.</p>

  <p><b>[Jozy Altidore concedes Liga MX is still a bit better than MLS]</b> I think the Mexican league probably still is better in terms of the quality they’re able to attract from top to bottom. The inferior teams so to speak in Mexico are able to spend a little more and spread it out and get some more quality players. Our league is doing a good job of trying to counter that. We have a salary cap so it’s different. But I think looking at both leagues with us having a salary cap, we have to be happy with where we are and where we’re trying to go. I think the possibilities are great for MLS, and I think if anybody’s future is brighter so to speak, you can’t knock what’s going on in MLS right now.</p>

  <p><b>[Altidore admits he was warned Sunderland transfer would be a ‘disaster’]</b> It didn’t feel right. The timing was not right. Sunderland was not the best club I had spoken to, I had also spoken to other major clubs. But Sunderland was concrete.<br /><br />I remember very well that Gertjan Verbeek and Earnest Stewart said that I had better wait for other offers, because Sunderland did not play my type of football. They were very honest about that, saying it would be a disaster if I went to Sunderland despite the transfer fee being so big.<br /><br />But my father really wanted me to go to England because the contract was good there. What if I suffered an injury at <a href="az-alkmaar.html">AZ</a>? Then I might not have been able to get that contract anymore. So it was a difficult, emotional decision. I went to Sunderland.<br /><br />My agents and my father thought about finances. With the contract at Sunderland, I was able to secure my future, guaranteed. I was a young man. If I had had the knowledge that I have today, I would have made a different choice<br /><br /><b>[Still, he does have some desire to go back to Europe, but he isn’t looking to make any sort of moves unless its to join the perfect club]</b> Only in the right situation. I’m fine here now. When I go back to Europe, I want to go to a place like the Netherlands, a place where I know there are good players around and people have the same idea about football. And if not? Then I’ll stay here.<br /><br />But I love the Eredivisie. I was close to returning once. I was in contact with Feyenoord when <a href="jaap-stam.html">Jaap Stam</a> was a coach there, but it did not become concrete. I would love to play at a club like Feyenoord, <a href="az-alkmaar.html">AZ</a> or <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> again. That would be great.</p>
