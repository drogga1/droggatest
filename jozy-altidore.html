  <p><b>[Jozy Altidore speaks about advice he’d give his 16-year-old self when he started as a professional footballer]</b> To enjoy it more. When you’re young sometimes a lot of things get put your way and you forget it’s a game and you’re supposed to have fun. Sometimes too quickly it became a job and I didn’t know how to balance everything. That’s probably what I would say to a young Jozy</p>

  <p><b>[Jozy Altidore prepares for his 100th cap serving as one of the U.S. team’s most important players]</b> It was probably my worst camp to date in terms of everything that went wrong. It was my first cap. I checked my cleats in my checked bag, lost my checked bag, it never got to South Africa. I got diarrhea, so I had no cleats and had to go to the mall and buy Copas actually, and played my first cap in Copas from the South African mall, and I still got on the field. So much went into it so I’ll never forget it.<br /><br />It definitely does feel like I’ve had 100 caps, but in a good way. Through the ups and downs, whatever it may be, to get here and to be in such good company is a dream come true. I never would have dreamed I’d be joining a legendary group of players. I’m really honored and excited<br /><br />The energy is different, there’s a new coach, everything is starting over. You’re playing for spots again. Whether or not you’ve played for the coach before you have to show why you deserve to be one of his go-to choices. When I come into January camp it’s all about trying to get a head start on the year. It’s all about using these days to get fit, and not only get ready for March, but for the <b>[MLS]</b> season coming up</p>

  <p><b>[With his start in a friendly against Serbia on Sunday, Jozy Altidore became the second youngest U.S. player to reach 100 caps]</b> It’s a huge honor to get such a milestone after having this as my dream as a little kid, wanting to play on the biggest stages and represent my country. Looking back at all the games I’ve been able to play, all the great memories I’ve been able to have with so many great players, so many events and so many competitions … to be able to have that all culminate on Sunday and be able to look back on all those games, I’m so proud and really honored to have had the opportunity.</p>

  <p><b>[On Darlington Nagbe]</b> It’s no secret. I think we all know how talented he is. It’s all about just getting better, and I think he has everything about him. I thought he showed that tonight. A bit unlucky sometimes with the final ball, or final finish, but I thought he was bright. I thought he was really good.<br /><br /><b>[on Sebastian Lletget]</b> He looked good. I thought he came on and was bright. He likes to get on the ball, he’s good going forward. I thought he was a really good two-way player and I thought he didn’t look out of his depth at all. Hopefully he continues to do well. He’s a guy obviously that we all hope can continue to improve</p>

  <p><b>[On Sunday’s draw with Serbia]</b> It’s tough man, it’s a January camp. It’s difficult, it was a difficult game. They did well defending. I thought we weren’t really that dangerous going forward. It’s something we’ve got to work on.<br /><br />It was good to see the ball in the second half a little bit, because the first half was a bit quiet. That’s what it is in this formation - you’re lonely a lot at times<br /><br />We’ve got a few days to get at it, but unfortunately it’ll be a little more of the same. It’s just hard. Some of these guys came off of two months not doing anything, so it’s difficult to kind of just pick it up and be in midseason form. Hopefully we’re more dangerous going forward - I think that’s the key. Defensively we did OK, but I thought we were just a bit toothless up there</p>

  <p><b>[Jozy Altidore talks about rising star <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a>]</b> Christian’s got the sauce man. Everything’s special about him. I think in any country he’s someone people are excited about. He’s fit. He’s fearless. I think he has all the makings to be a special player. The challenge for him, for us, for everybody is to keep pushing him. It’s easy when everyone’s telling you how great you are, but you have to make sure he knows there’s a long way to go, but I think he knows that. He comes across as a really bright kid, comes from a good family. I’m not worried. I think he has enough good people around him, and I think he has a federation too and a lot of guys who have that trial and error and have been through it, and know how to approach him, and I think hopefully he does great</p>

We’ve been friends for a long time and to see her progress as she has it’s a great sight to see</p>

  <p><b>[Jozy Altidore concedes Liga MX is still a bit better than MLS]</b> I think the Mexican league probably still is better in terms of the quality they’re able to attract from top to bottom. The inferior teams so to speak in Mexico are able to spend a little more and spread it out and get some more quality players. Our league is doing a good job of trying to counter that. We have a salary cap so it’s different. But I think looking at both leagues with us having a salary cap, we have to be happy with where we are and where we’re trying to go. I think the possibilities are great for MLS, and I think if anybody’s future is brighter so to speak, you can’t knock what’s going on in MLS right now.</p>

  <p><b>[Altidore admits he was warned Sunderland transfer would be a ‘disaster’]</b> It didn’t feel right. The timing was not right. Sunderland was not the best club I had spoken to, I had also spoken to other major clubs. But Sunderland was concrete.<br /><br />I remember very well that Gertjan Verbeek and Earnest Stewart said that I had better wait for other offers, because Sunderland did not play my type of football. They were very honest about that, saying it would be a disaster if I went to Sunderland despite the transfer fee being so big.<br /><br />But my father really wanted me to go to England because the contract was good there. What if I suffered an injury at <a href="az-alkmaar.html">AZ</a>? Then I might not have been able to get that contract anymore. So it was a difficult, emotional decision. I went to Sunderland.<br /><br />My agents and my father thought about finances. With the contract at Sunderland, I was able to secure my future, guaranteed. I was a young man. If I had had the knowledge that I have today, I would have made a different choice<br /><br /><b>[Still, he does have some desire to go back to Europe, but he isn’t looking to make any sort of moves unless its to join the perfect club]</b> Only in the right situation. I’m fine here now. When I go back to Europe, I want to go to a place like the Netherlands, a place where I know there are good players around and people have the same idea about football. And if not? Then I’ll stay here.<br /><br />But I love the Eredivisie. I was close to returning once. I was in contact with Feyenoord when <a href="jaap-stam.html">Jaap Stam</a> was a coach there, but it did not become concrete. I would love to play at a club like Feyenoord, <a href="az-alkmaar.html">AZ</a> or <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> again. That would be great.</p>

  <p><b>[Altidore wonders if aliens exist after government publish UFO videos]</b> That’s crazy. I don’t think people are paying close attention. The U.S. government has just dropped this news on us and no one has noticed. That shows how crazy these times are. They just indicated that they see UFOs flying around, and because of the coronavirus nobody is interested. So I had to tweet that just so people would see<br /><br />I don’t know what to think, but those videos seem to confirm that there is something. Otherwise, all those fighter pilots wouldn’t have made those videos. It’s really, very clear, otherwise those images wouldn’t be there<br /><br /><b>[Along with his girlfriend, tennis star Sloane Stephens, he is watching the true-crime documentary about a murderer and cat killer on Netflix]</b> We can do a little Netflix and chill, that’s all we can do. Sloane and I will keep watching the documentary Don’t F<em>*k With Cats. That’s really creepy sh</em>t, man</p>
