  <p><b>[Jozy Altidore speaks about advice he’d give his 16-year-old self when he started as a professional footballer]</b> To enjoy it more. When you’re young sometimes a lot of things get put your way and you forget it’s a game and you’re supposed to have fun. Sometimes too quickly it became a job and I didn’t know how to balance everything. That’s probably what I would say to a young Jozy</p>

  <p><b>[Jozy Altidore talks about rising star <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a>]</b> Christian’s got the sauce man. Everything’s special about him. I think in any country he’s someone people are excited about. He’s fit. He’s fearless. I think he has all the makings to be a special player. The challenge for him, for us, for everybody is to keep pushing him. It’s easy when everyone’s telling you how great you are, but you have to make sure he knows there’s a long way to go, but I think he knows that. He comes across as a really bright kid, comes from a good family. I’m not worried. I think he has enough good people around him, and I think he has a federation too and a lot of guys who have that trial and error and have been through it, and know how to approach him, and I think hopefully he does great</p>

I’m thrilled, I’m thrilled for her. She’s worked really hard to get back to where she is right now. I couldn’t be happier. My mom. My mom told me in the stands. It’s good for her. We’ve been friends for a long time and to see her progress as she has it’s a great sight to see</p>

No problem…. I’ve been here a long time now. The coaches know me, they know I will play with whatever. As a player, when you come across certain moments in your career, you want to give back everything. The club has given me everything. If I can run, if I can be out there, I want to help</p>

  <p><b>[Jozy Altidore states his injured quad is healing, but it is still unclear whether he will be ready to take on the Sounders at CenturyLink Field]</b> I haven’t played any soccer in a month, so that’s where I’m at. I’m trying to jog, I’m trying to change pace, I’m trying to do those types of things. But like I said, I have to let the muscle heal first or else you put yourself at risk. I’m not tell you no false truths or nothing like that, I’m actually being very candid. That’s where I am. I’m not happy about it, but it is what it is<br /><br /><b>[Seattle coach <a href="brian-schmetzer.html">Brian Schmetzer</a> and even Toronto FC manager <a href="greg-vanney.html">Greg Vanney</a> have told the media in recent days that they expect the American forward to play in some capacity]</b> I don’t know.

I’m trying my very best, I’m doing everything I can, and we’re all hoping, I’m hoping, to obviously play some sort of part in the game</p>

  <p><b>[Altidore admits he was warned Sunderland transfer would be a ‘disaster’]</b> It didn’t feel right. The timing was not right. Sunderland was not the best club I had spoken to, I had also spoken to other major clubs. But Sunderland was concrete.<br /><br />I remember very well that Gertjan Verbeek and Earnest Stewart said that I had better wait for other offers, because Sunderland did not play my type of football. They were very honest about that, saying it would be a disaster if I went to Sunderland despite the transfer fee being so big.<br /><br />But my father really wanted me to go to England because the contract was good there. What if I suffered an injury at AZ? Then I might not have been able to get that contract anymore. So it was a difficult, emotional decision. I went to Sunderland.<br /><br />My agents and my father thought about finances. With the contract at Sunderland, I was able to secure my future, guaranteed. I was a young man. If I had had the knowledge that I have today, I would have made a different choice<br /><br /><b>[Still, he does have some desire to go back to Europe, but he isn’t looking to make any sort of moves unless its to join the perfect club]</b> Only in the right situation. I’m fine here now. When I go back to Europe, I want to go to a place like the Netherlands, a place where I know there are good players around and people have the same idea about football. And if not? Then I’ll stay here.<br /><br />But I love the Eredivisie. I was close to returning once. I was in contact with Feyenoord when <a href="jaap-stam.html">Jaap Stam</a> was a coach there, but it did not become concrete. I would love to play at a club like Feyenoord, AZ or <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> again. That would be great.</p>

  <p><b>[Altidore wonders if aliens exist after government publish UFO videos]</b> That’s crazy. I don’t think people are paying close attention. The U.S. government has just dropped this news on us and no one has noticed. That shows how crazy these times are. They just indicated that they see UFOs flying around, and because of the coronavirus nobody is interested. So I had to tweet that just so people would see<br /><br />I don’t know what to think, but those videos seem to confirm that there is something. Otherwise, all those fighter pilots wouldn’t have made those videos. It’s really, very clear, otherwise those images wouldn’t be there<br /><br /><b>[Along with his girlfriend, tennis star Sloane Stephens, he is watching the true-crime documentary about a murderer and cat killer on Netflix]</b> We can do a little Netflix and chill, that’s all we can do. Sloane and I will keep watching the documentary Don’t F<em>*k With Cats. That’s really creepy sh</em>t, man</p>
