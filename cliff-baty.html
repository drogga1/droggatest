  <p><b>[Manchester United have confirmed they will lose £21 million on sponsorship revenue alone should they lose the Europa League final]</b> It’s a 30% reduction in the following year’s payments. So receipt of sponsorship next year from Adidas would be £70m if we’re in the Champions League, so that would be 30% of that, so £21m reduction. The important thing to remember about that is it’s spread out over the remaining life of the contract.<br /><br />Clearly the Champions League has greater revenues, but we have designed an offset within salary costs and our bonus structure which attempts to damage the impact between being in the Champions League and being in the Europa League.<br /><br />In the Champions League we’d expect to get about £40m-£50m revenues whereas the Europa League is normally around £15m-£20m revenues. This year we have benefitted from the performance of other English teams in the Europa League. We qualified by winning the FA Cup, and because only ourselves and Southampton went through into that first round we got a bigger share of the market pool, and also the performance of Southampton and Tottenham later on in the competition meant that we picked up a bigger share of that market pool and will do throughout the knockout stages</p>

  <p><b>[Record total revenue of £581.2 million and an 18.3 per cent drop in net debt to £213.1m]</b> We do not share in the market pool distributed to the four teams in England who qualified according to their league positions. If you finish top you get 40%, finishing fourth you get 10%. For example if you finish third you get 20%, and roughly that would work out at about £10m<br /><br />So in terms of looking at what we’ll make from the Champions League this year clearly it is performance dependent, but we’ve always said it’s between £40m and £50m so it will be roughly £10m less than that because we miss out on that pool</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Manchester United’s commercial might]</b> A new coefficient-based prize pool will be created, which allocations therefore a larger share of prize money towards historic performance rather than just the geographical broadcasting contributions. The coefficients pool is calculated on each individual club’s performance in the Champions League and Europa League over the preceding 10-year period with also further recognition for historic European trophy wins. It is shared between the 32 competing clubs based on their coefficient ranking order, so the club with the highest coefficient will received 32 times more than the club at the bottom of the coefficient. I think of it similarly to the Premier League merit payments in terms of finishing positions. Currently we sit fifth in the coefficient table, and we are the leading English club at the moment. Overall, we will need to wait until UEFA announce what the actual prize fund will be to determine the impact for us.</p>
