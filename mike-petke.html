  <p>[On Nick Rimando] He’s the best goalkeeper in the history of the league. Playing with him in D.C. and winning a championship and seeing those special qualities - he has singlehandedly embraced and took that position and become the best goalkeeper in our league’s history. I am extremely ecstatic to have him back. When you take his veteran leadership and his experience, for me it’s vital.</p>

  <p>[Mike Petke offers apology to fans and owner after ‘embarrassing’ RSL defeat] I apologize to my owner, a lot of places in the world I’d either be fired right now or I would resign. It’s embarrassing, and it starts from the top. [I] apologize to the fans who came out here for this. At the end of the day it’s my job to get the team ready to play and put the effort in. That’s my job description, and [I] did not fulfill that today.<br /><br />It was an anomaly. It was not representative of who I am as a person, as a coach. It’s not representative of who this organization is, it’s not representative of who these player are. So, I apologize</p>

  <p>[Mike Petke was fired as New York Red Bulls coach in surprising fashion] There’s not hard feelings at all. It’s going to be nice to see the couple of guys I was associated with. There’s nothing special about this game. It’s an opportunity for us, and I know an opportunity for them. There’s no significance to this because it’s New York. Perhaps if I was coming back to play in Red Bull Arena there’d be a heck of a lot more significance to me.</p>

  <p>[With or without David Villa, NYCFC looks like an MLS powerhouse] We played against a superior team. At their home. A team that Patrick [Vieira] built up phenomenally in three years. He’s got a player in every position that’s technically gifted. [in the] 89th minute - I don’t know if it was Moralez, I think it was Moralez - 89th minute winning 4-0 and him sprinting 60 yards back, [putting] the work in. A team with the great mentality. A team that he built up that is technically superior at every position [to] most teams. For us, the name of the game is the collective unit. We know we have individual talent in the team, but the way we want to play, if one person isn’t willing to work for the group it all goes upside down. It’s forced us to really stick to our gameplan, and we’re playing really good football as a group.</p>
