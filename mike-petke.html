  <p><b>[Real Salt Lake tabs Mike Petke as coach]</b> I am honored to be charged with delivering pride and excellence to the passionate RSL fan base. I arrived in December thinking this was the right fit and the right opportunity; the vision and blueprint provided by Mr. Hansen permeates from the first team to the Monarchs and through to our academy and our <b>[training]</b> facilities that open this fall</p>

  <p><b>[Mike Petke’s dream start]</b> The most important thing that we saw tonight was that, in one week, listening to the certain little tweaks that we want to make, they took it and implemented it and tried to implement it. <b>[The]</b> second half was all about grit and heart and just desire. Soccer goes out the window. There was no way to play in that second half, but they got the goals in the second half. It’s amazing.<br /><br />My toes are frost-bitten, and I had to have my pants tumble-dried at halftime. Those are the things I’m going to remember. Oh, and the 3-0 win. I’ll remember that too.</p>

  <p><b>[Real Salt Lake coach Mike Petke agreed, adding he believes the environment fostered a tougher, mentally resilient player]</b> You can tell the competition that I’m sure Brooks Lennon’s been through to get on that field and to be a part of that definitely molded him and made him a bit icier and a bit more competitive. I can speak from our academy’s standpoint. I’ve been there, observing them and I know the coaches there and the players and they do a fantastic job. But going over to Liverpool obviously takes it up a notch<br /><br />He needs to take every day as an opportunity to learn and improve. He can’t sit back at 20 years old and say, ‘I’ve been at Liverpool, I’m going to the U-20 World Cup, I’m here, I’ve arrived.’ He has to constantly be the best player in practice. It’s the same thing I talk to with guys like Bofo <b>[Saucedo]</b>, Danny Acosta and Justen Glad about. They have long careers ahead of them if they continue to do the right things. But that’s the big ‘if.’</p>

  <p><b>[Real Salt Lake has announced it has signed center back Marcelo Silva from Real Zaragoza]</b> He is someone who we have researched extensively and hold a very high opinion on as a player as well as a person. His talent, experience and professionalism will be a huge benefit in the locker room and on the field.</p>

  <p><b>[Saturday’s 2-0 win against Seattle not only snapped the Sounders’ 13-match unbeaten streak]</b> I don’t think tonight was the perfect game for us, or close to the perfect game. I could think off the top of my head five other games this year, some obviously that we haven’t won, that I thought we played better.<br /><br />But the one thing you that I think that you see from this team is the mentality shift over the last couple of months that, perhaps when I first took over, or before I took over, this is a game we would have lost. But the mentality has shifted dramatically, and that’s all on the players<br /><br /><b>[On Justen Glad]</b> I’ve said it before, Justin plays beyond his years. There’s so many intangibles that I could talk about with Justin - about his touch on the ball, his pace or his athleticism - but he reads the game far, far better than any player at his age, I think, in this league<br /><br />We’re a very dangerous team at home. Altitude always plays a factor with every team, so what we don’t want is for teams to come in and come at us the first 20 minutes because they know they’re going to tire out. We want to put it at them</p>

  <p><b>[Petke was familiar with Albert Rusnak upon taking the job]</b> The thing that struck me with Albert was his phenomenal attitude, an incredible ability with the ball and his vision as a setup man.<br /><br />I’ll be honest with you, one of the biggest things that maybe goes unnoticed is his defensive ability. I can remember off the top of my head 10-12 times since I took over that the ball’s turned over and he’s doing a 60-yard sprint back and slowing up the play. That’s very unselfish and also very uncharacteristic of No. 10s in this league<br /><br />I’m looking forward to preseason with Albert so I could really have six to eight weeks and have that time without the strain of a game every seven days that we have to focus on to really hammer out those little things,</p>

  <p><b>[Real Salt Lake has signed coach Mike Petke to an extension through 2020]</b> Loyalty is huge for me. I am ecstatic about <b>[owner Dell Loy]</b> Hansen coming to me and offering me this contract. I’m ecstatic at the prospect of being here at least three more years. And I’m excited and ecstatic about what I think we can accomplish together - Mr. Hansen, <b>[general manager]</b> Craig Waibel, myself, the players … the whole organization. I’m on cloud nine because I have an owner who values me, likes what I’m doing and wants to reward me for that.</p>

  <p><b>[On Nick Rimando]</b> He’s the best goalkeeper in the history of the league. Playing with him in D.C. and winning a championship and seeing those special qualities - he has singlehandedly embraced and took that position and become the best goalkeeper in our league’s history. I am extremely ecstatic to have him back. When you take his veteran leadership and his experience, for me it’s vital.</p>

  <p><b>[Mike Petke offers apology to fans and owner after ‘embarrassing’ RSL defeat]</b> I apologize to my owner, a lot of places in the world I’d either be fired right now or I would resign. It’s embarrassing, and it starts from the top. <b>[I]</b> apologize to the fans who came out here for this. At the end of the day it’s my job to get the team ready to play and put the effort in. That’s my job description, and <b>[I]</b> did not fulfill that today.<br /><br />It was an anomaly. It was not representative of who I am as a person, as a coach. It’s not representative of who this organization is, it’s not representative of who these player are. So, I apologize</p>

  <p><b>[Mike Petke was fired as New York Red Bulls coach in surprising fashion]</b> There’s not hard feelings at all. It’s going to be nice to see the couple of guys I was associated with. There’s nothing special about this game. It’s an opportunity for us, and I know an opportunity for them. There’s no significance to this because it’s New York. Perhaps if I was coming back to play in Red Bull Arena there’d be a heck of a lot more significance to me.</p>

  <p><b>[With or without David Villa, NYCFC looks like an MLS powerhouse]</b> We played against a superior team. At their home. A team that Patrick <b>[Vieira]</b> built up phenomenally in three years. He’s got a player in every position that’s technically gifted. <b>[in the]</b> 89th minute - I don’t know if it was Moralez, I think it was Moralez - 89th minute winning 4-0 and him sprinting 60 yards back, <b>[putting]</b> the work in. A team with the great mentality. A team that he built up that is technically superior at every position <b>[to]</b> most teams. For us, the name of the game is the collective unit. We know we have individual talent in the team, but the way we want to play, if one person isn’t willing to work for the group it all goes upside down. It’s forced us to really stick to our gameplan, and we’re playing really good football as a group.</p>

  <p><b>[Real Salt Lake sack head coach Mike Petke following suspension for abusing referee. RSL have replaced Petke with assistant Freddy Juarez]</b> …the steepest sanctions ever imposed on an <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> coach. After further deliberations and a series of constructive discussions internally and with various members of our community, we have concluded, pursuant to his employment agreement, to immediately terminate Mike Petke’s employment<br /><br />At Real Salt Lake, we have the privilege to represent our great community and fans here locally and on a national and global basis. We hold all of our coaches, players, executives and staff to the highest standards of professionalism. As an organisation, it is vital that everyone, particularly our leadership, reflects and embodies our core values and the values of our community, treating all people with respect, civility and professionalism. Moreover, throughout our 15-year history, we have championed diversity, acceptance and inclusion throughout our organisation, our stadiums and our community. This is a responsibility that we take very seriously</p>
