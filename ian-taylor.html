  <p><b>[Former <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> midfielder Ian Taylor on <a href="gary-speed.html">Gary Speed</a>’s death]</b> Locked horns with <a href="gary-speed.html">Gary Speed</a> on many occasions and was a complete gentleman on and off the pitch. Can’t get my head round him being gone</p>

  <p><b>[Ian Taylor says <a href="john-mcginn.html">John McGinn</a> would be worth every penny to those said to be considering big-money bids]</b> I think the likes of <a href="john-mcginn.html">John McGinn</a> can go all the way and play at the very highest level. The thing is, he did sign a new contract not so long ago. It’ll cost a lot to prise him away from our football club. I don’t know whether that price tag will scare people off or not. He’s made big, big strides since he came last year. It’ll be a massive price hike if someone does put the money down to buy him but I think he’d be worth every penny<br /><br /><b>[Another recent recruit that Villa have found considerable value in is commanding centre-half <a href="tyrone-mings.html">Tyrone Mings</a>]</b> Teams will have to pay through the nose to get <a href="tyrone-mings.html">Tyrone Mings</a> away. There were a lot of questions asked not just about him getting in the England squad but the price tag Villa paid for him in the first place. At the end of the day, Tyrone wasn’t getting in the <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> team, he didn’t look like he was wanted there. Yet we paid £20 million odd for him, which looks an absolute snip now</p>
