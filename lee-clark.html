  <p><b>[Former Sunderland midfielder Lee Clark was particularly critical both of the wonderkid striker Josh Maja’s decision to move and the club’s decision to cash in now, rather than wait for the season’s end]</b> There’s nothing good that comes of it. The player is playing first-team football, he’s scoring regularly, they’ve got a great chance of getting promoted to the Championship, which would mean the feel-good factor would keep on going. They could have full houses.<br /><br />Players in the French league are wanting to come to England. I know they’re playing outside of the top league at the moment, but they’re one of the biggest clubs outside of that. There’s no sense to this deal. He’s going to Bordeaux, not even one of the biggest clubs in France. If he was going to <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, or he was an older player going to have a good time on the French Riviera and play for Monaco, but he’s going to Bordeaux<br /><br /><b>[Clark also expressed some concerns that the move would also represent a step back in the youngster’s development]</b> And he’s not even going to play. He’s going to be back to reserve-team football after playing all season as a first-choice striker at a huge club that has got unbelievable support. It’s an amazing deal, it’s just crazy for me.</p>

  <p><b>[Lee Clark says <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> could be the elite addition to get a transfer ball rolling at Newcastle]</b> The elite footballers want to be playing in the top competitions and <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> aren’t in the position at the moment to offer players Champions League football. So you might have to go for a certain level of player to get to the next level. Then when you get into the Champions League you can start pushing for the elite players. When you are a player at the top clubs all of them can offer the same financial packages. But elite players want to be playing in Europe all the time. You might get one or two exceptions who will come earlier than expected and want to be part of the <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> project and if they buy into it, other players will see that and it might attract them. I think <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a>, he’s from Britain and he knows <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> very well, he’d be the superstar name and financially <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> could match anything he’s looking for close to his Madrid financial package. He could be the one that would buy into a project like taking <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> from where they are to the elite of European football again. And he won’t be found wanting for golf courses, and there will be lots of people willing to play with him as well</p>
