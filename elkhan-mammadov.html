<blockquote>
  <p><b>[The Azerbaijan FA have now issued a response to Klopp’s comments, with general secretary Elkhan Mammadov saying he was ‘unpleasantly surprised’ by what the German had to say]</b> I was unpleasantly surprised by the remarks of Jürgen Klopp. He always gave an impression of a very positive person. Moreover, we all know that he is a great specialist who has achieved really outstanding results in football. But with all this, I strongly disagree with his opinion that football should be geographically limited.<br /><br />We must respect and promote the values of football. And one of our main values is the expansion of the boundaries of football and its globalisation. Europe has long gone beyond the borders of the countries of the western part of this continent. And I am convinced that holding European Championship matches and European Cup finals in Eastern Europe opens up new opportunities for developing football in these countries, serves to make it more popular among the younger generation, attracts young people to football.<br /><br />The same can be said about the organization of the Champions League final in Kiev or 10 years ago in Istanbul. I agree that getting to Baku by bus from London will be difficult, but <b>[since]</b> when was the distance a barrier for real fans? I want to remind you that three cities participated in the tender for the final: Seville, Istanbul and Baku. No one limited the ability of other countries to participate. I am sure that there will be a real football holiday in Baku. And I am also confident that the same will happen in Madrid</p>
