  <p><b>[Fernando Redondo singled Thiago Almada out as one of the Superliga prospects most likely to make it in Spain]</b> There are players in the Argentine league like Thiago Almada, Cristian Pavon and Leonel Miranda who could make <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> because they have the talent and temperament</p>

  <p><b>[Real legend hails <a href="vicente-del-bosque.html">Vicente Del Bosque</a> as a huge personal influence]</b> I had some great coaches during my playing career. They all leave you with something. But <a href="vicente-del-bosque.html">Vicente Del Bosque</a> was special. Football-speaking he understood my potential and gave me the freedom to move around midfield. And also, for his way of being. He was a man of integrity, in every way. It was a great experience and gave me so much both professionally and personally<br /><br />I had the great good fortune to play with many great players. It would be unfair to pick just one, but from my time in Madrid, when we achieved so much, I have to mention <a href="fernando-hierro.html">Fernando Hierro</a>, <a href="raul-gonzalez.html">Raul Gonzalez</a>, <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a>, for example. The list is very long.<br /><br /><b>[played in 10 <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> Clasicos during his career and says now that his greatest opponents during those years were <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s Brazilian players]</b> I played against many great players. But to name one I would say <a href="rivaldo.html">Rivaldo</a>, <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a>, <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> <b>[Nazario]</b> when he played for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. They were all unbelievable.<br /><br /><b>[Real Madrid’s stadium is the best in the world]</b> Without any doubt the Bernabeu is special, even putting aside my passion and love for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. It is a fantastic stadium, to play football, and to watch it. The atmosphere is special, you can just feel it<br /><br /><b>[A scorer of 12 goals in 240 <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> games in total, Redondo picked his favourite strikes over his career as a fantastic 30-yard strike for Tenerife at Athletic Club in 1992, and when he dribbled past four Paraguay defenders for his only senior international goal the following year]</b> I never scored many goals, but I remember one in Bilbao, at San Mames, when I played for Tenerife. And then with the Argentina national team, in the World Cup qualifiers against Paraguay<br /><br /><b>[Now a <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> Ambassador in his home country of Argentina, Redondo says football still brings together his family, on both sides of the Atlantic]</b> I was always a fan of Club Independiente of Buenos Aires, as was my grandfather, my father, and now my sons also follow them, as well as <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. But I have a Madridista heart. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> have a very competitive spirit and always demand the absolute maximum … in the end, they are always successful</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Redondo says <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a> retiring at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> is the logical outcome to his career]</b> Sergio has a lot of football ahead of him. He is physically gifted and he has professionalism too. He’ll be the one who decides when to end his career. Logically, he has to be at Madrid and he has to remain linked to the club for everything he represents<br /><br /><b>[Redondo offered words of support for head coach <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>]</b> It’s notable how <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> has returned and shown his growth as a manager. Anyone who was at Madrid, who wore the jersey, we know about the criticism and the demands that you are subjected to.<br /><br /><b>[Redondo discusses the emergence of <a href="fede-valverde.html">Federico Valverde</a> and the continued progress of <a href="casemiro.html">Casemiro</a>]</b> Really important for the team. He’s really young, he is really dynamic and in this short time, he has shown his personality. <a href="casemiro.html">Casemiro</a> is young and he is physically powerful<br /><br /><b>[Asked if Madrid should consider signing another midfielder to help <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> rotate <a href="casemiro.html">Casemiro</a>]</b> In my case, the more I played, the better I felt. It’s something for the manager to consider and evaluate with the calendar and the scheduling of the competitions along with how the player is feeling</p>
