  <p><b>[On Patrick Vieira]</b> I think he’s a great manager, he does a great job with our team. Managing the team, making sure everyone’s happy. He’s very approachable too. If you have any sort of questions, he likes when people go to him to inquire about game play or our style. It’s important to have a good relationship with the manager and I think all the guys on our team have that with him.</p>

  <p><b>[NYCFC’s Jack Harrison flying after England U-21 call]</b> I didn’t believe him at first but it was a great moment, I was really surprised. He said, ‘I’m not really supposed to tell you now, I’m supposed to tell you after the game, but you’ve been selected for the U-21s. I tried not to let it throw me off too much in the game that day, but obviously it was very exciting.<br /><br />I actually surprised myself. After about one or two training sessions I realized that I settled in much quicker than what I thought I would. I thought I might struggle there, and be behind the guys, but I surprised myself. It was really encouraging to realize that because they’re a great team, they won the U-20 World Cup last summer, they’ve been together for a while and those guys are really tight. For me to go there and settle in very quickly was very encouraging for myself.<br /><br />It was a great experience. I definitely learned a lot from being there and I’m grateful for that opportunity. It was nice to be back around the guys, and the banter. They were asking a lot of questions about MLS, they seem really intrigued, which I was surprised by<br /><br />We’ll have to wait and see, because of the playoffs and everything. I spoke to Aidy and he said he thought I did really well and proved that I belong there, which was really encouraging to hear</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City has signed Jack Harrison from sister club New York City FC and immediately loaned the winger to Middlesbrough]</b> I can’t wait to get started over here. I’ve really enjoyed my time with New York City and I’d like to thank Patrick Vieira and his coaching staff for helping me to develop as a player. I feel I’ve really improved working under him and playing regularly in the MLS, but now I’m looking forward to testing myself in England.</p>
