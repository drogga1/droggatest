  <p><b>[Johan Kamal Hamidon on <a href="luqman-hakim.html">Luqman Hakim</a>]</b> <a href="luqman-hakim.html">Luqman Hakim</a> has signed a contract with us and is officially a Selangor player. He can play for us in the league as he is our player. For now he’ll only be playing for Selangor II. But if the coaches think he’s ready for the first team <b>[in the Super League]</b>, why not? Hopefully this will happen sooner rather than later<br /><br /><b>[In December last year, a photo of the 18-year old vacationing on a Phuket beach in Thailand with two young women as well as Malaysia and JDT young star Akhyar Rashid surfaced on social media, drawing the fans’ concern that he is no longer working hard to fulfil his potential]</b> We’re fully aware of what has happened and we’ve spoken to him about it. He’s not proud and he understands that these are the things that can affect his future as a professional.<br /><br />The only way for us to learn is by making mistakes, right? So he has to learn from these things as he matures, and we have individuals at the club who are looking closely into the development of exceptional talents, including coach Michael <b>[Selangor II head coach and Selangor technical director Michael Feichtenbeiner]</b>. It’s not only for the sake of Luqman, but also for the country</p>
