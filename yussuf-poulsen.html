  <p><b>[RB Leipzig’s fairytale debut campaign in the Bundesliga should not be compared to Leicester City’s heroics in the Premier League last season]</b> We aren’t thinking in that way at the moment. We just want to continue playing as well as we do. Let’s see how far it can take us. We aren’t looking around to compare us to anyone else. We aren’t Leicester and they are not us. The world changes, the team’s totally different, the league is completely different. There is no need to compare us to Leicester.<br /><br />We know we are good but we didn’t know we were that good already. We developed a team spirit so fast in the Bundesliga. It came as a surprise.<br /><br />We played some good games in pre-season but from the first game until now, to be unbeaten is unbelievable. Continuing these good performances every week, it’s still surprising. We have a good team and a good spirit. We have this spirit from last season when we got promoted. Everyone had this good feeling after promotion and we took it into this season.<br /><br />We have a lot of confidence at the moment. Every week, our confidence is getting bigger. But we still know we have to keep working hard because we are a new team in the league. We are flying on this cloud where everything is going fantastically but we have to focus on giving everything in every game. We know there are a lot of good teams in this league. If we stop doing so, it will become difficult<br /><br />It’s still a long time to go in the season, only 12 matches have been played. We have our goals to play a season without any doubt that we will stay in the league. We are almost close to that. Talking about the title it’s not the right time to do that. We are focusing on our own game. To do otherwise would be stupid.<br /><br />We know when we are doing good, attention is getting bigger. But we have to focus on ourselves and not worry about what the media are typing and what everyone is thinking. We just want to continue this streak we have now, try and hold onto that and see how far it can take us<br /><br />We have been playing this attacking brand of football since I came here three-and-a-half years ago. I like this brand of football, the fans do too. It’s attractive football. Some games normally you could almost fall asleep but when you see us play you don’t fall asleep. It’s satisfying for us players because it’s also a lot of fun.</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Yussuf Poulsen?]</b> It was said: ‘Why does he move to the German third league? Of course, it was not a regression for me, even if the media sold it that way. The mentalities in Sweden and Denmark are a bit similar: many believe that they are the best in the world. You also have to be realistic - I was just too bad for the Bundesliga. And in Germany’s third league there are enough clubs that could keep up with the first league in Denmark. After 15 months in Leipzig, I got my Sweden national team debut. Therefore, the change was obviously not too wrong.<br /><br />When I was little, I was a Barcelona fan. You also have to be honest with yourself and know what you can and can not do. I can not play in Barcelona, maybe I will never be able to. That’s why it’s not a dream to switch. As a kid, there was only the Danish or English league, that was the only thing you could watch on TV. So for me, as a kid, the biggest thing you can do is play in the Premier League<br /><br />The Premier League would generally interest me. That would fit well with my game. As a kid I followed Liverpool. My best friend was a fan of the club - and then you are somewhere, too</p>

  <p><b>[Naby Keita’s poor discipline could be a big problem for Liverpool]</b> I think that most of the fans of Liverpool already watched him play. He is a superb player on a very high level. He shows what he can do with the ball even if it’s not going well for the team at this time. His last goal against Hoffenheim where he fakes out three people. He hit the post and then the ball went in. There are not many players in the world who can do that kind of thing. He is one of the few and not only the fans, but also his team-mates should be looking forward to that</p>

  <p><b>[Confessed Liverpool fan Yussuf Poulsen has admitted that he would love the opportunity to prove himself in the Premier League]</b> I want to play there sometime, and it’s no problem for me to say so.

  <p><b>[Yusuff Poulsen has revealed that he does not want his attacking partner Timo Werner to leave RB Leipzig]</b> Timo and I, that’s a great partnership, and of course I want him to stay. He has to find out if now is the right time to change (club).</p>

  <p><b>[Yussuf Poulsen says <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a>’s quarantined training camp has helped <a href="dani-olmo.html">Dani Olmo</a> integrate into the team quicker]</b> He can give us a lot. He is a very good, talented player and he will also get enough time on the field in the future. I’m sure of it, because he’s a really good footballer. I think the coronavirus period was hard for him. Because especially the new players can’t train the processes on the field, because we trained in small groups. On the other hand, we were in quarantine for a week now, where you have more to do with each other on a personal level. I think that definitely helped him a lot, because he integrated into the team faster on a personal level. I had several offers, not only from Spain, but also from Italy and England. But <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> was the team that bet the most. The sports director came to see me in Zagreb and the coach called me to convey his interest because he wanted me to be part of his staff. And that was very important to me. The project they offered me was not given to me by any other team. This is how I felt and I was determined that it was the best option. I am clear about the path I want to travel and what I have to do to achieve it</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> team-mate Yussuf Poulsen says Liverpool-linked Werner’s future is up to him]</b> I cannot really estimate that. It’s not about me and it’s not a club’s decision. It’s his decision. If you ask him, you will get a better answer. I can only say that I hope he will stay so we can keep scoring goals together next season. If that’s not the case, then we have to accept. I would still wish him all the best for his future. Of course, he is an important player for the team - not only as a player but as a personality as well. He really fits in. That’s why we can only hope that he stays, but we are not the decision makers here. He for himself has to figure out what he wants<br /><br />Of course it would be ideal <b>[that the team stays together as it is]</b>. But every player of course has his own goals in his life and his career. Speaking purely for the team, of course it would be ideal if the top performers stay here. That way we would have better preconditions to show better performances, because it is easier to play with someone you know for four years, than with someone completely new. You always need time to adapt. That’s why we have to hope that we can stay together for the next few years, because we are a very good team at the moment. But in the end, everybody has to decide for himself</p>
