  <p><b>[Yussuf Poulsen says <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a>’s quarantined training camp has helped <a href="dani-olmo.html">Dani Olmo</a> integrate into the team quicker]</b> He can give us a lot. He is a very good, talented player and he will also get enough time on the field in the future. I’m sure of it, because he’s a really good footballer. I think the coronavirus period was hard for him. Because especially the new players can’t train the processes on the field, because we trained in small groups. On the other hand, we were in quarantine for a week now, where you have more to do with each other on a personal level. I think that definitely helped him a lot, because he integrated into the team faster on a personal level. I had several offers, not only from Spain, but also from Italy and England. But <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> was the team that bet the most. The sports director came to see me in Zagreb and the coach called me to convey his interest because he wanted me to be part of his staff. And that was very important to me. The project they offered me was not given to me by any other team. This is how I felt and I was determined that it was the best option. I am clear about the path I want to travel and what I have to do to achieve it</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> team-mate Yussuf Poulsen says Liverpool-linked Werner’s future is up to him]</b> I cannot really estimate that. It’s not about me and it’s not a club’s decision. It’s his decision. If you ask him, you will get a better answer. I can only say that I hope he will stay so we can keep scoring goals together next season. If that’s not the case, then we have to accept. I would still wish him all the best for his future. Of course, he is an important player for the team - not only as a player but as a personality as well. He really fits in. That’s why we can only hope that he stays, but we are not the decision makers here. He for himself has to figure out what he wants<br /><br />Of course it would be ideal <b>[that the team stays together as it is]</b>. But every player of course has his own goals in his life and his career. Speaking purely for the team, of course it would be ideal if the top performers stay here. That way we would have better preconditions to show better performances, because it is easier to play with someone you know for four years, than with someone completely new. You always need time to adapt. That’s why we have to hope that we can stay together for the next few years, because we are a very good team at the moment. But in the end, everybody has to decide for himself</p>
