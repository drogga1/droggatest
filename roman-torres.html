  <p><b>[Roman Torres after scoring the decisive goal against Costa Rica which helped Panama secure a place at their first World Cup]</b> It’s a really significant achievement and something we deserve. We’ve been striving for this for a good while now and it all worked out. We’ve been working very well together and, despite what happened in the USA <b>[a 4-0 defeat in the penultimate matchday]</b>, we never lost faith or gave up</p>

  <p><b>[Panama defender Roman Torres reveals his added motivation for stopping <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> and England]</b> I have had interest from England in the past. Blackpool and <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> were after me in 2010. Then I had a trial with Nottingham Forest in early 2012. Only a disagreement over personal terms prevented a deal<br /><br />Now I want to have a good World Cup with Panama - and then we will see what the future holds for me. I have an important job ahead of me in stopping players like <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> at the finals. I have prepared myself well. Concentration will be the key for me, as they are constantly on the move and very dangerous in the penalty box. But they will have to respect my area</p>

  <p><b>[The Sounders, meanwhile, are readying for both instances. They know Toronto FC can be a dangerous team with or without <a href="jozy-altidore.html">Jozy Altidore</a> in the lineup]</b> Honestly, whether Jozy is there or not, I think we have to have that level of concentration and still be organized defensively</p>

  <p><b>[In the aftermath of the news on Roman Torres’s 10-game suspension by <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> for violating the league’s substance abuse policy]</b> Under the policy, players are responsible for what they put in their bodies irrespective of whether there was any intent to take a prohibited substance,<br /><br />While a grievance is theoretically possible, to prevail, we would have to demonstrate that the test results were wrong, rather than Román did not intend to take a performance enhancing substance. That is a virtually impossible standard<br /><br />The policy also provides for a set schedule of fines and suspensions for players who test positive for performance enhancing substances and that schedule was collectively bargained. Roman’s fine and suspension is in accordance with that collectively bargained schedule, so the length of the suspension and/or amount of fine could not be challenged successfully<br /><br />The problem is that in this country, lawful nutritional supplements that can be purchased over the counter lack sufficient regulation. As a result, they can and often are contaminated with undisclosed ingredients that may cause an adverse test. Román had absolutely no intention to try to cheat, and the unfortunate fact is that he is the victim of an industry with insufficient oversight</p>
