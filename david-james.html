  <p><b>[David James is backing <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to land <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title]</b> I want <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to win it. Yes there’s a gap at the moment, but to think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will win every game this season would be foolish, because it’s never been done before. You’d imagine <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are going to drop some points, and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> will keep gaining points. I think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will do it, I would like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to do it because <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> deserves it and the club deserves it<br /><br />One thing I learnt about <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> quite early was the way that he manages that team and the confidence he gives players. When he first came in he didn’t make any signings, and that just instilled a level of confidence in the players that the manager was trusting people to do what they’re capable of, rather than just replace them straight away; which is so often the case in a new management tenure</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> team-mate David James says <a href="joe-hart.html">Joe Hart</a> can recapture his best form and even win back his England place]</b> It must seem like a very distant view for him because he’s not playing first-team football but he can come back and be as good as he was before. Obviously, he needs to play. If he still has aspirations of playing for England then he needs to be playing at the highest level. It was unfortunate in one sense that he went to <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> where they had two very good English goalkeepers, although Tom Heaton’s gone now. One thing I know about having worked with him very briefly at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> is that this is a guy who will fight all the way. He’s got talent and he’s young enough<br /><br />I was in and out of the England squad for 13 years. <a href="steve-mcclaren.html">Steve McClaren</a> dropped me from the squad when he took over and I thought that was my England career finished. Then all of a sudden at 38, <a href="fabio-capello.html">Fabio Capello</a> calls me back in again. I know Joe has confidence. You can be more confident at some times than at other times but I don’t doubt that he is trying every which way to get himself in the right position. And if he gets the chance to play I just hope that he takes it with both hands and puts himself in a position where he is the number one again<br /><br /><b>[Current England No.1 <a href="jordan-pickford.html">Jordan Pickford</a> has come in for criticism despite helping the Three Lions to the World Cup semi-finals in 2018 but James says all goalkeepers can expect to come under fire sooner or later]</b> It’s like the sword of Damocles being an England goalkeeper - you know at some point you are going to get hammered. Possibly it’s more so than foreign goalkeepers because as English football fans we are more interested in English goalkeepers</p>

  <p><b>[David James says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> back-up goalkeeper <a href="sergio-romero.html">Sergio Romero</a> is as good with the ball at his feet as <a href="ederson.html">Ederson</a> and Alisson]</b> I’ve analysed him and there are a few ‘keepers who are highly-rated who just put the ball out there in a general area. But he’s as good as <a href="ederson.html">Ederson</a> and Alisson using his left foot and right foot<br /><br /><a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a> is, of course, the number one, but I looked at Romero when <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> bought him and I was amazed at how good the guy is with his feet – then I saw an improvement in De Gea. What you tend to find is when you’ve got two ‘keepers or two players training with each other day in, day out, you start picking up positive habits from the other player<br /><br />You don’t necessarily have to be as skilful as you would have been 20 years ago when the pitches were bobbly, but it allows a bit more freedom for them. Those two and <a href="jordan-pickford.html">Jordan Pickford</a> at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> as well, these guys are very, very good with their feet. ‘Keepers that have that quality, they can kick a decent long ball over 60-70 yards with accuracy as well as make a short pass. They’ve got all the tools in the bag for that. But they’ve got to have a decent defence around them. We’ve seen a few times already this season when defenders have messed up and a goal has gone in. The defenders you pass to can’t show that they’re under pressure near their own goal and need to be confident and capable enough to deal with it. If you’ve got that then it gives you confidence to pass it to them<br /><br />De Gea has had five amazing seasons at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. To have six months where you are not at that same level doesn’t mean there’s things fundamentally wrong. It just means to keep that level of performance for so long was incredible in the first place. There’s no question that De Gea will return to that kind of form again because he is an exceptional goalkeeper. There are lulls in anyone’s performance curve - with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>, their lulls are still incredibly high. And that’s what makes them the best in the world</p>

  <p><b>[What charity work does David James do?]</b> I hope that in 20 years’ time there is no David James Foundation in Malawi – either because a better organisation has taken over, or because the problems themselves have come so much closer to being solved. The day that happens – when Malawi’s people are no longer struggling with failed crops and hunger – may also be the beginning of their national team’s most successful period in their footballing history</p>
