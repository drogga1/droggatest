  <p><b>[on <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>]</b> Very strong and clever, a really good captain for Man United, the best midfielder I have ever seen in my life. Very powerful and strong in the tackle, an absolutely brilliant player</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba is very inconsistent and facing an uncertain future at Manchester United]</b> I don’t know if Pogba will stay. He’s a good player, but is very inconsistent. Sometimes he plays well and other times he doesn’t play well at all. I don’t know if he will stay, it depends on which players Manchester United buy in the summer. They need to make changes ahead of next season. Pogba will need to play more next season, if he were playing under Sir Alex Ferguson he would definitely be playing more as they played more attacking football.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether there are any similarities between Mourinho and Ferguson]</b> No, they’re from two completely different schools. They’re very different coaches with different mentalities. Mourinho is Portuguese and they have a different system of playing, and of course Ferguson was the best<br /><br /><b>[On United’s chances in 2018-19]</b> It depends - if Manchester United buy new players, more attacking players with a new system of playing, they may finish higher. Manchester City are a stronger team who play better football now. If next season, after the World Cup, Manchester United buy new, fresh, quality players then they could be champions</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho should take time away from football and has created a negative atmosphere at Manchester United]</b> Mourinho needs to step away from the game for a year. He’s taking his rage out on the players, fans and media, which means every move he makes is under scrutiny. He’s a great coach and I think after he’s spent some time away from the game, he’ll come back in to his next role stronger and fresher.<br /><br />I don’t think Mourinho will ever have the full backing at Manchester United because he doesn’t play the right football and that is likely what will cost him his job. He’s known for having a defensive style of football and it’s hard for United fans to adapt to that after watching Ferguson’s attacking football for two decades. Mourinho is happy to sit on a 1-0 result and the games can become boring to watch. He’s not going to change the way he manages so I think that it might be best for him to move on from Manchester United at the end of the season<br /><br />There is clearly tension between Mourinho and certain players, and that has affected the whole dressing room. Before the game and at half-time, you need to keep a positive mentality in the changing room, but there’s clearly a negative atmosphere that is impacting the players’ performance and Mourinho has to take responsibility for that. Criticising the players in public is unlikely to help, that’s for sure<br /><br />Manchester United’s top four hopes will be decided after the Christmas fixtures. There’s a lot of games around Christmas and the New Year and Man Utd have to bridge the gap between them and the top four. If they can’t close that gap by New Year, I can’t see them finishing in the top four this season</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba will aim to force a move to Real Madrid and is not suited to the Premier League]</b> I think Paul Pogba will be seeking a move to Real Madrid this summer. I don’t think his style of play is suited for the Premier League, and we will see his brilliance in the Italian or Spanish league. He may not suit the Barcelona style of play, but he’s perfect for Real Madrid. He’ll be able to express himself more freely on the field for them. Pogba has failed to show consistency with his performances since joining United and it’s time for a change. If Pogba wants to go down as a great, he needs to find a team that suits his play. Maradona never found his feet properly at Barcelona but turned in to a world beater at Napoli and I think this could be the same for Pogba.<br /><br />It’s hard to judge players like Fred with the current situation at United. The players that have been brought in are surrounded by negativity, which means they’re under the microscope every game and don’t have much time to settle in<br /><br />Man Utd have bought Lukaku for £90 million, but have failed to buy players that will get the best out of him. Man Utd need to bring one or two top wingers into the club who will work the opposition’s full-backs and get balls into the box for Lukaku to attack. Man Utd need to stop focusing on bringing in a big name and start signing players that want to play for the club. This is a massive few months and they can’t go rushing into a signing that doesn’t pay off</p>

  <p><b>[David de Gea is the best around at the moment]</b> For me De Gea is the big man, a great player. He is the best around at the moment. I liken him to Peter Schmeichel because of how much he helps Manchester United but in my opinion Schmeichel was better. He was the best goalkeeper I’ve ever seen in my life.<br /><br />Martial is a great player and we see that again now under the different style and system being played. It is more relaxed now than under Mourinho and that is why we’re seeing better results for Manchester United because players like Martial are enjoying their football<br /><br />Alexis Sanchez is in a different situation now. Being coached by Mourinho and being coached by <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> is very different. Now he is playing in a different system and is being told that he is wanted. As a winger, that to me is everything. A coach has two choices with Sanchez. They can either say ‘I want you’ or ‘I don’t want you’. Everybody talks about Sanchez, saying ‘he had a poor game on Saturday blah blah blah’ but really it comes down to the coach and their attitude</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba has been told that he is no leader at Manchester United in the Roy Keane or Eric Cantona mould]</b> Everybody is talking about Paul Pogba and how he performs in the big games. Now we will see against Liverpool, in a big derby against an excellent team. At the moment he is no leader. In the past we had the likes of Roy Keane and Steve Bruce, Cantona. These were leaders. At the moment Manchester United don’t have one.<br /><br />I hope Manchester United win. I’m a big supporter of them of course. It will be a good story if United win, with them having won so many trophies and Liverpool not winning a title for 29 years. Now that Liverpool have a good chance at winning silverware, it would be good if United can help stop them. It would be great. Everybody around the world will be watching this game</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale can reignite his career at Man Utd and Sancho would be a shrewd signing]</b> There’s no denying Real Madrid are under-performing at the moment and it doesn’t matter who you are, no player would enjoy that. I do believe Bale would reignite his career if he came to Man United. I believe Bale needs to be loved and that’s exactly what the United fans and <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> would do for him. If Bale were to leave Real Madrid, Man United have a great advantage in the fact they are one of the only clubs that could afford his wages. With a few players’ contracts expiring in the summer, I wouldn’t be surprised if this was something the board were thinking about and why they may not be renewing some.<br /><br />I think Sancho would be a great signing for United. He’s young and English which is the perfect mould for Man United. It’s crazy to think that a player who was let go for so cheap can suddenly come back to the Premier League for £90 million, but I guess Manchester United did something similar with Pogba from Juventus. Sancho has really shown what he is capable of at Dortmund and it’s been great to see a teenager go abroad and become a first-team regular for a potential title-winning team. It makes you wonder how Man City didn’t see the talent or weren’t willing to give him the chance. Man United would love to have the chance of taking a City player and making him a United great</p>

  <p><b>[Alexis Sanchez flopping like Fernando Torres at Chelsea and could end up with Atletico]</b> Sanchez is at risk of finishing his career in the same way <b>[Fernando]</b> Torres did at Chelsea. Torres was the main man at Atletico Madrid and Liverpool, but he is now remembered for the tough time he had at Chelsea. Sanchez has clearly shown that he has the capability to play with the best teams in the world, but Man United doesn’t suit his style of play and he’s never looked settled into the dressing room since joining the club. I’ve previously said that Ole should give him the chance to express himself as a winger, but now looking at his form and how often he’s been used, I think it’s best for Man United and Sanchez if he were to move on this summer. I can’t see him moving to another Premier League club and I think he should move back to La Liga. I see Sanchez joining a club like Atletico Madrid as there are currently a lot of problems at Real Madrid and he wouldn’t go back to Barcelona. He will most likely have to take a pay cut, but it’s for the benefit of his career<br /><br />I think it’s time for Mata to move on from Man United. He’s not been able to replicate the same form he had at Chelsea, but he’s also had a tough time with being used very sporadically, whilst being part of a very unsettled Man United squad. Mata doesn’t add too much to what Man United already have and I think he needs to move on in order to re-spark his career. He’s fairly far down on the pecking order and only really seems to play games when others are injured<br /><br />There is a worrying situation developing with De Gea at Manchester United. He still hasn’t signed a new contract and the club will soon be faced with a decision either to sell him for a fee this summer or risk allowing him to leave for a free. De Gea is the best goalkeeper in the world so it would be a nightmare if he doesn’t sign a new contract at Manchester United. It’s bad enough that he may be leaving the club, but it would be an even bigger travesty if they were to let it happen on a free transfer</p>

  <p><b>[Andrei Kanchelskis reveals <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>’s <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> transfer apology]</b> When I left United, Ferguson was ready to apologise to the whole team. <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a> wrote that if I had not left Manchester, he would not have played. It’s nice that I gave him the opportunity. As a result, they recognise me more in England than in Russia.<br /><br /><b>[Despite his premature exit from <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> and the controversy that surrounded it, the winger has happy memories of his time at United]</b> Naturally, mostly positive things are connected with England, especially with Manchester. I remember the first time I went to <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>. I was then recognised as the best player of the match. Before <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup final with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, the Queen herself wished us good luck. There were difficult times, but in football everything doesn’t always run smoothly<br /><br /><b>[The winger also remembers a time that, due to the language barrier, his team-mates tricked him into swearing at Ferguson]</b> They made fun of me. I immediately realised myself that you should not say that, but, most importantly, the coach also laughed at that joke. In general, Ferguson and Valery Lobanovsky (his manager at Dynamo Kiev) could always admit their mistakes. This suggests that they are great</p>
