  <p><b>[on <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>]</b> Very strong and clever, a really good captain for Man United, the best midfielder I have ever seen in my life. Very powerful and strong in the tackle, an absolutely brilliant player</p>

  <p><b>[Andrei Kanchelskis reveals <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>’s <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> transfer apology]</b> When I left United, Ferguson was ready to apologise to the whole team. <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a> wrote that if I had not left Manchester, he would not have played. It’s nice that I gave him the opportunity. As a result, they recognise me more in England than in Russia.<br /><br /><b>[Despite his premature exit from Old Trafford and the controversy that surrounded it, the winger has happy memories of his time at United]</b> Naturally, mostly positive things are connected with England, especially with Manchester. I remember the first time I went to Old Trafford. I was then recognised as the best player of the match. Before <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup final with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, the Queen herself wished us good luck. There were difficult times, but in football everything doesn’t always run smoothly<br /><br /><b>[The winger also remembers a time that, due to the language barrier, his team-mates tricked him into swearing at Ferguson]</b> They made fun of me. I immediately realised myself that you should not say that, but, most importantly, the coach also laughed at that joke. In general, Ferguson and Valery Lobanovsky (his manager at Dynamo Kiev) could always admit their mistakes. This suggests that they are great</p>
