<blockquote>
  <p>It was fascinating watching it all play out, the negotiations on fees and pitch on salary packages. I found myself smiling a lot of the time because I know how it works. The club know what they can pay and what they can’t even before everyone gets round that table. It’s all a game. But a game I can now see from all angles<br /><br />As a sporting director I helped players play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, and I could see the excitement in their eyes at signing for a top-flight club. I’ve seen ‘little Huddersfield’ spend £11m on Steve Mounié, £7m on <a href="aaron-mooy.html">Aaron Mooy</a>, £8m on <a href="tom-ince.html">Tom Ince</a>, the kind of fees they’d never paid before, and I’ve seen the excitement, too, on the owner’s face. Now I’m in a position where I can help clubs sign players they might otherwise not have known about through the contacts I’ve built up. I can source players outside their normal channels, and help players from abroad find a way to play in England<br /><br />Leaving <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a> came out of the blue but, in life, things happen which throw you in a different direction. At <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> I’d overseen an academy producing the likes of <a href="victor-moses.html">Victor Moses</a>, <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> and Nathaniel Clyne under <a href="simon-jordan.html">Simon Jordan</a>’s ownership. I was on a cross-Channel ferry back in 2010 going over to Holland with an under‑16s team when the managing director, Phil Alexander, rang to say we’d gone into administration. I was one of 29 people who’d been made redundant. The sense of shock … but over the next few months I had the head of youth development at <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> <b>[Chris McCart]</b> calling me up to head up the scouting for their academy. I eventually gave in, and it was the best decision I ever made. That role submerged me in scouting, from youth into senior level, and set me up for everything<br /><br /><b>[Life at <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> where English top-flight clubs would receive £100m per season at the very least through broadcast rights, <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> would be all‑conquering domestically on around £2m a year in television revenues]</b> The most we could pay would be around £3m, and we had two criteria: did the player have the ability and character to compete against the likes of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>? And did they have the potential to be sold at a huge profit?<br /><br /><a href="victor-wanyama.html">Victor Wanyama</a>, Fraser Forster, <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a>, Moussa Dembélé - all had that huge potential. The big clubs all knew about them but found faults and reasons not to pursue them. If you’re receiving £100m every year, why take risks? You can wait for a club like <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> to do that and if you have to pay through the nose further down the line for the finished article, so be it. But you can see a Rolls Royce of a player early. I used to say to <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs: ‘Van Dijk is a man playing in a playground against kids, he stands out so much. He’s 6ft 4in, can ping it from one end of the field to the other, can head it, scores goals, is quick … he’s got everything’. And they’d still go and buy someone else. I’d despair<br /><br />I was aware of Dembélé when he came over to Fulham from <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, and all <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> clubs had watched him in the Championship. He wasn’t the quickest - he’s not slow, either - but he’s got great presence, is a natural finisher, and has a big-game mentality. The bigger the game, the cooler he is. Once it was clear he wasn’t going to sign a new contract at Fulham, that deal was perfect for us. English clubs would have to go to a tribunal and pay up to £5m for him, but Scotland is considered ‘cross‑border’ so we only had to pay £400,000 in compensation. He’s only 21 and is a dark horse to go with France to the World Cup. The bigger the game, the bigger his contribution. I’ve seen the suggestions he might go for £18m this window, but he’d still be cheap at £30m<br /><br /><b>[<a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> would call monthly meetings where the Yorkshireman would present the department’s findings to the manager and his staff]</b> Say we were looking for a box-to-box midfielder, we’d deliver 15 different options and Brendan, very professional, would make notes on each player. We’d go into each one, their strong points, and whittle it down to an absolute maximum of four to focus on. Brendan would say which ones he preferred, and we’d get the go-ahead to explore how much it would cost us, either with the agent or the club<br /><br />Initially, you’re looking at technical and physical abilities, then tactical and football intelligence, such as positioning. And then you’d have his psychological profiling, talking to people in the game or around the player. Further down the road we could come together again and update, and then hand over to the chief executive, <a href="peter-lawwell.html">Peter Lawwell</a>, and <b>[the company secretary]</b> Michael Nicholson to deal with the financials with the player’s agent once we had permission from his club. That process eventually landed us, say, Olivier Ntcham, from <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, who we’d watched <b>[on loan]</b> at Genoa<br /><br /><b>[Moss, working from Town’s near‑deserted training ground over the summer, and <a href="david-wagner.html">David Wagner</a> spoke two or three times a day and the owner backed the pair’s judgment. It was a slick operation, aimed at securing the best players within our budget]</b> It was fantastically exciting and I secured players I’d liked at <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> but could never afford. <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> ran an amazing business, but we’d stumble as soon as the fees rose to £4m, or the player wanted £2,000 extra a week. There is more leeway down here even at a newly promoted team<br /><br />The Mounié deal was a big one, £11m up front and potentially £13m to Montpellier, but to be there at Palace on the opening day of the season - you know all the work that’s gone in behind the scenes to make that happen, and then your record signing goes and scores two goals to give you a flying start. It’s unfortunate he’s had an injury since, but Laurent Depoitre was another we’d tried for at <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>. He’d made the wrong move by leaving Gent for <a href="porto-fc.html">Porto</a> for £6m: he’s not a Latin-type player. He’s made for English or German football, so his value had gone down since to a bargain €2.5m<br /><br />That can be the best time to buy. Anyone can spot a player who’s man of the match every week. It’s when you’ve seen their potential and yet they’ve slipped - confidence, injury, out of favour - that you have to move. Laurent’s another big lad, 6ft 4in, and not the prettiest on the eye in training, and David would come to me saying: ‘What have you bought here?’ He was off the pace in training, but he comes alive on matchday. David took some convincing to play him against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> <b>[in September]</b> when Mounié was out, but he bullied <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> and was the best player on the pitch<br /><br />If you don’t have that figure implementing the club’s vision, people can start shooting in different directions, politics kick in, and potential is passed up. Look at what Les Reed has achieved at Southampton: there is the example of the system working perfectly in this country, and everyone knows what <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> are about. In England, there have been a lot of bad appointments with the wrong people put in these positions, and that has put clubs off the idea. But get the right person in the job and the benefits are obvious</p>
