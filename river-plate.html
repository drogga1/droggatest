  <p><b>[Santiago Bernabeu will host the second leg of the Copa Libertadores final between River Plate and Boca Juniors]</b> Club Atletico River Plate informs that it will make the legal proposals and the pertinent appeals in relation to the decisions of the South American Football Confederation <b>[CONMEBOL]</b> and its Disciplinary Court, in relation to the change of venue arranged on the final match of the Copa Libertadores 2018, the economic sanction and the prohibition to dispute with audience two official parties organised by CONMEBOL.</p>

  <p><b>[River express ‘total disapproval’ of Bernabeu Libertadores final]</b> As has been expressed publicly, River make clear their total disapproval of the change of venue …grave, severe damage caused to members and fans of River, who purchased their tickets through an enormous economic effort for November 24 in River’s stadium and who are seriously affected and discriminated against by this decision<br /><br />It bears mentioning that more than 66,000 people paid for their ticket, waited patiently for around eight hours on November 24 and went to the stadium again on November 25. Many of those travelled hundreds of kilometres from across the country to be able to watch the match. They lost time and money and above all suffered the huge disappointment of not being able to watch the match. All of them deserve the utmost respect and most of all ample apologies. Those same spectators are now being unjustifiably denied the chance to go to the game, due to the clear difference in costs and the distance of the chosen venue itself. It is incomprehensible that the most important derby in Argentine football cannot be held normally in the very country where a G-20 summit is taking place. Argentine football as a whole and the Argentine Football Association <b>[AFA]</b> cannot and should not allow that a handful of violent people stop the Superclasico being played in our country</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Argentina bucks world trend as ball continues to roll]</b> The club considers that competing would imply severe risks for the health of the senior squad and everyone involved in an official match. The fact that one of our players has shown symptoms compatible with Covid-19 confirms the possible risks and forces us to be aware of the consequences, even if the diagnosis is unconfirmed and <b>[affected reserve player]</b> Thomas Gutierrez is recovering well</p>
