  <p><b>[Goals from Famara Diedhiou and Jamie Paterson gave Bristol City a 2-1 win over relegation-threatened Hull in their first match since sacking head coach <a href="lee-johnson.html">Lee Johnson</a>]</b> While I would like a shot at management at some point in my career, my only thought now is to put smiles on the faces of our supporters. It is not about me at the moment. It is about ending the season as strongly as possible. I wanted the players to perform with freedom tonight and they have come up with two great goals<br /><br />Now it is on to the next training session and a long trip to Middlesbrough. I am not thinking beyond that at the moment. We needed a win to end a poor run. I asked the players to go out and play as if it was the first game of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Nahki Wells scored his 20th goal of the season to keep Bristol City on the fringes of the Sky Bet Championship play-off race and leave Middlesbrough scrapping for dear life]</b> All we are focusing on is our performance. You can’t really take care of the result, but you can take care of your own performance. The players have done that today and we’ll look to do the same on Wednesday night against Stoke. We’ll just focus on the performance and see after Wednesday night where we sit. The play-offs are not something we are even thinking about. You take your eye off the ball and you can fall flat on your face</p>

  <p><b>[Stoke inched towards Championship safety with a 1-1 draw at Ashton Gate that did little for Bristol City’s play-off prospects]</b> Until it’s mathematically certain (not reaching play-offs) there is no chance that our season is over. And even if it does become mathematically certain we won’t be on the beach. There is too much to play for, we want to build momentum for next season. I knew there weren’t going to be fantastic chances here because <a href="michael-o-neill.html">Michael O’Neill</a>’s teams are always defensively sound. Michael’s Northern Ireland teams were always set up to defend soundly, but the lads gave everything</p>
