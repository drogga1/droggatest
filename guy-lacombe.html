<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Guy Lacombe, who was manager at AS Cannes when <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> was a teenage trainee there and is an instructor at the French Football Federation’s Direction Technique Nationale]</b> You can only succeed as a manager if you really want to do it and I know from being with him over the last couple of years that he really does, and he has done his utmost to achieve it<br /><br />It’s funny how life brought us back together after so many years. I found that he has the same qualities now that he had when I first met him. Above all, he is a simple person despite the immense aura that he now has in the football world. He is reserved and only speaks when he has something to say. But he is very attentive and really listens to people<br /><br />As his tutor I saw a lot of him and went to Madrid three or four times to observe his sessions with the Castilla <b>[Real’s B team, which <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> ran for a year and a half before replacing <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafael Benítez</a> at the head of the senior team this week]</b>. He has really taken on the mantle of manager. We discussed technical things but I only gave him one piece of advice, which is the same I give to all managers: stay true to yourself and follow your instinct. Being a manager is about making decisions, so listen to that voice inside you and let it take the decisions. I don’t have any worries on that front for Zinedine<br /><br />Over the years he, like all players, formed opinions of the personalities and exercises of various managers he worked under but when you are a player your opinion only relates to your own game, you do not have to have an overall picture like a manager does. Over the last two or three years that is all <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine</a> has been thinking about: the team. Even though as a player he had all the qualities needed to bring the best out of others around him on the pitch, he still had to reflect on how he could do that from the sidelines. He has developed those qualities and can convey them now as a manager<br /><br />Some say <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> would have been wiser to start his managerial career at a small club but I lean towards the view that Real is the best possible place for him to begin. To be a good manager you have first of all to be in the right place at the right time and Madrid is undoubtedly the right place for him<br /><br />Everyone was awaiting his appointment but all the pressure is on the president who appointed him. He knows the players very well from having worked with them in competitive situations while assistant to <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> and by being always around the dressing room. That is an incredible advantage. Normally when you arrive as a manager in a club you know maybe two or three players, but not the whole squad. To have such a deep knowledge of his environment puts him in a great starting position. So the only question that remains is: ‘Is this the right time?’ I wholeheartedly hope so</p>
