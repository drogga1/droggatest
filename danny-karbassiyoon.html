  <p><b>[Speaking about his travails as a young footballer, the journey to becoming a scout and what he’s learnt so far]</b> I’m living in London again. I moved here about 20 months ago after we moved our company over here. We were based in San Francisco originally. We’re building a football game with footballers investing in us for football fans so it didn’t make much sense to be based in San Fran despite it being such a tech-heavy city. We were pleasantly surprised with how amazing the market is here on the gaming side. On top of all that I’m still scouting for Arsenal on the weekends, across all leagues at a senior level.<br /><br />Doing both of them <b>[start-up and scouting]</b> has been really nice for me. At the weekends I get to switch off a little bit from the start-up side of things and get to do something I really enjoy doing for the club I love in a market which is far more closer to home than the US market and CONCACAF. It’s been really cool over the past year getting to experience the Premier League scouting side of it, seeing how it works and how clubs communicate with one another when scouts go to various places. Generally speaking there’s quite a nice rapport among all the clubs regardless of where you’re going and people will look out for you.<br /><br />I spoke at the Anne Frank trust recently at a young professional entrepreneurial event. The whole basis of the talk was that entrepreneurs have three things innately. One of them was hard work and knowing that you have to work harder than anyone else to succeed. Number two is the desire to take risks and I reference that because at 18 the club <b>[Arsenal]</b> told me that the odds of me making it at Arsenal were very small and I was passing a lot of amazing opportunities academically and on the football side in the States. If you are to succeed you need to have what Paul Graham calls ‘the cockroach mentality’, where no matter what you never die and keep on fighting until the end<br /><br />I’ve learnt that I can survive on aeroplanes and hotels on my own! When you’re a footballer you’re in a group all the time and as a scout you’re a lone wolf, you can’t really tell anyone where you’re going. I’m still learning even when I watch a game, even how tactics have progressed and when you’re looking at players it’s a game that continues to evolve. Players that were really good 10 years ago playing in a certain system, if they are unable to adapt to other systems then they may not be as effective as they were back then<br /><br />It’s much more than ‘this player is really good’ and that’s it. He has to have the right attitude, the right mentality, the right heart, desire and want to win - all on top of being a good footballer and athlete as well. Looking for that has been challenging but it’s the fun of the job as well. When you’re building a profile of a player you have to see various facets of their game. You take certain things from the people recommending him and you watch him home, away against difficult and easy opposition<br /><br />You can learn a lot about players when they’re down 2-0 away from home, who’s hanging their head, who’s angry at the team, who’s completely packed it in. You can learn a lot just from body language and if you go to the game and watch one player you can see things just from casually watching him that you wouldn’t necessarily pick up.<br /><br />There’s an analytics team and data team <b>[at Arsenal]</b> which looks at that side of the game that will flag players. It’s actually very good for pointing things out that you may have missed or the normal eye wouldn’t see. For example, if a player has a 100 per cent pass completion rate across 10 games and he’s played over 60 passes a game then it might make sense to take a look at him. It helps cast the net further across games and leagues where you don’t necessarily have a scout covering all the time. I see it as not only an insurance player, but to back your presentation as a player<br /><br />I think there’s still something to be said about ‘does he pass the eye test?’. Despite all the technology out there when I go to games there’s still 10 scouts sat next to me. I know other people will argue that scouts will be gone one day but I still think the dynamic nature of the game makes it difficult to put a number on absolutely everything. Sometimes the most influential piece in the build-up to a goal involves a player’s intelligent run off the ball or the awareness to just let the ball roll past him without directly touching it - two things that can be a bit more difficult to visualise with numbers and data alone<br /><br />Anytime you bring a player from such a different part of the world over to the Premier League and you talk about adapting there’s a lot of factors that have to take place. There’s no surprise that a lot of Latin players end up in Spain because it’s easy for them to integrate themselves, they speak the language, culturally it’s not that different too.<br /><br />When you throw someone into Lancashire or Tyneside it might be a little different to what they’re accustomed to. That said, the best players in the world can adapt and will settle. I was covering CONCACAF and the type of player there tends to be very hard-working, technically it’s starting to get better and better.<br /><br />Countries that are hard working, hot countries where the players are outside most of the time. For those people who come over generally - Joel Campbell and Alexis Sanchez for example - work extremely hard for their team and technically they’re very good as well.<br /><br />The tricky part is adapting to the Premier League - the speed of the game because if you’re not happy away from the pitch then you’re not going to be happy playing football either. Even some of the world’s best players come to the Premier League and don’t settle because maybe mentally they’re not right and they find it difficult to acclimatise. If it doesn’t happen on the pitch then all the time you’re away from it you start to wonder why you came in the first place.<br /><br />Players from South America, Central America and even continental countries like Spain and Italy arrive for a big transfer fee and end up leaving due to a combination of the league being so competitive and the player not being able to settle<br /><br />At the end of the day, I ultimately want to be able to provide value to the people around me. For Arsenal, that comes in the way of providing scouting reports that are meaningful and give a club that I love an edge on other clubs. From the start-up scene it’s creating something that’s never been created and focusing how to get fans to engage with their celebrities and icons in a meaningful way</p>
