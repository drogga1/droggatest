<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re into eating whales, Kouji Shingru’s shop is the place for you. Located on a pedestrian-only street in Tokyo’s bustling Asakusa neighborhood, Shingru’s compact establishment has it all: deep red whale steaks and fillets in vacuum-sealed packages, cured whale on a stick, snack-sized bags of whale jerky, and a wide selection of canned whale morsels packed in brown sauce. A steady stream of customers - most of them over 50 - flows through the Yushi Special Shop in Whales, one of the capital’s only retail outlets for whale products.<br /><br />The problem, says Shingru, is with the supply. Since 1986, commercial whaling has been banned by the International Whaling Commission, and whale-eating nations have had to make do with the byproducts of their scientific catch<br /><br />Japan <b>[whose people once killed and ate thousands of blue, fin, sperm, sei, and humpback whales in a single season]</b> has in recent years subsisted on an annual supply of 500 to 600 minke whales, each only a third the size of the fin whales that were once the backbone of the country’s whaling industry<br /><br />… This year Japan has more than doubled its whaling quota to 935 minkes, ostensibly as part of long-term research into the size and health of their population in the frigid waters around Antarctica. Norway has also boosted its quota in the North Atlantic, upsetting anti-whaling activists who note that this will be the world’s most deadly whaling season in a generation<br /><br />2006 could well be the year that the international whaling moratorium collapses altogether. In a triumph of patient diplomacy, Japan has used aid and trade measures to convince a small army of previously disinterested Caribbean and Pacific nations to join the IWC and vote with Japan. When the IWC meets this June in St. Kitts in the Caribbean, the pro-whaling bloc may well have the votes to overturn the ban<br /><br />Many in the West see a resumption of whaling as barbaric, a return to the dark days of the 20th century, when floating factories drove many great whales to the brink of extinction to procure industrial oil and pet food. But people in whale-eating nations see the issue differently, and find some of the criticisms by other countries hypocritical<br /><br />In Norway, even leading environmental groups like the Oslo-based Bellona Foundation support the country’s whale hunt<br /><br />Norway’s government-sanctioned hunt is controversial - it’s the only country in the world that has a commercial hunt in defiance of the moratorium - but it does appear to be sustainable. Operating from about 30 small fishing vessels, Norway’s whalers are allowed to kill up to 1,052 minkes out of a total estimated North Atlantic population of roughly 100,000<br /><br />Our interview started on the deck of one of Loftsson’s 150-foot steam-powered boats, which are so small they return from a hunt with one or two minke carcasses strapped to the outside of the hull. (The animals are butchered on shore.) But when my questions turned to the whale’s place in Icelandic food culture, Loftsson insisted we adjourn to 3 Frakkar, a nearby Reykjavik restaurant whose deep freezers have kept its tables supplied with whale throughout the moratorium<br /><br />The fin whale is served as sashimi, and looks and tastes like a cross between high-grade tuna and beef tenderloin. Despite spending 20 years in 3 Frakkar’s freezers, it’s subtle and delicious<br /><br />When the small dish is finished, I have some misgivings about having eaten part of a great whale, but the experience can’t fail to impress just how many meals a single whale must produce. In terms of food per life taken, it’s hard to compete with an 80-ton mammal - that’s 35,000 times the live weight of a chicken<br /><br />In Tokyo, Shingru had a back room where customers could eat their whale purchases, but I settled for a portable bag of minke whale jerky. It tasted something like beef jerky, only sweeter, as promised by the text on the package: ‘This Kuzira Jerky tastes sweet,’ it read in English, ‘one’s dear old taste’.<br /><br />The last reference was targeted at older Japanese who lived through the famine years at the close of World War II. In those days, whale meat provided a lifeline to a truly starving population, accounting for nearly half of all animal protein consumption, and earning itself a revered position in the nation’s food culture<br /><br />If the IWC moratorium is lifted, prices could go down - but demand, not supply, may become Japan’s problem. Even with an expanded scientific hunt, hundreds of tons of unsold whale meat have been piling up in storage freezers<br /><br />Now there’s even a campaign to introduce whale to Japanese children and teens. Schools in Wakayama, a whaling region, have added the meat to their lunch program. ‘Whale culture’ lessons have been added to elementary-school curricula, and one fast-food chain has started serving whale burgers, to a storm of international criticism</p>
