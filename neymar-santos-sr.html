  <p><b>[Barcelona star Neymar has been cleared of tax evasion in Brazil]</b> It is with great joy the we received the news of the termination of proceedings regarding the complaint on tax evasion directed by the Federal Public Ministry. The proceeding is officially closed, thus it proves the lawfulness on every act we took.<br /><br />During four years of unfounded accusations me, my family and our employees suffered a lot and in every possible way. But albeit lots of people doubt, there’s justice in our country. Accusation by accusation, one after the other, they were all defeated by our defence, leaving it clear that we did not evade not one penny in taxes. Now I hope we can focus only in our jobs, and that me and my family can have the peace we deserve</p>

  <p><b>[Of his son’s first years on this planet]</b> We did not start at zero - we started at minus five. It would have been the easiest thing to do.<br /><br /><b>[Real Madrid came knocking for his 14-year-old son]</b> We’re from a humble family, and in a humble family there is always the question of cultural values. We thought he had to grow up in Brazil. That was the first serious choice we had to make</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar netted 27 goals for the youth team in his short trial, impressing fellow players and coaches alike. Real were keen to tie up a deal for the talented teenager]</b> We were invited to come over and look at the facilities. We had a car available to travel to the training sessions. Neymar met all of the players, took part in the training sessions. The doors were completely open.</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar Sr. slams son’s critics after PSG no-show]</b> In a war there are those who feed off victories and there are those who, like vultures, feed from the carrion of the defeated. They do nothing, they produce nothing, they live off the limelight or, more often, off the struggles of their ‘prey’. In the football world we know these people as showing ‘vulture behaviour’. Sometimes they take advantage of a loud microphone, of a mediocre ‘playing’ career <b>[it is not right to call those who at the very least act questionably off the field ‘athletes’]</b>, always in the shadow of others who are more talented, to vent their frustrations. They take advantage of a defeat, a lost battle, to begin the hunt, waiting for defeat in the war to feed their egos, like vultures feed off carrion. They will never win an Olympics in Rio, but there they are, waiting for the first chance to show their mean spirits. But remember: We lost a battle, not the war. My son’s ‘war’ has been going on since he was a kid, always fighting the good fight, always dodging the vultures, always being reborn stronger! And most of all, respecting everybody, even the vultures. We lost a battle, maybe the war, we will see, because it will go on as long as he is on the pitch. And be sure of this… like a phoenix he will be reborn, ready for whatever battle lies ahead! Maybe you, the vulture, will go hungry. And you can go ahead and eat your words, as rotten as carrion.</p>

  <p><b>[The father of Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar claims that his son should undergo surgery on a foot injury]</b> PSG already know they will not have Neymar for the next six to eight weeks. The decision <b>[to undergo surgery]</b> lies with PSG and will be made as a team after the arrival of the Brazil national team doctor. It is vital to make it quickly because we cannot wait. Surgery is the quickest way to accelerate the player’s recovery.</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar’s father has quelled transfer speculation around his son]</b> He is in the second year of his contract <b>[with PSG]</b> so he still has three years before the end of his contract <b>[in 2022]</b>. We are already talking about an extension with PSG. His name has been speculated since he was 17, from the moment he made his professional debut. Neymar has only had two transfers in his life but there has been speculation for 10 years. The probability that he will not leave is too great. People say: ‘Neymar is in all the transfer rumours to the big clubs in each transfer window. This means that there is good management of his career, he is always among the names <b>[of clubs who matter]</b>. But that does not mean he’s going to go to one club or another</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar Sr defends PSG star against diver reputation]</b> I told him: ‘Oh, Neymar, if you play, you play’. I particularly think Neymar should not get into duels at certain times, because he would not win. When I explain this, they say: ‘So you asked Neymar to dive? So you’re responsible for him diving?’ No, I’m not responsible for him diving. I am responsible for protecting him. I don’t think Neymar is spoiled on the pitch. I don’t see anybody protecting him on the field. What does it mean to be overprotected in sports? Is Neymar an overprotected player? No. Neymar is a overprotected son. I will overprotect my son, it’s my right<br /><br />One piece of advice I give my son is that he does not lose the joy of playing football. Let him keep playing however he thinks is right regardless of the outcome. Of course he plays to win, but he has to play with joy<br /><br />The press is responsible for a lot that happens, because it has power. It has power, because it takes information. Sometimes you just publish information to be the first <b>[to spread]</b> it, it is not good. It has to be truthful information. From time to time, the press helps these social networks get things out first without the whole truth</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar does not want to leave PSG]</b> The contract is long with PSG. We are only in the second season and it is not even over yet. We have a contract we are not even halfway through. These rumours of departure will always exist, we cannot have a player like Neymar without clubs dreaming about him.<br /><br />Neymar’s desire to be at PSG was expressed two years ago, so the fans can sleep easy. Today Neymar does not want to leave PSG, he wants to continue to help the club win titles</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar aiming for Coupe de France return]</b> He is very happy today to know that he is very close to finding <b>[to the field]</b>. That’s where he feels most happy, and when he’s on the field his mood is very positive. The goal is to find the ground for this final of Coupe de France and win a new title with PSG. It is what matters most for him - to raise trophies to achieve his goals, this joy linked to victory.<br /><br />I think it was one of the only times I saw <b>[Neymar]</b> so sad, not only because of the elimination but also because he could not help his club. PSG was going to qualify, and Neymar would be able to play in the Champions League. It was a very sad moment for all of us, for the fans, for the club and especially for Neymar because he could not be present on the field<br /><br /><b>[On the Cantona situation]</b> It’s normal, you know, they were close enough to each other, we know that Eric Cantona likes to criticize Neymar, and at that moment everyone defends his colors. Neymar was there as a fan. He had the right to say what he wanted and to be able to live the moment thoroughly. We did not want to be verbally abused in our own stadium, there was this revolt due to this situation but it is the past</p>
