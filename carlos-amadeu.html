  <p><b>[Carlos Amadeu, Brazil’s U-17 coach, speaking about his nation’s difficulties in world football in recent years ahead of his team’s debut at the 2015 <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> U-17 World Cup in Chile]</b> What’s happened to the professionals in the senior side has also affected the youth teams. Brazil are currently trying to rediscover the old magic, but the world has changed. Nowadays it has to be part of a system; you can’t just rely on individual talent to express itself, at the team’s expense</p>

  <p><b>[Under-17 coach Carlos Amadeu called on youth football to show less importance to results]</b> I think this is the Brazilian style, the football I grew up watching with those great Brazil teams.</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid target, Vinicius Juniour, set to captain national team in India]</b> Vinicius has everything to become a top-quality player, to move up to the senior Brazil squad and play for the biggest clubs around the world.<br /><br />If he remains focused on his goals, he has all the tools. He has a lot of technical qualities and is showing a cool head in amongst all the glamor that is currently surrounding him. He has remained balanced, and if he stays like that he can reach the top</p>

  <p><b>[Seleccao juniors’ coach Carlos Amadeu spoke about how his nation has been able to regularly produce world-class talents]</b> Brazil, like India, is a huge country. We have 20-25 scouts going everywhere and scouting for talent every single day. Plus there are 10-15 very good clubs who have their own youth development programs. We all work together to spot talent. But sometimes it still happens that a player emerges from nowhere and does well at the senior level. We don’t like those surprises. We would like to have all the best talent available in the country and put them through the youth set-up.<br /><br />Paraguay is a very good team, the only team that we could not beat during the South American Cup. They don’t have any individuals who are outstanding, but as a team, they work very well. Colombia is technically a very good team, and then there’s also Chile, who have been doing well<br /><br />I call this the World Cup of equality. Almost any team can do well here. Statistics show that African teams have done very well in this age group and then there are also the European teams, Spain and England, in particular, are very good. We won’t be taking any teams lightly<br /><br />Brazil has always had superstars, from Pele and Garrincha. But these players used to go abroad in their 20s, nowadays our players are leaving at about 15-16 years of age. There are two situations that arise out of it. Firstly, their clubs don’t release them for the national team apart from the FIFA days, so we don’t get to spend a lot of time with them. But at the same time, they are learning things from another school of football. The clubs have very good coaches and trainers who look after them and help in their development, so we would like to focus more on the positives</p>

  <p><b>[Brazil coach Carlos Amadeu looks forward to Spain clash]</b> We do preparations before the match with videos, with stats. We know the style of Spain. It’s independent if it’s the first game, second game or the last game. We are always trying to win. We know the potential of this team and we know our potential and that’s why it will be a great game for sure.<br /><br />It’s a fact that Vinicius was important for us. But right now we have to focus on the players that are here. It will be the same team that played in the South American Championships, the only difference is in the offensive line due to the absence of Vinicius<br /><br />During the two years of preparations, we had many camps. All the players are used to playing with or without Vinicius. They are used to our system and strategy. We have many alternatives, we can play with a high line or a low line. That’s why we have confidence in these guys<br /><br />It’s important for us to want to win this competition. We know there are many great teams and it won’t be easy for us. For these players, the most important thing is the experience<br /><br />Our offensive system starts with our defenders, Our defensive system starts with our forwards. That’s why we didn’t concede many goals in South American Championship</p>

  <p><b>[Brazil coach, Carlos Amadeu, had satisfaction on his lips as he stated]</b> It was a well-played game. Both teams were trying to play a beautiful style of football. Our players started nervously. After the first goal, they remained calm and play their football. Second half Spain were better. They had more possession and corners but our defence was good. Our goalkeeper was also playing really well today.<br /><br />Both Antonio and Alan had a great game. During the competition, you will watch players exhibiting such football. We have many quality players. It’s important for a coach to have players like them. Not just them, all our players<br /><br />The most important thing is the mental power. Its the basis for everything that you do in your life. When you score or concede a goal, you have to use your mental power to remain calm and score your goal. Also if you are winning the game, you cannot be relaxed. It happened today with us, we remained focused on the game. This collective style of playing of this team is being built since 2015. Players like to play that way, together, in an offensive way<br /><br /><b>[On the pitch, which seemed not too conducive to a free-flowing style of football]</b> It was a good pitch but it was wet. The ball was getting <b>[stuck at times]</b>. But it was a good facility to play football. We felt really welcome here in India, especially in Kerala, Kochi. The coincidence between the kit colours of Brazil and Kerala Blasters was good for us. We could see the support. It is really important to have the support of the crowd. We want to give something back to you. We are feeling like home. here. I realized that you have a team in yellow here. It is important to have the crowd supporting us. It was the first game at such a high level. We know how important it is to win the first half</p>

  <p><b>[Brazil coach Carlos Amadeu - Goa and Kochi made us feel at home]</b> Today we could do things that we couldn’t do in the other games - score in the opening minutes. So we are a bit relaxed. We tried to score fast in the first half and control the movement in the second half by trying to make an attack on a few occasions. Niger were marking man to man which made it difficult for us. They <b>[Niger]</b> tried to score a lot in the second half but our defence was totally solid.<br /><br />The weather here <b>[in Goa]</b> is hot and humid. The players were tired because of this climate and there were many games with a short space between. Now we will have some time to recover and practice. The kinds of support that we got here and in Kochi made us feel at home. It’s not something that we are building right now. It comes from what we have built in the past. So we have the responsibility to continue with the history that was built by our players and coaches<br /><br />We have many players in our forward system. Lincoln, Paulinho, Brenner are giving us a lot in terms of goals and assists. Brenner, for example, didn’t score until today but he had two assists. We also have players on our bench who can score. Today we had Wesley attacking a lot on the right. Lincoln has a lot of importance but we have to look at the collective group. He has the same importance as the other 20 players</p>
