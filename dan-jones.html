  <p><b>[The Red Devils recorded a sensational rise in income in 2015-16]</b> Manchester United have had to wait 11 years to regain their position as the world’s leading revenue-generating club and it has taken phenomenal commercial revenue growth to help them achieve this. In recent years, their ability to secure commercial partnerships with value in excess of that achievable by their peers has been the crucial factor in enabling the club to regain their place at the top of the Money League.<br /><br /><b>[There is one word of warning, though, from Dan Jones relating to the 2016-17 standings released in January 2018]</b> They’ll face strong competition from Barcelona and Real Madrid to retain the top spot in next year’s edition, due to the lack of Champions League football, the weakening of the Pound against the Euro and, over the longer term, as other clubs enter the commercial market demanding similar deals, using United as the precedent</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> leads financial growth as European football valued at £25bn]</b> European club football is in the strongest financial position that we’ve ever seen. This reflects the drive among leading clubs to generate ever greater revenues to fund success on the pitch and also the sustained efforts of <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> to improve profitability and sustainability of clubs through Financial Fair Play and club licensing.<br /><br />While <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> retains its leading position financially, we expect to see other leagues continue to grow in the coming years<br /><br />With the sale of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s domestic and international broadcast rights now complete for the 2019/20-2021/22 seasons, resulting in an overall 8% revenue increase, <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs will receive further increases in central distributions in the coming seasons</p>

  <p><b>[Which football club is the richest in the world?]</b> At the top, we have seen <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> shatter records, becoming the first club to break the three-quarters of a billion-Euro mark and claim a record 12th Money League title in the process. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s outstanding financial performance in 2017-18 is built on their long history of success on the pitch, most recently three consecutive Champions League titles. This has enabled the club to continue to drive commercial revenue as the appetite to partner with Europe’s most successful clubs remains stronger than ever</p>
