  <p><b>[Inside the rise of Florentino - the future of Portugal’s midfield]</b> For me, what stood out right away was his maturity. He played like a grown-up, his awareness of the space, his positioning, the way that he recovered so many balls. His spatial awareness was fantastic, his perception of the game were very unusual for a 10-year-old boy, it’s not easy to find this kind of characteristics in a boy of this age<br /><br />When he played against us I was watching another game, but I told the technical co-ordinator, Rodrigo Magalhaes, that we had been having good feedback on the boy and that I like him, so could you please check and tell me if it’s worth making a move. In the middle of the first half, after he’d watched only a little bit, he called me and he said, ‘This is for yesterday, Goncalo’, so I dropped the game that I was watching, I told him to hold on to Florentino’s father and tell him not to leave because I wanted to speak to him, and right away we made the negotiation and Florentino joined</p>
