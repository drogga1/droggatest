<blockquote>
  <p>ROY KEANE is currently in Russia discussing the World Cup 2018 games including tonight’s England vs Croatia semi-final, but who is his wife?<br /><br />The ITV football pundit is married to Theresa Doyle. The couple are believed to have met when she was a dentist’s assistant and he was playing for <a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a> in 1992. Roy and Theresa exchanged vows in 1997 at a ceremony in Mayfield, Cork. They have five children: Shannon, Caragh, Aidan, Leah and Alanna<br /><br />The couple seemingly prefer to keep their personal lives private<br /><br />Earlier this year, the Irish native put the couple’s country mansion on the market. The Sun reported that their home has seven bedrooms, eight bathrooms, six reception rooms, tennis courts and a swimming pool. In his autobiography, the former Sunderland manager insisted he likes home comforts but isn’t afraid to take risks<br /><br />Football fans were quick to comment on the star’s appearance as he gave his say about the England vs Croatia game. One Twitter user commented: ‘I thought there was something wrong with the telly but it was just <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>’s tan’<br /><br />Roy famously missed the World Cup in 2002 and has since admitted it was his biggest regret. He claimed he should’ve put his personal issues with football manager <a href="mick-mccarthy.html">Mick McCarthy</a> to one side for the sake of the team.</p>
