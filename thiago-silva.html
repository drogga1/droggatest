That’s something positive. And the other thing <b>[that strikes me]</b> when I look at him is that it’s all about his personality. Any time he wants to say something to you, he would say it face to face. That’s positive. Quite often, players don’t speak face to face, they speak behind your back. So I think, what <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> does is very positive. He has a strong personality but people in front of their TV think that he is arrogant. He is not arrogant.

We’ll leave it to admire him in other games ahead<br /><br /><b>[Silva praised the forward’s ability to produce moments of magic]</b> Every time we face each other, whether in the national team or in the Champions League, it’s very difficult to face him. No matter how much you study, you will never understand the quality he has and the difference he can make. At certain times, he pulls something else out of the hat that you cannot imagine. That’s his difference. As a centre-back you have to study all the possibilities. We know he always pulls left, but many times he pulls right.</p>

For everyone, the club, and for us, the players. But that isn’t an excuse. It isn’t because of that that we’ve been less focused tonight. Ney wasn’t here and we have to concentrate on ourselves, and about all we need to do this season. It’s a shame to lose in the second game of the season. It was a difficult match. We started well, we opened the scoring but then we relaxed a bit, and I don’t know why we lost our concentration. It was a shame to concede at the end of the first half, and then at the beginning of the second half we concede a goal that we wouldn’t usually concede. We are going to lift our heads up, think about the next game and try to improve, because today it wasn’t the PSG we know<br /><br />We worked well, but this is only the beginning of the season. This is not an excuse, because Rennes played well. They were solid and more attentive. I do not know exactly what happened. It will be better in the next matches</p>

  <p><b>[Despite the fact that he is weathering the coronavirus storm in his native Brazil, Thiago Silva remains in daily contact with his squad]</b> I’ve spoken with the coach. I often speak with him, through messages. sWith the players, we have a WhatsApp group and we talk to each other all the time, every week, to see if there’s any news, or if anything has changed in terms of a return to football<br /><br />A lot of times you see the videos on Instagram where everyone is working out. I work with them on a daily basis so I know they’re responsible guys. We have to be professional and keep working. It’s not the holidays, you have to take responsibility and be ready if you have to play again<br /><br /><b>[On the subject of quarantine, Thiago Silva admitted that he has been missing the daily routines of the footballer’s life]</b> We’re used to training every day and being on the pitch with our team-mates. Of course, there are also the matches, with the fans and the atmosphere. We didn’t have the fans in the stadium for our last match but they put on an amazing display outside the stadium. They sang throughout the match, it was magnificent. It’s difficult, these are things we’re not used to<br /><br /><b>[Nonetheless, the stalwart defender is keeping things in perspective]</b> You have to adapt, that’s life. There are tougher things than this. The good thing is that we can enjoy the family a bit more. It’s a difficult time for everyone. As I said before, you have to adapt to this difficult time. I try to do things at home, even if it’s not easy. There are little things, like riding a bike</p>

  <p><b>[PSG captain Thiago Silva looking at positives during this strange period]</b> <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> captain Thiago Silva looking at positives during this ‘strange period’. I have spoken with the coach, we often send each other messages. We have a squad Whatsapp group too, we are always talking, every week we talk, to see how things are going, if there is any news to share, if there is any change on the return date. But I know my squad, it’s a very responsible squad. You often see the videos on their Instagram, their training sessions, but when you work with everyone on a daily basis, you know that the guys are responsible. We need to be professional and continue to work, because we aren’t on holiday. It’s a moment to take note of our responsibilities. And to be ready if we need to play again</p>

  <p><b>[Thiago Silva could stay with <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, claims out-of-contract defender’s wife Isabelle Silva]</b> Thiago is very attached to <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, the supporters and France. Whether the adventure continues or not at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, we will have to go back to Paris to see our friends again. But for us, it would be great to continue at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, we love the club, the city, France. This is where the children grew up, we would like to continue our careers in Paris.<br /><br />For the moment, we don’t know anything about it. Everything stopped because of Covid-19. We don’t even know when we’re going to return to Paris. We are in the shadows, like everyone else</p>
