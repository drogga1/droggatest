  <p>[Former Kedah, Kelantan and Harimau Muda head coach Azraai Khor Abdullah is open to the idea of leading relegation-threatened Super League side Melaka United] Of course I miss coaching and I can’t deny that I am excited when I learned that Melaka have shortlisted me [as Williams’ replacement]. But the Melaka management has not contacted me, although I am excited at that possibility. A number of Melaka players have played under me at Harimau Muda such as Nazri Ahmad, Izzaq Faris Ramlan dan Faizal Muhammad. Apart from them, Melaka have a number of potential players and if given the chance, I will try to save the club from relegation.</p>

  <p>[Former Kedah coach Azraai Khor Abdullah laments Malaysian clubs’ habit of signing senior players from other teams instead of promoting youth players] First of all, what is missing is the path of these young players. For instance, when I coached Kedah I promoted Khyril Muhymeen [Zambri] to the senior team at the age of 17. He then received call-ups to the senior and junior national teams. The same happened to Baddrol Bakhtiar, Bunyamin Omar and a few other boys.<br /><br />And at the time Kedah were also competing in the AFC Cup. In 2008, our first year in the competition, we faced fixture congestion and I’ve had to utilise squad rotation, using youth players that I have promoted.<br /><br />We then unearthed the talent of Shakir Ali. We promoted him to the senior team, he played in the AFC Cup, he started scoring and received a call-up from Rajagobal [former Harimau Muda and Malaysia head coach Datuk Rajagobal Krishnasamy]. Afterwards he joined the Harimau Muda programme for two, three years.<br /><br />What I hope and have been hoping from those days is for the U23 players to find playing time with the senior teams. These days, it’s just the Kedah boys, and a number who play for Pulau Pinang. This [lack of senior team playing time] causes low exposure, when we expect those representing the country in the SEA Games to also be playing at a higher level. The coaches need to be brave. With the hectic July schedule, they should have used it as a chance to expose their younger boys<br /><br />Without naming names, several teams have very good youth teams that have been winning at the junior levels, but their boys are not promoted [to the senior side]. Instead, the teams sign non-local senior players.<br /><br />Kedah until now still promote their young boys. Apart from the leftback position which is occupied by Fitri Omar, the rest are all Kedahans. And lately Hanif [Dzahir] has been challenging Fitri for the position. Even during my double-treble stint we have been developing and promoting local boys.<br /><br />The question is, do the senior team coaching staff, the senior team head coach attend these junior competitions; the President’s Cup and the Youth Cup, to observe their own junior sides? I don’t think so. How would they then be certain of the type of players that they need?<br /><br />During my time, I would attend Kedah youth team home matches at the Jitra Mini Stadium together with the late Ahmad Basri [former Kedah FA administrator Dato’ Paduka Ahmad Basri Akil], as well as away youth matches held in the northern region of Peninsular Malaysia, as far as Ipoh. We would go to Pulau Pinang and Perlis to see their performance. We would scout their abilities and performances one by one, but in addition to this, our presence would be a source of motivational boost for the team<br /><br />Vietnam’s scouting begins at the district level where thousands [of young players] are scouted. I read one article whereby they gather tens of thousands of them. You can see that in terms of youth development, Vietnam are following close behind Thailand in this region. Their young players are coming up, and Myanmar’s too. Their junior team have qualified for the World Cup. Whereas for us in Malaysia, we’re still neither here nor there<br /><br />You tell me, where are the products of the programme? How many former Harimau Muda players are prominent names in the Malaysia Super League now? Most of them are not household names now. We can consider the programme unsuccesful, especially when they were considered as the backup national team players. How many of them are in the national team now? It’s sad. The players are not anywhere now, so for me FAM did the right thing by shutting the programme down. Maybe FAM should come up with something new<br /><br />I’m sure head coach Datuk Ong Kim Swee is already aware of the Thais’ strengths and weaknesses, and we are capable of defeating them. This is football, we can still overcome them if we face them in the semis of the final match. [In the AFC qualifiers] they defeated us, but against Indonesia they only managed a draw. We can’t simply judge by what’s on paper. Sometimes coaches get the tactics wrong and what they plan don’t go their way</p>
