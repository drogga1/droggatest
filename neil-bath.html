<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Bath’s diligent work over decades that is reaping rewards at the moment. He joined the club as a part-time schoolboy coach in 1992 but he was promoted to assistant academy director in 2002 before taking full control in 2004. In his notes in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Youth Cup-winning programme special last year, he detailed how <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are producing so much talent]</b> When discussing the trophy success we have achieved in the academy in recent seasons, I will always say it is a wider effort from everybody involved. There is a particular focus around scouting and coaching, and the coaches won’t succeed if the talent is not of the right level. That is why the likes of Jim Fraser, Darren Grace and their recruitment team deserve credit for bringing in such talented players from a very young age. That is a huge part of our development programme. On the other hand, you need the right coaches. Fundamentally, it is about having good staff in all areas who work as a team</p>
