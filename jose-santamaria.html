  <p><b>[Jose Emilio Santamaria on Di Stefano]</b> I don’t see similarities between <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and Di Stefano. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> has ability in certain areas of the pitch. Alfredo could do it anywhere. I’ve watched football since 1935 and I can assure you that he is the most complete player of all time. He defended, attacked, he counter-attacked. He could strike a ball with his left foot, his right foot, he could head the ball, win it back too - very complete</p>
