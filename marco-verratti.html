  <p><b>[Marco Verratti has stressed that he doesn’t care who he plays alongside in Italy’s midfield]</b> It’s not about making experiments, the coach makes his choices and he decides who should play. I don’t care about who’s playing alongside me, I’ll try to do my best and then the coach will make his evaluations.<br /><br />I don’t care about just getting two points, we want to win games. Now we’ll focus on our clubs, then when we’re back we’ll try to win the two remaining games as winning helps winning. Even if winning won’t be essential, for us it’s very important. The important thing is that we won. Then we can’t deny we should improve. The three points against Malta and against Bulgaria paved the way for us to the top of the group, then we can work on improving our playing style. However, even other national teams are having difficult times nowadays playing against small teams, it is difficult as they are very organised. We are often criticised but we keep winning and it’s always difficult to beat us</p>

  <p><b>[Marco Verratti sues newspaper over nightclub allegations]</b> Mr Marco Verratti, professional footballer for Paris Saint-Germain and the Italian national team has taken note of a story in the newspaper L’Équipe from March 10, 2017.<br /><br />An article with no byline on page three of the newspaper ‘Matuidi and Verratti out before Barcelona’ affirmed: ‘On Monday night <b>[6 March, 2017]</b>, the Puma brand organised a soirée in a Parisian nightclub to launch the collection designed by the singer Rihanna. L’Équipe can reveal Blaise Matuidi and Marco Verratti were two of those invited to this private party. According to several witnesses, the two PSG players, flying out from Bourget with their teammates for Barcelona the next day, left the night club well after midnight<br /><br />This article is intended to call into question the professionalism of Marco Verratti, notably in perspective of the match on March 8 against FC Barcelona. Marco Verratti states in the strongest possible terms that the information contained in this article is totally false. This article is an absolute lie. Marco Verratti, as well as Blaise Matuidi, were never at that party. Marco Verratti was at home with his girlfriend and his son on the night of March 6, the day before the departure for Barcelona. With this statement, Marco Verratti intends to strongly denounce the information contained in that article<br /><br />These actions contravene the ethical rules and standards of the professional of a journalist, notably failing to verify your source before publication. The information published by the newspaper badly affected the image of Marco Verratti, as a player and as a family man. This information falsely claimed that Marco Verratti was living the high life before an important match.<br /><br />Marco Verratti wishes to make it known that he has instructed Mr Carlo Alberto Brusa, lawyer for the Cour d’Appel de Paris, to set in motion all legal recourse, both civil and criminal, and all useful actions to sanction such acts and attain reparations for the damage suffered as the result of the tarnishing of his image, both nationally and internationally</p>

When Unai Emery arrived, he did not know much about him. That’s why he could have left, but as soon as the coach got to know him as a player and a man, he understood that he had to stay.

  <p><b>[Marco Verratti explains why he want to move from <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>]</b> I’m honest, for the first time in five years I wondered if I should stay here. People think that I play for <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> for the money, but I could get that elsewhere, too. If I had moved in the summer, there were clubs ready to pay €100m to sign me and I would have earned a lot more<br /><br /><a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, he could have earned as much with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> or <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He didn’t sign here for the money but the project. It’s the same with me<br /><br /><b>[The 24-year-old Italy midfielder reiterates his frustration about the situation he found himself in, which led to him replacing agent Donato Di Campli with <a href="mino-raiola.html">Mino Raiola</a>]</b> It was really complicated. I didn’t expect a summer like that. A lot of things happened that I did not like, among them people from my side. They thought of themselves and not me. I never told PSG: ‘I want to leave’<br /><br />The only thing I did was explain to them some things I didn’t understand. We went through some complicated times last season. We didn’t live up to ourselves as a team that wants to win everything. We were asked to win everything and there were others a lot stronger than us<br /><br /><b>[While Verratti admitted that he had lost faith in the ambition of the club, the summer’s big spending was not what convinced him to stay]</b> I wasn’t sure if we were a team with very big ambitions. When new sporting director Antero Henrique arrived, the first thing I did was shorten my holidays to speak to him. As soon as we had our first talk, I told him: ‘It’s good, I’ll stay here’. I didn’t stay because <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> and <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> arrived - at that time I didn’t even know they were going to sign</p>

  <p><b>[Marco Verratti has denied reports that his agent Mino Raiola has sounded out Barcelona over a potential summer move]</b> I’ve read that Raiola has offered me to Barcelona. That’s a lie. I’ve spoken to my managers and they know what I think, things are clear. I’ve decided to stay with PSG.<br /><br />Real Madrid are a tough opponent but we were convinced we’d get by them. PSG aren’t far from them. Small things made the difference. We played well in the first leg but were two goals down. We were also without Neymar, which is like taking Lionel Messi away from Barcelona<br /><br /><b>[On Gian Piero Ventura]</b> Ventura had a very tactical vision. Maybe that’s okay with a club, but in the national team it’s more difficult to acquire a tactical understanding in a few days. Organisation is very important but a national team can’t do everything with tactics. I respect Ventura. He’s a bit like Zdenek Zeman, but if you put Zeman in a national team it would be hard to make everyone understand his ideas in such little time<br /><br />Perhaps we were already thinking of coming second since Spain were in our group. It was in the air the national team breathed. Then the playoffs are difficult. We have to look forward. It’s the players who are most responsible</p>

But anyway, I need to improve. I got it wrong against Real, but it was a red card out of frustration and sometimes referees could be more tolerant.<br /><br />I’ve spoken with my management and they know what I think, and it is all clear.

  <p><b>[Marco Verratti reveals weirdest moment with PSG fan]</b> There was a fan outside my window at 4am, and he was screaming a lot. At first I thought there was something serious happening. It was during my first year in Paris. When I went to my window, he was begging down on his knees to take a picture with me…at 4 am! It was a little bit strange.<br /><br />I meet people of 50/55 years old in the street who are asking to take pictures. And then I see tears in their eyes. When a person of that age reacts like that, you know that football is not only a game like everybody says. It is something that can change your life. For example, when I lose a game I can be sad for three weeks. It’s a game, yes, but a tough one<br /><br />People on the outside think that it is easy to win Ligue 1 but we work very hard to win it. Besides, it’s not that easy because last year we didn’t. We were not champions because there was a stronger team. When I’m with the club, my coach, my team mates, I know what I am worth. The only thing that is missing is to win an important trophy<br /><br />I had a complicated summer last year and it was hard for me. During pre-season I injured my knee, I couldn’t play any games. So when I played the Trophee des Champions, it was my first game of the season, with no real preparation after three months. I think that it was only a matter of injury, rhythm. When I started to play more, it was easier for me<br /><br />We know how difficult it is to win Ligue 1, a League Cup and a French Cup. People might think it is easy for us because the club bought very good players. Us, as players, and our fans will remember this period when we win a lot all together. Of course we also want to win a European title, it’s a step of a ladder that we will climb, one day. This season, at any rate, has not been bad at all to me</p>

  <p><b>[Marco Verratti is not thinking about leaving Paris Saint-Germain]</b> I’m not thinking about changing. I don’t care what the press or a journalist says, whether it’s negative or positive. I play for a club, they trust me, and they always show me that. I’ve been there for seven years and I’ve never had a problem with the coach, especially in a team which can make big signings every year. Since Ibra <b>[Zlatan Ibrahimovic]</b> left I’ve been responsible for more things, I want to keep going and win something important. It’s been a difficult week. I messed up <b>[having been caught drink-driving]</b>, and you can’t do these things when you represent a big club. I apologised and we’ll look forward.<br /><br />It’s always like this, when I play well I’m worthy of the Azzurri, when I play less well there are criticisms. At a club you can show what you can do every day, here it’s a bit different. With Italy you live it a month or a month-and-a-half at a time, so it’s difficult. Everyone expects a lot from me, but that just means they consider me an important player. My job is to give everything in the middle of the park</p>

I know that my agent <b>[Mino Raiola]</b> and the club talk to each other sometimes. But we did not sign anything. I still have many years to go on my contract. I have no problem signing a new contract here. I’m 27 soon, if I sign another contract it will be for four or five years. I can finish my career here, if the club wants it. Whatever happens, I will always remain grateful to PSG.<br /><br />I grew up here with Thiago Silva, with whom I get on very well. As with Marquinhos, Kylian Mbappe, Neymar. I feel good with everyone. The friends I see outside are Ney, Kylian and <b>[Gianluigi]</b> Buffon. Apart from the talent God has given Mbappe, he is a very professional boy, he always plays with the desire to score whether in training or in a match. He listens a lot. He already has, I think, everything needed in football. He knows how to stay focused, how to get into the game. Players like him, there will be others, but his mentality will make the difference. I really like Kylian and wish him a wonderful career. He deserves it as a player and as a person<br /><br />I have known a lot of coaches, but Tuchel gets to get into the players’ heads quickly. You want to listen to him. And give 100% because he gives himself thoroughly. This is the case for those who play or not this season. That’s the positive energy that Tuchel brought to PSG. We train with a smile, but always thoroughly and working on things for the game. These are things that make you approach games with serenity and confidence. That’s one of the things we’ve changed</p>
