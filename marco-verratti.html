  <p><b>[Marco Verratti explains why he want to move from PSG]</b> I’m honest, for the first time in five years I wondered if I should stay here. People think that I play for <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> for the money, but I could get that elsewhere, too. If I had moved in the summer, there were clubs ready to pay €100m to sign me and I would have earned a lot more<br /><br /><a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, he could have earned as much with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> or <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.

It’s the same with me<br /><br /><b>[The 24-year-old Italy midfielder reiterates his frustration about the situation he found himself in, which led to him replacing agent Donato Di Campli with Mino Raiola]</b> It was really complicated. I didn’t expect a summer like that. A lot of things happened that I did not like, among them people from my side. They thought of themselves and not me. I never told PSG: ‘I want to leave’<br /><br />The only thing I did was explain to them some things I didn’t understand. We went through some complicated times last season. We didn’t live up to ourselves as a team that wants to win everything. We were asked to win everything and there were others a lot stronger than us<br /><br /><b>[While Verratti admitted that he had lost faith in the ambition of the club, the summer’s big spending was not what convinced him to stay]</b> I wasn’t sure if we were a team with very big ambitions. When new sporting director Antero Henrique arrived, the first thing I did was shorten my holidays to speak to him. As soon as we had our first talk, I told him: ‘It’s good, I’ll stay here’. I didn’t stay because <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> and <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> arrived - at that time I didn’t even know they were going to sign</p>

As soon as he played, we only talked about him because he is an incredible player who excites everyone. I think for him it’s good if things are clear, if he stays or if he leaves.

We are not going to say that we will win the Champions League when it hasn’t even started, but we want to go as far as possible.
