  <p><b>[Greg Dyke​, ​​chairman of <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> on Sir Tom Finney]</b> He was one of English football’s all-time greats and will be much missed across the game. Sir Tom was a true one-club man at Preston North End and a fantastic player for England. He will rightly be forever remembered at Deepdale and Wembley</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> defender Gerry Byrne dies, aged 77]</b> I can still remember the way he helped <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> win the 1965 FA Cup despite suffering a broken collarbone early in the game. His determination to play on rather than leave his team down a man was remarkable. Of course, he went on to be involved with the 1966 World Cup squad underlining just how talented a player he was. My sincere condolences go to his family and friends</p>

  <p><b>[Former England coach <a href="don-howe.html">Don Howe</a> passes away at 80]</b> It is terribly sad news and our thoughts are with Don’s family at this time. He is widely regarded as being in the vanguard of coaching in England, and I know that his loss will be keenly felt amongst the coaching fraternity in particular and not least by <b>[England manager]</b> <a href="roy-hodgson.html">Roy Hodgson</a>, who was close to Don. He was a fine player - named as one of West Bromwich Albion’s finest - and, of course, he went on to play an integral part in <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s history as a coach and later as manager. For his country, he not only appeared in a World Cup, but he was instrumental in both <a href="bobby-robson.html">Sir Bobby Robson</a>’s management team for Italia ‘90 and Euro ‘96 where he assisted Terry Venables</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Is the Home Grown Player rule likely to change?]</b> First, we want to raise the existing requirements on homegrown players in Premier League squads, so that by 2020 12 of a 25-man squad will be homegrown, rather than the eight it is today, with at least two players having come through the academy of the club they play for. Second, we think we should close the loophole in the existing definition, so that in the future homegrown means homegrown. Players will have to have played three seasons with English clubs under the age of 18, rather than the current 21.<br /><br />Cesc Fabregas is an outstanding player who is an asset to English football, but he is clearly a proud graduate of the Barcelona academy and should never have qualified as homegrown, which he did by joining Arsenal at the age of 16. With these changes and a little bit of luck, we can fulfil my public ambition for England to win the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. But we will only have a chance of success if we fix the pipeline problem.</p>
