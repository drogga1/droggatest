  <p><b>[Greg Dyke​, ​​chairman of <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> on Sir Tom Finney]</b> He was one of English football’s all-time greats and will be much missed across the game. Sir Tom was a true one-club man at Preston North End and a fantastic player for England. He will rightly be forever remembered at Deepdale and Wembley</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> defender Gerry Byrne dies, aged 77]</b> I can still remember the way he helped <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> win the 1965 FA Cup despite suffering a broken collarbone early in the game. His determination to play on rather than leave his team down a man was remarkable. Of course, he went on to be involved with the 1966 World Cup squad underlining just how talented a player he was. My sincere condolences go to his family and friends</p>

  <p><b>[Former England coach <a href="don-howe.html">Don Howe</a> passes away at 80]</b> It is terribly sad news and our thoughts are with Don’s family at this time. He is widely regarded as being in the vanguard of coaching in England, and I know that his loss will be keenly felt amongst the coaching fraternity in particular and not least by <b>[England manager]</b> <a href="roy-hodgson.html">Roy Hodgson</a>, who was close to Don. He was a fine player - named as one of West Bromwich Albion’s finest - and, of course, he went on to play an integral part in Arsenal’s history as a coach and later as manager. For his country, he not only appeared in a World Cup, but he was instrumental in both Sir Bobby Robson’s management team for Italia ‘90 and Euro ‘96 where he assisted Terry Venables</p>
