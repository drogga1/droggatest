  <p><b>[Greg Dyke​, ​​chairman of <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> on Sir Tom Finney]</b> He was one of English football’s all-time greats and will be much missed across the game. Sir Tom was a true one-club man at Preston North End and a fantastic player for England. He will rightly be forever remembered at Deepdale and Wembley</p>

  <p><b>[Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has written to Fifa’s ExCo members urging them to insist on the release of Michael Garcia’s report]</b> As you probably know the reputation of Fifa was already low in England and much of Europe before the events of last week. The failure to publish Mr Garcia’s report and his statement that the summary report which was published contained ‘numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations’ has resulted in a further decline in public confidence of Fifa. We cannot go on like this. Complete transparency is required if the actions of all those who bid, including England 2018, are to be judged fairly.<br /><br />I know some of you believe that Fifa’s reputation in England is the result of an obsession amongst the English media with Fifa and I know Mr <b>[Sepp]</b> Blatter sees their reports as an unfair attack on the organisation he leads. However, in England we see it differently. If you read a whole range of English newspaper reports about Fifa, particularly those in the Sunday Times, they do provide compelling evidence of wrong doing. They cannot be simply dismissed as ‘racist’ or ‘an attack on Fifa’ as Mr Blatter described them at the Fifa Congress in Brazil. Urgent action is needed if confidence in Fifa is to be rebuilt in England. The FA is of the view that this action should start with the full publication of Mr Garcia’s report.</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> defender Gerry Byrne dies, aged 77]</b> I can still remember the way he helped <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> win the 1965 FA Cup despite suffering a broken collarbone early in the game. His determination to play on rather than leave his team down a man was remarkable. Of course, he went on to be involved with the 1966 World Cup squad underlining just how talented a player he was. My sincere condolences go to his family and friends</p>

  <p><b>[Former England coach <a href="don-howe.html">Don Howe</a> passes away at 80]</b> It is terribly sad news and our thoughts are with Don’s family at this time. He is widely regarded as being in the vanguard of coaching in England, and I know that his loss will be keenly felt amongst the coaching fraternity in particular and not least by <b>[England manager]</b> <a href="roy-hodgson.html">Roy Hodgson</a>, who was close to Don. He was a fine player - named as one of West Bromwich Albion’s finest - and, of course, he went on to play an integral part in <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s history as a coach and later as manager. For his country, he not only appeared in a World Cup, but he was instrumental in both <a href="bobby-robson.html">Sir Bobby Robson</a>’s management team for Italia ‘90 and Euro ‘96 where he assisted Terry Venables</p>

  <p><b>[Brexit will not create a better England team that can win major tournaments]</b> One of my concerns in my period as chairman has been the decline in the opportunities for kids at the bigger clubs to get through and into the first team - very few make it. If anything happens that gives them better chances, then I welcome it. I think the clubs will clearly want to keep a totally free market. Whether that is possible we won’t know for probably two years.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Is the Home Grown Player rule likely to change?]</b> First, we want to raise the existing requirements on homegrown players in Premier League squads, so that by 2020 12 of a 25-man squad will be homegrown, rather than the eight it is today, with at least two players having come through the academy of the club they play for. Second, we think we should close the loophole in the existing definition, so that in the future homegrown means homegrown. Players will have to have played three seasons with English clubs under the age of 18, rather than the current 21.<br /><br />Cesc Fabregas is an outstanding player who is an asset to English football, but he is clearly a proud graduate of the Barcelona academy and should never have qualified as homegrown, which he did by joining Arsenal at the age of 16. With these changes and a little bit of luck, we can fulfil my public ambition for England to win the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. But we will only have a chance of success if we fix the pipeline problem.</p>
