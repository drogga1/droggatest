<blockquote>
  <p>[The returning Josh Brillante says Sydney FC are expecting a similar result against Adelaide United] We’re expecting a great result again … I don’t see why anything is going to change. We’ll go out there with the same attitude we always do. We’ve had the preparation, we’re going out there with the winning mentality and hopefully we can get another four [goals] again<br /><br />Even since day one when I arrived in pre-season, just on the training park leading into the games, the way everyone has gelled together and wants to play for each other and backs everyone up is amazing. I’ve never really had that before. The feeling you get when you’re out there is fantastic. The team that we have, the set-up here and the way we play, [staying undefeated] is definitely something we knew we could do and we’ve been doing it so far and we’re not going to stop. To have that kind of confidence among the team is a big help [going forward] but I don’t think we really need that. With the depth we have in the squad and the way we play, it just happens naturally</p>
