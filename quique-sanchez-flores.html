We have to make an amazing effort if we want to make the level. We have to be positive with our first hour. The match was finished in a 10-15 minute spell. I am really happy with the first half performance. We had chances and I felt we would get the first goal.<br /><br /><b>[Quique Sanchez Flores stopped short of saying <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are the best side <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> have faced so far this season]</b> There is not a lot of difference between <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, they both have amazing players</p>

He is always thinking about how he can take advantage in different situations, he is very good in set-pieces, he is always very hard in the work, very constant.

Little by little we are growing. We are getting more competitive but we need to win. Today we were close. We had opportunities in the match so it’s a pity we didn’t win. It was really good but a clean sheet would have been good. It is an amazing result. When you are so close to winning, it is disappointing. I believe it is a foul.

  <p><b>[Quique Sanchez Flores replaced <a href="javi-gracia.html">Javi Gracia</a> after a slow start to the season but was unable to rectify poor results]</b> It’s sad because if I can help the team I suffer, I suffer for the fans, I suffer for the players and I suffer for the owner of course. It’s the way I chose, I can’t do anything for that. I would regret if they came to my house and they said: ‘you can help us’ and I stay there. This is not me, it’s not my character. If I stay in my comfort zone it’s not me. I came here and I’m trying and fighting a lot, although the circumstances are bad for us</p>

  <p><b>[Sanchez Flores calls for patience with deadline day signing]</b> Mainly, the problem is how they train in China. It is not the same as in England. Is he really ready for first-team matches in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> because the physical difference is so big? He probably needs one month to recover the full rhythm. The good thing is he knows his body well, works hard on injury prevention and he is always working after training. I should say, also, that I felt in China, he gave exactly the same effort and quality as he gave me four years ago. We had the feeling in China that he could recover a high level with any team in Europe<br /><br />I have an amazing impression of the player. I fell in love with him. As a guy, he’s professional. He’s a straight arrow. As a person, his life is private. He has strong Christian values and he is respectful. As a player, it is difficult to explain <a href="odion-ighalo.html">Ighalo</a>. His first quality is he can protect the ball and he gives time to the team to get up the field and win the second ball. It’s so difficult to get the ball from him. He’s stronger than he looks. Four years ago, when we put ball in the space, he was also super fast. Now, with five years difference, he is a bit different … but he will always be fine in a physical battle. We played him up front in a two with <a href="troy-deeney.html">Troy Deeney</a> and they knew each other inside out but he is absolutely fine to play as a lone frontman, too. One of his most valuable qualities is that his team-mates very quickly learn his strengths and he adapts very well</p>
