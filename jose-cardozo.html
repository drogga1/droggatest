  <p>[Jose Cardozo replaces Matias Almeyda as Chivas manager] I’m here to write my own story with Chivas. For me, glory doesn’t have a price. That’s why I’m coming here. I’m here to write my own story in Guadalajara. Logically, the fans are annoyed with the way a winning coach who brought them titles is gone now. That’s normal. But I think we’re going to work with a lot of professionalism, a good relationship with the squad and I don’t have any doubt we’re going to play well</p>

  <p>[Chivas-Cardozo relationship off to rocky start after another home loss] We’re all annoyed, but we have to correct it. That’s my work, and the coaching staff’s, to try to get better, get stronger where we’re weak and try to be really smart to be able to correct things as quickly as possible because we’re already hurting. I don’t think this is the position the fans or we [coaches] wanted to be in, the squad either. So, you have to try and get up quickly because there’s no time now. There’s no time left for anyone. So, you have to really smart from the coaching staff’s perspective and also the players’ to try and correct the little mistakes we’re making.</p>

  <p>[Raul Gudino becomes newest Clasico Nacional hero with penalty save] I’m really happy with ‘Gudi’ because he’s been doing things well as a goalkeeper, but he wasn’t playing much in Europe. He didn’t have much rhythm. I’ve talked a lot with him, we’ve worked with him. He’s put in the work on his part to make it as a professional. He’s an excellent goalkeeper. He has an imposing physical presence that you really notice. I think that factored in a bit with Uribe on the penalty where the goalkeeper is really imposing in the goal</p>

  <p>[Chivas overhaul comes too late for Club World Cup success] Tomorrow the moment of truth arrives. We have to show we have all the skill we have, that football is played well in Mexico and show the world that Chivas can do it.<br /><br />The first half we came in and generated an early goal. From there, we controlled the game. In the second half, it looked to me like we came in with a lack of concentration. I don’t know why. We lost the mark on the first goal they scored there and from there we went into a disorganized state that caused us to lose the game. We had to be calm, we’ve talked about that a lot and worked on it a lot, but we lost our heads. I don’t know why because we were in the game. 1-1 isn’t a bad scoreline, they did the same thing to us that we did to them with an early goal<br /><br />We’re really confident in the players we have. We know that we have the very big responsibility to be able to compete on the international level and I think Chivas and the squad we have is at the needed level. The squad is motivated, they’re hopeful that we can have a good match. We need to look to do what we know how to do, which is to play football</p>
