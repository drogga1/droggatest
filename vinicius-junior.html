  <p><b>[Vinicius Junior opted to join Real Madrid instead of Barcelona because he preferred their project more. Frederico Pena said]</b> Barcelona offered more money than Madrid, the player would’ve earned more. But we arrived at an agreement with Madrid because the player preferred their project more. Some people believe that he chose Madrid for money, but they are wrong. Vinicius only concentrated on the sporting aspect and Real Madrid’s position in the negotiations was better in that regard.<br /><br /><b>[The success of current Madrid stars who signed for the club at a young age also helped persuade him]</b> Raphael Varane, Sergio Ramos, Casemiro, Marco Asensio, Marcelo all arrived before the age of 22 and they’re all very important players in the first team now. Barcelona sign players who already know the team plays, except in Neymar’s case, so it is more difficult as can be seen with Arda.<br /><br />Madrid can sign players like Mbappe. We’ve got to see the player’s development this year and what Madrid will need next summer. Then we’ll know when he goes there. Vinicius will go to Madrid with his whole family. Such a young lad will need to be surrounded by his own</p>

I have more contact with him nowadays and, when I watch him play, I try to take things to improve myself. I do not want to be another Neymar, I want to build my own career and spread happiness for everyone from Brazil.<br /><br />Everyone in the youth team dreams about that and it’s no different for me. The dream is to win the Copa Libertadores and the Brazilian league title, to have at least one big day with Flamengo. Flamengo was the club that helped me when I needed it. I have been here since I was 10-years-old. When I step out onto the pitch, I always remember my first day at Flamengo and everyone who helped me. <b>[Youth team director]</b> Norval helped me a lot, and the structure I was provided by Flamengo turned me from the worst to the best</p>

I would definitely be in favour of him moving to Madrid because it would be my big dream to play in the same side as Neymar. He is my idol in football. If had a chance to play with him, I would feel very happy.<br /><br /><b>[On Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> Every day, I say thank you for being blessed with the gift of playing football. The dream of any player is to have the gift but very few have. I have been given this gift and my desire to improve is even stronger. In this respect, Cristiano Ronaldo is my inspiration. I admire what he has been doing for the last 10 years, playing at such a high level. It is not just talent and quality but hard work too. I hope to be able to tell him that one day. I know I am still no one and I have done nothing so far. I want to become one of the best players in football and win a World Cup. I want to reach my goals and make my family proud</p>

  <p><b>[Vinicius Junior has revealed that he spoke with Neymar about Barcelona before heeding the advice of fellow Brazilians Marcelo and Casemiro to join Real Madrid]</b> Marcelo and Casemiro helped me a lot in the decision. My family too. They visited all the clubs and ended up opting for Real Madrid. I had to think very fast and I think I made the right choice. At Madrid, there are Brazilians who will be able to help me on and off the pitch. Also, playing with Cristiano Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos… I have no words to explain what that means to me. Being next to the best is something that I always dreamed of, that’s why I chose Real Madrid.<br /><br /><b>[On Neymar]</b> Yes. He always called me, but I was thinking about what would be best for me and for my career. I had to go to the club where I could evolve more and improve technically<br /><br />Casemiro always sends me messages to congratulate me and tell me that I’m on the right track. He tells me to continue how I am, that when I arrive I will adapt quickly and I will give them plenty to celebrate. And Marcelo always says that I have to maintain my positive football that I have and my ability. I’m a big fan of him and I’d like to have a bit of his skill, because that way I’ll become an excellent player</p>

It was my dream as a child, but right now I’m focused on these games with Brazil. I can talk to Brazilians and share my experiences with them. Everything will come in time.

  <p><b>[Vinicius rubbishes <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> links after <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> defeat]</b> There’s no choice, I want to stay at Madrid<br /><br />I would like to ask to the fans to keep this way up, we are going to fight until the end of the season in order to win <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> and Champions League too. We were not in good shape, and Sociedad plays football really well, they’re well-placed in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>. It was a difficult match. The only Copa one played at home, and we lost. It is hard to lose at home. We were unbeaten at home and we got beaten on the single match we can’t afford to lose. But on the other hand, we keep fighting until the end, fighting to keep in good shape looking forward the end of this season</p>

  <p><b>[Vinicius Junior says <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> makes jokes]</b> Yes, he is close to the Brazilians, he likes how we play, he makes jokes like us, like <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> who is always joking.

But when he learns, our relationship will be even better<br /><br /><b>[Vinicius made his senior debut last September in a friendly against Peru]</b> I hope to be in the next squad.

  <p><b>[Vinicius takes Sterling inspiration as he aims to emulate <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> attacker]</b> When I played in the youth categories, I was used to scoring a lot of goals, but in professional football I’m playing further from the goal and it’s harder to score. But I am only 19 years old, I’m getting better. Karim <b>[<a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a>]</b> and all the players who are always scoring try to help. When I start to score, I’ll score a lot of goals, just like every winger here.<br /><br />Sterling for me is an example. At my age, he played just like me and didn’t score too many goals, and this season he has already scored a lot. Last season, he scored even more. I’m improving a little bit. I’d never played on the right side, but here I had to. And it gets hard for me because all my moves on the left side are natural, I know everything that I should do. But on the right, I have to think more. On the left side, I do everything without thinking<br /><br /><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> come together for their Champions League round of 16 encounter]</b> It will be a great game.

It will be tough, because City are a team that play football really well, they know the game. <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> knows the game.

  <p><b>[Vinicius had three days to decide between <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> &amp; <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> before €46m move]</b> It was right after I came back from the 2017 South American Under-17 Championship in Chile. There were already rumours in the press, but I never believed them. Eventually it happened: both <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> put offers on the table and I had only three days to make my decision. I always wanted to play for the greatest club, so that’s why I chose Real. My parents visited both clubs and liked them more. It matched with what I already wanted, and I felt their project was better for me. They give a lot of minutes to the younger players, like me, and were going through an outstanding period of success in the Champions League back then<br /><br />It was one of the toughest parts, more so than playing consistently. I had to make everyone forget about the price tag. Fortunately, I played a lot of games in my first season. Now I have surpassed 50 matches for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> - few players achieve that at such a young age</p>

  <p><b>[Vinicius Junior said <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> want to win <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> as a way to give back to the club’s fans following the coronavirus pandemic]</b> I’ve watched the games again and I think so. I think we were better than them in more aspects. We’ve had very good games until now and we have to recover our best form. We’re really hungry to come back, to win, and we want to win this league title for our fans. People have suffered a lot and we want to give <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> fans something to cheer about in this situation.

The result of the first leg <b>[against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> was bad, but we’re <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>.
