  <p><b>[Vinicius Junior says it would a be ‘a dream’ if Real Madrid could lure Paris Saint-Germain pair Neymar and Kylian Mbappe to Santiago Bernabeu this summer]</b> Of course he <b>[Neymar]</b> could join Real Madrid but, at the moment, I do not know what he will do. Of course, he could be in Madrid or PSG I do not know, but it’d still better <b>[if he were at]</b> Real Madrid. I want to play with Neymar, for sure, and also with Kylian Mbappe, and all the Madrid fans dream of having him here, and I know it because I’m there. It’s not only Madrid fans because the fans of all teams in the world would like to see Mbappe play under their colours.</p>

  <p><b>[Vinicius Junior claims to have felt no pressure of replacing Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid]</b> Cristiano is Cristiano, he’s a club legend. He did what no one has ever done. But I’ve never felt as though I am replacing him. I want to play and help Madrid<br /><br /><b>[He believes he has made the right choice in linking up with the Blancos while still in his teens]</b> In my case, I think it was the right time. I was playing well for Flamengo but I also had the margin to improve. I evolved more in three months in Madrid there than I would have in a year back home. It was good for me to start and then play in the best club in the world<br /><br /><b>[He added on his experience to date]</b> Training is different. Most of the training sessions there are better than the actual games. And in training, no one wants to lose, all of the players want to improve every day. There are players like Sergio Ramos and Benzema who, even though they’re over 30, train harder than everyone else. The inspiration you get from being next to the best players also helps, that makes you grow</p>

Zidane is a big idol for everyone, he was a legend as a player and now he is a legend as a manager. I was nervous when he entered the locker-room the first time after his return. We are confident and ready to play a better season than the last one. We should not overrate the results in the pre-season<br /><br /><b>[He said of his return to fitness]</b> I have to find the rhythm. Mentally, I feel even better than last season, I enjoy being here and playing with joy, that’s the most important thing. <br /><br />I had many offers before I joined Real Madrid, including from Germany, but it has always been clear to me that if there’s a chance to go to Madrid then I’m going to Madrid. Joining Real Madrid was the best thing that could have happened to me<br /><br /><b>[Despite not having played together for long, the youngster has formed a fruitful relationship with team-mate Karim Benzema during his brief spell in the Spanish capital]</b> He gives me a lot of advice on how to behave on the pitch. He is a great player, but also a great person. He is a friend, like every other teammate</p>
