  <p><b>[That positional switch, and <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>’s memory, led to Vermaelen being watched carefully by <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. Vermaelen, struggling for his best form, was surprised]</b> I knew they were there… I heard about it, but I was not playing well. A lot of people told me about that fight, too, and it was in his mind. It was terrible, there was only two weeks in between - I just don’t know why they came back to watch!<br /><br /><b>[When Rowley turned up at a Belgian national team training session prior to an end-of-season trip to Japan, Vermaelen was confused]</b> A lot of players from Anderlecht and Standard Liege had pulled out. There were only six of us on a bad pitch!</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, Suarez, and <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>]</b> They are the three best in the world. Together they are incredible. The goals they score, the way they play. What they do on the pitch they do in training as well. For us it’s amazing. If you play against the best, you will only get better. You have to improve. We’re lucky we can see them every day in training; what they do is special. We’re lucky we can see it. You have to wait until it’s on the TV, but we can see it every day</p>

  <p><b>[Thomas Vermaelen speaks about a common misperception about <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a> defenders]</b> People have a bit of a wrong view of defenders in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> because they think: ‘Ah it’s an easy job, they only attack, attack, attack’ but the demands are very high. Playing in the other team’s half doesn’t just happen by itself. It’s because we keep them under constant pressure</p>

  <p><b>[Vermaelen looking to end injury-hit career on a high with Kobe &amp; Belgium]</b> I feel very good about the country; the adaptation has gone very well. All the people are very helpful, so I think it is easy to adapt to the club and the life here. I know a few players, so that makes it easier too.  When Andreas came here I said, ‘That’s a very nice move, going to Japan where there’s a lot of culture. It’s a nice country.’  For me, that was a big part of my decision too. There is a big tradition here, a lot of culture<br /><br /><b>[injuries limited his game time before his move to Japan earlier this year]</b> It’s true that I had some problems in the past. How do you face it? You just get on with it and try to overcome every problem because I knew that when I was fit, I could still play. I still felt good when I didn’t have any problems, so that’s the reason I kept going to overcome these problems<br /><br />‘m very happy that I could play with one of the best there’s ever been. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> made me a better player. It was an unbelievable experience. He eventually becomes one of your team-mates, but at the beginning he’s a big star. During my years there, sometimes I was still surprised by some things he did in training and in games. It was just a nice experience to see these things; what he can do with the ball<br /><br /><b>[He has spent most of his time immersing himself in football and getting to know his new team-mates]</b> Kobe is a nice city but my family is not here yet. It’s not like I’ve been visiting so many places. Firstly, it’s been about adapting to the team and then I will explore more outside. The club has helped very well and it’s been very easy to adapt outside football. That’s very important for your mind because you can focus and concentrate on your job. It’s made it easier for me to adapt and that’s made easy for me to play my football<br /><br />The J-League is a good league and a very attractive league. The teams want to play with ideas and there are good players, technical and quick players. The level is good in Japan. Of course, there are always things you can improve but I’m quite surprised how good the league is and quite positive<br /><br /><b>[It may be five years now since he ended his stay with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">the Gunners</a>]</b> He <b>[<a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>]</b> choose me to be captain because of the player and person I am. I didn’t do anything special. I just stayed who I was in the dressing room and on the pitch.  I can understand why he was seen as a father figure because in my time and even before, he tended to bring very young, talented players - sometimes unknown players - and gave them the chance.  He gave them an opportunity to play for a big club and made them grow. He had a very good eye for talent he always had a confidence in young players.  For a lot of players and for me personally, he was very important because he gave me a chance to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> on a big platform<br /><br /><b>[Belgium, currently the top-ranked national side in world football, won their qualifying group]</b> At my age, it’s very important to go to the Euros. I’m very excited to go there. The team is doing so well. We have been together for a long time and we know each other very well.  We are ranked No.1 in the world, it makes you proud to be in that that team</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="robin-van-persie.html">Robin van Persie</a>’s move to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in 2012 came as a massive disappointment to Thomas Vermaelen]</b> It was a surprise <a href="robin-van-persie.html">Robin van Persie</a> left. I knew he was going to go eventually but to hear that he’d all of a sudden left for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> was a big surprise. I wanted him to stay at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> of course, because in his last season with us he was the <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> Player of the Year. He had a great season, the best season of his career, so I wanted him to stay and be a legend. Of course, he’s strong in his character so he couldn’t change his mind. I think that’s a good thing because that makes him the person and player he is. You couldn’t change his mind, he’d made it up that he was going to go.</p>
