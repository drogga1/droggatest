  <p>[Spain defender Inigo Martinez has admitted that he is feeling the pressure since taking over the No.6 shirt from Andres Iniesta] It does. For sure. Whether you want it or not, [Iniesta] has been here for many years. He has showed a level and has achieved things that few have achieved. I had the option to take the No.6 or other numbers, but I liked the six. I knew it weighed a lot, because Andres will always be in our memory. But I take it with desire.<br /><br />Gerard has always given everything for the national team. He has never failed, [is] always available, he never rocked the boat. Pique is Pique. He was here for many years at a great level. He has decided to retire, and now good players are coming. It’s up to us now to show up, and that’s why we have come<br /><br />[On Sergio Ramos] He is a leader here. He has a personality that few have. He does it well, and not just now. But over the years, with an armband or not, he has always been a leader in the dressing room</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Julen Lopetegui has been backed to be a success at Real Madrid despite losing Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus] We all know what Cristiano has given Real Madrid. All of those goals over the years will be difficult to match by a single player, but we are watching a different Madrid and there are the results. They are doing well. I was with Lopetegui in the national team and he’s a great coach. Surely they will be fine. But we always give it all against Real Madrid in San Mames. It is our party. We all want to win.<br /><br />[Confirmation of Julen Lopetegui dismissal came a day before the start of the summer World Cup] Not only for me, but for many people - I think it caught us a little unsuspecting. It was a blow. They had been training with Julen for some time, getting used to the idea of how to play, their style - to decide to leave a few days before the World Cup is not easy for the players, obviously. Many things change. It was a shame, because I think that with Julen, who had been training these players for a long time, it would have been good. And starting that way, whether you want it or not, influences. Even if you try to fix all of that, there is always something that affects you. I think that’s what happened<br /><br />[Asked what Lopetegui offers his Real squad] Julen leads the group well, and that’s very important. Especially in those teams where it is so difficult to deal with the squad. Julen does it well, has a great team, they are all committed and it will be difficult to beat them. We have to do our thing. Julen knows us, and will do everything possible to win us. But we will try to harm them as well as we can. They attack a lot and maybe they could suffer with the counter-attacks</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[How Kepa Arrizabalaga rose from the Spanish third division to chase down De Gea] He’s a great goalkeeper. He attended the World Cup while being so young. Chelsea signed him for €80m, nobody pays that amount just for the sake of it, but because he is worth it. He is proving it, in fact. He is playing, performing well, winning games. He has personality, he is a great goalkeeper who performs well with his hands and his feet. Maybe [David] De Gea is ahead of him for Spain now, but we have three great goalkeepers and if one decreases his level, the other will soon take his place. Here not only the goalkeepers, but we all have to give 100 per cent because we all want to be a starter.</p>
