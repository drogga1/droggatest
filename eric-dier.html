  <p><b>[Tottenham and England midfielder Eric Dier believes his early performances this season have disappointed as a result of his efforts at Euro 2016]</b> It is completely up to the manager where I play. What is more important is making sure I’m feeling good mentally. That is more important to me. If I get back to that, where I have a good feeling and my confidence is back, then whatever position I am playing in, I will be able to play. I feel that I am getting it back - last weekend and against CSKA. I am just trying to get everything back to the levels of last season. It has been a difficult start for me this season - it has been there for everyone to see.<br /><br />It has been tough coming back late from the Euros because I haven’t really been able to get going. Then I got injured a couple of games into the season and that halted me again. And when Toby got injured I played at the back again. This is football and these things happen to everyone. It has not been a ­catastrophe - it has just been a bit of a low start. I don’t think there has ever been a really low point. It is just about getting back to where I want to be</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Dier has outlined Tottenham’s aims for the rest of the season]</b> It is very tight, it is going to be a fight until the very end. There are lots of very good sides, including us, fighting for it. We are going to keep focusing on improving and hopefully we will be in the top four.<br /><br />I think we still need to improve in all areas. We have never not said that. We still have a long way to go and we need to keep improving and working hard. There is lots of stuff we can still improve on. We can’t just talk about it, we need to do it</p>

  <p><b>[Why Dele Alli must emulate Bale’s rise to supremacy]</b> I think he’s at the perfect place for that because he’s got a support system around him and a manager and a group of players that will take care of him. You have to worry about young players sometimes in certain places if they can cope with it and will they be looked after as a 20-year-old boy and not just an asset.</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham midfielder Eric Dier has revealed he was forced to explain his actions after being spotted chatting to Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho last season]</b> We were talking for a very long time. And all of that week, really, we were in constant dialogue. It was a difficult week for me. The manager’s point of view was <b>[the friendliness with Mourinho]</b> was disrespectful to him. <b>[The dialogue]</b> was more him getting that message across than me getting my message across.<br /><br /><b>[Dier grew up in Portugal and played for Sporting before being signed by Tottenham in 2014]</b> I grew up in Portugal. Portuguese people are very proud and it’s a small country. It doesn’t have the economic power of a country such as England, so people like Mourinho, Ronaldo, they’re extremely proud of it. Growing up there I was within all that, you know? I didn’t want to be disrespectful to anyone. I completely understand where the manager was coming from but I believe I was stuck in the middle of something I couldn’t really affect</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham’s Eric Dier is confident the early gulf opened up by Premier League leaders Manchester City is not insurmountable]</b> I believe what we are doing is right, that has been the case for a long time. Win, lose, or draw against Real Madrid, that would have been the same. Winning that game has obviously given us confidence as individuals and as a group. You’ve got to keep trying to improve and push the boundaries. That’s the same for club and country; you’ve got to keep trying to improve. That’s the key.<br /><br />The games we have had in the last month have been really good and the results have been very positive. Obviously, Manchester City have been fantastic recently but there is so much football to be played before the end. I’m sure there are going to be a lot of twists and turns before the end.<br /><br />Playing for your country is the pinnacle of football. It is what you all want to do and it has to be special. I think that it’s essential, you cannot just think you will be in every squad because you have done ‘X and X’ in preview years, it has to be constant<br /><br /><b>[Three Lions mainstay Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was dropped after a series indifferent performances for Liverpool]</b> You always have to be on your toes to get the call-up otherwise you can become complacent and I don’t think that is a good thing</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Dier insists the possible presence of Alexis Sanchez in Manchester United’s midweek side will not change Tottenham’s plans]</b> The game as a whole won’t change because of one player. <b>[Sanchez playing]</b> doesn’t make a difference to me as a player. I’ve played against him many times and we all know the quality he has. But he’s going to add to a Man United squad that is already full of quality. It’s going to be a great game, a difficult game, but I don’t think one player changes a football match. Every game is really important now. It really doesn’t matter. The Newport game is just as important as <b>[United and Sunday’s trip to Liverpool]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[Champions League wins against Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid are behind Tottenham Hotspur’s fine Wembley form]</b> We took our time but I think we’ve really made it our home. The fans have made it their home and that’s the feeling we have at the moment here and the support is fantastic. Madrid at home and Dortmund, in those two Champions League games the atmosphere was fantastic. The fans and the players have to work off each other and that’s what we did in those two games and from then forward we’ve been really strong.<br /><br />We learned a lot from last year in the Champions League. We were very disappointed but that was our first experience. It was difficult last season but we learned a lot about it. We proved that this season with the way we’ve played in the Champions League and hopefully we can continue that on Tuesday<br /><br />You need a competitive environment like that. I think that’s what we’re trying to build. You look at all the top teams, they all have big squads. It makes it difficult for the manager and that’s what the players have got to do. They have got to make it difficult for the manger to choose an 11, an 18, and who’s left out<br /><br /><b>[Spurs recruited Brazilian winger Lucas Moura]</b> We’ve just constantly added to the squad since I’ve arrived. It’s getting stronger and stronger and that’s what we need. We need competition for places, we need players pushing each other and everyone needs to be at their best<br /><br />That’s what you need. When you’re with the same manager for a long period of time - this is our fourth year together and the core group of players is the same - we’ve been working for four years on lots of different things. They’ve all come together and that gives us opportunities to adapt to many different systems. Over those four years we’ve learned all of them<br /><br />It’s fantastic. We’re really happy. Obviously the results have been really good, we’ve got seven points, but not just that. I think the performances have been really good in every single game. The beginning of the Liverpool game was a bit frustrating but from then on to play the way we did, to control the game at Anfield, was really positive. And to win again here was massive. We’ve got another big game on Tuesday and we need to get ready for that</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Dier has no regrets at having chosen Tottenham over Manchester United]</b> I can only speak for my own case. I can’t speak for anyone else. What happened with me a year-and-a-half ago, it’s one case. Every case is different and I can only speak about my case. There is a great spirit here, we get on very well on the field and off the field. I think there is fantastic chemistry. I think after the manager’s <b>[Mauricio Pochettino]</b> first season here, it started really in the second season. I felt like the manager had the team that he wanted and we could feel. It was a 50/50 call. The manager has created that and the players have created it as well between themselves.<br /><br />I think it helped a lot there were a lot of young players going through the same thing at the same time. Myself, Harry <b>[Kane]</b>, Dele <b>[Alli]</b>, Ben Davies, it was really the time that Danny Rose came through. Lots of people grew together at the same time so we were all in a great place in our careers and everyone was enjoying themselves and that has carried on now. There are great friendships and everyone likes each other which is a good thing. We are looking forward to next season together. Everyone is excited. Obviously, it is a massive step for the club to move into a new stadium. It is a huge project so it is a huge step for the club in the right direction. I can’t speak for others, every player is different and every player has to look after themselves at the end of the day so I can’t say what each person wants. All I can speak for is myself and I think there is a fantastic group here, fantastic manager, fantastic set-up, fantastic project with the new stadium so it is a very exciting time for the club. So I think everyone is looking forward to that.</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Dier is confident England have the right mentality to stay focused at the World Cup]</b> He is a fantastic player and it is a very good team. Croatia have a lot of fantastic players. We are very happy that we won it, but there’s a big prize ahead after every game and this one was no different, so we have to focus on the next game. We focus again, we can’t lose that. That’s been the mentality until now, just to go one game at a time and hopefully that can continue. It means everything to create our own history. We keep doing that game after game. We keep going and aim to try and get as far as we can. I think that we have developed very well, but we have shown a good level from the beginning. We showed a good attitude with commitment and fight from the beginning. Obviously, a team’s quality can always improve and we will try to keep improving. I think we believe that we can improve a lot, but we will try to do that. I think we have had the right attitude and mentality and willingness to fight from the beginning.<br /><br /><b>[Dier has invited more fans to join the travelling support of the Three Lions]</b> I can only recommend for England fans to come. It has been fantastic so far. The tournament and the organisation and everything about it has been great. I am sure the England fans here have seen that, I hope the England fans back home will see the same thing</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Dier does not believe Tottenham’s top-four rivals are necessarily stronger this season]</b> You can look at all the other teams around us, they might have signed players but not many of those players that they’ve signed are better than the players they’ve already got. Obviously, there are signings that have been made which are players of very high quality but in many cases I don’t believe that they’ve signed players that are better than they already have. If it’s your point of trying to create a better atmosphere or give the team a boost then that’s cool but we’ll find the same boost in a different way. It’s a great challenge for us - to shut everyone up. We’re going to enjoy that challenge. We’ve got a fantastic squad here; fantastic players, throughout the team in every position. To strengthen it is not easy as well. The players are really happy, we’ve got a fantastic group here. We all really enjoy training together, playing together, being with each other. We’ll just try to continue to build on that.<br /><br />For the last three years we’ve been challenging the best teams in the country. And last year we were challenging the best teams in the Champions League with the squad that we have here. The manager said it before, we’re in a fight but we’re having to use different tools. We’ve known that for the last three years and we have to try and compensate for what other clubs can do in different ways - with our attitude, our work ethic, our desire. We have to try and compensate in those ways. That’s what we’ll try to do and it’ll make us better</p>

At the end of the day we’re in this to win. We had a fantastic World Cup, we broke down many barriers as a national team. We managed to get to the semi-finals, which was incredible but at the same time winning is the most important thing. Only Hugo <b>[Lloris]</b> can know what it feels like because he won it and only winning it matters. Nothing else matters. Everyone else, back here at Tottenham, <b>[we had]</b> the semi-final last year but we need to go one that step further and win. We’re all in this to win it and we all want to win.<br /><br /><b>[On Hugo Lloris]</b> Hugo can be a changed man because Hugo won it! Everyone else, we’re in the same boat. He’s one of the best goalkeepers in the world, first and foremost. He’s someone that everyone in the squad looks up to. Even more now. To look up to the quality he brings, the work ethic he brings, the attitude he brings. His style is a quiet style, but silence is sometimes deadly</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Dier has warned that England’s run to the semi-final of the World Cup has put a target on their backs]</b> The more successful you are as a team, the more of a target you become. Do teams see beating us a scalp now? Yes. Having got to the semi-finals and played the tournament we had, we gained more respect from the footballing world. The hardest thing now is to maintain that respect and earn even more. That’s what we are trying to do. We had a very positive World Cup and we need to build on that, get better and really keep improving. We need to maintain that high level over a long period of time to be in the top bracket.<br /><br />Spain had a difficult World Cup but they are still one of the best footballing nations. We want to compete against, and beat, the best. Even though our World Cup was so positive, we still feel like we need to prove ourselves against the best teams<br /><br />During the tournament, it was difficult for us to really understand what things were like back home. Hopefully we can feel a bit of that on Saturday and Tuesday as well. We had a fantastic tournament, we brought unity to the nation which was needed at the time and everyone got behind us. It was incredible to be a part of, but we need to have that mentality where we should never be satisfied</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> can be a bit out of touch with reality]</b> At times things haven’t felt very good at the beginning of this season. Maybe we’re a bit out of touch with reality sometimes. We always want to do better. Overall, we’ve had a really positive start. We wanted to start well. In recent years it may be one of the criticisms that we haven’t started so well. I think we can be happy where we are. We can always do better and now when we get back from international duty there’s a chance for us to keep improving<br /><br /><b>[He added on an outing against the Bluebirds which saw <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> dominate possession and fire in 19 shots on goal]</b> I thought we controlled the game throughout, created a lot of chances and the only negative is that we’ve only come away with one goal, I feel like it should have been a lot more. It would have been really disappointing if we’d conceded a goal. They had a chance from a set-piece where I think I should have done better myself and a few half-chances, but nothing very clear. For the most part and overall, we can be happy. We’ve got the clean sheet, we’ve won and we can go into the international break feeling positive</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford are capable of scaring any international team]</b> Yes, I think it is really scary. You have got three players who I think complement each other really well. Of course, Harry we know, Raheem is playing at such a high level now as well, Marcus is really kicking on. All three of them have fantastic quality. They complement each other really well. Their work rate is fantastic, which is something people probably won’t talk about as much. The way they work for the team, track back. Raheem was making such important defensive actions towards the end of the game. Those things are just as important. All three of them have a fantastic attitude, they are brave and direct. It is really positive for us. We have fantastic players throughout the whole side in every position. We have fantastic depth too. We believe in ourselves and it is up to those players to step up in those moments and we have been doing that. Individuals have been doing that, the team has been doing that and we need to continue doing that. That’s what the manager wants and that’s what this team is about, being brave whoever the opposition is. Believing in yourself, being direct, being attacking, willing to take risks like everyone did and that’s what this team is about and it will continue to be about. It is key, I think you have heard the manager say it many times and we need to be all that. I think our basis is our attitude, commitment and work rate. Those are the things that need to exist in every game. Then the quality and the magic come out on top.<br /><br /><b>[The Tottenham midfielder has reflected on a rare year of success for England]</b> Yes, it has been a very special year for the England team. The World Cup, the game in Spain, the penalty against Colombia, all those moments. There hasn’t been a year like it for a long, long time. We are going to play another semi-final in the space of two years, in another competition. It is fantastic for us and a good experience for us. The most important thing is to use it in the best way possible now. We believe in what we are doing. We believe in ourselves and the manager has really instilled that. We feel that within the group. I feel like even when we went 1-0 behind, there was a lot of positivity on the pitch. In the crowd as well. They were pushing us on in a really positive way, which maybe hasn’t been the way in the past. So, we really felt that and that’s so important if we are to continue going forward and to be a really good side. We are constantly trying to improve and this is another step along the way. We want to keep improving since the World Cup. We could have gone in two directions after the World Cup, we want to keep improving, keep getting better. I feel like we have done that, but at the same time, we need to keep getting better. To continue to improve, we know that our potential is huge and it is up to us to fill it</p>

We are upset that Harry is injured, like we are upset when any player gets injured, but we have to get on with it. It is down to the team and the squad to rally and carry on.<br /><br />We won and that is the most important thing. It is not a question of whether we can cope without Harry or not. He is one of the best strikers in the world, so any team would feel his loss when he is not playing. We have to find solutions and move on. Injuries happen in football. That is why you have a squad, not just 11 players. Fernando is a very good player. He has very good qualities. We need to give him the service he needs to demonstrate his qualities.

It’s the first time that we’ve found ourselves in this position, we can’t back down from it. We’ve got to push through it</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> midfielder Eric Dier believes that it’s a good thing for the club that losing two games in succession is considered a crisis]</b> The main thing is we’ve been working all together - okay, some people have gone, some people have come in - but working all together over the last five years to get to the point where this is the conversation when you lose two games on the trot. We’ve wanted to get to the point where we are considered a team that if you lose two games like that, you come in for a lot of criticism. Now, we have to embrace the situation. We’ve got to this point and now we need to… as I said to the press after the Brighton game, we can’t back down, we need to push forward, push through it, fight through it, everyone together<br /><br /><b>[Dier is itching to get back in action after the disappointment of losing to Brighton, with a home match to follow against <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> on Saturday]</b> To be honest, after Brighton, I wanted to play again the next day. It’s never nice going into an international break on that note and having to wait this long. At the same time, it gives you time to settle and put your emotions in the right place. Hopefully that’s what we’ll do, and we can all push through this as a club</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Dier believes <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> the ‘perfect’ manager to replace <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> I think he’s the perfect person to have followed on from <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> - that’s the feeling I have. We’re really happy that if someone was to replace <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>, it was him. His record is unbelievable and he transmits that confidence. The way he speaks, you believe it, you feel it from him. I think for everyone, we’re very lucky to have played under <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> and now <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>. We couldn’t be luckier. I think he said to you guys, like he said to us, that he doesn’t want to come in and change everything two days before a game. I think it’s going to be something gradual that we move towards over time. He has his ways, he has his ideas and his mentality, so we’re just trying to adapt to that now<br /><br /><b>[Shockwaves reverberated across the football world on Tuesday night as <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> was sacked, and <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> was appointed just 11 hours later]</b> It was a crazy few days. We found out that night through the club. There were a lot of emotions after being together for such a long time - that’s normal. Was I able to say goodbye? Yes, it was important for me and everyone. I think everyone did it in their own way. I spoke to him and the coaching staff and it was good</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Dier is hoping to reap the benefits of moving to a central defensive role at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, a position he claims is his strongest]</b> As I’ve said, centre-back is a position where I see my future, where I think I can be the best I can be, but every opportunity I get to play I’m really happy with and I always try to show my qualities. Ultimately, though, it doesn’t really matter how well you play individually if you’re losing<br /><br />This year I’ve been fine, I haven’t really had a problem health-wise, it’s just getting game time really - other than that, from a health point of view, I think I’ve been okay this season. That consistency of playing is what everyone wants but it’s up to us as individuals to perform in the right way to deserve it<br /><br />Eric played very well. The thinking was Davinson <b>[Sanchez]</b> and <b>[Japhet]</b> <a href="japhet-tanganga.html">Tanganga</a> are the two fastest central defenders that we have. Eric is the one who by nature is a midfield player so playing in the middle between those centre backs is the one who is normally more comfortable to step up, he’s more comfortable with reading the game and passing<br /><br />They played well, especially Eric was very, very good and sometimes you concede goals and you blame goalkeepers and defenders. Other times you concede goals and it is a global situation and I think it was when it comes from a transition. Sometimes when it comes from behind midfield I think it’s not about them</p>
