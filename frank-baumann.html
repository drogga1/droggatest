  <p><b>[Werder Bremen have rewarded coach <a href="alexander-nouri.html">Alexander Nouri</a> for his side’s stunning second half to the season with a contract extension]</b> In recent weeks, we sat down and spoke about many things which were important for us to be able to work together in the long term. We’re delighted to confirm that we’ll continue along our path together. <br /><br />In autumn, Alex took charge of the team overnight. Firstly, he had to take control of a difficult situation, which he did with panache. In the Rückrunde, he has led the team step-by-step into the top half of the table. We want to build on that and further develop Werder together<br /><br />Even in February when results still weren’t coming, I was sure our journey with Werder was not over, and I always had the feeling things would get better. I’m happy with the confidence the club has shown in me, the support of the fans and the passionate and hungry team I have around me</p>

  <p><b>[Nouri was the U23 coach at Werder when the club turned to him to take over the senior squad following a 4-1 home loss to Borussia Mönchengladbach on Matchday 3. The 37-year-old had never coached at <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> level and the club presented him as an interim solution]</b> How long Alex stays is up to him. Alex has picked up a lot of self confidence and conviction, but he’s still the same guy</p>

  <p><b>[Werder Bremen announced the dismissal of head coach <a href="alexander-nouri.html">Alexander Nouri</a>]</b> Alex took on a very tough task last season and successfully accomplished it. We want to thank him for that. He brings everything that a successful coach does. I am sure that he will be successful in another post.<br /><br /><b>[This time, the club has also gone for an internal solution, promoting current under-23 coach to <a href="florian-kohfeldt.html">Florian Kohfeldt</a> to bench boss of the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> team. He is to be assisted by current assistant coach Thomas Horsch and U17 assistant coach Tim Borowski]</b> We are of the belief that this coaching team will implement an important impuse in the next few days and can stabilize the the team</p>

  <p><b>[As recently as last December, Werder Bremen admitted to flying a drone over a Hoffenheim training session ahead of a meeting between the clubs]</b> If the action in Hoffenheim led to a certain uncertainty on the training ground, then we would like to apologise for that. A drone was flown for a short period, but didn’t fly over the pitch their team was training on. There was no threat. Everything has been resolved with Hoffenheim. We have done nothing illegal. That would go against our club principles. We apologise to Hoffenheim if the incident has unnerved them. This is all we have to say on the matter</p>

  <p><b>[Werder Bremen have announced that captain Max Kruse will depart the club at the end of the 2018-19 season]</b> We have always emphasised that we would have liked to continue working with Max. However, he has decided to seek a new challenge after three years. For us it was important to have planning security for the new season, this is now the case and we are sure that we will have a strong squad again in the coming season. Max came to Werder in a situation at the time in which it was not taken for granted that a player of his quality would go that route. He has shaped the club for the past three years, giving the team a face and making a decisive contribution to the development of the club.</p>
