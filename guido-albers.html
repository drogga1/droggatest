  <p><b>[Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Roma have been offered hope in their pursuit of Ajax midfielder Donny van de Beek]</b> It is true that this interest has been there for a while. Last summer it was already concrete, but Donny opted for a longer stay at Ajax. The past few months have gone differently than we had in mind. If his situation remains the same way for much longer, a transfer is a better option for all parties. These agreements have now also been made with <b>[director of football]</b> Marc Overmars. If the situation remains the same, a transfer can be discussed.</p>

  <p><b>[Guido Albers says Former Feyenoord boss Giovanni van Bronckhorst is interested in succeeding <a href="rafael.html">Rafael</a> <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>]</b> I think the rumours have come a little bit early and no-one from the club has spoken to Gio. But I think every coach in the world would be interested in working in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. And what we would say if a club like <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> has an opportunity to work for them then of course he would be interested in doing that. It is an amazing club with an amazing fanbase but it’s up to them who they decide to go for. Giovanni left Feyenoord, he was competing on a limited budget but won the Eredivisie against two clubs in <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> who have greater resources. He had a great relationship with the fans, the players, the media and the city and he’s ready for the next challenge.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="wesley-sneijder.html">Wesley Sneijder</a>’s retirement announcement came as a complete surprise to his agent Guido Albers]</b> It was a complete surprise for us that he announced it this way. I had planned a meeting with him next Thursday to discuss the options he still has and then we were going to decide how to announce this to the public. So, next Thursday we can decide if this decision is certain. He has some things to do in Doha, where he still lives and there are still a few clubs who probably want to sign him, so I’d like to tell him about that. He just came back from America. We will discuss it on Thursday and then he can decide what to do. Normally you consult each other about these things, but I think he just announced it in all his enthusiasm today</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="donny-van-de-beek.html">Donny van de Beek</a>’s agent Guido Albers insisted he was unworried about the <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> midfielder’s future]</b> It will all be different, but I also have to be realistic. It also creates opportunities at clubs that perhaps thought they had no chance anymore and are now knocking on the door. I’m not worried about Donny.<br /><br />The interest has been, and that is also known, for a long time and from several clubs. We will see what will come out of that in the coming weeks. I dare not say anything about it at the moment. I can’t say anything about it because a number of things are just confidential. The situation will have changed per club and we have to look closely at that</p>

I dare not say anything about it and can not say anything about it, also because some things are confidential. The situation per club will have changed and we have to look closely at that</p>
