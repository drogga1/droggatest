  <p><b>[Guido Albers, Wesley Sneijder’s agent, on <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a> coach Cesare Prandelli]</b> He is shameful. He only speaks in Italian and the players don’t know what to do on the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Wesley Sneijder’s retirement announcement came as a complete surprise to his agent Guido Albers]</b> It was a complete surprise for us that he announced it this way. I had planned a meeting with him next Thursday to discuss the options he still has and then we were going to decide how to announce this to the public. So, next Thursday we can decide if this decision is certain. He has some things to do in Doha, where he still lives and there are still a few clubs who probably want to sign him, so I’d like to tell him about that. He just came back from America. We will discuss it on Thursday and then he can decide what to do. Normally you consult each other about these things, but I think he just announced it in all his enthusiasm today</p>

  <p><b>[Donny van de Beek’s agent Guido Albers insisted he was unworried about the <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> midfielder’s future]</b> It will all be different, but I also have to be realistic. It also creates opportunities at clubs that perhaps thought they had no chance anymore and are now knocking on the door. I’m not worried about Donny.<br /><br />The interest has been, and that is also known, for a long time and from several clubs. We will see what will come out of that in the coming weeks. I dare not say anything about it at the moment. I can’t say anything about it because a number of things are just confidential. The situation will have changed per club and we have to look closely at that</p>

  <p><b>[Donny van de Beek: Why is the <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> star such an in-demand transfer target?]</b> What’s going to happen to Donny? Nobody knows at the moment. The interest, that is known, has been there from several clubs for a long time. We will see what will come out in the coming weeks. I dare not say anything about it and can not say anything about it, also because some things are confidential. The situation per club will have changed and we have to look closely at that</p>
