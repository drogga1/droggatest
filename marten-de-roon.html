  <p><b>[Marten de Roon reveals what it’s like to play beside Barca-bound <a href="frenkie-de-jong.html">Frenkie de Jong</a>]</b> It makes it easier because he makes the spaces; he takes the players with him. It makes it easier because he makes the spaces; he takes the players with him. He always waits one more second to play the ball so somebody else has to make a decision if he comes closer to you. With him, I have a little bit more time to play. On the other hand, he is searching for the ball, searching for the position, <b>[and]</b> I’m staying a little bit more central, so when we lose the ball I am already in position. So for me, it’s a great pleasure to play with him because I also see his qualities. As the other midfielder, it makes it easier to play. I can only say good things about him.<br /><br /><b>[The captain, Virgil van Dijk, is partnered by 19-year-old Matthijs de Ligt, who could yet end up at Barca]</b> They are physically so strong. Matthijs is of course an enormous talent who is going to make a step. You can already see how physically great he is. And Virgil is on his best moment. He’s 28, he’s feeling good, he just won the Champions League so we’re very strong there in the back. But I also think fullbacks are crucial because Denzel is going all the time, Daley is a little bit more for the football. The team is really balanced and you can see it<br /><br />Since the new coach came, we searched a little bit for what was the best XI but we created a big team like you see against England. We changed two players <b>[Quincy Promes and Donny van de Beek) and they are decisive in the final score. You can see we are 23 people here and 23 people want just one result. We are growing, but we already grew a lot this last year. If the results are positive, it makes it easier to grow and it gives confidence. We didn’t panic after the 1-0 but we just continued and in the end it fell in the right place<br /><br /><b>[Marten de Roon on Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> I played this year already against him. It will be hard because Portugal plays at home. The stadium will be full of Portugal fans and Ronaldo is an exceptional player. So we have to defend him very well. If we have a good day and we play like we did against England we have a good chance. It’s a nice duel hopefully Virgil will win and I am confident it will happen</b></p>

  <p><b>[The former Newcastle man was joined in the Dutch engine room by a fellow 28-year-old in Atalanta’s Marten de Roon]</b> I’d happily lose this final, instead of next year during the Euros. It always sucks when you lose. Especially after the things we had shown over the last months. So we’re very disappointed we couldn’t show the same things as we did in the last games.<br /><br /><b>[De Roon helped his club side reach the Coppa Italia final and earn a Champions League place through a third-place finish in Serie A]</b> This season has been brilliant. But that’s something I will look back on later, because now I’m disappointed after this lost final. We wanted to win it so badly. The Dutch team has shown we are developing as a young team. We’re a decent squad with much quality. If we’re in good shape, we can compete with the best countries in the world<br /><br />We have shown that everyone must now take us seriously. We have gained more experience from these finals. We still have to qualify for the European Championship final round, but we will certainly benefit from these experiences. As a team if you’re so close to a trophy you want to win it. We didn’t play our best match, but this is an experience we can take on board for next year’s Euros, where we hope to do better. We did not do enough in the build-up. I myself did not. We found too few solutions between the lines. The game against England was tough, but that should not be an excuse. I’d rather win the tournament with the team, but it’s always an honour to win the individual trophy so I feel honoured to have been given it</p>
