  <p>What concerns people the most now is cheating in the election because it will distort people’s will. It will distort what people really want in this election</p>

  <p><b>[her party is working to form a governing coalition]</b> As we have said before, the party with the most seats is the one that has received the confidence from the people to set up the government<br /><br />No matter the outcome, whichever party obtains the majority vote should get to form a coalition government first. We don’t want to fight with anyone for power.</p>

  <p>We want to stop the regime from hanging on to power. We have obtained the majority and received consensus from the people<br /><br /><b>[Pheu Thai leader Sudarat Keyuraphan said that between the seven parties had 255 seats between them, enough to secure a majority in 500-seat house of representatives and form a government]</b> Right now are are starting with seven parties. We want to demonstrate that our goal is to stop NCPO power, then we will discuss with other parties to help us. But we already have a majority<br /><br /><b>[In the absence of an official winner, both Pheu Thai and the pro-military party Phalang Pracharat, which was formed by the junta as a way to hold onto power through the ballot box, have claimed victory in the election]</b> Last time the military took power through a coup, this time they are trying to do it through manipulation. Our main mission is that we don’t want any more chaos. We want to move forward following the people’s voice. We got the majority so we will proceed to stop the NCPO</p>
