  <p><b>[Charlton and ex-chairman Matt Southall embroiled in legal row]</b> Charlton is a great club and the football club and the fans have always been my priority. I am confident that this will be clear to all when the true facts of the last few months come to light</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Charlton ownership crisis: Court finds Matt Southall’s attempt to retake control is ‘unlawful’]</b> I fully accept that my actions were ill-advised and the court has applied the appropriate sanction. However, in terms of the future of the club it is important to note that the judge acknowledged that negotiations for the sale of the club were ongoing. This finding contradicts the statements previously made about the sale of all of the shares in East Street Investments Limited. I am pleased that this clarification has been made. I would also make the point that the applicants sought a costs order in excess of £32,000 and the resulting award of £17,500 plus VAT falls far short of that number. I remain confident that a credible buyer will emerge and my team and I will be discussing the next steps shortly.</p>
