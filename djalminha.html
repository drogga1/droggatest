  <p><b>[Former Brazil midfielder Djalminha gives his opinions on <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>’s qualities]</b> If everybody could do what he does they all would do it. The problem is they can’t, so they get annoyed with those who can. I don’t think people don’t criticise him because of his exaggerated dribbling, but because they seem to think he is making fun of his opponents or provoking them. But in my opinion it’s exceptional, and those who criticise him only do so because they can’t do what <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> can. If <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> had a great team behind him, with good team-mates, then he could win the league with Depor. But if he was playing in the current La Coruna squad I’m absolutely sure he could not. It depends a lot on the team-mates you have, because nobody wins nothing alone. Nowadays he is winning more because things are easier for him with the team-mates he has at Barcelona</p>
