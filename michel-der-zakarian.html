<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Montpellier boss Michel Der Zakarian has accused <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> of always crying after watching his side suffer a 3-1 defeat at home to <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> on Saturday]</b> He <b>[<a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>]</b> has a game who always provoke the opponents with his skills and his dribbles. When he takes a kick he is always crying<br /><br />He’s a great player and it’s just a pity at the end of the game that he wound everyone up. I said to him that his team was 3-1 up. He played 63 one-twos and didn’t need to do that. He told me he was just playing passes. That’s not being respectful but then we mustn’t have the same education. He’s a bit on the edge and haughty with everybody. I told him that he needed to respect people. When you’re idolised you need to show the right values. His attitude since he’s been in France is there for everybody to see. He’s over the top, winds people up and speaks badly, as usual</p>
