<blockquote>
  <p>[Paraguay goalkeeping legend Jose Luis Chilavert has revealed that part of the difficulty in defending Michael Ballack had to do with the midfielder’s strong body odour] You couldn’t get near Ballack because his BO [body odour] was terrible, absolutely terrible. He should have used more deodorant or a lemon. Perhaps it was a strategy, who knows!<br /><br />[On spat in the face of Roberto Carlos] I spat at him when he told me, ‘Indian, we beat you 2-0.’ That’s the reason I did it.</p>
