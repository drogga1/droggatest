  <p><b>[Bernd Schuster says The Argentina National Team Does Not Know What To Do With Lionel Messi]</b> The Argentina national team does not know what to do with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. They have the problem of not allowing him to play. It could still change, but it will be difficult. You cannot have such a luxury and not use him to his potential in a World Cup. One needs to adapt to his style of play<br /><br /><b>[Schuster also weighed in on the Liga race between <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> with special emphasis on El Clasico, to be played in the Santiago Bernabeu in early April]</b> I have no idea which of the two will fail, because both teams are performing well - each team in its own way, but they are playing well. El Clasico will not be decisive; <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> will be decided by one side giving up points. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are the only ones that can stop Madrid<br /><br /><b>[As for the Spanish national team’s role in the World Cup]</b> For the first time in history, Spain begin the tournament as favourites. They have earned it and are the European champions, but in the World Cup one has to beat Brazil, who are my favourites for the final</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> coach Bernd Schuster does not understand the reasons behind Pepe’s aggressive behaviour on the field of play]</b> I do not need to say how good Pepe is, how a great person and professional he is, or that he has to be at Madrid. What he did was ugly, but this is all because we can watch everything that happens on the pitch. Migueli, <b>[Fernando]</b> <a href="fernando-hierro.html">Hierro</a>, <b>[Roberto]</b> <a href="roberto-ayala.html">Ayala</a>, these are players who hit hard, but now we can watch everything. Since the day of the incident with Casquero, I do not know what has happened with Pepe. It is something rare, something you cannot explain if you know him. When Pepe puts on the shirt, he is a different guy. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> knows how to take advantage of these things, but sometimes he goes too far<br /><br /><b>[The 52-year-old coach, who is currently out of work, then admitted he was surprised with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>’s formation in Wednesday’s match]</b> There are some things that are hard to understand. <b>[Ricardo]</b> Carvalho had not been playing in a long time, <b>[Hamit]</b> <a href="hamit-altintop.html">Altintop</a> perhaps does not improve the team’s level and Pepe played again in midfield. But most of all, what happens when you change so many things is that you are taking many risks. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> have been playing in the exact same way since I left Madrid, but Madrid try to change things in every Clasico. There is one team which plays always the same every year and another who tries the impossible to win</p>

  <p><b>[Following last week’s 2-1 home defeat by the Catalans in the first leg of their Copa del Rey quarter-final tie, it has been reported that there are deep divisions within the Madrid squad and that certain players have turned against coach <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> and are leaking stories to the press]</b> Whenever things have been leaked to the press, it goes beyond the players. There are many people there all day following <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and those things <b>[leaks]</b> can not be stopped. Clearly there are <b>[divisions]</b> … <b>[But]</b> when things are going well, nothing happens. But if results go wrong, then there are problems<br /><br /><b>[Indeed, Schuster believes that unrest is a natural by-product of defeat and, consequently, is paying little attention to reports that <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> could walk out on Madrid at the end of the current campaign]</b> I do not think he will go. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> has only one problem: <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. Everything else is fine</p>

  <p><b>[Schuster has warned Madrid against signing another forward in early 2019 as he thinks it unlikely any top-class players will be made available]</b> I wouldn’t sign anyone in the winter market because if what you want is to bring in a star or someone who improves what you have, I think that if a club allows a player to leave like that it’ll be because he’s not right. Arriving in January without having good rhythm is very difficult. They won’t easily let a striker leave if he has 20 goals with his team. What happens is that <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> didn’t only guarantee you goals, but the opponents unconsciously change the way they play. Sometimes, a leader is missing. Madrid didn’t have one in Moscow <b>[a 1-0 Champions League defeat to CSKA]</b> and it was too noticeable<br /><br /><b>[Schuster, who lasted just 17 months in charge at the Santiago Bernabeu, thinks <a href="julen-lopetegui.html">Lopetegui</a> is well aware of the demands involved]</b> The players barely care. It’s the coach who is thinking about the next game all day. They are mentally prepared for criticism and to suffer when things aren’t going well. They know they live by the next result</p>

You don’t need three seasons. He <b>[Dembele]</b> had some great games for <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> at the start, but not that many. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> is too big for him<br /><br />I went directly to speak to the captains if a player was turning up one hour before the matches.

I don’t know if they’re the team for him. I think <a href="alvaro-morata.html">Morata</a> was wrong to leave Madrid.

But you have to put him in. He has to play. He’s an indisputable first-choice. What they miss at Madrid is a player who gets 45-50 goals</p>

We didn’t believe in <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> recently and now you see that they have become very good again. The problem for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> is that they have lacked a No.9 for two years since <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> left<br /><br /><b>[Zinedine <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>’s side suffered a 2-1 Champions League last-16 defeat to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in their most recent outing]</b> Sterling came back from an injury, but he is a player who can mess with you. His introduction gave something to his team and nothing happened on the other side<br /><br /><b>[Next up for Real is a Clasico clash with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> on Sunday]</b> I want to see this game but we are also in a phase of the season where a draw could be a good result, and I don’t like that. Both teams have problems and it will be interesting to see who is more animated, although the one playing at home has a small advantage</p>
