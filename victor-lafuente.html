  <p><b>[Behind the scenes in LaLiga: How <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>, Mallorca, Granada and Osasuna keep their players in top shape]</b> The job title of fitness coach is just one of the many hats we wear. At the end of the day, we’re responsible for optimising player performance. People seem to think that our job is just to make the players run further, jump higher and keep going for longer. But there’s far more to it than that: sleep, ergogenic aids, the various interpersonal relationships with the player, etc. Our role isn’t limited to just planning strength exercises<br /><br />It all started back in 2016. I was looking for a muscle activation training course and came across Neuromecanica LAB, who looked at things from a neurological approach. My dad had Alzheimer’s and that was what initially prompted me to look at how the brain works. Another reason behind it was my interest in finding out why many players suffer injury relapses. And I discovered that injuries not only affect the body on a musculoskeletal level but that they also impact on neurological mechanisms. Whilst you might recover physically from an injury, there are still neurological changes which can end up causing a recurrence of that injury<br /><br />We tend to think it’s a case of just improving your strength, but really everything goes through a primary process where the brain dictates and organises things. Any kind of neurodegenerative illness ultimately means that, even when your muscles can be healthy, if your brain doesn’t coordinate the signals received that it has to send to the muscles, then the muscles aren’t activated as the context demands. An injury causes a neurological change because there’s an interruption to the process that carries the signal to the sensor and motor cortex and on to the muscle. This whole circuit is affected</p>
