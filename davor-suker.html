  <p><b>[Davor Suker opinions on <a href="joko-widodo.html">Zlatko Dalic</a> the interim Croatia head coach]</b> <a href="joko-widodo.html">Zlatko Dalic</a> has absolutely justified our confidence after the matches against Ukraine and Greece and thus confirmed he was the correct choice after the Finland match (1-1). As we agreed quickly when we first met, we have again reached an agreement very quickly, which proves that we have a common interest, which is the success of the Croatian team. I congratulated the coach on what he did in a short-term, and he showed that he deserved to lead the Croatian national team. We will provide Zlatko and the team the best conditions ahead of Russia so that we can achieve the best result possible there</p>

  <p><b>[q: It’s now four month since France and Croatia contested the World Cup final. Has life changed at all since then?]</b> What happened in Russia was the most beautiful thing we’ve seen in Croatian football. We were able to unite the whole of Croatia and I cannot remember anything quite as emotional as the homecoming celebration with more than Croatians taking to the streets. Football’s my life and its moments like that that make me feel great happiness</p>

  <p><b>[q: What did Croatia do differently to the rest in Russia?]</b> To keep it as brief as I can, I’d say we gave a lesson in talent, unity and national enthusiasm. We are working very hard so that the new Luka Modrics and Ivan Rakitics will emerge in the future</p>

  <p><b>[q: How much of Croatia’s success at Russia 2018 was down to you?]</b> When a small country achieves something as big as that, it means that the system has worked well. I feel very proud to be at the head of a federation which represents our country with such success</p>

  <p><b>[q: Be honest - do you want revenge on Spain for the Matchday 2 tonking?]</b> Of course, we were very disappointed with the result in Elche, where a lot of things didn’t go to plan and with one thing and another, it ended in a defeat. I’m sure that the coach and the players are motivated and keen to show that match was just an off day for us and nothing more. Especially as this game will be the first at home after the World Cup - we’ll have our fans behind us and hopefully their support will help the team</p>

  <p><b>[q: Are you worried that Spain could serve Croatia another heavy defeat?]</b> Spain is one of the best sides in the world and <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a> is a great coach so it wouldn’t surprise me if Spain played well again. I’m hoping for a great game of football between two fantastic teams - a much more exciting match than the last one in Elche</p>

They have deserved all of the awards they have received because they are exceptional players, among the best players in football history but their absence could not have spoiled Luka’s night because it was the moment when we celebrated his success and his trajectory in football</p>

He is our captain, and he still plays very good football. He showed that in our recent games, and with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. I’m sure that he will be our leader next year, in the same way that he did in Russia.

  <p><b>[Commenting on the coronavirus situation that has halted football across the globe]</b> Health issues come first, and then football. The decision was made to postpone the leagues but we have to think about how to resume. And that’s why we’ve taken decisions, such as testing before games. Every week, we will carry out tests. Of course, all these issues are important for all clubs, leagues and national associations and TV rights are also a big issue. We will do everything possible to avoid Covid-19, in addition to the decisions we’ve already made, and with the help of the authorities. In Croatia, the government has made some great decisions and we will hopefully play very soon</p>
