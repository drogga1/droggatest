  <p><b>[Davor Suker opinions on <a href="joko-widodo.html">Zlatko Dalic</a> the interim Croatia head coach]</b> <a href="joko-widodo.html">Zlatko Dalic</a> has absolutely justified our confidence after the matches against Ukraine and Greece and thus confirmed he was the correct choice after the Finland match (1-1). As we agreed quickly when we first met, we have again reached an agreement very quickly, which proves that we have a common interest, which is the success of the Croatian team. I congratulated the coach on what he did in a short-term, and he showed that he deserved to lead the Croatian national team. We will provide Zlatko and the team the best conditions ahead of Russia so that we can achieve the best result possible there</p>

  <p><b>[Davor Suker never enjoyed much success in front of the Kop]</b> <b>[Anfield]</b> is one of the more charismatic stadiums and you also have the big club there. Everyone who has the chance to visit Liverpool’s stadium to enjoy <b>[it]</b> understands it. Croatian players who will be there and Croatian fans; it will be absolutely exciting to watch the game and be part of the big festival of football. <b>[Lovren]</b> will be a really nice host for the Croatian football family. And of course, Liverpool will make a great game and a great atmosphere, and I would like all football fans in the United Kingdom to just come and enjoy this friendly game. Brazil, of course, is one of the biggest teams in the world and, you know, Croatia; we are <b>[a]</b> small country, but we are so proud and we have quality players. I expect <b>[Luca]</b> Modric, <b>[Mario]</b> Mandzukic, <b>[Ivan]</b> Perisic, <b>[Ivan]</b> Rakitic to have a big battle against the Brazilian players in the midfield and of course, we need to make <b>[a]</b> good game<br /><br />Brazil is one of the top teams in <b>[the]</b> world and it’s so exciting and so nice to have this chance. I hope we can make <b>[a]</b> great game because <b>[Zlatko]</b> Dalic and the players; it’s a big test for us. I am president and I don’t like to make so many big comments. I would like to have all players healthy and all players in the best competitive time to play well, and of course, <b>[the]</b> expectation of <b>[the]</b> Croatian family of football is to be <b>[the]</b> surprise of the World Cup - I have that secret wish. This is the World Cup. Every dream of each kid. All kids around the world can dream of playing for the national team. Of course, England is a great country for football, Brazil is a great country for football, and so is Croatia. All ingredients to enjoy the game</p>

  <p><b>[Croatia legend Davor Suker has insisted that Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi cannot be compared]</b> The two of them can only be compared to the height; football is changing every 10 years. In Diego’s time the balls were different, the pitches were not so scorched. Look, Diego won the World Cup, Messi has not, but Diego liked me because I played with him<br /><br /><b>[Croatia were largely ineffective in attack]</b> We have not done anything yet, we have to stay firm on the ground. There is no euphoria, Argentina is coming. Argentina is always a favourite, and we’re going step by step. I’ve seen a lot of good in our game, but I can say that we are going to be world champions and then after five days, everything can change. Messi is a miracle, he can have a hat-trick in every game, but he’s just a man, he can make a mistake. The dangers for us are now even bigger because the Argentinians are wounded. This will be a chess game, but if it’s like Nigeria, I’m not afraid</p>

  <p><b>[q: It’s now four month since France and Croatia contested the World Cup final. Has life changed at all since then?]</b> What happened in Russia was the most beautiful thing we’ve seen in Croatian football. We were able to unite the whole of Croatia and I cannot remember anything quite as emotional as the homecoming celebration with more than Croatians taking to the streets. Football’s my life and its moments like that that make me feel great happiness</p>

  <p><b>[q: Be honest - do you want revenge on Spain for the Matchday 2 tonking?]</b> Of course, we were very disappointed with the result in Elche, where a lot of things didn’t go to plan and with one thing and another, it ended in a defeat. I’m sure that the coach and the players are motivated and keen to show that match was just an off day for us and nothing more. Especially as this game will be the first at home after the World Cup - we’ll have our fans behind us and hopefully their support will help the team</p>

I’m hoping for a great game of football between two fantastic teams - a much more exciting match than the last one in Elche</p>
