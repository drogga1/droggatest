  <p><b>[Jai and Dane Ingham have been included in New Zealand’s squad for this month’s World Cup qualifiers against Fiji]</b> Jai has been progressing with his club and his performances have been very good. In recent time he is getting more and more time on the pitch and his performances have been very strong. He is a dynamic player, a very attacking player and he is someone who suits how we want to play. Recently when Dane made his debut for the Roar, for me 20 - 30 minutes into the game and I was sold. I had seen enough. He is a really good player. I have said all along that I wouldn’t be adding unless they add to the squad and these two players do that. I have seen enough to know that they can come in and improve what we are doing.<br /><br />It is the best squad we have had since I have been here. We have got quality all around the pitch, we have depth and competition for places, and the best thing about this squad is we have a good blend of experience and youth. There is energy, quality and hunger in this squad so I’m very pleased</p>

  <p><b>[Anthony Hudson previews their intercontinental World Cup qualifying play-off with Peru]</b> The pressure they <b>[Peru]</b> must be under is gigantic. It’s unthinkable to lose to New Zealand over two legs</p>

  <p><b>[The Colorado Rapids have fired Anthony Hudson as head coach]</b> We are fighting at the bottom with a bottom group of players and we have to find a way to pick up results while also being a team that tries to play a certain way. And we just have to find that balance</p>

  <p><b>[U.S. Soccer announced on Wednesday that former Colorado Rapids boss Anthony Hudson has been hired as the new U.S. U-20 men’s national team coach]</b> I’m very proud to be joining U.S. Soccer. It’s a really exciting time with the game’s rapid growth in this country and especially with so many talented young players coming through the ranks. I can’t wait to work with them and help develop these players into contributors at the highest level</p>
