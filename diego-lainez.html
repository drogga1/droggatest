  <p><b>[Lionel <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has been an inspiration to hundreds of rising stars]</b> I really identify with him. I really like his style of play, and I try to learn from him and do some of the things he does. I look to take players on a lot, play a lot of one-twos, but I also like to shoot from distance. I can play behind the No.9 or as a midfielder. Whatever is needed, I do it, and I can use both feet very well</p>
