  <p><b>[Diego Lainez and Roberto Alvarado look to convert from Mexico’s future to Mexico’s present]</b> We came in doing things well, and I’m happy there may have been scouts because that means we’re doing things well. We’re good people and we’re centered so we won’t lose our heads<br /><br />I’m really happy. It’s my first brush with the senior level and I think it’s good to play against these elite players. You don’t always play them and the first steps also are really important. It’s really good to play against these types of national teams. It motivates us to get better and I’m really happy how the team functioned as well</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Lainez and Matt Miazga jawed at each other while the defender made gestures about Lainez’s small size]</b> It’s something that happens in soccer. A little run-in. It’s nothing. It’s something that’s totally normal.<br /><br />I think these games helped a lot, since I’m a young player. It was a great experience and hopefully I keep getting them. I’m happy that the manager included me, that we did things well. Now it’s about continuing on this path</p>

  <p><b>[Lionel <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has been an inspiration to hundreds of rising stars]</b> I really identify with him. I really like his style of play, and I try to learn from him and do some of the things he does. I look to take players on a lot, play a lot of one-twos, but I also like to shoot from distance. I can play behind the No.9 or as a midfielder. Whatever is needed, I do it, and I can use both feet very well</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Lainez has expressed his joy at finishing in the top 10 of this year’s NxGn]</b> This is what this competition offers; you get to face top teams and players. That helps you to keep growing as player and that’s why, for me, La Liga is one of the best two leagues in the world. From the best players, you always have to take good things, so I try to add their attributes to my game<br /><br /><b>[On The Mexican Messi’s moniker]</b> I think Mexican fans are really passionate but I like this! I’m just really happy to see Mexican fans supporting Mexican players who are here trying to realise our dreams. I’ve always said that I like positive comments about me because this means you’re doing well. So, I’m very happy to receive prizes like <b>[NxGn]</b> because this is another sign that I’m doing well<br /><br />It was something that I won’t forget. It’s always pleasing to score goals but this was something special. Things are going really well so far. I’m enjoying the way we work and I think I’m improving each day, in each training session. I hope to continue in this manner and just want to keep learning from all the awesome players that there are here. It is also a challenge playing for Setien. He is a coach who likes to keep the ball, really tactical. But I like this, I share his ideas on the game and this will help me to keep growing as a player. I haven’t played a lot in the last few matches but, since I arrived, I think I have played many minutes overall. Besides, this is part of football but the first year is always like this. But I’m pleased with the amount of game time I’ve had and when I have played, it’s gone well<br /><br />I think it was something I wanted and needed to keep improving as footballer. I’ve wanted to do it for some time. I think it was important for me and my development, to work in this kind of environment. I’m really happy, too, because America supported my decision and I’m also grateful to Betis for giving me this opportunity. In the end, I think Betis’ project was the one which I liked the most, both from a footballing and lifestyle perspective. And now I’m very happy to be here and just want to give my best for Betis. I want to keep growing; the rest will take care of itself. But I certainly want to win a trophy with Betis. Our first goal is to qualify for Europe, though. We’re working to finish as high as possible in La Liga. As for my own short-term goals, they’re just to keep growing, on the pitch and as a person, which I think is really important. Long term, I’d like to play in a World Cup or Gold Cup for Mexico, and hopefully win things with Betis.</p>
