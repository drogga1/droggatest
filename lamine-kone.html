  <p><b>[Lamine Kone on Falcao]</b> Is Falcao the most difficult player I have had to mark? Frankly, no. In fact, he’s quite easy to mark. There are far more difficult players in <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a>. Ibrahimovic is a genuine poison. Bafe Gomis and even Brandao are also very hard to mark</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> upped the ante further, bidding £25m, but Kone would later say Sunderland simply blocked his move]</b> There have been three offers, £18m, £20m and £25m. Six months before, Sunderland had bought me for €6m from Lorient. It was amazing. I started with Chateauroux, the second division club in France</p>

  <p><b>[Strasbourg’s Lamine Kone backs decision to end <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> season due to coronavirus]</b> It makes sense, because we are in crisis and with this pandemic it’s better like this. But for the competitor, it’s hard. I would like to play matches, see fans again. Unfortunately, for the health of all, we have no choice. We must trust what the prime minister announced. If we must wait until August or September, it will be very, very long. But it’s not for nothing that this decision was made<br /><br /><b>[The uncertainty over how <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> and Ligue 2 will settle those questions is weighing heavily on Kone]</b> I would like to know what will happen after … When will we resume and with what formula? If we start a new season, how? With the same teams? I have a lot of questions about contracts also. But today, I know that the (Strasbourg) president (Marc Keller) and the coach (Thierry Laurey) don’t have the answers</p>
