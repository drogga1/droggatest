  <p><b>[Figo Hails <a href="rui-costa.html">Rui Costa</a> Before Final Outing]</b> It is the club that have the duty to make the player happy: Rui left when and to where <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> wanted and needed. From that point of view, I even believe that Rui’s career might have been harmed. Rui is a unique player and deserves plaudits from all those who enjoy football. Football will win a great sporting director, I am sure of that, and <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> will only benefit from it</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Figo part ways with Premier Futsal]</b> I would like to announce that starting from today I am no longer the Honorary President of Premier Futsal having ceased my relationship with Premier Futsal Management (p) Limited.<br /><br />After two years of intense collaboration, I’ve decided to leave the project having in mind the complete failure of their representatives and officers to fulfil the agreement and, most important for their continuous breach of their obligations towards me and other players involved in the project. Nevertheless, I wish to reaffirm my continuing support for the long-term development of the game of futsal<br /><br />We had a few financial issues due to a hostile environment that was created for us to operate under and monetization became difficult because of the various hurdles. Figo is aware of all of the above and the reasons behind it, and he’s been kept informed completely. He’s been engaged for over 2 years as president and we’ve honored all obligations including his quarterly salaries during this period except the final payment delay. We respect his decision and thank him for the support over the years where he stood by three young entrepreneurs with a dream to do big things and contribute to the Indian sports ecosystem. We will be announcing our new president and the dates for the next edition soon. Next season onwards, Premier Futsal will have a longer season with more venues.</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Figo feels that <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and Croatia ace <a href="luka-modric.html">Luka Modric</a> is a worthy winner of this year’s Goal 50]</b> He is one of those who certainly deserved an individual prize. These awards are always subjective but, without a doubt, <a href="luka-modric.html">Modric</a> has had a wonderful season. He made the difference with his national team and with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. For this reason, his prize is well deserved. I live in Madrid and although we did not play together, we attended the same places, knew the same people, also shared family moments together. He is a great person and it makes me happy that this year he has won so many individual trophies<br /><br /><b>[Messi was, thus, criticised for perceived lack of leadership but Figo believes it is unfair to judge the 31-year-old too harshly for the contrasting quality of his performances for club and country]</b> The team-mates are not the same, the tactical systems are not the same, the opponents are not of the same type. When the quality <b>[of the team]</b> is lower, it becomes more difficult for a player to win a tournament like a World Cup on his own. He can make a difference in one or two games, but it’s hard to get to victory without having a high-level team. I think this is the big difference: between his club and the national team, there are different situations and limits that affect his performances.</p>

  <p>I don’t know what happened between <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> to make him change clubs. It was always a personal decision too. If you have the best footballer in the world and if he moves, of course, it makes a huge impact. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is a great professional, making history in football. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, one of the biggest clubs in the world and football is like that. Madrid will survive without <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is making history without Madrid right now, his life is football<br /><br /><b>[Figo was asked about the struggles of teams like <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in the Champions League despite spending a lot of money]</b> They have to be better than other clubs! Sometimes money doesn’t assure you a win in the competition. Of course, it makes you stronger to compete against the other clubs. But money doesn’t make you win the competition. I think they’re <b>[playing well]</b> well domestically. When you have a history in the competition, sometimes it helps you in a positive way. It happened with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, they have quality and history in the competition too<br /><br />VAR is a part of our lives right now. VAR must improve, like everything life. Right now, everyone in life depends on technology. In football, we have to adapt in the best way. I think it is to help the referee and be fairer in terms of justice. It is a positive tool for justice that will help.<br /><br />We have to really define the concept of VAR of how you use it. Everyone has to be a bit moderate. It is important that when, for example, it is important that when <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> makes courses for information on the VAR and call the coaches and clubs, they come and not just three of four people. Then you can’t complain when you don’t understand how it is being used</p>

  <p><b>[Figo compares <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> fans to demanding Real faithful]</b> I saw both sets of fans in different moments. In <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> there are certain players who are idolised and it is marvellous to play in an atmosphere like that. They don’t insult you that much if things are going well. Madrid have a great support which is accustomed to the best and that sets the bar very high<br /><br /><b>[Figo believes that <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>’s absence has been keenly felt]</b> It is logical for teams to need to rebuild when they lose such an important player, but the market is tough because there are not so many chances to buy key players who can help Madrid. He has been crucial. He has such great potential, but I think that due to his age he is lacking precision in front of goal</p>

  <p><b>[former Portugal star Costa says He have never seen a champion as hungry as Ronaldo]</b> How is he different? In the ambition. Never seen a champion more hungry than him. He lives every game as if it was the last of his career. With <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> I played the EUROs of 2004. Then he was a kid, but we were all old. We knew very well that he would become a Ballon d’Or winner. An anecdote? <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> was a crazy dribbler and every training session he showed us incredible things, and always different, with the ball. We almost never succeeded. Unfortunately, I did not have time to serve an assist to <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">CR7</a>.</p>

What is a Galactico? Luis Figo, who arrived in the summer of 2000 from arch-rivals Barcelona for a then-record 10 billion pesetas (£37.2m or €62m), was the first Galactico acquisition of the Perez tenure. The capture of Figo was a fitting statement of intent and they went on to win their first Liga title in four years that season</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Figo says <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> was a ‘good buy’ for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>, he is one of the best players in Portugal]</b> He is a different player, he is not a striker <b>[but]</b> a midfielder. In these days the market is not so big so it is difficult to find players because everyone is looking for that and the production of talent is not as huge as in other generations. So sometimes you have to buy different players<br /><br />He is one of the best football players in Portugal. He is in the international team, a midfielder that can score. He has the quality to <b>[score a]</b> goal and to be in the box. I think it was a good buy, I just hope that he can adapt as soon as possible to a different league</p>

The important thing is that he continues to be passionate about this sport, that he continues to improve, to want to be better every day. That is the way he will achieve everything he wants. <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> is a young player, one of the best in the world, one of the most expensive too.
