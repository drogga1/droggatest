  <p>[Last year was tough for MLS fans in Northern California] He demands it. He says, ‘Chase your player everywhere he goes.’ It’s not everywhere he goes, but if a man comes into my zone, I have to be really tight, don’t give him any space to turn or dribble. I have to take the ball or I have to take him down. It’s something that really excites me. I’m excited to take this challenge for myself and see how far we can go with it..</p>

  <p>[San Jose Earthquakes understanding what Matias Almeyda is asking ahead of 2019 season] It’s very clear. We talk so much, and he’s very open to talk and answer all the questions we have. Sometimes I have a lot of questions, but we don’t have an issue with that. Everyone is trying to help. There are a lot of guys on the team who can speak Spanish and translate for me, so it’s not an issue. We have meetings with video, replays, everything, all the small details which are important in soccer and it’s very clear. It’s very clear right now, but with so many new things we have to perform.<br /><br />That man-marking, to follow everybody, is something new for me and I’m trying to really pay attention on the right peopl. With two central defenders, one follows the striker and one is a type of libero. That’s something we need to be working on. We’ll make mistakes, but every training, we’re working on it. It’s a matter of time about how fast we’re going to learn and adjust to the system. It’s completely new for me too as a central defender because if a striker goes to the toilet, I must follow him there too!</p>
