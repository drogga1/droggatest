We need to let these young players grow and hopefully they’ll take us back to the Italy we’re used to. England have managed to go through transition while still qualifying. England have a group of young players with lots of experience. Our young players don’t have that experience. There’s no point looking back. We should look forward. We have a team with not much international experience. You can’t compare our younger players to the English ones.<br /><br /><b>[On Gianluigi Donnarumma]</b> Right now he should be thinking about his own growth, not about replacing Buffon.

With Manchester City when I received that offer <b>[in 2016]</b> I actually talked to the club, I talked to Juventus and we decided that it was good for me to stay and to keep on winning with Juventus.

I didn’t succeed to achieve and that was probably because in my heart I had already made the decision that I wanted to go back home. The decision was not made until June but it’s true that I had this feeling inside me. So when my agent told me there was a tangible opportunity to go back I just stopped listening to anyone telling me what to do. I stopped listening to any kind of suggestion and I just said: ‘OK, let’s go home’.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leonardo.html">Leonardo</a> Bonucci conceded his side struggled againts <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> and had to settle for a frustrating 1-1 draw in the Coppa Italia semi-final first leg at <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a>]</b> An away goal is important for a double leg, but we cannot be satisfied. We gave away a lot, and so we have to change gears, while staying compact and giving something more. We are where we should be right now, but we have to put into practice what we do during the week and continue to grow as a team. The management of the game and the dribbling must be better, we must put our players in a position to make a difference in the final 30 metres</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leonardo.html">Leonardo</a> Bonucci blasts <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> after toothless <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> defeat]</b> I could tell something wasn’t switched on. We were second to every ball. We got the first half wrong. We were second to every ball. In some games, you pay for the tiniest error. We were too stretched out, not aggressive enough and that is an issue of mentality, we should’ve woken up earlier<br /><br />They hit us when we were down to 10 men; that was the little moment when they were smart to hurt us. Now we have to get our heads focused on what awaits us on Sunday, then we absolutely must qualify in the second leg<br /><br />I didn’t tell <a href="blaise-matuidi.html">Matuidi</a> off, I told him the team includes those who are on the bench and we must all be ready to contribute. I could tell something wasn’t switched on with the 11 starters either. We’ve got to sort this out, as these are the things that make the difference</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leonardo.html">Leonardo</a> Bonucci has admitted to being in awe of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>’s physique upon his return from lockdown]</b> He is a super athlete, a great professional. He told me what he did to keep fit during the quarantine. He presented himself in perfect condition. He cannot amaze, he is a champion, from all points of view<br /><br /><b>[The 33-year-old admits that he rushed into his decision to leave <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> following their 2017 European Cup final defeat at the hands of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, but insists that the whole experience helped shape his character]</b> It was a difficult year for me. Both on a personal and working level. There had been disagreements and I, in the end, especially after the defeat in the Champions League, made an unpolished decision - but I have to say that that choice, that it certainly influenced my career, it improved me as a man. Those months at Milan allowed me to look inside and understand that my place was in <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, in this one that I feel like my family. I met beautiful people at Milan before among these <a href="gennaro-gattuso.html">Rino Gattuso</a>. It was a difficult year, but not in vain. At the end of which I was very happy to go home</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> defender <a href="leonardo.html">Leonardo</a> Bonucci has compared <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a> and <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Massimiliano Allegri</a>]</b> <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> is very good at managing the locker room in the most difficult moments of a season, to make the team understand how to manage the time of a match. He, in his five years, was a master in this. <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> is meticulous, passionate about tactics, he likes to make the team play well. He also learned, in these months of <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, what it means to be in the black and white world, where nothing is ever forgiven for failure. Since he is with us, I have seen significant growth. He has a great wealth of football knowledge but has been able to question himself, he has had the humility to understand the dynamics of this collective. I was pleasantly surprised, really. We have daily contacts, moments of confrontation. He is someone who wants to improve. I want to improve by understanding his football, which is original, different from what I’ve known before.<br /><br />I hope it will arrive at the normal end of the championship. If it were not so, a lot of stories, controversies, appeals would arise. I am not in favour of other hypotheses. If you stop, better finish it there and do not assign anything. Hopefully we arrive on August 2nd and announce a winner. Hopefully it’s Juve</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leonardo.html">Leonardo</a> Bonucci backed <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> team-mate <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> following his unsuccessful penalty against Milan en route to the Coppa Italia final]</b> Even the greatest miss. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is always important for us. He increases the pressure on opponents’ defenders. He was unfortunate today and <b>[Milan goalkeeper Gianluigi]</b> <a href="gianluigi-donnarumma.html">Donnarumma</a> did well. We’ll see a great <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and a great <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> again<br /><br /><b>[Prior to the Covid-19 crisis, <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> leaders <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> were a point clear of <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> after 26 matches]</b> The important thing was to qualify so we could play in Rome for our first objective of the season. It was strange and difficult at the start, an empty stadium after 90 days. We got a bit stretched out and Milan did very well with 10 men against 11. It was a draw, but we must look at the glass half-full, as our objective was to reach the final on Wednesday. We’ve shaken off a dark moment for the whole world and hope being back will give a bit of hope and joy to the fans at home. We want to dedicate something more to them on Wednesday<br /><br />I asked <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> to take a more central role, he was pleased to try it out and he played the game he needed to at this moment. He probably isn’t accustomed to missing a penalty, so hitting the inside of the post it could go anywhere and he was unlucky. I don’t think playing him a few metres more one way or another is going to make a huge difference to such a strong player. Everyone had a strong opening 30 minutes and then faded away</p>
