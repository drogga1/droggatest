Paris Saint-Germain have made contact with the representatives of Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci as they face up to the likelihood of missing out on Matthijs de Ligt.</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci believes his side have signed ‘the best young player in the world’ in Matthijs de Ligt]</b> Matthijs de Ligt is the best young player in the world right now. This step helps him to grow, and from us there was a warm welcome. Together with Merih Demiral and Daniele Rugani they are important young players who will help us reach every goal<br /><br />Juve is my home. I returned to Milan after a year because here I know what I can give and I feel I am in the right place. Every year we need to improve and this will be a year in which we will all improve. On a personal level I would like to go back to how I was two years ago because in the last two years I could have done better. I want to go back to the standard I set<br /><br /><b>[He has come up against Sarri teams before when the coach was in charge at Napoli]</b> I was struck by the ideas of Sarri, when you see them from outside you get a certain idea but when you are inside you understand the intelligence of a coach who has brought new ideas. The new season will be tough, especially in Italy, because Inter have taken one of the best coaches and Napoli continue to grow. In Europe we know that the great teams always improve and we will have to do battle with them</p>

  <p><b>[Leonardo Bonucci has said that racism is a plague that has to be eradicated]</b> It’s a delicate situation. There are certainly measures to hold the guilty ones responsible. I believe it is not right to generalise. We have entities and means to take the guilty ones and ban them from entering stadiums. And I don’t think this happens only in Italy, we have seen such episodes in other European leagues as well. So I think it would be too much to point a finger, but racism is a plague that has to be eradicated</p>

  <p><b>[Leonardo Bonucci says he wouldn’t trade his <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> titles to lift the Champions League, but warned the Italian champions will go into every European game trying to win it]</b> I value those I’ve won very highly. At <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> you always have to go onto the field ready to give your best. I wouldn’t trade any of the championships I’ve won for anything.<br /><br /><b>[Juve struggled in their most recent game , a 0-0 draw at <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a>, but for the Italy veteran, such an attitude is close to unthinkable]</b> It is not in the DNA of <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> to think of a draw. We will go onto the pitch with the desire to prove that the path taken by the coach was the right one, and to gain useful points to go forwards in the Champions League. It will be a battle. It will be a difficult test like all Champions League games. We go there with enthusiasm and energy because playing in this tournament is a dream. We didn’t have a great game in Florence, but the Champions League is another competition. Atletico are always ready for battle and we will have to play at a competitive level<br /><br /><b>[Two of the main protagonists from those clashes, experienced defenders <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Giorgio Chiellini</a> and <a href="diego-godin.html">Diego Godin</a>, are missing this time around]</b> They are two leaders within their teams and they have shown great personality. Giorgio’s loss for us is important both on the pitch and in the dressing room, but I also have a lot of respect for Godin. Without him, Atletico have lost something but they have been able to make up for his loss. We will try to make sure Giorgio’s absence isn’t felt</p>

We cannot concede so many goals</p>

In Turin, we will talk. There are still many games in which we will need the best <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>.

I’m fired up as it is to reach <a href="gianluca-zambrotta.html">Gianluca Zambrotta</a>’s 98. The important thing, then, is to show, against Bosnia that Italy treat every game in the same way. Of course, we’ll need desire and sacrifice to show we want to stay on our path with <a href="roberto-mancini.html">Roberto Mancini</a>, who gave the Italian people their enthusiasm back<br /><br />A lot has changed from the Sweden game, the coach but also the <a href="figc.html">FIGC</a> president who’s given us a breath of fresh air. Mancini’s very good at making us feel like a strong team, which we hadn’t felt like since our failure to qualify for the World Cup. It’s also thanks to a new philosophy: the first form of defence here is attack. It had been seen just before <a href="roberto-mancini.html">Mancini</a> arrived<br /><br /><b>[Leonardo Bonucci will today play against Bosnia-Herzegovina, who will have Scudetto rival, <a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> striker Edin Dzeko]</b> <a href="edin-dzeko.html">Dzeko</a>’s a truly great, international-level player and not just for Bosnia. He’s done very well in so many different Leagues. He has physical strength, technique and ruthlessness in front of the goal: I really like him. However, we’ve studied the first game, where we suffered: now we know how to mark him better</p>

We are not at the level of Spain, France, Germany and England because of our lack of experience. They have a lot of world-class players and we don’t, but we have all the qualities and the potential to reach that level<br /><br /><b>[The great <a href="arrigo-sacchi.html">Arrigo Sacchi</a> recently hailed Italy’s performances under head coach Roberto Mancini]</b> Thanks to <a href="arrigo-sacchi.html">Arrigo Sacchi</a> for the compliments, it is such a pleasure to receive nice words from someone like him. I was not expecting 10 wins, but of course I was expecting qualification. Winning games was not our priority at the beginning. Our main task was to do something new and different to make our fans happy and passionate again.

We are a group, we must be competitive until the end. The goal is to be at the top in the spring. Every day <b>[with Matthijs de Ligt]</b> you see the improvements and the qualities of a great player.

We gave away a lot, and so we have to change gears, while staying compact and giving something more. We are where we should be right now, but we have to put into practice what we do during the week and continue to grow as a team.

He, in his five years, was a master in this. <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> is meticulous, passionate about tactics, he likes to make the team play well. He also learned, in these months of <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, what it means to be in the black and white world, where nothing is ever forgiven for failure. Since he is with us, I have seen significant growth. He has a great wealth of football knowledge but has been able to question himself, he has had the humility to understand the dynamics of this collective. I was pleasantly surprised, really. We have daily contacts, moments of confrontation. He is someone who wants to improve. I want to improve by understanding his football, which is original, different from what I’ve known before.<br /><br />I hope it will arrive at the normal end of the championship. If it were not so, a lot of stories, controversies, appeals would arise. I am not in favour of other hypotheses. If you stop, better finish it there and do not assign anything. Hopefully we arrive on August 2nd and announce a winner. Hopefully it’s Juve</p>

It was strange and difficult at the start, an empty stadium after 90 days. We got a bit stretched out and Milan did very well with 10 men against 11. It was a draw, but we must look at the glass half-full, as our objective was to reach the final on Wednesday. We’ve shaken off a dark moment for the whole world and hope being back will give a bit of hope and joy to the fans at home. We want to dedicate something more to them on Wednesday<br /><br />I asked <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> to take a more central role, he was pleased to try it out and he played the game he needed to at this moment. He probably isn’t accustomed to missing a penalty, so hitting the inside of the post it could go anywhere and he was unlucky. I don’t think playing him a few metres more one way or another is going to make a huge difference to such a strong player. Everyone had a strong opening 30 minutes and then faded away</p>
