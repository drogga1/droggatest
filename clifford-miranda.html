<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Clifford Miranda turns to management]</b> Whilst still at Churchill <b>[Brothers]</b>, during the late stage of the <b>[2016/17]</b> season, Derrick first called me up asking me to take up <b>[coaching]</b>. At first, I was a bit hesitant because I was not interested in coaching at the time but he eventually convinced me to take up coaching. The opportunity of learning under one of the best coaches in India <b>[Derrick]</b> coupled with working at an organisation as big as FC Goa helped me in making my decision.<br /><br />I thought about retirement from playing from the past few years as I have not had the same consistency, as far as clubs are concerned, in a way I had with Dempo <b>[SC]</b>. After spending 15 years with Dempo I kept changing sides - from ATK, to Mumbai FC, Minerva <b>[Punjab]</b> and Churchill <b>[Brothers]</b>. The opportunities were getting limited and that’s when I thought that I will leave when I’m still good rather than having to leave quietly <b>[unceremoniously]</b>.<br /><br />I had done my coaching licensing courses as a form of a backup than realising later when I want to take up coaching and wait for another few years to get my licenses<br /><br />I want to thank all my coaches - Brahmanand Sankhwalkar, Mariano Dias and Jerome <b>[Dias]</b> for helping me through my youth days, Eban Mesquita and Mario - my PE <b>[Physical Education]</b> teacher at Agnel ashram school for spotting me and Ranjan Chowdhury for helping me in my time at TFA <b>[Tata Football Academy]</b>.<br /><br />My gratitude to Alberto Colaco for helping me throughout my career, Dempo chairman Mr. Shrinivas Dempo, <b>[late]</b> Manuel Rebello and Derrick for convincing me to take up coaching. I also thank all the fans who have supported me through thick and thin</p>
