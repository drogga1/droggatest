  <p><b>[Sanjeev Stalin - India U-17’s dead-ball specialist curving his way into the nation’s hearts]</b> Firstly, I’d like to believe my stint at the Chandigarh academy is the biggest factor in contribution to my development so far. The coaches were very supportive, as they wanted not just me, but every player in the academy to progress. They gave individual attention to all the pupils in the academy. Harjinder Singh sir was vital in aiding my development<br /><br />They focused on improving my qualities, as they knew the older we get, the we lesser we tend to learn new attributes such as control. We can improve on our speed but not control<br /><br />Even at this point in time I see players such as Daniel Lalhimpuia and Nishu Kumar at Bengaluru, the seniors who’d been selected into the MUPC team - with whom I played and gained a lot of experience from - and I feel happy<br /><br />When I was a junior, then three juniors got selected for the senior team in the MUPC Cup competition, by Harjinder Sir. After getting selected, we <b>[three juniour finalists in the team]</b> got even more confident in our abilities and I thought, ‘I have shown the right set of qualities to get here’. Everything changed from that point onwards!<br /><br /><b>[Questioned if a change in coaches had affected his role in the team]</b> No, <b>[I’ve had]</b> no role changes under Luis Matos sir from Nicolai Adam. He <b>[Matos]</b> already knew my qualities and is constantly playing me, which is a big plus. I don’t believe my style has changed but my game has. With respect to my overall game, I’m not overconfident. I’m just confident and in love with the ball. I just want to showcase my skill whenever I get the ball<br /><br />Abhishek <b>[Yadav]</b> sir is one of the reasons the team how the team was put together and he keeps everyone united. The head coach is also working a lot with us and we have improved a lot<br /><br />Yes, we are concentrating on set-pieces because they will be important during the World Cup. Goal scoring from set-pieces is a possibility and the team can then concentrate on defending to gain three points<br /><br />We practice on set-pieces everyday, whether it’s the right-side or the left. We can’t be certain on which side we’ll get a set-piece advantage on match day. I’m now confident and training with both feet. In the World Cup, we’ll only get one ball to deliver and convert. So I’m working hard on that aspect of my game<br /><br /><b>[Opining that Matos’ assistant coach aided them in making massive improvements during the tournament]</b> After the Mexico and Chile match, Hugo Santos paid a lot of attention to the transition of play - from attack to defence and vice versa. He told us where to improve individually, and we also analyzed a lot of videos. We were told in training what we do wrong and he makes sure we improve through qualitative feedback. It is a big confidence booster to us, because we can now pay with a lot of confidence</p>
