  <p><b>[Coach Tan Cheng Hoe has admitted that Kedah will need a bigger squad if they were to compete in the AFC Cup]</b> It would not be easy for Kedah if we qualify to play in the AFC Cup. If we go into the tournament without a good squad, it will backfire because we don’t have the squad to sustain our performance. As we know, the schedule might be similar to last year, so we need to rotate our squad often, and of course when we have to rotate, we still want our best players on the pitch for every game.<br /><br /><b>[Speaking about their clash with JDT next weekend]</b> We will go there with a positive mindset, and if we go there with that mindset, the result will be positive. There is no guarantee that in any football game that one team will definitely win the tie, and we have to chance the upset them. As a coach, I want to win there<br /><br /><b>[On Sandro Da Silva]</b> Sandro just came back to the squad and settled in quite well but he needs to regain match fitness and for Ilso, we can see his quality and I strongly believe he can deliver and score goals for us this season</p>

  <p><b>[Kedah head coach Tan Cheng Hoe praised his team for winning their first trophy of the season]</b> Overall, our players played really well because we know that to come here and beat JDT is not an easy thing to do. I have to congratulate the players because they played really well and managed to collect at least one point<br /><br />Of course, playing the first game of the season wouldn’t be easy for any team, as we are still trying to find the right tempo to play. But in the second half, we played really well and almost scored the winning goal but I think this is a good start for our team</p>

  <p><b>[Head coach of Kedah, Tan Cheng Hoe praised his team and believed that playing possession football helped them with the dominant 4-1 win over Pahang]</b> I told my players we must played with our style, with possession football and in the end, we scored the goal. Players did well to follow orders and played short-passing game. If we played long ball, we may not be able to compete with Pahang. We know they have good physical players so I told my players to be strong mentally. I think we always played well with this style but the season is still long, I want the players to be consistent in every game.<br /><br /><b>[On Farhan Roslan]</b> I think the turning point was when we scored the second goal. The players gained more confidence after the goal. Farhan did really well in training and I wanted to give him the chance. He rewarded us with a goal and that is what he is capable of</p>

  <p><b>[Kedah head coach Tan Cheng Hoe chalked his men’s inability to defeat Selangor in their Super League match on Wednesday down to their loss of focus]</b> We controlled the game and played well throughout the match, but Selangor’s fighting spirit and our loss of focus caused us to concede the penalty. I hope in the following matches my men will be more focused and mentally strong until the final whistle.<br /><br />After recovering from his injury, Sandro played exceptionally well and scored, congratulations to him. He’s a key man in our first eleven. I hope in the next match, against Melaka, the players will work on their confidence</p>

  <p><b>[Baddrol Bakhtiar will not start against Perak says Tan Cheng Hoe]</b> You see FA Cup, sometimes the lower clubs can upset the top. You see it in Europe, when top Premier League sides lose to lower ranked teams. But of course we have to come to Perak with confidence. It’s a tough match. After they changed the coach, they look like they have more discipline in their play.<br /><br />Their strength is that they have a never-say-die attitude. The way they fight, the way the fans motivate them. This year, Perak’s squad has good depth with some local national players and good foreigners. Even though they are fourth now, they are one of the contenders for the league also<br /><br />I’m a bit worried about Baddrol Bakhtiar. He got hamstring troubles but he’s here for the team. He won’t start for the team but we’ll see. We miss also Fakri as he’s out for another four weeks more with MCL and ACL concerns. Farhan Roslan picked up hamstring injury two weeks ago and he’s not 100% yet, but we’ll see how tomorrow <b>[Saturday]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Tan Cheng Hoe was pleased that his Kedah side managed to beat Perak but warns there’s still room for improvement]</b> I think overall we played well although in the second half, losing a little bit of our focus and concentration. The two first half goals gave us the confidence and we were keeping the ball well. We won the match but Perak almost scored against us in the second half<br /><br />In the future, I hope we can keep the same tempo throughout the game. I don’t want us to be under pressure because we are not keeping the ball well<br /><br />It’s referee’s decision. As long as my players play the way I want them to play, then I’m satisfied. I’m more focus to my team only<br /><br /> bit sad that he got a serious injury on his ankle. I hope he can recover during this break because we have important games to come. Amirul had been playing very well in the last few matches. It’s not easy to choose between the both of them <b>[and Akram]</b> but they did well<br /><br />All the teams want to avoid JDT!</p>

  <p><b>[Tan Cheng Hoe yearns for a possession-based football for Malaysia national team]</b> Of course when in 2014, I came into the team I try to instill short passing football. You see the modern game, team try to keep the ball possession.<br /><br />When you want to keep the ball possession, you have to go with short passes. When you play a lot of long passes, you can’t keep good ball possession. This is the modern way of football I need, especially with Malaysian players<br /><br />Because I’m been with the national team before, if the national team wants to improve, we cannot play the long ball game. Because we are Malaysian we don’t have the size and height to play that game. So that’s why when I come in to Kedah, slowly instill and practice with the players how to play short passes and support in between. Not too hurry to go forward. If you have an opportunity to go for goal, then you go<br /><br />You can see in Europe, those top teams are the ones with more possession of the ball. Might as well I try to do these changes. End of the days you can see the fruit of labour but there’s still room to improve for these players</p>

  <p><b>[Tan Cheng Hoe accepts favourites tag in match against PKNP]</b> On paper, they are underdogs and we are the favourites. But if you look at the matches they have played, they are a dangerous team. They have young players who are committed and never give up. I’m sure it will be difficult to play against this PKNP team.<br /><br />Their 9 and 19, the local players look dangerous. The foreign players are not bad but their centre back won’t be available due to red card picked up. The fans expect us to score a lot of goals but if we can score and not concede, that’s good enough for me<br /><br />Sandro is a doubt after the match against Perak in the last match we played. If he can join the training these one or two days, then we’ll consider him</p>

  <p><b>[Kedah boss Tan Cheng Hoe has blamed his side’s 5-0 hammering by T-Team on the individual errors committed by his men]</b> In overall, we conceded the goals due to the many individual mistakes we committed. I hope my men can bounce back in the next match.<br /><br />I think my players knew what they did wrong, and I want this to be the game that we failed to perform. I want them to turn around their form and momentum, with the help of teamwork. What’s important is the coming matches</p>

  <p><b>[Foremost on Cheng Hoe’s mind is the need for his side to recover from their demoralising defeat to T-Team last week]</b> I hope my men will bounce back from the league defeat and qualify for the semis. They surely want to end that low period and recover their spirit. I know it’s not easy to work on morale and mentality following the defeat, but we do not have time to get carried away, and must recover.</p>

  <p><b>[Tan Cheng Hoe named his 23 man squad plus one for the opening match against Indonesia]</b> We know Hazwan is a good calibre player in attack but he hasn’t played in a while and he struggles to keep up with the tempo of international match. However we’ll keep monitoring him in the Malaysia Cup. As for Faiz, he had fever and feels weak, so we had to drop him.<br /><br />Jafri Chew was someone we wanted to give a chance but he has to work harder to be part of the national team. These three players will be kept under close watch and after the Indonesia game, we might still call them if there’s any injury</p>
