  <p><b>[Coach Tan Cheng Hoe has admitted that Kedah will need a bigger squad if they were to compete in the AFC Cup]</b> It would not be easy for Kedah if we qualify to play in the AFC Cup. If we go into the tournament without a good squad, it will backfire because we don’t have the squad to sustain our performance. As we know, the schedule might be similar to last year, so we need to rotate our squad often, and of course when we have to rotate, we still want our best players on the pitch for every game.<br /><br /><b>[Speaking about their clash with JDT next weekend]</b> We will go there with a positive mindset, and if we go there with that mindset, the result will be positive. There is no guarantee that in any football game that one team will definitely win the tie, and we have to chance the upset them. As a coach, I want to win there<br /><br /><b>[On Sandro Da Silva]</b> Sandro just came back to the squad and settled in quite well but he needs to regain match fitness and for Ilso, we can see his quality and I strongly believe he can deliver and score goals for us this season</p>

  <p><b>[Kedah head coach Tan Cheng Hoe praised his team for winning their first trophy of the season]</b> Overall, our players played really well because we know that to come here and beat JDT is not an easy thing to do. I have to congratulate the players because they played really well and managed to collect at least one point<br /><br />Of course, playing the first game of the season wouldn’t be easy for any team, as we are still trying to find the right tempo to play. But in the second half, we played really well and almost scored the winning goal but I think this is a good start for our team</p>

  <p><b>[Head coach of Kedah, Tan Cheng Hoe praised his team and believed that playing possession football helped them with the dominant 4-1 win over Pahang]</b> I told my players we must played with our style, with possession football and in the end, we scored the goal. Players did well to follow orders and played short-passing game. If we played long ball, we may not be able to compete with Pahang. We know they have good physical players so I told my players to be strong mentally. I think we always played well with this style but the season is still long, I want the players to be consistent in every game.<br /><br /><b>[On Farhan Roslan]</b> I think the turning point was when we scored the second goal. The players gained more confidence after the goal. Farhan did really well in training and I wanted to give him the chance. He rewarded us with a goal and that is what he is capable of</p>

  <p><b>[Tan Cheng Hoe says his squad will be arriving in Kota Bharu with the intention of capturing their first three points away from home this season]</b> We want to win in Kelantan and we have two or three more days to prepare, as we know they have won their last two games.</p>

  <p><b>[Kedah head coach Tan Cheng Hoe chalked his men’s inability to defeat Selangor in their Super League match on Wednesday down to their loss of focus]</b> We controlled the game and played well throughout the match, but Selangor’s fighting spirit and our loss of focus caused us to concede the penalty. I hope in the following matches my men will be more focused and mentally strong until the final whistle.<br /><br />After recovering from his injury, Sandro played exceptionally well and scored, congratulations to him. He’s a key man in our first eleven. I hope in the next match, against Melaka, the players will work on their confidence</p>

  <p><b>[Baddrol Bakhtiar will not start against Perak says Tan Cheng Hoe]</b> You see FA Cup, sometimes the lower clubs can upset the top. You see it in Europe, when top Premier League sides lose to lower ranked teams. But of course we have to come to Perak with confidence. It’s a tough match. After they changed the coach, they look like they have more discipline in their play.<br /><br />Their strength is that they have a never-say-die attitude. The way they fight, the way the fans motivate them. This year, Perak’s squad has good depth with some local national players and good foreigners. Even though they are fourth now, they are one of the contenders for the league also<br /><br />I’m a bit worried about Baddrol Bakhtiar. He got hamstring troubles but he’s here for the team. He won’t start for the team but we’ll see. We miss also Fakri as he’s out for another four weeks more with MCL and ACL concerns. Farhan Roslan picked up hamstring injury two weeks ago and he’s not 100% yet, but we’ll see how tomorrow <b>[Saturday]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Tan Cheng Hoe named his 23 man squad plus one for the opening match against Indonesia]</b> We know Hazwan is a good calibre player in attack but he hasn’t played in a while and he struggles to keep up with the tempo of international match. However we’ll keep monitoring him in the Malaysia Cup. As for Faiz, he had fever and feels weak, so we had to drop him.<br /><br />Jafri Chew was someone we wanted to give a chance but he has to work harder to be part of the national team. These three players will be kept under close watch and after the Indonesia game, we might still call them if there’s any injury</p>
