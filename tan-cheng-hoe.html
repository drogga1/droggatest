  <p><b>[Coach Tan Cheng Hoe has admitted that Kedah will need a bigger squad if they were to compete in the AFC Cup]</b> It would not be easy for Kedah if we qualify to play in the AFC Cup. If we go into the tournament without a good squad, it will backfire because we don’t have the squad to sustain our performance. As we know, the schedule might be similar to last year, so we need to rotate our squad often, and of course when we have to rotate, we still want our best players on the pitch for every game.<br /><br /><b>[Speaking about their clash with JDT next weekend]</b> We will go there with a positive mindset, and if we go there with that mindset, the result will be positive. There is no guarantee that in any football game that one team will definitely win the tie, and we have to chance the upset them. As a coach, I want to win there<br /><br /><b>[On Sandro Da Silva]</b> Sandro just came back to the squad and settled in quite well but he needs to regain match fitness and for Ilso, we can see his quality and I strongly believe he can deliver and score goals for us this season</p>

  <p><b>[Kedah head coach Tan Cheng Hoe praised his team for winning their first trophy of the season]</b> Overall, our players played really well because we know that to come here and beat JDT is not an easy thing to do. I have to congratulate the players because they played really well and managed to collect at least one point<br /><br />Of course, playing the first game of the season wouldn’t be easy for any team, as we are still trying to find the right tempo to play. But in the second half, we played really well and almost scored the winning goal but I think this is a good start for our team</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Tan Cheng Hoe named his 23 man squad plus one for the opening match against Indonesia]</b> We know Hazwan is a good calibre player in attack but he hasn’t played in a while and he struggles to keep up with the tempo of international match. However we’ll keep monitoring him in the Malaysia Cup. As for Faiz, he had fever and feels weak, so we had to drop him.<br /><br />Jafri Chew was someone we wanted to give a chance but he has to work harder to be part of the national team. These three players will be kept under close watch and after the Indonesia game, we might still call them if there’s any injury</p>
