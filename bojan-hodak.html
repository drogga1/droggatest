  <p><b>[Malaysia U18 head coach Bojan Hodak has not set a specific target]</b> I don’t want to put too much pressure on the boys because it’s my first time with them. Another reason is that Thailand are traditionally the best side, and while there are Singapore and Malaysia, recently Timor Leste and Cambodia have recorded better results, as well as in development.<br /><br />I believe only Thailand are the favourites but we will go match-by-match. We played several friendly matches previously so there have been some good things. Some players showed potential. The tournament will be physically very tiring because there are matches every other day. I don’t want to put too much pressure on the boys, I just want them to give their best<br /><br />We did not talk about the target because I had only 10 training <b>[sessions]</b> with the boys. To be honest in the first 10 days we were only learning their names. The target is obviously to see improvement in every match. In the future, sure, there must be an objective to fulfill; in every tournament, every match and every friendly match. Maybe we’ll see a few of them who are good enough for the Under-23 team in the future, and some may be dropped because they cannot perform under stress in important matches. This is how you basically groom players for the national team</p>

  <p><b>[Bojan Hodak wants his Malaysia U19 side to provide an avenue for the youth development programme trainees to continue their progress in the future]</b> When TMJ <b>[Malaysian FA president Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim]</b> called me, he told me that the problem with the team is that these boys were not given exposure, this generation. In overall, the problem with the under 19 team in the past is that nobody really cared much about youth development, and this is the biggest problem in Malaysia.<br /><br />NFDP works at the grassroots level but when these boys become teenagers, there’s nothing <b>[for them]</b>. I think the first batch of trainees are now under 16 players, and previously players aged 17, 18 and 19 did not get much exposure. This is what TMJ wants to do, because in Europe 90 per cent of first team players have trained under youth development when they were young. So TMJ wants to focus on youth development. He gave me a two-year contract and told me what he wants to focus on<br /><br />For me, my current focus is on the AFF U-18 Youth Championship. This tournament will help us identify players because training can show only so much. But in the end playing in matches under pressure is when players show their real character; who can win the game and who will cave in. This will give us a better picture ahead of the tournament in November, the 2018 AFC U-19 Championship qualification in South Korea. Also, when we come back I’ll attend the President’s Cup and Youth Cup quarter-finals, and arrange <b>[the centralised training camp]</b> earlier in October so that we will have more time with the boys. Especially because some of the teams will completely stop training and release the players after the quarter-finals as they cannot pay <b>[the youth players’ allowances]</b>!</p>
