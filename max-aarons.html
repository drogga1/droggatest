  <p><b>[Max Aarons says <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> is crazy to watch]</b> I would probably say <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a>. The way he can switch a ball is top drawer. It is crazy to watch<br /><br /><b>[When selecting the best dribbler]</b> Robertson. When I watch him go forward, the way he takes on players and beats them he is great to watch<br /><br /><b>[When selecting the quickest man in his chosen position]</b> Definitely <a href="kyle-walker.html">Kyle Walker</a>. He is the quickest in the league. Explosive, big, strong. Hard to stop<br /><br />Someone like <a href="branislav-ivanovic.html">Branislav Ivanovic</a> back in the day at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. An absolute monster. <a href="antonio-valencia.html">Antonio Valencia</a> was a strong boy. Even <a href="kyle-walker.html">Kyle Walker</a> again. I missed the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> game earlier in the season so I havenâ€™t come up against him<br /><br />I remember watching <a href="ashley-cole.html">Ashley Cole</a>. No winger was getting past him. He was tough to beat. Top class</p>
