  <p><b>[Hibernian warn of tough times ahead with revenue set to halve for 2020/21 season]</b> We’re all excited that football is returning - but it will be behind closed doors, with likely limited attendance as a next phase. That means we continue to endure limited revenue opportunities for the foreseeable future. Therefore, several initiatives, activities and services at our club need to be paused or scaled back until it is safe, permissible and financially prudent for us to resume activity. We must now focus our limited resources on our core business - and that is supporting our first team to deliver success on the pitch. That is what we are here to do. This scaling back will have an impact on our people, and we enter into a period of consultation with them to discuss the potential impact on them. I would like to thank the contribution and efforts of all of our staff during this difficult time. I would also like to thank our supporters who, recognising the threat to the club, have responded. Around 8500 Season Tickets for next season have sold so far, with more selling each day despite fans knowing that the timing and shape of next season is far from clear at this stage<br /><br />We will get through this by all working together. Supporters, staff, management and players have all played their part so far, and I believe will continue to do so</p>
