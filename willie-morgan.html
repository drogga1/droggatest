<blockquote>
  <p>[On selling Paul Pogba and buying Lionel Messi] Mourinho’s buys have been diabolical and the way he wants them to play football, not just now, this is since he came, all that defensive football, hoping for a breakaway - that’s not what I want to watch and it’s not what Manchester United fans want to watch. If he was winning and he was getting away with it, you could say ‘at least he’s gone the right way’. But he’s not and it’s the standard of player [that is the problem]. I advocated Mourinho coming. I thought he’d be great and I thought he’d come and say ‘okay, this is Manchester United, this is how they play’ and join in. But he’s reverted to probably why he got the sack at Chelsea and the sack at Barcelona. He’s reverted to that. But you can’t blame him completely.<br /><br />He’s brought in [players] who he thought would be alright, they’re not. It’s not for lack of trying from the manager’s point of view. As a manager, if you’re sat there, you’re relying on your players. It’s soul-destroying if they’re not doing it for you because at the end of the day, you’re responsible. The players that are there now would not be there under Pep Guardiola. I think Pogba will go because you cannot have that festering behind the scenes. There will be pockets with him, pockets against him … you just can’t have it. Something has got to give and I think he will go. And hopefully, he’ll buy Lionel Messi and then we might have a chance!</p>

  <p>[Former Manchester United midfielder Willie Morgan claims that Jose Mourinho must drop Paul Pogba in order to have a chance of victory at Anfield] The game against Fulham, albeit it was Fulham, they played really well. They were quick, they were moving around, there was no Pogba in the team. He kills everything anyway, he’s just so slow and cumbersome. It was the first time they actually looked like a team.<br /><br />If he puts Matic and Pogba in midfield, the game stops every time they get the ball. So you have got to get the young lads in, a bit of movement, move the ball quicker. Rashford is a free player and can play anywhere, the kid is really good. I think we’ll get a result. Again it comes down to who does he play. If he plays Pogba and Matic we won’t win. If he plays the team that he played against Fulham I think we’ll get a result<br /><br />Liverpool are not that clever, you know. They’re getting away with murder at the moment. They’re getting all the luck in the world, they’re getting all the breaks</p>
