  <p><b>[Is VAR killing football’s soul or is it needed to stop injustices?]</b> It takes the excitement out of football; players don’t hug each other after scoring a goal any more, instead they look straight towards the referee. It’s removing the adrenaline and my enjoyment of football.</p>

  <p><b>[A conundrum fall into Simone Inzaghi’s on Sunday when he has to decide whether or not to start centre-back Stefan de Vrij]</b> We’ll play our usual game, regardless of the result. We don’t know what attitude Inter will have, but must focus only on ourselves. I had wanted to avoid this final day showdown, but we got there with a three-point lead and worked to be ready for this situation. We talked a lot in the locker room, the lads know what is at stake at the end of a very long season. We need the right approach, concentrated, humble and avoid errors. There has been so much talk about this, but I just watched him and had no doubts. I am certain he wants to leave his mark on this club, the fans and his team-mates. He’ll also want to show Inter what a great defender they are signing for the next five years. We know that there’s a draw open to us, but both teams will play to win. Inter have great players, an excellent coach and it’s an exciting challenge. I don’t like to say whether Lazio deserve the Champions League more than Inter or not. I only know that everything would change in terms of finances and prestige. We wanted this with all our strength, we played more than anyone this season and lost a few players along the way. I want to know that after the final whistle, this team gave all it had. We are at the final climb of a very long Giro d’Italia. Let the best team win..</p>

  <p><b>[Later that month in a game against Inter that finished 0-0, Lazio were denied a penalty by VAR, leading Inzaghi to fume that the video technology had cost his side seven points that season]</b> I’ll be honest, I don’t like this technology. I prefer the Europa League, where there is no VAR.</p>

  <p><b>[Simone Inzaghi has signed a contract extension with <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> that will keep him at the club until the summer of 2021]</b> <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> announces that it has renewed and extended the work contract of Mr. Simone Inzaghi until 06/30/2021. The choice to continue this journey together, the result of shared planning, strengthens the bond between the parties and certifies the unity of intent necessary to achieve the set sporting goals</p>

But I also believe the club has to consider offers when they come in and then make a decision. Milinkovic is 24 years old now, he’s no longer a kid. I can give him advice, he is at our disposal and hasn’t missed a training session, but then I don’t know what will happen. I hope he stays<br /><br /><b>[His current head coach is under no illusions about the issue of finding a replacement for <a href="sergej-milinkovic-savic.html">Milinkovic-Savic</a>, who has 22 goals in 125 <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> appearances]</b> We know that if he was to leave, we’d have some important shoes to fill. I hope he remains, he had a great pre-season training camp, but the market is open, and we are ready for any situation. If he were to leave, we’d need a physical player to come in the midfield. Purchases are targeted and chosen together with the club, we have sat down and talked calmly. If an important offer arrives, it is only right the club take it into consideration</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> coach Simone Inzaghi was happy with his side after they won a <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> match at Milan for the first time since 1989]</b> We won an important game, I think deservedly, against a side that in my view had a good performance but <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> played very well and did everything to win. It wasn’t easy after the equaliser but we wanted to break this 30-year taboo, especially as we won here last season in the Coppa Italia semi-final. I told my players we needed more hunger and determination than Milan</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> have won seven games in a row in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> and are only five points behind leaders Inter, prompting suggestions they could be in the title race]</b> We are in a great period of form. We should be ambitious, knowing also that six weeks ago people said we weren’t getting results but I remained calm. The club was always close to me, even when we lost, reassuring me there were no problems. I also have a squad that is always at the disposal of my staff and I. Now we enjoy this victory, which we hadn’t managed for 16 years here, a game I remember, because I was on the bench. We enjoy it for a few hours, but from Thursday we must get right back on track and aim to stay in the Europa League. We played well, created many chances and could have scored more goals, so I praise these lads for something extraordinary</p>

  <p><b>[Simone Inzaghi has acknowledged the threat <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> will pose <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> in the Supercoppa Italiana final]</b> He is a champion who can change the game at any time. We have to be on guard, knowing that, on paper, <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> have greater potential. However, all that matters is what happens on the pitch<br /><br />We are facing a team that has a great amount of capacity, intensity, and quality. I have told my team that we must remain concentrated. It won’t be like a league game. You play for a trophy in one night. You can’t make any mistakes because you have two teams that can hurt each other at any time. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> have great qualities. We will have to be very focused. In the league game, we conceded just the one goal. There is obviously no certainty of winning. We have confidence in our work. We face a team that has won the last eight league titles, so we will need the perfect game</p>

From tomorrow, we will return to group training. There is a desire to start again. A positive in the team? I don’t know, it hasn’t happened yet. We are waiting for the protocol to understand what to do. As Germany did, we hope to start again. Once a case is found, the subject will be isolated and the game should be played back at least a week later</p>
