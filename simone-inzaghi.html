  <p><b>[Lazio head coach Simone Inzaghi says that while he wants Manchester United target Sergej Milinkovic-Savic to stay, they must take offers into consideration]</b> My thoughts are that I’d like Milinkovic-Savic to stay. But I also believe the club has to consider offers when they come in and then make a decision. Milinkovic is 24 years old now, he’s no longer a kid. I can give him advice, he is at our disposal and hasn’t missed a training session, but then I don’t know what will happen. I hope he stays<br /><br /><b>[His current head coach is under no illusions about the issue of finding a replacement for Milinkovic-Savic, who has 22 goals in 125 Lazio appearances]</b> We know that if he was to leave, we’d have some important shoes to fill. I hope he remains, he had a great pre-season training camp, but the market is open, and we are ready for any situation. If he were to leave, we’d need a physical player to come in the midfield. Purchases are targeted and chosen together with the club, we have sat down and talked calmly. If an important offer arrives, it is only right the club take it into consideration</p>

  <p><b>[Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi was happy with his side after they won a <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> match at Milan for the first time since 1989]</b> We won an important game, I think deservedly, against a side that in my view had a good performance but Lazio played very well and did everything to win. It wasn’t easy after the equaliser but we wanted to break this 30-year taboo, especially as we won here last season in the Coppa Italia semi-final. I told my players we needed more hunger and determination than Milan</p>

  <p><b>[Lazio have won seven games in a row in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> and are only five points behind leaders Inter, prompting suggestions they could be in the title race]</b> We are in a great period of form. We should be ambitious, knowing also that six weeks ago people said we weren’t getting results but I remained calm. The club was always close to me, even when we lost, reassuring me there were no problems. I also have a squad that is always at the disposal of my staff and I. Now we enjoy this victory, which we hadn’t managed for 16 years here, a game I remember, because I was on the bench. We enjoy it for a few hours, but from Thursday we must get right back on track and aim to stay in the Europa League. We played well, created many chances and could have scored more goals, so I praise these lads for something extraordinary</p>

  <p><b>[Simone Inzaghi has acknowledged the threat <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> will pose Lazio in the Supercoppa Italiana final]</b> He is a champion who can change the game at any time. We have to be on guard, knowing that, on paper, <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> have greater potential. However, all that matters is what happens on the pitch<br /><br />We are facing a team that has a great amount of capacity, intensity, and quality. I have told my team that we must remain concentrated. It won’t be like a league game. You play for a trophy in one night. You can’t make any mistakes because you have two teams that can hurt each other at any time. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> have great qualities. We will have to be very focused. In the league game, we conceded just the one goal. There is obviously no certainty of winning. We have confidence in our work. We face a team that has won the last eight league titles, so we will need the perfect game</p>

  <p><b>[Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi eager to see <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> resume]</b> We are happy to start again. It is the wish that we finish the championship in favour of all the people who work in football and for the fans. The prerequisites are there. We coaches have all felt we want to start again safely. Regardless of the ranking, before the pandemic we were doing something extraordinary<br /><br />In our sports centres, we are in total safety, there are distances, we are checked every day. From tomorrow, we will return to group training. There is a desire to start again. A positive in the team? I don’t know, it hasn’t happened yet. We are waiting for the protocol to understand what to do. As Germany did, we hope to start again. Once a case is found, the subject will be isolated and the game should be played back at least a week later</p>
