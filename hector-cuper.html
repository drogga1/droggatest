  <p><b>[Hector Cuper believes <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> should be voted The Best <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Men’s Player]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is my compatriot and I had to choose him, but I don’t think this affected my decision. He’s the best player I saw in the last year. We’re speaking about the whole performance. He gave everything to lead <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> to the domestic double. That also applies for Argentina, where he did everything possible to win the Copa America, but he wasn’t lucky. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> won titles also, but I don’t think his performances were good enough to be the player of the year. Performance won’t be in his favour, it’s just the titles that would help him to be in the nominations. You can say I chose <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> for several reasons, not just because he’s Argentinian</p>

  <p><b>[Egypt coach Hector Cuper has played down his side’s campaign at the 2017 Africa Cup of]</b> The expectations here in Cairo <b>[for the Afcon]</b> are very high. <b>[This is]</b> mainly due to the traditions that accompany us <b>[for being]</b> the nation with most African titles and the hunger of the fans after missing the last three editions. I repeat that our main goal is Russia 2018. I am saying this because if things were to go wrong in Gabon, all the good effort that has been done in recent period will be undermined.<br /><br />Secondly, we have what it takes to win; we are not inferior to anybody but we will see what happens. I would be fine if we arrive in the final to continue my own tradition. I have played many finals and I lost a lot, but I am sure Egyptians will forgive if we <b>[fail]</b> in Gabon</p>

  <p><b>[Egypt coach Hector Cuper says beating Uganda and Ghana is nothing but a necessity]</b> The pitch was awful, also humidity and temperature badly affected our players’ performance. Plus, now, I have a crisis after <b>[goalkeeper Ahmed]</b> El-Shennawy was injured during the match. This leaves me with two injured goalkeepers and only one ready to start. We have no option but to win our match against Uganda. Even if Ghana defeat Mali, the group will still be complicated till the last round.</p>

  <p><b>[44-year-old Egyptian keeper Essam El Hadary’s heroic bedtime story]</b> We knew it would be difficult because Burkina were powerful and very quick. They were much fitter than us. They were even better in the second half with aggressive attacking. They wasted so many chances. Our players were fatigued so we aimed for the penalties because anything could happen there.</p>

It was hard to get back in the game. The conditions were hard and the professionals didn’t play well. We’ll try to get back in the future and won’t lose our focus. The Tunisian team are strong and deserved the win but qualifying isn’t done yet.</p>

To me, he is in an amazing position right now.<br /><br />Salah has got the mentality to keep playing at the top level for many years. I believe that Salah will not stay for long at Liverpool. Soon he will be gone to Real Madrid</p>

  <p><b>[Hector Cuper explained how plans are being made for his players ahead of the holy month of Ramadan, which begins in May]</b> The Egyptian Football Association has hired specialists to help me and the players during the fasting month of Ramadan. We will organise and monitor their eating and sleeping and hope that this will not affect them badly. It may be a problem for the coaches because the players will stop eating from sunrise until sunset, so it will not be easy during training but that is to do with the religion and I can’t prevent them from observing Ramadan. I respect Islam and all religions</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah is in line to start Egypt’s opening game of World Cup 2018 against Uruguay]</b> Salah is doing very well indeed, he’s recovered very quickly. We’ll see how it goes today. I can almost assure you 100 per cent he’ll play. We’re trying to make him feel confident. The doctors are giving him the option to play or not. I know him very well, and I’m sure he’s not afraid. A risk of playing a match is something we can’t hide. In terms of him on the pitch, he’ll have full guarantees. If we do see at the last minute there’s an issue, we’ll see if it can be resolved.<br /><br />Salah has three training sessions per day. He does training with the doctors, by himself and with specific exercises. He’s recovered from his injury but he still trains a lot. He has to do physical training and mental training. Why? That’s what he feels he needs to recover<br /><br /><b>[On Salah’s chances of outscoring some illustrious rivals]</b> He could be the top scorer and one of the greatest players. He’s shown he’s got great personality, talent and character. No-one thinks he can’t <b>[be top scorer]</b>. We’ll see great players here and he can be the greatest player <b>[of all]</b> at this World Cup</p>

Tomorrow <b>[Tuesday]</b> I am optimistic he’ll be able to play.</p>

He was with the doctor but I can’t confirm why he isn’t here. Problems within the squad? I don’t know what you mean. As far as I know there have not been problems. I don’t think <b>[Salah will quit]</b>. I don’t think it’s true because all those who are here really appreciate the opportunity. I don’t think that’s true.</p>

It’s the knockout stage, so we have no room to make errors. We will come to the pitch to win, but at the same time we realise Australia are a tough rival and one of the best teams in Asia.<br /><br />During the last three days we have tried to improve on all of our mistakes and we have tried to analyse the Australia side. Based on their advantages, we will make some changes but it doesn’t mean we’re going to change the system or style of our game. We will come to the pitch and the players will do their best to get the necessary result</p>

  <p><b>[Hector Cuper came to <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>’s defense saying that he’s among the best players in the world but confirmed that he has to stay humble in order keep this level]</b> <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> is an extremely important player and is among the five best players in the world. He reached a very high level and his biggest challenge will be to maintain this level. He will need to make a lot of effort and stay respectful and humble. The domestic manager has a sensitivity not present in the foreign manager. As for the foreign manager he needs to live in the country in order for him to understand the issues present within the field and the team. But at times too many emotions can harm the players as the coach needs to work quietly and coldly to take the right decision because too much emotion can make you take decision in a non objective matter<br /><br /><b>[The current Uzbekistan coach talks about Tunisia’s AFCON campaign and believes that Algeria will lift the trophy]</b> Tunis left the tournament on a very small detail, they qualified <b>[to the semi-finals]</b> despite not having played physical football. Tunisia were very bad in the first-half against Senegal. In the second-half Tunisia improved and created some chances but they made one defensive mistake that cost them an own goal<br /><br />In my opinion Tunisia were the favorites <b>[to reach the final]</b> because Senegal aren’t strong in my opinion. I also believe that Algeria are the best side and are the favorites to win the AFCON as they’re a very organized team and very balanced defensively and in attack</p>
