Why are Japan &amp; Qatar playing at Copa America 2019? In short, it’s to fill in the remaining gaps in the tournament. There are only 10 national teams in South America - Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela - and so CONMEBOL had to invite teams from another federation to compete as a 12-team competition</p>

Conmebol has confirmed problems with the VAR system used in Brazil’s controversial Copa America semi-final win over Argentina, with reports that Brazil president Jair Bolsonaro’s security team were to blame for communication issues. The South American continental governing body has insisted that the problems were fixed before kick-off in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday night</p>

  <p><b>[CONMEBOL have responded to allegations of corruption as they labelled <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>’s comments ‘unacceptable’ and ‘unfounded’ at the Copa America]</b> In football sometimes you win and sometimes you lose and accepting the outcome of a match with loyalty and respect is a fundamental pillar of fair play. Same goes to the refereeing decisions, that are human and will never be perfect. It’s unacceptable that because of incidents proper to the competitions, where 12 nations competed in, all in equal condition, there have been unfounded accusations that misrepresent the truth and put to judgement the integrity of Copa America. Said accusations represent a lack of respect for the competition, all the football players involved and the hundreds of professionals of CONMEBOL, an institution that since 2016 has been tirelessly working to professionalise and develop South American football.</p>

I hope the VAR and referees don’t play any part in the final and that Peru can compete but it looks tough to me. I did not want to be part of this corruption, we shouldn’t have to be part of this disrespect we suffered during the Copa America. We could have gone further but we weren’t allowed into the final. Corruption, referees and all the rest stopped people from enjoying the football</p>

  <p><b>[Copa Libertadores final moved to Lima amid continuing Santiago protests]</b> New circumstances of force majeur and public order, analysed and evaluated with care, considering the safety of players, fans and delegations, have motivated the decision to take the final of the Copa Libertadores to Lima, Peru and maintain the date of November 23. The choice of the new stage is based on an offer from the government of Peru and on the safety guarantees it has given. The decision was agreed upon with the presidents of <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a> and River and the associations of Argentina, Brazil and Chile and is also based on the policy of holding each of the single finals in different countries. CONMEBOL is grateful to the government of Chile for its active collaboration that different public bodies offered to organise the 2019 Libertadores single final. We wish the Chilean people and its authorities peace and goodwill</p>
