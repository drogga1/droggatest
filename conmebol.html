The announcement builds on the support of UNCAF’s six voting member associations that the United bid was honoured to receive in March. We look forward to continuing our conversations with Member Associations across the world, highlighting the operational and economic certainty of our bid with the entire FIFA family</p>

  <dd>Why are Japan &amp; Qatar playing at Copa America 2019? In short, it’s to fill in the remaining gaps in the tournament. There are only 10 national teams in South America - Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela - and so CONMEBOL had to invite teams from another federation to compete as a 12-team competition</dd>

  <p><b>[CONMEBOL have responded to allegations of corruption as they labelled <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>’s comments ‘unacceptable’ and ‘unfounded’ at the Copa America]</b> In football sometimes you win and sometimes you lose and accepting the outcome of a match with loyalty and respect is a fundamental pillar of fair play. Same goes to the refereeing decisions, that are human and will never be perfect. It’s unacceptable that because of incidents proper to the competitions, where 12 nations competed in, all in equal condition, there have been unfounded accusations that misrepresent the truth and put to judgement the integrity of Copa America. Said accusations represent a lack of respect for the competition, all the football players involved and the hundreds of professionals of CONMEBOL, an institution that since 2016 has been tirelessly working to professionalise and develop South American football.</p>

I hope the VAR and referees don’t play any part in the final and that Peru can compete but it looks tough to me. I did not want to be part of this corruption, we shouldn’t have to be part of this disrespect we suffered during the Copa America. We could have gone further but we weren’t allowed into the final.

The choice of the new stage is based on an offer from the government of Peru and on the safety guarantees it has given. The decision was agreed upon with the presidents of <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a> and River and the associations of Argentina, Brazil and Chile and is also based on the policy of holding each of the single finals in different countries.
