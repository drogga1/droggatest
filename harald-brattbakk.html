  <p><b>[Former Celtic and Rosenberg forward Harald Brattbakk on being pilot]</b> Being a pilot is much harder than being a footballer. You work hard physically as a footballer but the days are very short. I’ve been away from home a lot more as a pilot than I ever was before. I’m just finishing a five-day working period at the moment and I’ve been up at 4am every morning, which is a big difference to what I was used to. Then again, being able to see the sunrise - getting up above the clouds - is always something special. Also, I can be flying anywhere across Europe really but I’m based in Trondheim and flying back here takes me over my old stadium with Rosenborg, which is always nice</p>

  <p><b>[Former Celtic star Harald Brattbakk says The success of <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> and <a href="andy-robertson.html">Andy Robertson</a> in English football has not altered the opinion of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> scouts when it comes to talent in Scotland]</b> A lot of good players in Scotland are not rated high enough because they think that Scottish football is not good enough. Van Dijk had to go to Southampton and play two seasons before <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> thought he was good enough. They could have bought him for £50 million straight from Celtic but they had to pay £25m more from Southampton. That’s unfair. But it shows that there are so many good players in Scotland - even going back to the likes of <a href="henrik-larsson.html">Henrik Larsson</a> who scored 50 goals a season and went on to win Champions League with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. <a href="andrew-robertson.html">Andrew Robertson</a>, too. There are so many quality players in the Scottish system and I just hope that more get the chance to play for Scottish teams, but also if they want to move on, then it’s possible<br /><br /><b>[Current Norway star Ajer is said to be a summer target for former Celtic boss <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> at Leicester]</b> I don’t think Kris is the kind of guy that needs that to have a good career. Maybe like Henrik he can stay here for a few more years. But then money is a big issue. I heard Van Dijk doubled his salary going to Southampton and then doubled it again at least when he moved to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Obviously that can make a difference and you would be stupid to say no to doubling your money somewhere else. But it has to be a good match for the player as well. The money that is in football now is so big at that level anyway - if you have three million a year or five million a year, who cares? It doesn’t make a difference. It’s more important to choose a club that suits you. There are so many to choose from down south. And Kris has been brilliant. But what impresses me most is that he is good at school as well. He left school with all As. That’s equally impressive and tells me that he is focused on everything he does. He is not the quickest, he is a big guy but not the strongest. But he just puts together all these qualities and becomes a brilliant central defender. He is consistent most of all. He is very mature. He is important for Celtic and also for Norway</p>
