  <p><b>[David Platt on <a href="roberto-baggio.html">Roberto Baggio</a>]</b> One games stands out in particular, one against Ancona which we won 5-1. Baggio scored four goals in the first 20 minutes and killed the game off. I don’t think I’ve seen a better performance from any player in any game I’ve ever played in. For half an hour, he was on fire. As footballers go, he’s a genius</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[In an interview in 2010, recalling that moment against Belgium, Platt has no qualms in believing the goal sealed his move to Italy]</b> If I hadn’t scored that goal, I might still have ended up playing in Italy, but, realistically, I’m sure it was the catalyst. Italian clubs were looking for international names and, before that goal, I was only really known as a club player with Aston Villa<br /><br /><b>[Why did nobody other than Bari step forward with a bid?]</b> Genoa had a couple of sniffs, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a> were interested, but there was a fear of English players from the big clubs in Italy because they had their fingers burnt in the past<br /><br /><b>[Five months prior to Bari’s relegation he received a call from <a href="roberto-mancini.html">Roberto Mancini</a>, the <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a> skipper and talisman who would ultimately play a huge role in his life - but at this point, the pair weren’t exactly on a first-name basis]</b> We’d played <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a> a few times and I’d faced Robbie. But I didn’t know him and he’d tracked my number from somewhere. He said: ‘I know you’ve got a good relationship with your president, I’m sure you could push through a move to us’<br /><br /><b>[When the Blucerchiati played against <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> in the Stadio Delle Alpi in May - a game he scored in - Platt would recall that]</b> Robbie was playing, so I was marking him and hovering around, hoping he would say something<br /><br /><b>[In July 1993, the move to <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a> finally happened, with much-loved owner Paolo Mantovani paying £5.2m for him. In three successive summers, Platt had wracked up an accumulative £17.2m in transfer fees. Mantovani might have stumped up the money for him but he is unequivocal about who made the deal materialise]</b> I’ve always suspected I wasn’t on <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a>’s list that summer, because their president wanted to sign Marco Osio from <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> but he ran the transfer list past Robbie (Mancini), who had much of the say. I soon made the move<br /><br /><b>[He confessed to having envisioned winning trophies in England yet conceded he was torn between staying in Genoa, where he was settled, and with a proposal from <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> on the table, believing that at the age of 29 this was his last chance to join another big club. In his own words]</b> I couldn’t have my cake and eat it</p>
