  <p><b>[Celtic’s Odsonne Edouard aiming high amid <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> links]</b> I would like to become the best striker in the world. One of the best strikers anyway. I don’t know when that will happen. I live day to day and I enjoy my life. We will see in time<br /><br /><b>[Asked who he looks to for inspiration]</b> There are a lot of strikers I like. I don’t have one specific striker at the moment that I admire the most, but <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> - the Brazilian one - is the best. In the present moment I watch a lot of different strikers and I try to learn from them. I’m still young so I’m training a lot and every year I become more mature as a player. I work hard on all aspects of my game all the time, so everything is improving<br /><br />It’s very flattering but I try not to listen too much to that so I can focus on the team and helping them to win titles. <a href="henrik-larsson.html">Henrik Larsson</a> is a Celtic legend. When I was little he was one of the best players in Europe so it’s amazing that some people compare me to him<br /><br /><b>[Edouard himself has been linked with <a href="manchester-united.html">the Red Devils</a> among others]</b> I don’t know! Today I’m at Celtic, I have two years left on my contract, I’m very happy here and I enjoy myself. For now, there’s still two years on my contract and I am more focused on the five months that we have left for the rest of this season and the two titles we are competing for. And then we’ll see what happens after</p>

  <p><b>[Celtic striker Odsonne Edouard has been voted the Scottish Footballer Writers’ Association Player of the Year]</b> This year is nine in-a-row, and next year I hope it is 10 in-a-row. This will be historic for the club. It’s very important for the club, for the fans, for the team, for all of the staff. We now need to go back to work for next season, and I hope that we can win this title for 10 in-a-row</p>

  <p><b>[Odsonne Edouard plays down <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> talk and would ‘love to be a part’ of 10 straight Celtic titles]</b> Winning 10 in a row is very important for the club, the players and the fans. Of course, I would love to be part of it. No one knows what will happen in the future but I want to be a part of it. My first target right now is to play football again after so much time away from the pitch. I only set personal targets for myself once the season actually starts. At the moment, I am still under contract with Celtic and my priority is to get back playing again. In the future, we will see what happens<br /><br /><b>[Edouard added on being the subject of interest from Arsenal]</b> It shows you are working hard and doing the right things as a player. It is flattering, but I just concentrate on trying to play well for Celtic. That’s what I am focused on at the moment. <br /><br /><b>[Edouard went on to express his delight after becoming the first French player in history to pick up Scottish football’s top individual prize]</b> I’m very happy with the award. It shows I worked hard and had a good season. It gives me a lot of confidence for the future. The other three players on the short-list were not there by chance. It’s because they are real quality players. I’m very proud to be the first French player to win this award, I know how important it is. There were a lot of highlights for me during the season but the biggest one was winning the title for nine in a row. That’s the reason we play</p>
