  <p>[On Jack Wilshere] For me, Jack Wilshere is the best English footballer of all time. From Arsenal’s academy, he made it to the Premier League, and he became my idol. Jack is a natural talent, with an elegant control of the ball.</p>

  <p>[Ex-Arsenal youth star Chuba Akpom revitalising his career in Greece] Before I even spoke to [Unai] Emery I was realistic. There were good strikers ahead of me, more experienced than me. I’m still young so I knew I had to get more experience but I knew realistically I wouldn’t get much game time as I wanted. I spoke to the coach and he told me the exact same thing. It was good to get that honesty, that’s what you want from a manager. I took it from there and came to PAOK. I’m enjoying it so far. I’ve settled in. It’s exciting because we’re doing well in the league and it’s all looking positive. There were a lot of things [behind my decision to join PAOK]. I saw the team should have won the championship last season but they were deducted points. This season the ambitions are very strong. I spoke to the directors and chairman, they told me the ambition, they brought in new players and wanted to push for the league. They also said they could be involved in the Champions League or Europa League so that was a big motivation for me to come to PAOK.<br /><br />I’ve always said that all of the loans have helped contribute to the person and footballer that I am now. I’ve been going on loan since I was 18. Stepping into the man’s game at such a young age is really good. I was in different leagues in England, League 1, Championship. I feel like even though I’m still young I’m still experienced for my age. Sometimes when I say how old I am to people they think ‘he’s only 23’ but I’ve been around for a long time. I definitely think the loans have helped me develop as a player and a person<br /><br />This is when I was 19. We did a 10 metre sprint and when we did it the fitness instructor told me that ‘this is the record held by Thierry Henry before’. Obviously I was buzzing because Henry was rapid over short and long distance. I think I still hold that record actually, I’m not sure. I remember I saw him [Henry] around the training ground and I said it to him and he started smiling and laughing<br /><br />He [Wenger] was important for me to developing as player. He was the one who gave me my first taste of football. Unfortunately I couldn’t get the opportunities that I wanted under him but I do appreciate everything he did for me. Taking me on pre-seasons, putting me on cup games and Premier League games, giving me that exposure. He has a big part to play in the player I am now<br /><br />Alex is a very good player. The thing with Alex is that you need to know football to understand how good he is. Technically he’s unbelievable, his understanding of the game is unbelievable - one of the best I’ve seen anyway. I feel like you need to understand football to know this. He’s a perfect Arsenal player. When we were growing up playing football with eachother the coach used to say look at the way Alex does this, look at the way Alex does that because he’s got Arsenal in his DNA. He’s a good guy - we’ve been close friends since nursery, primary school - he’s a humble guy and we still speak about his games and my games. It’s good to see him doing so well at Arsenal even though it didn’t work out for me, I’ve taken another path. I’ve always said I hope we can play against eachother or play with eachother on another occasion. Obviously he plays for Nigeria so hopefully I can be called up for Nigeria and play with him. It’s just good to see two people that have grown up together doing their own things with their football careers<br /><br />They’re on fire We all have the same agent; me, Alex, Reiss and Jadon. It’s good to see them take off how they’re taking off. Everyone knew they had the ability, Jadon played for England. If it wasn’t for them taking that risk by going abroad to the Bundesliga they’d probably be still playing in the reserves somewhere. It’s good that they went out there and are showing their full potential. They’re looking like world class talents at the moment so the only way is up for them<br /><br />I always think everything happens for a reason. If you look back and say ‘what if’ you can say that at so many things in life. You have to make a decision and follow your heart and go with it. I’m actually very happy at PAOK, we’re top of the league, we’re competing in the Europa League and it’s good exposure for me. I’m getting my head down and keep working hard. My goals are to help the team win the championship because we can put ourselves in the history books as it’s been a long time since PAOK have won the championship. We want to qualify for the next phase of the Europa League and win the Greek Cup as well. It’s an ambitious team and I’m hoping to contribute with goals and assists as much as I can</p>
