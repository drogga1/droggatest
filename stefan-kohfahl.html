  <p><b>[When asked which player could go all the way to the top]</b> From the current squad, <a href="fede-valverde.html">Federico Valverde</a> is my absolute favourite. I can’t imagine the starting eleven without him. There will be a lot of talk about <a href="martin-odegaard.html">Martin Odegaard</a> as well. He had some difficulties at the beginning but so far he’s been playing superbly well at San Sebastian this season</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="toni-kroos.html">Toni Kroos</a> has proved to be an inspired signing from <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, with the Germany international helping <a href="real-madrid.html">Los Blancos</a> win 12 trophies since he arrived back in 2014]</b> It’s about making the right decisions quickly. <a href="toni-kroos.html">Kroos</a> might have slipped through the cracks as a teenager because he doesn’t have that maximum speed, but he is incredibly fast in his mind. He can also play with both feet, which adds to his ability. Anyone who is a youth-team player at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> can play football, and is fast. You can learn strength and tactics later but you have to have that speed of thought</p>

  <p><b>[Stefan Kohfahl says <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a>’s biggest problem at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> has been his vulnerability to injuries]</b> His ratings with Real are incredible. The problem is his vulnerability to injury. He is actually a shy and modest person, very introverted. He’s also under pressure, of course. It would make me happy if more respect comes from the audience and he gets back on his feet again.<br /><br />Real always has a large number of its own young players in the squad. That has always been a main focus. This season, with Nacho, <b>[Dani]</b> <a href="dani-carvajal.html">Carvajal</a> and <a href="casemiro.html">Casemiro</a>, there are again some top-class players. In addition, players like <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a>, <b>[Karim]</b> <a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a> and <a href="raphael-varane.html">Raphael Varane</a> came to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> at the age of 20 and have matured here to become world-class players. <a href="vinicius-junior.html">Vinicius Junior</a>, <a href="rodrygo.html">Rodrygo</a>, Valverde and <a href="reinier.html">Reinier</a> are also taking this route</p>
