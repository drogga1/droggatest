<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Felcra boss reveals why he took off Adib Zainuddin at halftime against Sime Darby]</b> Adib had fever but he persevered, and at halftime he told me ‘Coach, I can’t go on anymore’. His temperature was high so I did not want to take any risks, and took him off to rest for the next match <b>[second leg]</b>.<br /><br />We were under pressure playing at home, as we had to score. Our failure to put away the chances we had resulted in us not being able to play as well as we should have<br /><br />Thankfully none of my players will be suspended for the second leg despite having received bookings. And those who were injured only picked up knocks, and I expect them to recover in time for the next game</p>

  <p><b>[The defeat was the second year in a row they were denied promotion at the last hurdle, following their semi-final defeat to PKNP FC in 2016]</b> We failed to capitalise on the chances we had, and we committed simple mistakes. But that’s football, the side that make the least mistakes and take advantage will win. We played well throughout the whole season, but again we fell at the last hurdle. We failed to meet the objective and now I’m not sure what will happen. It is now up to the board <b>[whether to compete again in 2018]</b>, and I await their decision.</p>
