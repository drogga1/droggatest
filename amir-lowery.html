<blockquote>
  <p><b>[When realising the group at his first club wasn’t representative at all of the city]</b> It was almost 30 middle-class white kids. The inner-city kids, who are majority black or Latino, couldn’t afford it or weren’t getting those opportunities. They just weren’t in the picture<br /><br />I went out and started to look for kids to kind of shift the balance and in that process I met Simon, who was working with a local organisation here on a volunteer level called DC Scores<br /><br /><b>[The pair are now in their fourth year of running Open Goal Project, an organization that aims to help ethnic minorities access and pay for these opportunities]</b> Along the way, we’ve been peeling back the layers and discovering how much there is that affects the kids pursuing a youth soccer career and then connecting the dots up to the top level<br /><br />It’s becoming obvious why it’s impossible for these kids to access high-level soccer and why the national team looks like it looks still and we’re almost in 2020s<br /><br /><b>[Asked what it can do to address these issues, he says]</b> They have to want to do something. I think we have to cross that line before the conversation starts on what they can actually do. I think U.S. Soccer has been the main culprit in letting the system evolve into what it is today. Everyone is in it for what seems the profit motive rather than to develop good soccer players<br /><br /><b>[While in countries like England coaches spend a lot of time around the non-professional game looking for new talent, the attitude in the US is to focus on those already in the system]</b> The ultimate belief behind everything is that U.S. Soccer is missing out on the best players, or some of the best players, by neglecting kids in urban areas, by neglecting minorities. To just totally throw a blanket over everyone who can’t afford it and push them out of the equation, I think there’s a solid argument that we’re missing a lot of talent<br /><br /><b>[on Diversity]</b> I was playing club soccer here in the 1990s and my club team was more diverse here in D.C. than the team I was coaching. All the teams I played for were more diverse than the team I was coaching and the teams within the club. I haven’t seen <b>[an increase in diversity]</b>. I’ve actually seen the reverse. There’s not one Latina on the <b>[USWNT]</b>. In the entire population of the United States, which has many Latina, it makes absolutely no sense that there’s no one on that roster. That’s just not more representative.<br /><br />If not, I think we’ll suffer over the next 10 or 20 years. We’re essentially cutting out half of the population and not giving them access. We’re taking the best players from one half of the population. If you open it up to everybody, imagine</p>
