  <p><b>[Eder on Ze Sergio]</b> Ze Sergio is a great player and he is going through a great moment in his career. I know that he holds the position on the left but my time will come and i am fine with that . I am a professional and i accept that there is a great player ahead of me . I accept my reservation passively. but i will eventually get a place with my ability and effort</p>

  <p><b>[Lille striker Eder is hopeful that his excellent performances in France will be enough to secure a spot in Portugal’s squad for Euro 2016]</b> I can’t talk myself into the national team. I can only show on the pitch what I can do for my club - and for Portugal. The rest is up to the national team coach. I am always proud to play for Portugal, and I will do everything to give my best performance to help the national team win for my country. Of course I want to score more goals for Portugal. But it is only winning that counts, regardless of whether I am scoring or not, and the only thing I can do is to focus on football and always work hard.<br /><br />It was amazing to qualify for Europe after how bad it looked for Lille halfway through the season. When I arrived, we were only 15th, and people were a bit afraid we risked going down. Then we hit great form - like a real top team. We have done a great job together, and a difficult season got a happy end after all. I am proud to have been a part of that. We have developed a lot as a team<br /><br />With the goal I gave something back to Lille for what they have given me. Everything I have done on the pitch for Lille has been to say thank you for the opportunity and the trust that this great club gave me. Everybody was happy after the win. It was so important to win that last game to qualify for Europe, and it is a great feeling. In my few months here in Lille I feel, that I have adapted well to French football, and that I have been playing some of the best football in my career.<br /><br />I feel I have a great relationship with the LOSC fans, and yes, it helps me on the pitch. I think they see that I always work hard for the team and try to do my best for my club - and for our fans. They have been really fantastic to me, but I have also given them some good goals to celebrate.</p>

  <p><b>[Portugal’s EURO 2016 hero Eder speaking on his tough upbringing, growing up in an orphanage, before his father was sent to prison for murdering his stepmother]</b> I can’t lie, it was hard. I was in an orphanage without my parents. Things can go badly in those places. I look at where some of my friends are now and they’re not very well. I had little contact with my parents. I was resentful. As I got older, my mum and I increased contact, but it was irregular. We don’t have a normal relationship because we lost those big moments together when I was growing up. Now, my mum and I are reunited and back in contact</p>

  <p><b>[Inter attacker Eder remains optimistic about his side’s chances of qualifying for the Champions League this season]</b> There are loads of points left to play for and a long way to go. Anything could happen, we just have to keep believing. What we all want is to get back in the Champions League. We know we are off the pace at the moment, but you can soon change things with a run of wins. The only way you get out of a situation like this is by knuckling down. We are doing just that and I think we are on the right path. Pioli has only just come in and with each passing week we are getting to grips with what he wants from us. I believe we can be successful.</p>

I’m very happy, but I still have lots to learn. Playing for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> has been a dream for me ever since I was very young. Thanks to God, I have the chance to be here and I was to enjoy this opportunity. I hope I can have a wonderful career in this shirt. It’s an incredible feeling to be alongside the best defenders and fullbacks in world football. I hope I can help the team because these are fantastic players. I did what the coach asked of me and I hope things carry on in this vein</p>
