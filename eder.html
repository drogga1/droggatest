  <p><b>[Eder on Ze Sergio]</b> Ze Sergio is a great player and he is going through a great moment in his career. I know that he holds the position on the left but my time will come and i am fine with that . I am a professional and i accept that there is a great player ahead of me . I accept my reservation passively. but i will eventually get a place with my ability and effort</p>

  <p><b>[Portugal’s EURO 2016 hero Eder speaking on his tough upbringing, growing up in an orphanage, before his father was sent to prison for murdering his stepmother]</b> I can’t lie, it was hard. I was in an orphanage without my parents. Things can go badly in those places. I look at where some of my friends are now and they’re not very well. I had little contact with my parents. I was resentful. As I got older, my mum and I increased contact, but it was irregular. We don’t have a normal relationship because we lost those big moments together when I was growing up. Now, my mum and I are reunited and back in contact</p>

  <p><b>[Brazilian defender Eder, who arrived from Porto, made his debut for Madrid against Salzburg. The 21-year-old featured in a back three alongside captain Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane before making way at half-time]</b> It’s a special feeling to play my first match for the best club in the world. I’m very happy, but I still have lots to learn. Playing for Real Madrid has been a dream for me ever since I was very young. Thanks to God, I have the chance to be here and I was to enjoy this opportunity. I hope I can have a wonderful career in this shirt. It’s an incredible feeling to be alongside the best defenders and fullbacks in world football. I hope I can help the team because these are fantastic players. I did what the coach asked of me and I hope things carry on in this vein</p>
