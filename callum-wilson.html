  <p><b>[Callum Wilson believes the introduction of VAR into <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is going to stop a lot of fun in the game]</b> Obviously I’m disappointed not to score the winner. It’s going to be like that next season I think. It’s going to stop a lot of the fun in the game. You score and you celebrate but then you are waiting for it to be allowed - and when it’s not it feels like an anti-climax. It’s frustrating on a personal note, of course. I don’t there was much in it, he’s a big centre-half and I only moved him to the side a little bit to get half a yard on him and he’s just dropped to the floor. If centre-backs are going to keep dropping to the floor next season there will be a lot of disallowed goals that shouldn’t be. It’s a contact sport and I think strikers should definitely get the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />I think against the Netherlands it was really heartbreaking. We all celebrated, we thought it was a goal and then the disappointment comes - it was the same <b>[against Switzerland]</b>. I think it’s going to improve the game. We’ve been on the wrong end of it twice but I do think it will improve the big decisions. There is too much in football now for the big decisions to go against you, especially the blatant ones</p>

  <p><b>[Callum Wilson has signed a new four-year contract to end speculation he could leave <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>]</b> We’ve improved in all areas since I initially joined the club but there’s still a long way to go. While <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> may be known as a smaller club, we’ve got some really big ambitions here. Everyone is pulling in the same direction towards those targets and goals. I feel like as an individual, my game is constantly improving here at the club. I want to continue that progress and reach even higher targets. I’m really excited about what the future holds</p>

  <p><b>[Callum Wilson is determined to stake his claim as England’s first-choice forward ahead of a Euro 2020 qualifier against Czech Republic]</b> <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> is a great player, I’m not saying I want to kick him out of the team but with injuries and things that happen along the way, you have to be ready to grasp the opportunity - whether it is one minute, 20 minutes or from the opening whistle. It’s not just thinking: ‘Harry is going to play’. I like to think I can make an impact. In Cup games, I tend to come on for <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> as a sub and you get quite a few goals from that. Defences get a bit tired, you run in behind and that’s the last thing they want to be up against. It has its pros and cons. No professional footballer will say they want to be on the bench. I keep working hard at club level to try to eventually get a starting place<br /><br />You watch how clinical Harry is in training, in the finishing sessions and there is no laughing and joking, just pure concentration. Sometimes in club football - and I’ve been guilty of this myself - you’ll be doing a finishing session but having a bit of banter with the lads; having competition, laughing and joking at people missing but in a game, that is not what happens. You have to be focused. Harry is in that frame of mind and I have taken that into my own training at <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>. When I’m working on my finishing there is no need to be laughing and joking. You can have banter in the changing room<br /><br /><b>[Even when he was playing non-League football, Wilson was adamant an England call-up would one day be on the cards]</b> When I was on loan at Kettering and Tamworth, I said I will play for England one day. Everyone calls me self-confident. If you don’t believe you can get somewhere you will never get there and it was always the aim to play for the national team and to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. When I got there, I felt I had been there before because in my head I had been there</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> striker Callum Wilson accepts his form this season does not warrant speculation of a move to the likes of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> Of course it is flattering, they are great clubs, massive clubs in the league. There were links and talks but I’m not one to read papers or listen to too much news. But you hear it from people - from friends, from family - and it only encourages me to do well really. Last season, my performances were quite consistent and, when there were links, I tried to stay at a certain level and play well. Any player would like to play in the Champions League and progress, that’s what I’ve based my whole career on. First and foremost is obviously keeping <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> up and safe and I haven’t been good enough this season to even be talking about things like that. I put it to the back of my mind and tried to focus on myself<br /><br />To be honest, I have the ability and I believe in myself to be able to play for these clubs and the national team. I haven’t been consistent enough with good performances this season but I have no doubt that when the season gets going again, or if it’s next season, I’ll pick up. I’ve put things behind me and I’m ready to go again. There are English strikers who have been doing well this season and would have fancied their chances for the Euros, but it being put back another year, we’ll see who is the most consistent. It’s about focusing on your club and then international football comes on the back of that. I’ll just be focusing on myself week in, week out and then come the end of the next season, hopefully I’ll find myself in the squad</p>
