  <p><b>[DC United has signed Venezuela international Junior Moreno]</b> Junior has established himself in the Venezuelan national team because of his physical presence and ability to connect the game in the midfield. He is adept at reading the game, making quick transitions on both sides of the ball, and he will provide us with tactical flexibility with his ability to play both holding and central box-to-box midfield positions. Junior is arriving at a great age with international experience in both World Cup qualification and the Copa Libertadores, and we look forward to his future with our club.</p>

  <p><b>[DC United has completed a trade with Atlanta United for the rights to winger Yamil Asad]</b> Yamil is a bright talent in MLS, who was a major contributor to Atlanta’s successful inaugural campaign. His pace, skill and creativity in wide areas will provide us with an additional attacking dimension. He’s a young player who plays with a big personality and a high work rate, and he will continue to develop and improve with more experience in this league. We’re thrilled to add him.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United star Rooney completes DC United move]</b> Wayne is undoubtedly one of the best players in Premier League history and his goal scoring record for club and country speaks for itself. He is a world-class player and he elevates those around him, both through his work-ethic and winning mentality. We are beyond excited to add someone of Rooney’s caliber and we are thrilled to welcome him to D.C.</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT goalkeeper Bill Hamid returns to D.C. United on loan]</b> Bill moved to FC Midtjylland at the end of last year and it was an important step in his personal and professional development. He’s a major part of the fabric of this club with his local ties, homegrown history and on-field accomplishments, so bringing him back on loan is a great acquisition as we make a push for playoffs at Audi Field. He’s a leader on and off the field and we’re excited to welcome him back to the club he worked tirelessly for over eight seasons.</p>

He is physically and mentally strong so we know that he is well-equipped to overcome this. The experienced medical staff at MedStar were able to discover it at an early stage and are optimistic that this is highly treatable.

  <p><b>[<a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> is leaving <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, and D.C. United is hoping to make his final season in the league a successful one]</b> This being Wayne’s last year, we want to finish strong and make a deep run. Wayne knows what lies with his future, his teammates know what lies with the future and the group collectively can say ‘Listen, we’re now in the final stretch, we know who we are, what we have, especially with the new additions. Let’s get to work and let’s compete for a trophy this year<br /><br /><b>[Midfielder Luciano Acosta has been linked with a move away from <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> in recent windows]</b> I think there’s flexibility with that. If he does move in the European window, or any league that has a window that extends beyond ours in <a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a>, we will be prepared for it. If he stays, we’ll have him as an option to make a deep run in the playoffs</p>
