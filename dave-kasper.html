  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney is leaving MLS, and D.C. United is hoping to make his final season in the league a successful one]</b> This being Wayne’s last year, we want to finish strong and make a deep run. Wayne knows what lies with his future, his teammates know what lies with the future and the group collectively can say ‘Listen, we’re now in the final stretch, we know who we are, what we have, especially with the new additions. Let’s get to work and let’s compete for a trophy this year<br /><br /><b>[Midfielder Luciano Acosta has been linked with a move away from MLS in recent windows]</b> I think there’s flexibility with that. If he does move in the European window, or any league that has a window that extends beyond ours in Major League Soccer, we will be prepared for it. If he stays, we’ll have him as an option to make a deep run in the playoffs</p>
