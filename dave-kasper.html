  <p><b>[DC United lays groundwork for new era under Ben Olsen]</b> We went very vet heavy to get ourselves back on track, and that was a team that was really built for a 4-4-2. But we were grinding out results, and we did it for a couple of years, just grinding and grinding. We really wanted to develop a more proactive team, a team that could possess the ball and create more chances and ultimately score more goals.<br /><br /><b>[Next came the shift to a fresh formation this past June. Some call it a 4-1-4-1, some call it a 4-3-3]</b> I think that completed our vision. The change of system was a very important part of our success and something we had talked about a good year and a half ago - that we wanted to change our identity and move to a 4-3-3<br /><br />Something we have talked about, really in the last 18 months, was identifying some young players who can develop now and help us win now, but have a view toward getting into Buzzard Point in the new stadium. But we don’t want to look too far ahead of ourselves because we’re in the now. We want to win now, and it’s important creating real momentum and buzz going into the new stadium</p>

  <p><b>[Capitalizing on the league’s influx of general allocation money and targeted allocation money, the D.C. front office put those resources to good use in building a core for the Audi Field era]</b> Thanks to our friends GAM and TAM, you can be more strategic and think maybe a little longer term with your investment. The main focus worldwide is to get younger players who can grow with the club, who are not the finished product, who have a ways to go, who can become a real asset down the line. That’s the way our league is going right now.</p>
