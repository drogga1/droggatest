  <p><b>[Michael Keane has revealed he hit rock bottom while attempting to cope with form and fitness issues following his big-money transfer to Everton]</b> I didn’t want to go out, didn’t want to see anyone. I felt a bit embarrassed with how things were going on the pitch so I didn’t want to be seen anywhere, didn’t want to do anything. I was keeping it in for a long time, working hard, turning things around on the football pitch but in the end it sort of got on top of me. I ended up not having a full breakdown, but I was basically in tears telling my family how I felt. That was a big breakthrough moment where I sort of got to my ‘rock bottom’. From there on I’ve got better and better with the help of my family and my friends and I started speaking to a sports psychologist which I still do now regularly to just keep on top of it</p>

  <p><b>[Everton centre-back Michael Keane has opened up about his battle with coronavirus]</b> I got the virus after we’d finished training but before the country went into lockdown. I went to play golf at Wentworth, felt ill driving home but my pals didn’t get it so I don’t really understand where I got it. I was in the shower and all of a sudden I felt like I was going to faint. It wasn’t something that I’d had before. I came out of the shower, I was soaking wet, just lay on the bed and I just needed to lie down. I didn’t think too much of it, I was OK but then I woke up the next day and I felt really off. I didn’t have a cough but felt lethargic, low on energy and then went to bed that night and had the sweats for two nights. I went out for a run, was going out for 20 minutes but had to stop after three and a half minutes because my chest wasn’t right, I was really heavily breathing and I had to stop and walk home. I knew at that point something was wrong. I told the physios and they sent me a test, it arrived six days later by which time I felt better but it still came up positive. Even when I felt better, it probably took two weeks for my chest to feel back to normal when I was running<br /><br /><b>[The England international says he is excited to start playing again after such a long wait]</b> Three months without football has felt like an eternity and I can’t wait to get back to playing for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> because I’m not sure I’ve ever gone this long without playing or knowing when I would play again. It’s been such a strange time as I had the virus myself early on, training at home in lockdown, watching Netflix and getting back to contact training with all the new protocols. It’s been such a long time and when it became obvious that we wouldn’t be going into training for a while, I turned my garage at home into a gym to keep myself fit. I’ve got a peloton bike in there, treadmill, weights and flooring and mirrors. It’s a good set-up and once it’s in place I had no excuse! You knew you had to put the work in, you can’t cut corners and, looking at the lads since we’ve been back, I think everyone’s done that. I watched lots of Netflix, Ozark, Money Heist and then Gangs of London on Sky. But I also got back in touch with my old youth team coach Paul McGuinness at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and I ended speaking to him four or five times on Zoom. He works for <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> now and he really helped me with a few things. We looked at some clips and talked about my footwork, how I can turn quicker and going through drills which I can use to improve that</p>
