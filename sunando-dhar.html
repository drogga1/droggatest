  <p><b>[Mohun Bagan have been banned from participating in the ongoing 2016/17 of the U-18 I-League for fielding an overage player as adjudicated by the I-League’s Supreme Committee]</b> We got a complaint from SAI Calcutta that one of the players of Mohun Bagan was overage and they had documentary proof which they submitted. We had asked that player to come to New Delhi for medical tests and he didn’t show up. There were two other dates given to him and he didn’t come. Then the Supreme Committee and Disciplinary Committee showcasued Mohun Bagan. We did not get a reply. The player was never sent to us to be medically tested. Mohun Bagan have been suspended for this season in the U-18 I-League.</p>

  <p><b>[East Bengal sticking on with Mridul Banerjee while Ranjan Chaudhuri assumes de facto charge]</b> For whatever reason, if a coach is indisposed, sufficient time and leeway will be given to the club to find a replacement - about 7 to 10 days - and by that time the I-League would be over</p>

  <p><b>[Initial reactions to Subrata Paul’s failed doping test: ‘We are Shocked!’]</b> First of all we are awaiting an official communication from NADA. Obviously, he won’t be allowed to participate in any tournament under the AIFF banner. Once I see the papers, then only will I be able to take a call on this. We want to see what the papers that have come from NADA state. Without look at that, it’s difficult for me to comment <b>[on Paul’s ban]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[Sunando Dhar welcomed Gokulam with open arms]</b> We would like to congratulate Sree Gokulam Group on winning the bid. It has been our endeavor to have corporate teams come into the I-League and the team from Kerala will open a new market for the league. It will be beneficial to both the Hero I-League as well as Indian football. I amm sure the passionate football fans of Kerala will be delighted to have a team of their own.</p>
