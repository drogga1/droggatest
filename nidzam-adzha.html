  <p><b>[Nidzam Adzha has insisted that the change of head coaches their opponents, JDT are going through, has no effects on his team at all]</b> For Kedah, we just want to focus on our team and our preparation. We really don’t want to know what happened in JDT’s camp. It doesn’t really affect our focus on the game.<br /><br />We already forgot what happened to us in the past. At that time, it was our second game after we signed new foreign players, and similar to tomorrow, I hope that our two new foreign players can adapt quickly to our style of play. A few players, such as captain Khairul Helmi and Syazwan Zainon are still injured, but hopefully they can recover before the game</p>

  <p><b>[Nidzam reckoned that it hampered them in terms of confidence - especially in front of goal]</b> The players proved themselves tonight, not me. They are very in-tune with the style that we’ve used all this while. For the players, no matter who’s in charge, they’ll perform. It’s the style for Kedah. We managed to stop them from scoring an away goal but from what we’ve seen tonight, we should have scored more. We need to continue at it and work on our finishing.</p>

  <p><b>[Kedah’s temporary head coach Nidzam Adzha was left disappointed after sloppy defending in the second half allowed PKNS to rescue a point]</b> First half we were leading 3-1, the players gave their best. But in the second half, we let in easy goals. The introduction of Baddrol and Syazwan was to use their experience to control the game. Not really missing Liridon <b>[Krasniqi]</b> and Rizal <b>[Ghazali]</b>. We see from the first half, we had a good momentum but we’ll need to check on our carelessness at the end that caused us three points.<br /><br />We’re not sure yet on Ifwat. We’ll check tomorrow and hopefully he’ll be alright for the FA Cup second semi-final. It’s our target for the game on 13th April. We hope to put out the best against NS. We’ll get back Liridon and Rizal for that game</p>

  <p><b>[Kedah’s caretaker boss Nidzam Adha said he made the right decision by resting his key men in their mid-week Super League against PKNS FC last Tuesday]</b> Praise God, I want to thank my men who displayed their utmost commitment and discipline in the match. The win is due to the decision to rest six key players against PKNS in our league match the other day, as preparation for the cup match.</p>

  <p><b>[Nidzam Adzha wants his players to focus on their game as they prepare to face Pahang in the 2017 FA Cup final]</b> The players are focus. They are comfortable playing at Shah Alam Stadium. We play every game like a final and tomorrow we will perform as per our usual performance. We will try to be the champions.<br /><br />I’ve already advised the players, the coaches don’t decide the final. It’s the players themselves. In the final, where both teams are quality teams. It’s 50-50</p>

  <p><b>[Kedah etched their name on the FA Cup trophy]</b> Thankful for the win. It was a tough game. Pahang attacked continuously and we made mistake in conceding those two goals. We were cautious because Pahang were playing direct football as they have good forwards and wide players but we manage to handle that situation.<br /><br />I don’t think we’re at that level yet. In the game itself, we were a bit yo-yo. After leading comfortably, we conceded and it’s something that happened in the league as well. The battle among the three will be a tough one. We know JDT and Pahang are good teams but we’ll try<br /><br />For me, he’s a good individual and we’re on constant contact. As for the shirt, maybe it’s just a coincidence</p>

  <p><b>[Kedah were held to a 1-1 draw at home by a defensive Selangor, but head coach Nidzam Adzha Yusoff acknowledged the custodian’s role in the clash]</b> Congratulations to the Selangor goalkeeper for performing splendidly in the match. I already expected Selangor to play that way, with five defenders and three in midfield, eight men in front of the goal. We were able to create chances, but we simply couldn’t put them away.<br /><br />My men were not able to keep up their speed, tonight’s match was their fifth match. They could not do more, and in the end we were disappointed by the failure to collect all three points<br /><br /><b>[Nidzam said that the key players who were absent against Selangor would be available in their next match]</b> For our match against Kelantan, a number of our players will return from injuries and suspensions. They are Fitri <b>[Omar]</b>, Akram <b>[Mahinan]</b>, Farhan Roslan, Syawal <b>[Nordin]</b> as well as Zac <b>[Anderson]</b></p>
