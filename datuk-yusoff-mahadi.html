  <p><b>[Melaka United FC manager Yusoff Mahadi has stressed the importance of their 1-0 away win over Sarawak on Saturday]</b> This is a very important win, to compensate for our defeat <b>[against T-Team FC last weekend]</b>. We have no other way but to recoup the three points on the road<br /><br />After we scored, thank God the players were able to fend off Sarawak’s pressing, and absorb the pressure of playing in front of thousands of the home fans. I’m very proud that the team were committed to defending the slim lead<br /><br />I hope the three points will galvanise us into playing better in the league. I hope it will restore the players and coaching staff’s confidence, that not only we can collect points at home, but also win away matches</p>

  <p><b>[Melaka United has taken the decision to rest Eric Williams from his duties as the head coach]</b> Williams informed me today that he is ill and we subsequently decided to rest him until further notice.<br /><br />We may make a change in our coaching staff as several players cannot agree with Williams’ coaching style. We will not make a hasty decision. I will discuss matters with Williams after the match against Felda and we will take it from there on whether we should look for a new coach</p>

  <p><b>[Team manager wants focus on SEA Games rather than the AFC U-23 qualfiers]</b> At this time, we’ve called 25 players for this training but only 22 will go to China. I hope this opportunity is used by the players to show their capability to achieve our target of going far in the SEA Games in our home ground even though before that, they have the AFC qualifiers in July.<br /><br />The friendly matches arranged in China. After they return from China, they will go for another round of training in Melaka which includes a match against Melaka United. Maybe there will be chances given to other players for that match because we have a list of 40 players to assess and test<br /><br />We hope we get a good position in the AFC but what is more important is to focus on the SEA Games. I consider that a big responsibility on us and we want to be there in action on the final day of the competition. We want to reach the final first then we can think about the gold medal. The teams we play in the AFC are also similar to the teams we will play in the SEA Games, hence that is also part of the preparations<br /><br />It’s not we take it easy there <b>[AFC qualifiers]</b>, we’ll still try out best. It’s just that since the SEA Games is held in Malaysia, we have to give that a priority because we don’t our team to failed on our home ground. It’s a matter of pride. We still consider the AFC qualifiers as a big tournament and coach Ong will get the support he needs</p>

  <p><b>[Datuk Yusoff Mahadi will ensure that all parties are heard before making the final decision on whether to retain or remove Eric Williams from Melaka]</b> Melaka will have big changes coming up as after the match against Felda where the result showed that we cannot compete. Melaka have start to press on the panic button.<br /><br />Initially we wanted to change two import players but now we are considering three players. As for the coaching position, we will finalise it this week. We’ve signed Jasmin to replace Godwin and Felipe to replace Aguero. The question now is on Spaso because we saw his performance against Felda wasn’t that good. We are also trying to secure a few local players on loan from JDTII and Pahang<br /><br />I have a long list of candidates <b>[for head coach post]</b> but we need to dig into what’s the issue. For me, Eric is a good coach but the problem is that until now, he’s found it hard to get a common understanding with the players. The players seemed unable to accept his training methods.<br /><br />I will meet the players after they come back from their holidays because what I want is a harmonious team. We cannot just take in new players when the team’s attitude cannot work with the coach. There’s still possibilities for Eric to stay if the players can adapt. I see there’s a crack in the team and everything will be cleared once I have the meeting with all parties</p>

  <p><b>[Relegation-threatened Super League side Melaka United will undertake a massive mid-season squad revamp]</b> It may be that the players are not able to adopt to his coaching style, but personally I know Williams is a good coach. A decision will be made soon. A decision will be made by the end of the week. We feel Spaso’s <b>[Spasojevic]</b> performance during the 0-3 loss to Felda United was not up to the mark and he missed a number of golden chances to score. We have listed a number of local and foreign coaches. But we will also speak to all the players to see what is the problem.</p>

  <p><b>[Malaysia U22 team manager Datuk Yusoff Mahadi is optimistic of his charges’ chances of qualifying for the 2018 U23 AFC Championship]</b> Malaysia U22 are a good side, we can see that they have the chemistry and spirit. But their fatigue led to them losing <b>[against Melaka United]</b>, while in the first half they dominated the game and played in an organised manner. Fatigue set in and Melaka took the advantage later in the game. However, judging by the previous matches they have the potential to shine in the AFC qualifiers and do even<br /><br />We have to go as far as possible in the qualification stage and we hope to earn automatic qualification. While for the SEA Games <b>[in July in Kuala Lumpur]</b>, we want to reach the final</p>

  <p><b>[Melaka United Soccer Association finally sees the start of the end point of on-going negotiations with former head coach Eric Williams]</b> Today <b>[Saturday]</b>, we received a text message from Eric Williams to MUSA official stating his agreement to accept the offer of three months salary payoff as well as rejecting the option to handle the Gold Cup or President Cup squads. Williams wants the payment in cash and a one-way flight to Australia.</p>
