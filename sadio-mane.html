  <p><b>[Having helped Senegal qualify for the World Cup, Sadio Mane speaks with Goal about his journey to the top]</b> When I was young, I would tell everyone that I am going to be a big player for a big club and they would laugh at me. It wasn’t because they didn’t think I was talented, but it seemed impossible to go from Sedhiou to the top. But I always knew I had it in me and that whatever it took, I was going to make it happen</p>

  <p><b>[Sadio Mane is not the stereotypical footballer]</b> If I have an injury or we have disappointment with a result, the only thing in my head is about the reaction. I cannot tell you what I told the player in a one-to-one meeting, but it was about what he did so far. One or two things not that good, but the rest good. So, let’s build on that and ignore the rest. That is how life is. You cannot think all the time about your mistakes because that makes no sense. You cannot forget all the good things. We are all a bit like that and sometimes people need help to realise again the good situation. He is in a fantastic situation where everyone loves him in the club. But he played from <b>[the heart]</b> and not from <b>[the head]</b> and nothing really worked out in the end. I like to be honest and I don’t want to say Sadio was brilliant when he wasn’t. Everyone could see that he struggled a bit</p>

I never doubted how I could help the team, and I never stopped working hard every day in training. I always tried to remain balanced, even when it was not working, because it is my job and I have to do it. It is part of football. I don’t know how to describe it, but it can happen to every single player and in my mind I was relaxed that it will change.</p>

We are going to do our best to go and win the final.<br /><br />I think it will be a little early to speak about the final because we have two more important games.

  <p><b>[Sadio Mane acknowledges that he is a lucky boy to have formed a fearsome attacking unit at Liverpool with Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino]</b> Like I have always said, I have always been enjoying playing alongside these great players. They make everything easier for me. I am a lucky boy. But we always talk about the front three. Don’t forget it starts from the guys behind. They make it easier. The power of Liverpool Football Club is the collective. We always do everything together, this is our power.<br /><br />I think more goals are coming! Of course, I am happy, but as a striker you’d love to score every single game to help your team. Now we have one more important game, so why not try to do our best, score for the team and win the trophy?<br /><br />It was not easy, especially from having the play-off against Hoffenheim and the group stage, but now we are in the final. Maybe that is a surprise for many people but for us it’s something we have always believed in. Of course it will not be easy because we know they have experience and also they have qualities in the team. We respect them a lot but we also have players and staff to beat any team in the world. We are going to go there and try to do our best, cause them the most problems we can and try to win the game</p>

  <p><b>[Sadio Mane admits he couldn’t believe it when the wrong team came after him in 2016]</b> I couldn’t believe it. Some teams wanted me - Manchester <b>[United]</b>, the wrong team wanted me. Of course, I spoke with Van Gaal, and they even made an offer. But for me it was not the right club, it was not the right moment. To feel this - the right moment, the right coach, the right club.<br /><br />Yes, I met him <b>[Klopp]</b>, I spoke with him about it. Salzburg were asking for 25 million <b>[euros]</b>, that was too expensive at that time, because I was playing in the Austrian league, no disrespect. I was not that good for 25 million and that’s why I didn’t go there<br /><br />Liverpool is different to many clubs I know and I have been. It’s like family, the people are so close and especially the players. It’s something that makes us stronger because you can also see on the pitch how close we are, so I think it’s also important for teams to have this kind of friendship in and out of the pitch as well</p>

  <p><b>[Sadio Mane reveals Firmino text ahead of Liverpool’s PSG win]</b> I think Bobby doesn’t need his eye to play so I told him! I sent him a message on Monday saying: ‘Hey Bobby, come on, we need you’. You’ve all seen the ‘no look’ goals so I think he doesn’t need his eye to play. I texted him saying: ‘You don’t need your eye!’<br /><br />It’s a great start. It is too early to speak about anything but it is very important for us to focus more because we are Liverpool, we are a stronger team, and we will try to do our best every game<br /><br />I think it’s a big result honestly. It is very important for us to keep going on our good run. It was not an easy game because PSG are one of the best teams in the world but we played very well and deserved to win. I think it is about desire and belief, it is what we try to do. We have quality in the team and I think it is mentally free to go forward and believe it until the end. It is what we tried and finally we scored the third goal, which was very important for the team<br /><br />It is normal if you see the high level of all of them. We have to be as professional as we can and try to recover as fast as we can. We also have a great team with many players which is very strong. If I am tired some players will be coming in. Sometimes you need <b>[a rest]</b>. You do not like to but sometimes your body tells you you need to rest. But the manager is prepared for it and he knows his team more than most so he tries to help us cope with it.<br /><br />This season we have improved a lot against teams all over the table. Even if it’s not the highest score we score but the most important for us is the three points. We know it won’t be the easiest game for us with a game every three days but we have to take it seriously and try to do our best</p>

  <p><b>[Why I wanted Philippe Coutinho’s No.10 at Liverpool]</b> I was very happy to get it because I have always taken the No.10 everywhere I have gone. When I first came to Liverpool, Philippe <b>[Coutinho]</b> had it so I was happy with my number 19. But when he left I thought: it is free, I want to take the number 10 because it has always been my favourite number. Everywhere I go, I wore No.10 and now I wear it for Liverpool<br /><br />Honestly, at the moment we have no pressure. I can say we have a good team, a big squad and we have got a good amount of points. So why create pressure? The confidence is here because we are playing well and winning games so we will try to take it game by game. It is early in the season, we are looking forward and we want to keep more focused than ever. This season we want to believe everything is possible. A team like Liverpool can do it, but it will not be easy. We have to believe in ourselves as a team</p>

I am happy and concentrating on giving my best for my team-mates, my manager and the fans<br /><br />Honestly, we are not thinking about Man City or any other team. There is no point putting more pressure on ourselves. It’s still early in the season. We have our work to do and that’s what we are concentrated on. We have to take the positives. Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham are very good teams and we have already played them all away and we are still unbeaten. Now we need to try to do even better<br /><br /><b>[Mane also refused to criticise the officials after he had a goal disallowed for offside]</b> I haven’t watched it back and to be honest I’m someone who is not really interested in this kind of thing. If you remember, when I scored a goal against West Ham earlier in the season I was offside and that goal counted. So if this time I was onside and it didn’t count then you just to deal with it and accept it. Officials are human beings and sometimes we all make mistakes. I think it was a good game, a difficult game. We were disappointed not to win because we had more clear chances than them. We struggled a little bit in the first half. Our pressing was lacking at times and it was too easy for them to pass it around. We needed to be more together. The manager changed some things at half-time and we improved in the second half. I know we can do better but a draw at Arsenal is not a bad result and now we have to move forward</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool hero Sadio Mane targets Champions League glory]</b> It’s the most enjoyable season I’ve had. Of course, I can say that. It wasn’t easy, but we tried to do our best. In the beginning, when we started the group stages, nobody expected us to go to the quarter-finals or the semi-finals, but we always believed in ourselves, gave everything and that took us a long way in the competition. Honestly, the Champions League is the dream of any player in the world. I know it was always my dream, for sure. Last season was the first time I had ever played in the Champions League, and we made great memories which will stay in my mind forever. We played great, great, great teams and had some amazing results. We gave a lot to try to win the final, but we didn’t sadly. That’s part of football. Now we have tried to forget about that and we are doing our best this season to try to go to the final again. And why not win it?.<br /><br />Honestly, I always enjoy playing alongside these great players. They make everything easy for me! We are very close, we love to play together and we love to give each other the pass to score. It’s amazing to play alongside them. Lucky for us, everyone talks about myself, Mo and Bobby, but, believe me, the work starts from the beginning. We are Liverpool, and we have a great team all over. They make the foundation for us, and make it easier for the forwards to shine<br /><br />For us, it’s a motivation, not a pressure. We are all still young, and we know we have a great team. We will continue to try to do our best, but it’s not pressure. Pressure doesn’t help. Of course, last season, nobody expected it from us, and maybe this year they do. But that’s not pressure; that’s motivation to do even better. You need that. The aim of any player is to get better and better and better. That’s why we work hard in training. But don’t forget that we are a team, and the most important thing is to win trophies. If my goals help us to do that, or Mo’s or Bobby’s, then that’s a dream. Of course, I would love to score more than I did last season, but only if it helps us to win!<br /><br /><b>[Mane, though, believes the Reds have what it takes. He believes]</b> We are on a good run, and we have started well this season. It’s too early to speak about the title, or winning trophies yet, but we can take it game by game. It’s not easy. There are so many great teams. Both the Manchester clubs, Chelsea as well. But we are Liverpool. We don’t concentrate on other teams; we are thinking about ourselves. Our fans, they make it easier for us. They play a big part in our success. Sometimes you can see that the team playing against us is scared a bit because of that. But that’s why they call it Anfield. That’s why we are Liverpool. We’re here to win</p>

We started fast in the game, we moved quickly with and without the ball and created many chances. We scored five goals and we deserved the win. The team was fantastic, everybody played well.

I said ‘Oh!’, and I looked at my team-mates … I was laughing and I said ‘we are a team so you have to trust me!’. They were all laughing at me but I said ‘from today, call me Ronaldo or Firmino!’. Gini <b>[Wijnaldum]</b> said ‘You have to score. If you score we’ll call you Ronaldo, if not, you’re shit!’. I was lucky to score two goals but honestly I don’t mind. I’m happy to play left or right side but if the team or the coach needs me as a striker, I’ll try again.<br /><br />Of course it is one of the more important derbies because we know what we want this season.

Mo, Bobby … it seemed like everyone was signing contracts and they were saying, ‘hey, Sadio when are you going to sign?’ I said to each of them, ‘don’t worry bro, I will sign’. And what did I do? I signed, so they are pleased now! I’m very happy here and I think people are happy with me too. We want to write our names alongside the many great ones in the famous story of this club. Hopefully it’s just the beginning of something special.<br /><br />The media seem to expect there to be, but I can honestly say it isn’t even a competition for us. I think you can see that in our relationship both on and off the pitch. Everyone is trying to do all that we can for the success of Liverpool - it’s not just about us. We just want to win trophies with this team. That is the priority. I know other players in the world have a rivalry going for individual awards, but for us it isn’t something we think about too much. If we do, we have a laugh about it and if one of us ends up winning, we are all happy. The fact we get short-listed for any individual awards can only be good for Liverpool and our countries because it means we are doing something right</p>

I want them to lose, and they are so good, and sometimes it’s difficult for them to lose.<br /><br />It could be <b>[the toughest game]</b>, but people expect the only tough games to be against the top six, but sometimes that’s not the case because it’s unpredictable. It could be Southampton. Sometimes you win easily with the top six, and sometimes you get a difficult game, but it’s the same with the teams at the bottom of the table. So it would be a bit silly to say Tottenham would be the biggest game<br /><br />People out and around the club are speaking about Mo because he used to score almost every single game. It’s almost normal because it’s football, but we all know him as somebody who is very, very relaxed with the situation. Sometimes it can happen.

That’s what makes you more motivated and makes everyone say ‘let’s go, we can do it’ so I think it’s always important. This is a very, very good sign and I think everything is possible so let’s do it and win it<br /><br />It was a really, really difficult game and you can see also if you don’t create many chances, it can happen. Also we have to respect <b>[Tottenham]</b> because they played very well, they were organised. But I think the most important thing today was getting the three points and that’s it. Yeah of course <b>[we can improve]</b>. But sometimes it’s difficult after the international break because we had three sessions together, or two I think, so everybody was a little bit away sometimes. sNow we are back and we start with a win, I think it’s very important.

  <p><b>[Sadio Mane admits he is enjoying a ‘great period’ at Liverpool]</b> I would watch Champions League ties when I was younger; back then, my ultimate dream was to play in the Champions League one day, so it’s fair to say it’s a dream come true. I watched the 2005 final with a friend who was an AC Milan fan, and at 3-0 up, my friend kept telling me: ‘It’s over, we’re going to win’. Sadly for him, they ended up losing, but it truly was incredible. And here I am today, playing for Liverpool. I’m enjoying every moment of it. I’m trying to give everything I’ve got so I can lift the trophy one day. The dream of any footballer is to improve year on year. This is a great period for me and I’m very happy because I’m helping the team. I think I need to never let my guard down because my dream is to improve every season.<br /><br />As a football player, you have to stand up to the pressure. You have to try and savour the moment. We are doing well in the competition and in the <b>[Premier]</b> League, so we just need to savour these moments and enjoy them. That’s it. We have to be really focused and motivated to achieve these goals<br /><br />We have good memories of beating <b>[Porto]</b> by a large margin. That was last year. They will be more motivated. That’s normal. One of the greatest mistakes we could make would be to rely on what happened last year. Last year is in the past, so we will try to forget that. They will really want to win. They have an objective just like we do. Let the best team win</p>

We have a lot more to see from him and I am sure we will see it.

I’m 100 per cent sure he will do incredibly well. He played well the last two games<br /><br />It is not easy to move from Germany to change clubs, especially as the league is not the same. I just talked to him to do what I can. It is part of the things you have to deal with and he is working hard every single day. I spend a lot of time with him, yes, and off the pitch I am very happy for him, he’s very relaxed. At the moment it is going well for him and everyone is very happy for him.

If you see those people, you push hard and harder to make them proud because it’s the only satisfaction they have on it. I have to give back what they have done for me</p>

  <p><b>[Mane: Title race far from easy for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, despite making it look like a stroll]</b> Easy? Oh, I wish. We know <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is the best league in the world and every single game you have to give 100% if you want to win. It’s what we always try and I think it’s working very well but we have to keep working hard to get what we want. Our target from the beginning was to win the league, so if we win it, it will be great for the club and for the fans<br /><br />For sure I think there will be one because he is a great manager and he is doing very well for the club and the players. He has his specific way of doing things and he gives his players more responsibility on the pitch which is really important. At the same time, he is very friendly with his players so that is one of his big strengths<br /><br /><b>[He added on his homeland being dominated by <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans]</b> Yes, for sure they do try. They are just proud and happy to see me achieving this level. Two years ago it wasn’t the case - there were more <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> fans but now it’s <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> everywhere. When <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> play now it’s like the national team is playing, so if we win this trophy, it will be massive</p>

  <p><b>[Mane urges <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to respond quickly after <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> loss]</b> The best team won today. In the first half we played well and created many chances but we just didn’t score, and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> had a few chances and scored two goals, so game over. We created enough chances to win, but we need to be more clinical in front of the goal and that was not the case. But that’s a part of football. I think in this moment you could be or could not be a champion, a great champion, and I think this kind of moment has happened to us, but it’s not the first time and it won’t be the last time. We have another important game on Saturday <b>[against <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>]</b> and then on Wednesday <b>[against Atletico]</b>, so for this game, we will be ready and we will be back again. This can happen in football and we’re used to it. We just have to keep working hard and keep going if we want to be great champions<br /><br /><b>[The reigning European champions were beaten 1-0 by Atletico at <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Wanda Metropolitano</a>]</b> We’ll learn from that defeat and then we’ll be ready to go again. We know it’s a different competition and it will be really important for us, but we’re playing at home, so let’s enjoy it</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> star Mane salutes ‘amazing’ <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>]</b> Jurgen is an amazing coach. He is always positive even if you lost and always finds the right words to push you to that little extra that makes you win again. He knows how to bring players to another level, when they thought they couldn’t play on<br /><br />Football in England is something else. Much bigger for the people and <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is the championship with the highest speed and quality.

  <p><b>[Sadio Mane says he would accept it if <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are denied <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title this season because of the coronavirus pandemic]</b> I want to win the games and I want to get the trophy, it’s what I would love. But with this situation, whatever happens I will understand. It has been difficult for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, but it has been more difficult for many millions of people around the world. Some people have lost family members and that is the more complicated situation. But for myself, it’s my dream and I want to win it this year.

  <p><b>[Sadio Mane opens up about his upbringing]</b> When I was young my dad was always saying how proud he was of me. He was a man with a big heart.

  <p><b>[Sadio Mane has outlined his ambition to achieve even bigger things at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I think this is another step for all of us in our career for what we want to achieve, because as football players you have to be always professional and always hungry in a good way to win everything. I think we have a great team, great staff and the club is amazing, so we have another step and big things to achieve so we won’t stop here. We just have to believe in ourselves still and keep working harder and be humble for sure - work hard and try to achieve bigger and bigger things with this club.<br /><br /><b>[Mane went on to thank <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> for bringing the best out of him]</b> He is a great manager and everybody is happy with him. I am lucky to be working with him for sure, because as a player and a human being I have developed under him which is really important for every player. We can see how the players develop in this team, so I think all the things come from him. So I will say again, thanks to him.<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether a win over the recently dethroned champions will top off a superb season]</b> For sure. Like I always said, we don’t have to stop and we won’t stop for sure after being champion. I think it’s another step of our careers and what we want to achieve so I can say for myself, it’s part of us and it’s the past now so we have to make sure we <b>[carry on]</b>. Records in football are always there to beat so for sure we want to achieve again something special after being champion. It’s going to be a really, really good game <b>[and]</b> for us there are no excuses, we have to do everything possible to win it because now we have seven games. We are going to take it game by game and try to win all of them because it’s our dream and really important for us.</p>
