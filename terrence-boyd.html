  <p><b>[Terrence Boyd invites former USA President <a href="barack-obama.html">Barack Obama</a>, who follows the club on Twitter, to a match at their 17,000-capacity ground]</b> We’ve heard that you follow us as the only European soccer club on Twitter. It’s a huge honour for us at Darmstadt 98. Now that you’ve got a little more time for yourself, we’d like to invite you to a game of The Lillien at the Böllenfalltor. We’ve got the fitting jersey for you as well. So see you at the Bölle</p>

  <p><b>[Former U.S. national team striker Terrence Boyd has hit out at <a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a>’s structure, saying the way the league is set up will continue to hold it back]</b> The league has a lot of potential but the structural things aren’t good. The system of a draft and the trades, no promotion or relegation – all that hampers the development. Furthermore, the developing of youth players is significantly worse than at clubs in Europe. The most talented kids do not choose football anyway, they choose the more important U.S. sports<br /><br />I should have been able to train with the professionals, but I saw zero chances of deployment. <b>[Lucas]</b> Barrios left the club, but there was still <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a>, who is world class on one hand and never injured on the other<br /><br />He’s the same way with the team as you see it on TV. He’s always authentic. When I, as a player from the second team, was invited for a training session of the first team, he came up straight to me and said, ‘Please, please be careful that you don’t hurt anybody.’ He definitely knew my style of play</p>

  <p><b>[Former USMNT player Terrence Boyd says <a href="donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> is one of the worst people on the planet]</b> I’m sad. <a href="donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> is one of the worst people on the planet. He’s driving his country apart and making things worse in the United States. I love the U.S., but I hate what Trump has made of the country.<br /><br /><b>[Asked what he would say to the president if he was to meet him in person]</b> Donald, aren’t you ashamed? But Trump is so egotistical that he wouldn’t even be bothered by that. <br /><br /><b>[Vandalism and violence towards police officers has been widely condemned by most, including Boyd, but a reaction to decades of discrimination must be loud enough to be heard, the striker concedes]</b> Of course, no cars should be set on fire or police officers attacked. Most police officers have families and are great people, but we have to be honest with ourselves: what other solutions are there? The protests have to be loud, it has to pop, because enough is enough. African Americans have to start up to the constant injustice. Racism is also a problem in Germany, but it has a completely different look in the United States. Germany continues to be a stable country<br /><br />Right now, during the crisis, it’s becoming even clearer how important Chancellor <a href="angela-merkel.html">Angela Merkel</a> is for our country. <a href="angela-merkel.html">Merkel</a> has the biggest balls of all the politicians in the world. We are leading the way through the pandemic. Everyone envies us – even the top three leagues are running again. We are governed by good, intelligent people. Here, when you are admitted to hospital, you are not asked first how you will pay for your stay – just like a 16-year-old cannot buy a fully automatic weapon. Germany is the best country in the world for me</p>
