I am very excited for that. I hope we can right what happened last season, get a good result, and win the competition.<br /><br />I think it will be tough.

We were a little bit disappointed after the final and now we are back and have won it again, the sixth time for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, it is something great. Last year it was disappointment. I was very disappointed that I got injured and went out after 30 minutes and we lost the game. It was something to motivate me to win today. I didn’t look at the picture for a long time. I just looked at it one time and said ‘OK, let’s go’<br /><br />I scored a penalty to send Egypt to the World Cup after 28 years in the last minute. So this one was easier! Our job is more mental and you have to believe in yourself before the game. You could see the players; we were believing in ourselves in the game. I think everything happens for a reason and the reason for us to lose the final last season was to come back and win it again<br /><br />The average age of <b>[the squad]</b> is 26/27 so we still have young players. It is good experience for us to win the trophy now and also last season we learned a lot.

It’s not over. It’s three games, so if you have a period of time where you lose two games, then you are in trouble again. Even if you win, there is still a long way. We are still in October, November so it’s still early to talk about the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah not competing with <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> &amp; counters critics of supposed selfish streak]</b> No, no, we don’t look at it like that. If none of us score and the game finishes zero-zero - which doesn’t happen often - we are really angry and we get annoyed by that. But when we’re on the pitch and we’re winning, it’s great<br /><br />Sometimes people judge you only on your goals, but honestly, <b>[the creativity]</b> is something the gaffer thinks about and talks to me about a lot. I think my team-mates are happy about it too. As long as I feel like am creating chances and giving assists for them, that’s great. Maybe people don’t focus much on that, but I like to give assists as well as score.<br /><br />In the last game against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, I gave Bobby <b>[<a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a>]</b> an assist and I was really happy for him to score. Without assists - and I don’t just mean my assists - you can’t win games. Also, I can’t focus too much on just scoring or finishing myself, because that means my game won’t really change and my opponents will figure out how to defend against me. If sometimes I get the ball and create a chance or give an assist, I can confuse them. It’s about being clever<br /><br />There is always a lot of pressure when you want to play at the top level, when you want to win trophies and a lot of individual trophies as well. There is of course a big expectation, but the best way to handle it is just to focus on your work and do it in the right way in each game</p>

Before this part of the season, I said I wanted to see the best behind-closed-doors football ever. I don’t know if we had that, but for sure it was the best counter-pressing behind closed doors ever! The attitude, the passion we showed was exceptional, and we played some outstanding football. Usually in my job I have to calm things down and say we can improve - and we can improve - but that’s not important tonight. We showed our supporters the respect they deserve - that we can play like they are here even when they are not. Yes, they can push us to incredible things, and without them it is nothing. I never missed them more than I did tonight because imagine this game in front of 50,000 people, the emotions that would have been in the stadium. It would have been incredible!</p>

I think everyone was excited to watch the game <b>[Chelsea vs <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>]</b> together. Some players wanted to win against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> there and some players said ‘no, let’s win it now and celebrate together’. It was an unbelievable feeling, when <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> scored the second one, it was like ‘wow’, it was a party. We tried to keep the distance but it doesn’t work sometimes but we did our best<br /><br />I do remember last year the game against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> away, when we drew <b>[in February]</b>, and I went to the dressing room, I put a towel over my head and I started to cry because that’s the moment I felt like we had lost <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I think after that game, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> stepped into first place then I was like ‘it’s going to be tough now because there are only a few games left’ and you have to wait for them to draw games or something. When I look back to that, it’s like ‘great, wow’, it’s unbelievable to win it this season after last season because we lost it with one point. It’s crazy to lose <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> with one point difference, it’s unbelievable. I think the first time we felt <b>[a big moment towards winning the league]</b> was when we beat <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> here <b>[at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>]</b>.<br /><br />We said ‘OK, now we’ll go for it’. Then I think a few games as well, like <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> here when we won in the last minute, we knew mentally ‘OK, this is our season now’. Last season, we didn’t have that luck. This season we had it - because you still need the luck anyway - so that moment felt like it was our season so let’s go for it.</p>
