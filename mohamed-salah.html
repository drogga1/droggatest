Unfortunately Louis went straight into a lamp-post while running after the car and busted his nose when he hit the floor. We were still trying to work out what had happened when Mo arrived. He’d seen one of the boys had hurt himself and he had the decency to drive back into the close to check that he was ok. No-one could believe it. Everyone was gobsmacked. Mo asked if the boys were all right and gave them a big hug which was what they both needed. It was a touch of class on Mo Salah’s part to turn round and actively come looking for the boys. He was really apologetic and saying sorry for something that wasn’t his fault. I’d just like to say a big thank you to him. He’s a top bloke</p>

I play on the wing which no one recommended. For a long time I didn’t play as a number nine. I’m comfortable with that. It’s not my first job. Like, the number one his job is only to score but as a winger it’s not just to score, it’s to give assists … and play with the team. I’ll do a lot of things to defend</p>

It’s our time to win it and it’s great<br /><br />We had a great performance today and all the players were unbelievable. I’m happy about the result and looking forward to the next two games. I think all the players are motivated, everyone is motivated in his way – but everyone is motivated to win the league<br /><br /><b>[Klopp dedicated <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s strong performance on Wednesday to the club’s fans]</b> We showed a lot, if not everything, which helped us into the position we are in. Before this part of the season, I said I wanted to see the best behind-closed-doors football ever. I don’t know if we had that, but for sure it was the best counter-pressing behind closed doors ever! The attitude, the passion we showed was exceptional, and we played some outstanding football. Usually in my job I have to calm things down and say we can improve – and we can improve – but that’s not important tonight. We showed our supporters the respect they deserve – that we can play like they are here even when they are not. Yes, they can push us to incredible things, and without them it is nothing. I never missed them more than I did tonight because imagine this game in front of 50,000 people, the emotions that would have been in the stadium. It would have been incredible!</p>

  <p><b>[Salah targets third Golden Boot after achieving <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title goal with Liverpool]</b> Winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is amazing for the club and the city. I’ve now reached my biggest goal, the one I set for myself since I signed for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. When I set my mind on something I want to achieve, I always do. If I’m convinced that I can achieve something, thank God I always do. The first question that I was asked since joining <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was that if we were able to win the league and Champions League. That’s why it feels great being able to win something I pledged to win. Of course I want to win the Golden Boot for the third time in a row, let’s see what happens. I’m focusing on the games and trying to make the most out of my opportunities. I’m sometimes unlucky but I never give up.<br /><br />While watching the game, some players wanted <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> to win and the majority wanted <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> to win so that we could celebrate winning the title together. I’m expecting a very entertaining game <b>[against City]</b>, because they’ll want to win at all costs and we won’t want to lose. That’s why I’m expecting a tough game and everyone will probably enjoy it</p>

  <p><b>[Salah ‘happy’ at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and dedicates <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title success to club’s fans]</b> It’s great to score goals to help the team to win games. So I feel like I am happy here, I am doing good and everything is also working well with the team and we’ve won trophies. Everything is good and I am enjoying it.<br /><br />It’s an unbelievable feeling to win a trophy like that. To win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> after long years for the club and the city, it’s unbelievable<br /><br />I can’t describe with words, it’s so hard to say that <b>[how it feels]</b>. When I came here, I said I wanted to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> - it’s my first thing in my head, I want to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and the Champions League. People said, ‘If you could choose one … ?’ But now I can say that I’d choose both!<br /><br />The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>, I can say now after we won it, for the city it is something else. Everybody is crazy about the result, everybody is crazy about <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. It is an unbelievable feeling for everybody, for all the fans around the world. Without their support, we could not do it. They did a great job, the players also did the same. It is a great feeling, I cannot explain it with words</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah: <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> title win an ‘unbelievable feeling’]</b> Winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> after a long time - and after winning the Champions League last year - it’s unbelievable! I think everyone was excited to watch the game <b>[Chelsea vs Man City]</b> together. Some players wanted to win against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> there and some players said ‘no, let’s win it now and celebrate together’. It was an unbelievable feeling, when <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> scored the second one, it was like ‘wow’, it was a party. We tried to keep the distance but it doesn’t work sometimes but we did our best<br /><br />I do remember last year the game against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> away, when we drew <b>[in February]</b>, and I went to the dressing room, I put a towel over my head and I started to cry because that’s the moment I felt like we had lost <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I think after that game, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> stepped into first place then I was like ‘it’s going to be tough now because there are only a few games left’ and you have to wait for them to draw games or something. When I look back to that, it’s like ‘great, wow’, it’s unbelievable to win it this season after last season because we lost it with one point. It’s crazy to lose <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> with one point difference, it’s unbelievable. I think the first time we felt <b>[a big moment towards winning the league]</b> was when we beat <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> here <b>[at Anfield]</b>.<br /><br />We said ‘OK, now we’ll go for it’. Then I think a few games as well, like <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> here when we won in the last minute, we knew mentally ‘OK, this is our season now’. Last season, we didn’t have that luck. This season we had it - because you still need the luck anyway - so that moment felt like it was our season so let’s go for it.</p>
