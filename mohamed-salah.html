When you score 10, 15 minutes in, it makes the game easier, less pressure. I’m happy about the start, but we have to keep looking forward.<br /><br />I said in the beginning, I always try to help the team. When you score of course you help the team.

We were all celebrating except Mohamed, who was crying because he had not scored a goal in this historic victory. That made me realise the depth of his passion for scoring goals. He was struggling to cover the long distance between his position, left-back, and the opponents’ goal. I think this moment was the turning point of Mohamed Salah’s career because I sat with him after the match and told him that I was going to change his position to use his outstanding speed and his passion for scoring. It was a great moment because, after moving forward, he managed to score 35 goals in one season with the Under-16 and Under-17 teams.</p>

In the beginning Mohamed kept the ball for too long and we tried, successfully, to change that. After a very successful season he became one of the important players in the team despite his young age. I sat with him and the team captain, Mohamed Al Aqabawi, and told him it was time for him to be the team’s hero. I was not worried that he might get more arrogant because I know his humble personality. In the same meeting, I advised him not to limit his ambition to just joining the local big clubs like Zamalek or Al Ahly, but to really think about playing in Europe - and he did it.</p>

  <p><b>[Egypt star Mohamed Salah has hit back at his nation’s FA, accusing the federation of neglecting player safety and comfort at the World Cup]</b> I did not ask for a special treatment from the EFA, I do not see myself as above any of my team mates in order to do so, and when I speak about the problems we had in Russia I’d like to speak for my team mates but I’m not entitled to do so, there are more important and older players than me there.<br /><br />I’m not speaking to cause problems; all I want is to tell my side of the story as the EFA did. First of all I did not like how they distorted the main problem. When I ask for something I do it for everyone in the team, last time we went to the national team I slept at 6am and could not go to the restaurant for breakfast or lunch because of all the people that were there. We need guards with the team while travelling, we have asked for that in a letter for the EFA but they never responded. Also they said that nobody knocked my room door at 4am to take pictures with me, anyone is free to ask the hotel or the players<br /><br /><b>[In a second video, Salah emphasised that]</b> I did not ask for privileges, that’s how it works everywhere around the globe, we are in 2018 and EFA still uses old methods and ways. I know that we have the ability to offer those things, for every player in the national team, not only for me. I think it’s reasonable to ask not to be disrupted by anyone during my own time in the hotel room. What I’m asking for is to be able to discuss those things with the EFA, they do not even respond. They make us travel in economy class, which is exhausting for every player; all the other African teams fly in business class. Again, I dare any one to republish anything that I said about personal privileges, and again I’m sorry for all my teammates. I’m not the captain but someone had to speak out, that’s all, and I’m ready to take responsibly for those words</p>

But I played with Liverpool on my console well before 2005.<br /><br />One or two months after I arrived at the club, I heard them sing my song and it was so special. That’s when I really felt the love and the fervour towards me. The fans are simply the best<br /><br />You can’t expect to get what you want without making sacrifices. I’ve always made big sacrifices. When I was young, in Egypt, I would travel nine hours each to train then return home in Nagrig. I needed to change bus four or five times. And when I came back, I would only see my family at dinner, then I’d go to lie down. At that time, there was no mobile internet.

I play No. 9 sometimes, I play on the wing, I play on the left side. We have a good connection together. We are a front three and we know how to play with each other.<br /><br />Firmino sits next to me in the game, dressing room. He doesn’t talk English much to the players. But we talk together maybe everyday. In the game I think we played together for one year. He gave me, I think, the most assists of the team and I gave him the same. We play close to each other, we know how to play. I think when football players play with each other they know how to play. It doesn’t matter about the language, it doesn’t matter how to talk to each other.

But the people don’t take it like that. They take it like: ‘OK, there’s a pressure now’. But in the beginning of the season you need to win the game to get the three points to be here now. So now you are top of the table or second and you have one game in hand, so you just need to be calm and play football. It’s a dream, to be honest. It’s one of my dreams when I came <b>[to Liverpool]</b>: To win the Premier League. I said that last season. Maybe the people were saying it was crazy, but it was in my mind always to come here and win the Premier League. I said it last season, I said it at the beginning of the season and now we are close.

I don’t like to brand myself a No. 9 because the way I play, it’s never like I hold the ball and am always physically strong. As a striker, I have to drop deep to get the ball and go past the players so, even when I play as a nine, my position is a different type of game to many centre-forwards. When I play No. 9 I drop deep to play as a No. 10, too, to keep the ball and dribble. I am always trying to help the team score goals and I am still one of the top scorers in the Premier League so I am happy about that</p>

I think the first time we felt <b>[a big moment towards winning the league]</b> was when we beat <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> here <b>[at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>]</b>.<br /><br />We said ‘OK, now we’ll go for it’. Then I think a few games as well, like <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> here when we won in the last minute, we knew mentally ‘OK, this is our season now’. Last season, we didn’t have that luck. This season we had it - because you still need the luck anyway - so that moment felt like it was our season so let’s go for it.</p>
