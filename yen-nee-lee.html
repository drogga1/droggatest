<blockquote>
  <p>Voters in Thailand will choose their next government on March 24 - after five years of living under military rule. The outcome of the election is unpredictable and could reignite tensions between supporters of the different political fractions in Thailand, said <a href="thitinan-pongsudhirak.html">Thitinan Pongsudhirak</a>, a political science professor at Chulalongkorn University. Such uncertainties are clouding Thailand’s economic outlook, economists from consultancy Capital Economics wrote in a recent note.<br /><br />… Thais have reacted enthusiastically to the long-awaited vote: Around 87 percent of the 2.6 million people registered for early voting cast their ballots in the last few weeks, according to various reports<br /><br />Harrison Cheng, associate director and lead analyst for Thailand at consultancy Control Risks, outlined his predictions for the major party in each of the fraction:<br />1. The pro-military Palang Pracharat Party, which named current Prime Minister <a href="prayuth-chan-ocha.html">Prayuth Chan-o-cha</a> as its candidate to lead the country, is expected to win up to 70 seats.<br />2. The anti-military Pheu Thai Party, which is linked to exiled former Prime Minister <a href="thaksin-shinawatra.html">Thaksin Shinawatra</a>, will likely be the best performer with 130 to 200 seats.<br />3. The neutral Democrat Party, led by another former prime minister, <a href="abhisit-vejjajiva.html">Abhisit Vejjajiva</a>, is forecast to secure between 80 and 120 seats<br /><br />Thailand’s Election Commission has until May 9 to finalize the outcome of the March 24 vote. In between, the current ruling junta led by Prayuth is still in power and election candidates could still be banned or have their votes invalidated, noted Harrison Cheng<br /><br />The uncertainties surrounding the upcoming general election are clouding Thailand’s economic outlook, economists from consultancy Capital Economics wrote in a recent note. ‘Whoever wins, the shift towards economic populism is likely to continue, delaying reforms needed to raise productivity growth and deal with the worsening demographic outlook,’ they said<br /><br />If there’s one silver lining for the Thai economy, it is that the new constitution requires the next government to stick to the junta’s 20-year national strategy plan, noted economists from Australian ANZ. The plan includes infrastructure spending and initiatives to lift Thailand up the production value chain. That arrangement could provide the policy continuity that investors seek regardless of the election outcome, ANZ said</p>
