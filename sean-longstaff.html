  <p><b>[Sean Longstaff admits to being flattered by reports linking him with Manchester United]</b> I just keep my head down. I am just trying to get fit - that’s all I can focus on. I am still a Newcastle United player. I want to get back on the pitch as soon as I can. That is what I am looking forward to doing. I make more and more progress every day, that’s all I look forward to. I can’t wait to get on the pitch and impress the new boss<br /><br /><b>[Longstaff admits that he has enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence, with a season-long loan to Portsmouth all set to be sealed 12 months ago before Rafa Benitez moved to block the switch]</b> If somebody had said to be me a year ago I would be in this position, I would probably have laughed at them. This time last year I was deciding whether to go to League One on loan. A year on, you are seeing your name linked with one of the biggest clubs in the world. For me, it is all a positive really. It gives you even more confidence. When I was in for a short amount of time people took notice of me. It is flattering but my job is at Newcastle. The new boss is coming in and it’s a clean slate for everybody - including me. I just get my head down and work on the pitch. Like anybody knows you are no use to anybody if you aren’t fit</p>

Manchester United have been dealt a blow in their pursuit of Newcastle United starlet Sean Longstaff after Magpies owner Mike Ashley said the young midfielder is not for sale</p>

<p>: 2019 07 28
Newcastle manager Steve Bruce has reiterated that midfielder Sean Longstaff will not be sold this summer amid interest from Manchester United.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Newcastle United midfielder Sean Longstaff has confessed that he was distracted by talk of a potential transfer to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> over the summer]</b> You can sometimes get distracted by the outside noise and maybe for a little bit in the summer I was a bit. It’s hard not to whenever you go anywhere you see your face on the front of a newspaper and you turn the telly on people are talking about you. And it’s not like they’re talking about little things, they’re talking about things that can change your life really. The expectation is half what I’ve done and it’s probably a good thing. It does just go to show I did impress people when I got my chance last year. So for me, it’s about not listening to them and sticking to what I do. I speak to Matty Ritchie a lot, he’s someone I lean on in the squad. He tends to keep us grounded and he’s always there with good bits of advice. Sometimes you can get distracted by figures that are thrown out there and you’re doing things you wouldn’t normally try to do. I think I spoke to him about it and he said the reason people are speaking about you is because of what you did and keep everything so simple and ticking along and you’ve got the other stuff there if you need it<br /><br /><b>[The talented young star claims he has not yet returned to the same level he reached last season, despite earning a regular place in <a href="steve-bruce.html">Steve Bruce</a>’s set up]</b> I’m not back to where I was last year but I’m getting closer and closer and I think it’s just about working hard and getting back to that level. The outside noise is something I try not to listen to. It’s always going to be there now – there’ll be more eyes on me now. Ahead of <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>’s trip to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> to face <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> on Saturday, Longstaff insisted he still needs to cut out moments of ‘sloppiness on the ball’, adding: I’m only going to get back to that level with games and it’s going to take a bit of time. The kind of person I am, I want to be there straight away. The manager has given us that reassurance it’s going to take a bit of time. I know there’s things I can do better but it’s all learning and I’m still young. I’m still enjoying it, I’m still going to keep working hard on the pitch</p>
