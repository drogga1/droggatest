He could be one of the all-time greats here. We shouldn’t be losing players of his quality. I’ve not spoken to Ross yet but I will be doing. I’d love him to sit down with a cup of tea.

That is what will dictate any future as <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> manager. The chairman is going to talk to me every day. There’s been no points total or number of matches mentioned. Hopefully it will be a run of games. The club needs a winning manager. That’s simple. There are some very good foreign coaches in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and British ones around as well</p>

  <p><b>[Unsworth unsure about <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> future]</b> I honestly don’t know. I’m scheduled to meet <b>[Farhad Moshiri]</b> on Friday afternoon with the chairman, but I speak to the chairman, two, three, four times per day. What will be, will be. All I know is that we’ll hopefully be as committed as that every game that I’m in charge. We can’t be where we are and expect to win every game. There’s an awful lot to work with there. It’s a very proud performance tonight. I just have to be committed. We have to try and win some games. There’s no points return or game total that we’ve been set. We’ll just plan game to game. I can only influence the training sessions and the games going forward. What’s gone on before is history<br /><br /><b>[Unsworth reinstated several of <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>’s fringe players back into his starting XI for Wednesday’s clash]</b> Sometimes you stumble across a formula. Beni wasn’t in the team last night. <a href="morgan-schneiderlin.html">Morgan Schneiderlin</a> was taken ill, and sometimes that opens the door for a young player. With me in the Under-23s he’s been outstanding. He’s very humble and we’re all proud of him tonight. I didn’t think Beni would be as good as he was. You have to have the confidence to play young players. I thought the pressing when we went in threes and fours was good. It’s not as good as I would want it yet. But certainly, when you put James McCarthy, Aaron Lennon, Kevin Mirallas back into the team, you get that response that we got tonight</p>

  <p><b>[Unsworth slams <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> mentality]</b> It’s not about me. It’s about the football club. It’s about getting over this disappointing result. We can’t cave in the way we do when we concede a goal. We need to rectify that very, very quickly. I’m really disappointed with the result. For nearly 70 minutes we were nearly perfect with our game plan. If you concede, for five or 10 minutes you all come together and don’t concede again. When you’re not winning games you do concede sloppy goals. The mentality must be stronger and we must have courage if we go a goal behind<br /><br />We have got to pick ourselves up really, really quickly. Sunday is a huge game for me, huge game for the club and I’ve left the players in no uncertain terms that it’s a huge game for them. What will be, will be. Whatever is best for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, I’ll accept</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> coach David Unsworth has lauded the ‘desire and ‘determination’ of Oumar Niasse]</b> Oumar Niasse has desire, determination, and that willingness to run and run until you drop. That is a pre-requisite for how I want every single player to go about their job. He is a great guy as well. I have had the privilege of working alongside him and now all his hard work is paying off in performances and goals. He is a handful because he never stops running. His fitness is so good, he works tirelessly for the team - he is a team-player and that is what this Club has been built on</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> caretaker boss David Unsworth says there has been no development in the pursuit of a new full-time manager]</b> All I can tell all the <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> fans is that the support I’ve had from every single <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> fan I’ve spoken to has been nothing but positive. They are fully backing the team. I’ve not been told of any frustration. They’re fully backing the team; you can see that in the way they have stuck with the team. The backing that we’ve had off our fans has been amazing. I thank them for that<br /><br />January is crucial. Everything I do is about <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. Conversations have already taken place on what we need in January. In all aspects of the job I am in communication with every department. That won’t change. I have had conversations with <a href="steve-walsh.html">Steve Walsh</a> and our recruitment department. We will continue have conversations every day.<br /><br /><b>[Unsworth insists Niasse was fouled by Scott Dann and believes the retrospective punishment sets ‘a dangerous precedent’]</b> He was shocked and I was shocked. He doesn’t tell lies and he wouldn’t go down without reason. He wants to score goals. Contact or slight contact, it doesn’t matter. We’re all bitterly disappointed. My view won’t change. Contact is contact. Anywhere on the pitch, it’s a foul. I think these people will be very busy if that’s going to be the case. You will have to look into every foul across the board. We don’t want contact taken out the game. I am all for protecting players but we do have to have experts who know what a foul is. It’s a dangerous precedent that could be set if decisions go against you that are debatable</p>

  <p><b>[Unsworth questions players’ commitment after Atalanta embarrassment]</b> I’d like to think every single player is hurting the way I am at the moment and if they are not then they shouldn’t be here at this great club. The minimum requirement is 100 per cent effort. Only those players will know themselves when they look themselves in the mirror at night. The players who have been asking me for opportunities to play in the first team were given that. I asked the players to make it difficult for me to leave them out of the team on Sunday and the majority have probably made it very easy for me<br /><br />The manner we capitulated <b>[in]</b> just isn’t acceptable and the players know that. What you can’t do at this level is carry players. When your best player is an 18-year-old kid <b>[Beni Baningime]</b> who’s only had a couple of first-team appearances that tells you all you need to know. Players need to take responsibility - senior players, foreign players, young players. <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> fans will be disappointed with what they saw and so am I.</p>

The second-half performance from all our team was unacceptable. I’m sorry for all the <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> fans who came down here and all the ones who were watching as well. We can’t keep performing like this, it’s just not good enough. We are in a tough moment and we have a massive week ahead of us<br /><br /><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> may go into that game with two key players absent after Leighton Baines and Michael Keane were forced off injured on the south coast]</b> Leighton said he felt his calf. We’ll assess him but it doesn’t look good for Wednesday. Michael Keane is different but I need to find out the latest on him.</p>

  <p><b>[Nathangelo Markelo’s hopes of new <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> deal ‘down to him’ as coach sets challenge]</b> I thought Nathan was terrific tonight, we’ve moved him to more central of the three role. He’s different to Beni <b>[Baningime]</b>, Beni will take it off the back players. Nathan is a great presser of the ball and sets things off. We’ve worked on that this week and, apart from the kick-off for the second-half, that’s probably his best game for us this year. If he were to put 10 games, like that, back-to-back, I’m sure Marcel would be getting a lot of phone calls about him<br /><br /><b>[Markelo was signed from Volendam in the summer of 2017 and Unsworth added]</b> When he performs like that you wouldn’t want to let him go and he’d be a massive asset but it’s really down to him, and his performances, what the future holds</p>

He trains with the first-team every day which is great for him and he’s getting his games with us. A loan might be a possibility but it wouldn’t surprise me if he stayed until the end of the season with the first-team so who knows?</p>
