  <p><b>[Josh Murphy insists he has been ignoring reports linking him with a move to Chelsea, instead focusing on securing promotion back to the Premier League with Cardiff City]</b> I can tell you I took no notice of it <b>[being linked with Chelsea]</b>. I don’t know if there’s any truth in it, but I took no notice of it. I wouldn’t say it is a distraction, stuff like that is always going to happen. There is a fine line about it being true and not true. It is just something that I would never look into too deeply. It is the end of the season so you always get stuff like that. I see myself staying at Cardiff. Then we go from there. You never know what the future holds but as of now I am a Cardiff player and I am gearing up to get ready to fight for promotion to the Premier League. I have only been here for a season and I love it here. That’s my priority - to be at Cardiff and get Cardiff back to the Premier League..<br /><br />I have always had that self-belief in myself. I have always thought I had enough talent and belief to make it to the very top. The only person who was going to stop me was me. Now I am eventually where I wanted to be, playing Premier League football. I feel like I did alright <b>[in the Premier League]</b>. I am always out there to improve and get better as a player. So, hopefully, I have impressed the right sort of people. I want to go out there and enjoy football, get goals and assists for the team and bring success to the club. Any young English player’s dream is to play for England. Going through the England ranks, then my goal is to eventually play for the England team. That will come down to me, how well I play and if I can impress the right people. It is one of my dream goals to do and hopefully I can get there<br /><br /><b>[Murphy believes that it has been hugely beneficial to have Jacob by his side throughout the early years of his career]</b> Being twins, you are always going to have your brotherly rivalry. Some days you are going to hate him, some days you are going to love him. That’s like every brother and sister everywhere. We are always there to drive and push each other on. If he scored more goals than me as we got older, it is not like I am going to resent him. It would be his job to go to me and say ‘come on, I am going to help you be better’. We were always going to try to keep driving each along to keep getting better, better and better. I feel like we have done that.<br /><br />I used to be a centre-back and then Jacob played in midfield. As we started getting older, the positions started changing but they are my first early memories from playing football. I would stay at the back, smash it up for Jacob to run on and score. A lot of the scores would end up maybe 15-2 or 20-4 or something like that. That’s just the way it works. As you start developing and getting older, you start trying new things, like you want to play in different positions. Now both of us are wingers and we are enjoying ourselves. We would always get mistaken. Being identical twins, it is easy for that to happen. We are both wingers, but different types of wingers. I like to be out on the touchline, chalk on my boots and take defenders on one-versus-one.<br /><br />He is more of a modern-day inside forward who likes to receive the ball in the pockets. We both have different attributes but we like playing differently in different styles. He will get the ball on the half-turn and stride through the middle of the pitch. I like to be completely out wide. That’s the noticeable difference in the way we play. He is a bit more bulldog-ish than me with his running technique. I like to think I am more elegant and glide across the pitch. We have always played in the same team up until the first-team level. We even played in the same England youth teams. We have done the whole journey together. It got to the point where he went to Newcastle and that was hard for me to take. We did everything together. He coped with it better than I did because he had six or seven loans in the meantime. He was coming back to Norwich as a base. It was okay because I thought he was always coming back. When he moved to Newcastle, his career went one way and mine went the other way. Hopefully, our paths cross again<br /><br /><b>[He watches the likes of Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar and Real Madrid’s Gareth Bale as he looks to develop into the finished article and better himself as a player]</b> I am a Newcastle fan, so growing up it would always be Alan Shearer <b>[who I watched]</b>. Then it was Jermain Defoe because I was all about scoring goals. So it would be those sorts of players who were hot at the time. When I was getting older it would be wingers who I would aspire to be like. Like Bale and Neymar. Like all the top wingers, I just try to be the best I can be. There are loads of things. I want to learn and improve. That will come down to me. I want to get more goals so that’s something I will strive on</p>
