  <p><b>[A top German psychologist insists that Joachim Low’s players should not be focusing on the nation’s poor record against Italy ahead of their Euro 2016 quarter-final on Saturday night]</b> A bogey team can exist only in your mind.<br /><br />Now there is the question of how many players have experienced that. Then it’s important how to deal with it. You have to consider that Germany won the World Cup and they have mastered all challenges on the way, which means you get a lot of confidence. Furthermore, people often think what happened in the past will happen in future again. But every game is a new game. So it depends on how you deal with it as a player and as a team.<br /><br />The negative record at tournaments can be an additional incentive as well. You want to show that you can deal with this. The World Cup and the 4-1 friendly victory against Italy shows that you are able to be successful, and that’s the most important thing. You have possibilities and strategies to beat this kind of opponent. We need a good day, to successfully deal with the situation and we need to remember all the things which have been positive. You can compare the game to a person with exam anxiety. If this person only thinks about the exams he’s ever failed, it’s counter-productive<br /><br />It’s important to concentrate on the solutions. You should not think too much about the opponent’s strengths, you have to accept them. But weaknesses always exist as well and these you have to put in the foreground - in the training, too. You have to convince your team that your plan can work and first of all you have different solutions. So even if plan A does not work, there is plan B and plan C - then you feel very safe.<br /><br />Having won the World Cup, Germany know they can control the game. It’s crucial you to take an active role, not a reactive, take influence on the game. If you concede a goal you still have to know the you can overcome the situation. Therefore you need a plan B. If you concede a goal there can be images in your mind, that’s individually different. If that’s the case you have to block these images and to remember what you’ve learned for example by the defeat in 2012</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Why have Germany never ever beaten Italy?]</b> It always has something to do with what goes on in the head. The first point is that not all players have been a part of these negative experiences. Second, how do you handle it? It is worth noting that we have become world champions and mastered various challenges, leading to a healthy self-confidence. The third point is that which is so often done: when all the events that have happened in the past must occur in the future. But every game is a new game. So it all depends on how the players or the team handle it.<br /><br />You have to convince your team that your plan can work and first of all you have to have different solutions. So even if plan A does not work, there is plan B and plan C - then you feel very safe. Having won the World Cup, Germany know they can control the game. It’s crucial you to take an active role, not a reactive, take influence on the game. A bogey team can exist only in your mind</p>
