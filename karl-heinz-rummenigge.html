Pep Guardiola expressed his disagreement with the idea of a breakaway competition for Europe’s top clubs, saying a prospective Super League would ‘kill’ domestic football. Reports suggesting Bayern Munich and their chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge might attempt to lead the creation of a new competition for Europe’s biggest clubs have been circulating since late 2018, and Guardiola is one of many to have voiced their concern</p>

Now you will have to wait in peace and quiet to see if something moves in this direction. It is well known that we are still looking for a wide player. We lost Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben, two players who have shaped the face of Bayern.<br /><br />Internationally, the competition is greater and the market has become more global. Nevertheless, Bayern still have much to offer. We have a beautiful city, a nice stadium. But you have to say the buzz is different. We are speaking in the nine-digit range almost as if it is normal. There are almost two months left until the transfer market closes, and these two months will bring many more uncertainties. Everything is waiting for the dominoes to fall and then there will be this effect. Then let’s wait and see what Bayern will do</p>

Also, what we have to offer up front… it’s all good. We have a good team and a good squad; the transfer market is not over yet. When the Bundesliga starts, I’m convinced our team will be very focused and motivated to get to work. Niko knows we are a club that needs success. We’re interested in continuity, in the coaching position as well. I wish him as successful a second season as he had last year, with the double, and perhaps one more round in the Champions League.
