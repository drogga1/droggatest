Recently we had two lunches with Real Madrid’s bosses and we haven’t spoken a single word about Lewandowski.<br /><br />The decisive factor is the duration of the contracts.

But now, 10 years later, he is happy<br /><br /><b>[On Thomas Muller]</b> Thomas is irreplaceable, a Bavarian identification figure. There is no price tag for him.

This is about a player who has won everything with Real in the past few years. He has been voted the best player in the world five times, so all in all he is a great footballer. Nevertheless, I was surprised that Andrea Agnelli finally decided to do business.<br /><br />In Italy, Agnelli has earned great acclaim - from Juve’s point of view the transfer makes sense, after all, Italian football had recently lost some ground. With this big deal, the Italians are now hoping that they will once again come into the focus of world football<br /><br /><b>[When asked about Ronaldo in Germany]</b> Only Bayern could have. It’s noticeable that the top stars are not flocking to Germany in droves. And then only to Bayern. We have to be careful in the Bundesliga because we’re starting to stew in a juice of satisfaction.

We will not accept that at Bayern Munich anymore. I can’t even start with what I’ve read about Manuel Neuer. Neuer is a four-time World Goalkeeper of the Year. Without exaggeration, he has created his own game. What I also read about Boateng and Hummels, it seems these experts are no longer aware of dignity and decency. This also applies to Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben. They have contributed for a decade to the fact that FC Bayern is a shining star in the world of football. I would like to remind you that both won everything. This age debate is disrespectful. I would like to remind you that Germany won the World Cup in 2014 in big part thanks to Bayern players. Three weeks ago, the world was fine, now we don’t win four games and the world falls apart. There is simply no reason to deal with the team this way. We will not put up with this anymore. We do not seek to blame the media. If you do not play well, you deserve no praise. But we want a report of a factual nature. We will protect our players, team and coach.</p>

We’ve already started this in phase one, by introducing a significant number of young players. The change is largely going to take place this summer. In case we need a third phase, it will occur the year after, as contracts expire. We’ll work through these changes. I’m not afraid of that. I’ve experienced more difficult years in 2007 and 2012.

  <p><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> CEO Rummenigge hints that <a href="hansi-flick.html">Flick</a> could stay on as manager into next season]</b> Our coach turned 55 yesterday. This is a good age. We’ll give you a pen in this red packet. Sometimes you sign papers with pens<br /><br />It was a very good game and result from us. You have to say that the team did it pretty well what we gave them as a plan. It was a very good and focused performance over the whole 90 minutes. That’s why we are very happy that we could win this game with 3-0. We told the players that the first half was good but we still need to do more. We wanted to reward ourselves here. We really wanted to score a goal here. First half we missed several chances. In the second half we converted our chances into goals and so I can say that the team performed very well over the whole 90 minutes</p>
