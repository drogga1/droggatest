The elegant attacking midfielder with an impressive work ethic only made his professional bow for <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a> in July, coming on in the second leg of a Copa Libertadores clash no less, and went on to rack up six goals and two assists in 14 appearances in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>. Former team-mate <a href="filipe-luis.html">Filipe Luis</a> has acknowledged only time will tell if the early comparisons with <a href="kaka.html">Kaka</a> are warranted but, encouragingly. The Brazil Under-23 international has only just turned 18 and will initially line out for Madrid’s B team, but it looks like only a matter of time before he is playing alongside compatriots <a href="vinicius-junior.html">Vinicius Junior</a> and <a href="rodrygo.html">Rodrygo</a> in <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>’s senior side</td>

  <p><b>[Curiously enough it is another Madrid legend whom Reinier credits as his footballing icon]</b> I’m heavily inspired by <b>[<a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine</a>]</b> <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>. I’ve watched a lot of videos on the internet of him playing. I’m always trying to execute plays like he did</p>

  <p><b>[How <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> failure led to Reinier deal]</b> <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> are the greatest.

And of course since then I have always loved them. <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> and <a href="kaka.html">Kaka</a> have always been my idols because of their style of playing in midfield, with elegance and daring. But I have seen so many good players in Madrid… <a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a> and <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a> are pure artists! My word, they play so well</p>
