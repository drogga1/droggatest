<blockquote>
  <p>[Coach Marc Collat mainly instructs in French on the steamy morning, but there’s also a strong Haitian Creole influence. As the session ends, a number of players chat with each other in English] It’s the same old, same old. When you’re a Caribbean team there are certain things that are thought about you and the way that you play. I’m not surprised that people overlooked us. We take that as fuel and wanted to go out there and show that stigma is incorrect. To be honest, we didn’t care what people were saying. We knew in the group that we could do something special, and we were able to do it.<br /><br />It’s a great group of guys. A lot of guys speak English, so it was easy for guys to translate. When you’re winning, everything is fine. We were able to get past that hump of not getting to the last Gold Cup. We came in here, we had one goal in mind: To make the Gold Cup. Then the next goal was to get out of our group, we saw the draw, the goal was to win the group. We set little goals for ourselves and the goal was to conquer them and hopefully we can continue</p>
