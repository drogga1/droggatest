<blockquote>
  <p>[Hertha Berlin midfielder Maximilian Mittelstadt has hailed Ousmane Dembele as the most difficult opponent he has ever faced] Ousmane Dembele [was my toughest opponent]. I can remember games in which it was very difficult to defend against him, be it with the Under 18 national team or Borussia Dortmund. He is an unpredictable player with enormous speed, who is also two-legged and therefore hard to predict.<br /><br />In pure footballing terms, I would say Ondrej Duda [is the best I’ve played with]. He plays at a level I have rarely seen before. But also Marko Grujic impresses me. He is very present in the center and overall an outstanding player<br /><br />[Mittelstadt has enjoyed playing under the coach Pal Dardai] I learned from him that you should never give up and always give 100 per cent. I owe him that I could find my way here. Under him, I made my professional debut, I developed steadily. And I’m very grateful to him for that.</p>
