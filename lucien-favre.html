It is very interesting this season and it will be exciting in Gladbach.<br /><br />We have to be fully concentrated on our game and hope that good things happen on the other pitch. The game has to be our focus and we have to win it. Period. Everything is possible. How high are the chances? It’s hard to say and I don’t really want to talk about it. We have to win in Gladbach.

At one stage it was 1-1 between Bayern and Eintracht Frankfurt, then Bayern immediately scored to make it 2-1. We still believed in it, but most of all we focused on our game, on our task. We did not look much at the other teams’ results. In the end it is clear that we are a little disappointed by the result of the championship, but we won our game. There was little missing to the title, but we are still very happy with our season. Nobody would have thought that we would get 76 points.<br /><br />It was tight this season. We haven’t missed much, but overall you can say that we conceded unnecessary goals. But we must not forget that we had good luck in the first half of the season. We turned around some games at the very end. That’s why I always said that we still have much to do. Let’s see what happens until the next season starts, but of course we always want to have another good season like this, 76 points is not easy to reach, that is clear</p>

We’ve made mistakes in pressing, in conquering the ball. There was no aggressiveness. We go into the duels like this. They counter and we lose the ball unnecessarily. If we can’t intervene, we come back, if we can intervene, we have to go into the duel. Then we have to be tough for 90 or 95 minutes. But there were also tactical mistakes. And up front, the last 35 metres we have to say clearly, we did not play well here in the second half. It was complicated. Five, six times we lost the balls and they countered. It is a gift for me.

You have to be diplomatic with him, but you can talk to him and explain things. There were sometimes minor issues because of his behaviour.

It is true that we are currently not doing as well as last year. There is nothing wrong with that. It’s the results, that’s all. They analyse the results, but do not analyse the rest enough. That does not affect me very much. I understand that because I think that today there are media that have to write very sharply in order to be read.

It was a crazy match. Constant chances. We had to win this game - it’s what we were aiming for and we did it, but it was difficult. Slavia were very tough as expected. They had drawn their previous games, we hadn’t. <a href="roman-burki.html">Roman Burki</a> was unbelievable, he was fantastic. But just to reiterate: we achieved this victory together. We created a lot of scoring opportunities and should’ve been winning more than 1-0. We were too open at certain points. It’s a win but we need to continue to work hard</p>
