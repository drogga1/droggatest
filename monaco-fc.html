  <p><b>[Man Utd complete £9m signing of AS Monaco wonderkid Hannibal Mejbri. The player’s father had previously signalled the relationship with Monaco had broken down]</b> Something bad happened. For our family, it was very hard to live. It’s a real shock, a trauma. Mistakes were made. From there, I consider that the relationship of trust between the club and our family is destroyed. Something broke. It’s hard to keep working with people when there’s such a lack of trust</p>

  <p><b>[Monaco star <a href="gelson-martins.html">Gelson Martins</a> earns six-month ban for referee assault]</b> AS Monaco takes note of the decision of the Disciplinary Committee of the LFP to sanction <a href="gelson-martins.html">Gelson Martins</a> with a suspension of six months dating to February 6, a very heavy sanction. The club once again condemns the unjustifiable behavior of its attacker, but also regrets the excessive length of this suspension, for a player who has never served a disciplinary ban in more than 200 games at the highest level</p>
