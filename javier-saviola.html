  <p><b>[Gonzalo Higuain has the quality and lethal touch in front of goal to win back the support of Argentina’s fans]</b> Higuain has been demonstrating his efficiency in all the clubs that he has played for. He has a very high goal average. He was top goal-scorer on his last stay in Napoli. He is always among the best goal-scorers of his team, and also of Europe. There are always ups and downs, but he has enough level to stand in the way of these moments.</p>

  <p><b>[Javier Saviola believes Lionel Messi is better to watch than Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> I love how Messi plays football. If I had to choose a favourite player, I would definitely choose him. It is about taste, I like Messi better, but there is no doubt that Cristiano is a great player. Cristiano Ronaldo is a machine, physically powerful. Messi is more skilful and he brings more of a spectacle when he comes onto the pitch. When they finish their careers, both will be among the best in history - that is beyond doubt.<br /><br />I love how he plays, the way he improves season by season - if he can improve at all as there’s little space for him to improve! Messi is beyond doubt among of the best in history. We are all looking to everything he does as he is a pure spectacle. He is the best, not just as a player but also as a person. I have always been on very good terms with him. He is a very humble person and it is really pleasant to chat with him. The kind of guy you keep a friendship with, very humble. As great as he is on the pitch, he is great as a person<br /><br /><b>[Saviola played for Barca while Messi was making waves with the youth team prior to making his debut in 2004]</b> I heard there was a kid in the Barca youth team and that it was worth going to see him play. They told us he had an incredible left foot, that he was already different and they thought he would be one of the best in history. He is better than the rest because he thinks before he gets the ball at his feet. Most players, we can’t do that. We can’t think before we get the ball. Maybe due to tiredness, maybe due to our skills, but we can’t.<br /><br />He thinks, he imagines the play before even getting the ball and then executes it. He’s fast, really difficult to stop. He’s effective, understands his team-mates and is really complete. A normal player has two or three of these skills - he has got them all<br /><br /><b>[Saviola still had kind words for Ronaldo]</b> His results, his records are there. Year after year they both improve their own records and it is not coincidence that all these years they compete in between them to win Ballon d’Or. They are making history with amazing seasons clinching trophies such as the Champions League or Euros as Ronaldo did this summer with Portugal. They were not favourites and it has a huge merit that they won, he also won Champions League.<br /><br />He’s really effective and of course stands a chance for Ballon d’Or. He is really competitive with himself. If he scores three he wants to hit the fourth and you can see he gets frustrated if he doesn’t. So he’s mentally really strong</p>

  <p><b>[Lionel Messi is unlikely to leave Barcelona]</b> Leo is really identified with Barcelona, it’s hard to imagine him with another shirt. In the future, however, anything can happen and that’s why Inter fans can’t lose their faith. But, I repeat, it will be complicated to see Messi join another club.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer Lionel Messi over Cristiano Ronaldo because the way he plays is the way I believe football should be played. There is no doubt that Cristiano is a fantastic player but how Messi has played in the last few years shows why he is the best in the world. <b>[Kylian]</b> Mbappe is also a great talent who has proved his mettle on the grand stage. But, I think it will be really difficult for the new stars to surpass Messi and Cristiano right now</p>

  <p><b>[Magical Messi no guarantee of success for Barcelona]</b> Sometimes you ask yourself the question, how does he do it? He does things that seem impossible. He is one of the best players in history and an extraordinary player in our lifetime, which is highlighted by the number of goals he has scored and the number of trophies he has won. Messi continues to excite me, I love seeing him play and his approach to football. I could talk about him for hours and I have huge admiration for him.<br /><br /><b>[Saviola admits that Messi cannot carry Barcelona by himself]</b> I don’t think so. In the Champions League and World Cup, with so many competitive teams and top players, it is difficult to say that any team can reach the final and be champions. To have Leo is an advantage but it is not definitive. There are other teams that can fight for honours. I think Barcelona will be strong contenders, but they must show that throughout the competition<br /><br /><b>[On Santiago Solari]</b> I know Santiago Solari well because I played with him for a long time, we were partners for many years, and I wish him well. I know him as a coach but since he’s just starting out and he’s at Real Madrid, we all know how difficult it is to manage at that club. I hope he can achieve what he wants to as a coach</p>

  <p><b>[Former Argentina striker Javier Saviola insists that Lionel Messi is hurt]</b> Messi, unfortunately, has not yet managed to win any trophy or tournament for the national team and the Argentine fans are very demanding. I was Leo’s colleague, I know what he feels about the country and how much it hurts when things don’t go as he would like. The most important thing is to trust that everything will go well and I believe that the next World Cup will be for Argentina. Considering the results, because he played great matches - he played three times the Copa America final and was runner-up in a World Cup, although unfortunately he never managed to win. Still, Messi is the best in the world and maybe in history. We are always looking forward to winning some competition with Argentina, which is what we need to conquer. Playing for the National Team is different, because Argentina is not Barcelona. In Barcelona they train all year long, players have been together for many years and all the methods are different. I think that’s the big difference.<br /><br />This question is very difficult to answer because we are talking about two very different time periods. Maradona was for us an emblematic player, who gave us a World Cup. They are very different players, from very different times. As an Argentinean, I can only feel proud to have the two best players in the world in a period of 30 years. More important than comparing them is enjoying the honour of having them both<br /><br />I arrived in Barcelona at a difficult time, a moment of great change, in which the club needed to win championships. I always gave everything I had for the club and fought to do things well. I really enjoyed the time I was in Barcelona, but it’s always a decision for the coaches to choose players they most identify with for their type of playing. With Frank Rijkaard I was not an option and I had to look for a new direction. They <b>[Barca and Madrid]</b> are two huge clubs. Full of history and players of tremendous quality. I can not say which is the best - in both I have lived unique experiences and played with the best players in the world. It makes no sense to compare them, they always treated me well and respected me a lot. They are undoubtedly two of the best clubs in the world.</p>
