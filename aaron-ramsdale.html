  <p><b>[Bournemouth keeper Aaron Ramsdale backs <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> restart after positive coronavirus test]</b> Seeing how our staff and our training ground is working at the moment, it does give you a feeling that everything is being taken to the smallest detail to be done properly. In that sense, you do feel very safe in training. But this isn’t a football-related thing that has happened to me. It’s in everyday life. You do see people who are worried about it and they’ve got every right to be. So I’m still on the fence. But once it is safe to get back to, then I’m all for it.<br /><br />I’ve been trying to figure it out for the past two days. My test last Monday before we started training was negative. So this last week, I’ve done the usual things like going to the supermarket and going to the petrol station to fill my car up. I’ve been just as careful as before on lockdown and it seems to be a shopping trip where I’ve caught it. We’ve trained but we’re under strict rules to be two metres apart. Ours is a club that don’t want to be breaking rules and we want to be doing everything properly to get back. It was one of those freak things. I’m healthy, I’ve got all my taste and smell, and all the things that are linked to the virus. It’s definitely a shock and one that I’ve got to deal with.</p>
