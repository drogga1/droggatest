<blockquote>
  <p><b>[PSG ordered to allow exiled Adrien Rabiot to train with the first team]</b> When there is no place to train, which is PSG’s case, the criteria do not apply, it just means another group cannot be formed. In the case of Rabiot, who has declined to extend his contract which ends at the end of the season, it is not necessary to even consider if this will be a temporary situation. No exceptions have been requested, the forming of a second group is now allowed and he should be automatically returned <b>[to the first team]</b>.<br /><br />That re-incorporation should be carried out within the next 48 hours. If not, the club will be exposed to sanctions, because from a legal point of view PSG have no right to make Adrien Rabiot train with the reserves, just like they did not have the right with <b>[Hatem]</b> Ben Arfa.<br /><br />If it is not done in 48 hours, I don’t want to get ahead of myself but we will be on guard because right now, PSG are trying to buy time and we do not want them to prevail, especially because the end of the transfer window is approaching. The player is in the right condition to train normally and in line with the regulations.<br /><br />If the club continues to evade the rules, it could be seen as a discriminatory measure, which could be compared with harassment, and that is wrong, this should be remedied immediately</p>
