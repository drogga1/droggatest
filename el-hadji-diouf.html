  <p><b>[El Hadji Diouf tells that Morocco can be a success at Russia 2018]</b> If the Moroccan players have taken confidence and tell themselves that they can write the history of African football <b>[in Russia]</b>, they can do it. They’re a technical team, tactical, and they have a manager who they listen to. That’s the thing that’s really good. Frankly, I take my hat off to this team, that they never give anything up</p>

  <p><b>[El Hadji Diouf told that he believes Egypt are the favorites in the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations]</b> I would put Senegal at the top because it is my country and I hope they win the title but there are many other good teams - Egypt will be at the forefront with Morocco and Nigeria. Egypt is the strongest candidate for me because they will play in their own country with a lot of fans and they have very good players led by <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a>. He’s a very decisive player and has a full country behind him</p>

I don’t think they are going to be able to play like that this season. They missed the chance to win the title last season, because you know in football every season is different, and if you look at the way they went all out for it last season it will be impossible for them to do it again this season. That level they were last season was an unbelievable level and look at the way they lost it, with a point difference, so we have to be realistic to ourselves. They have great competitors in City, and they’ve long been a team that has fought so hard for the title, so for me I maintain that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will not be able to produce that level of performance they did last season<br /><br /><b>[<a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> and <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> have become talismanic figures for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a>]</b> I think that both Mo and Mane are doing amazing and they are up there flying the flag for Africa.

  <p><b>[El Hadji Diouf says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> bottled it last season and have blown their best chance to land <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title]</b> I don’t see them doing as well as they did last season. They had the chance to win the league title; they had it in their hands and then let it slip. They were seven points ahead around Christmas - how <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> got it in the end beats my mind. As they say in England, I think they bottled it. If you have only one defeat in a whole season, surely you can’t say that you didn’t win the league - so it’s hard for me to imagine them having such a similar season and coming out as champions. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> will be the team to beat once again<br /><br /><b>[The two-time African Player of the Year admits to still having regrets over his decision to link up with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I’ve never hidden the fact that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> didn’t treat me right and that they cherished some players better than me, even though I’d arrived with a better profile. Sometimes, reporters will never get what goes on in the club and in the dressing room. Don’t get me wrong: the club is run very well now, based on what I hear from <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, but I feel I was seen as an outsider back then. The upsetting thing is that <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> had offered me more money, but I really wanted to go to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - and it ended up being one of my worst experiences</p>

For me, it’s all in the past, but I’m not a hypocrite - I know they don’t like me, so I also don’t like them. Look, I say this and they get offended but let’s be honest: ‘Gerrard has won nothing for his country’. I took my country to the World Cup, and that singular act cannot be quantified</p>

He deserves the Ballon d’Or more on a personal and collective point of view. We can’t compare the French and English leagues. There’s more effort required in the Premier League<br /><br />For me, the podium would be <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>, <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> and Mane just by the leagues they play in. You know that to win the Ballon d’Or, you have to leave France. The only one to have done it while being in <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> is Jean-Pierre Papin, and he was in a <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> team that played the Champions League final</p>

  <p><b>[Diouf: My boy Mane leading <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to title but nothing is won yet]</b> You can have hundred chances to be champion and you will miss it. Some years ago <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were leading and everyone said that was their year but <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> slipped and everything changed from there. That is football for you and so for me, life is more important than <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> winning the title, first we all have to be safe and be alive before talks of resuming a league or handing them the title<br /><br />Everyone talks of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> but other teams are also important. My former team Lens in France have been trying to come up for many years and when it looked like they would this year the virus struck. Another team I played in, <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>, have also been trying to come up for years and it looked like they would this year and then this happened again so for me it’s not about just <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I would be happy if they won it because I played there and my boy Sadio is leading them towards it, but of course it’s not won yet</p>
