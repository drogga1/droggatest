  <p><b>[On Steven Gerrard]</b> When I arrived, I showed him that he was nothing. I asked him, ‘What great competition have you played and where do people remember you?’ It wasn’t <b>[Zinedine]</b> Zidane. The player, I respect him. He’s a great player. But the man and the person not. I let him know. For me, he was a player like everyone else. He had to keep up well, and play as he knew how to do, but don’t go to the coach to report what happens in the dressing room.<br /><br /><b>[Gerrard was intimidated by him]</b> He did not look in my eyes because he was afraid. And he was afraid to speak to me. And when I arrived at Liverpool, it was he who asked me for my jersey, not the opposite<br /><br />There is nobody more egotistical than him. He does not care about others. I spoke to the major figures at Liverpool and nobody can stand him. And I am not talking about Carragher</p>

  <p><b>[El Hadji Diouf insists that he has no problem with former Liverpool team-mate Steven Gerrard]</b> I have no problem with him. Gerrard is a strong character and I am a strong character. ‘Stevie G’ was a very good player, people like him in Liverpool but he never did anything for his country. I am Mr El Hadji Diouf, Mr Senegal but he is Mr Liverpool and Senegal is bigger than Liverpool and he has to know that.<br /><br />I am a lion, I am a bad loser and it’s not wrong to be a bad loser. I have got character and I want people to respect me. I am an easy target. It’s easy to talk about El Hadji Diouf and I let them talk but I know in my heart I am a good guy. My family know, my population knows, my continent knows I am a good guy and that’s the best thing. The rest is not my problem<br /><br />Maybe they used to tell me something I didn’t want to hear. I did that, I paid and now it’s finished<br /><br />We put Senegal on the world map. Before the World Cup nobody knew Senegal, but after the World Cup everybody wanted to know where Senegal was. What Maradona did for his country <b>[Argentina]</b> is what I did for Senegal. I was one of the biggest men at the 2002 World Cup.<br /><br />We were colonised by France, most of the businesses are run by French people here and to beat them was a big thing for us. Before the game, they used to say: ‘The reserve team is going to play against the first team’ - because most of the players used to play in the French league. I used to be in Lens, Salif Diao <b>[Sedan]</b>, Khalilou Fadiga <b>[Auxerre]</b>, most of the players played in the French league but we used to say: ‘Be careful before you kill the lion</p>

  <p><b>[El Hadji Diouf tells that Morocco can be a success at Russia 2018]</b> If the Moroccan players have taken confidence and tell themselves that they can write the history of African football <b>[in Russia]</b>, they can do it. They’re a technical team, tactical, and they have a manager who they listen to. That’s the thing that’s really good. Frankly, I take my hat off to this team, that they never give anything up</p>

  <p><b>[Former Liverpool attacker El Hadji Diouf has named Egypt as his favourites to lift the Africa Cup of Nations]</b> I would put Senegal at the top because it is my country and I hope they win the title but there are many other good teams - Egypt will be at the forefront with Morocco and Nigeria. Egypt is the strongest candidate for me because they will play in their own country with a lot of fans and they have very good players led by Mohamed Salah. He’s a very decisive player and has a full country behind him..<br /><br />I do not think there is jealousy or trouble between Mane and Salah. They are happy to play together and there is a healthy competition between them. They want to win the Golden Ball and before that the best player in Africa. This is life and we should not be sensitive about these things. I know them personally and understand their desire to reach their best level<br /><br />Winning a tournament needs a complete system. The players have to be mentally and psychologically ready to fight in every game. Senegal needs players who are responsible and fans who are always committed and behind the team. We have a lot of very good players and great talents that must rise to the level of the event in order to achieve the title. Senegal Football Federation handles things very well now and is developing in an acceptable manner, which will help the players and the team to achieve positive results</p>

I don’t think they are going to be able to play like that this season. They missed the chance to win the title last season, because you know in football every season is different, and if you look at the way they went all out for it last season it will be impossible for them to do it again this season. That level they were last season was an unbelievable level and look at the way they lost it, with a point difference, so we have to be realistic to ourselves.

They had the chance to win the league title; they had it in their hands and then let it slip. They were seven points ahead around Christmas - how <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> got it in the end beats my mind. As they say in England, I think they bottled it. If you have only one defeat in a whole season, surely you can’t say that you didn’t win the league - so it’s hard for me to imagine them having such a similar season and coming out as champions. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> will be the team to beat once again<br /><br /><b>[The two-time African Player of the Year admits to still having regrets over his decision to link up with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I’ve never hidden the fact that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> didn’t treat me right and that they cherished some players better than me, even though I’d arrived with a better profile.

Don’t get me wrong: the club is run very well now, based on what I hear from <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, but I feel I was seen as an outsider back then.
