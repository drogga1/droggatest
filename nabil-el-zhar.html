  <p><b>[Nabil El Zhar says Humble Salah proves dreams can come true]</b> When I signed for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, everyone in Morocco was supporting <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and now you can see it over here in Asia, in Qatar. <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a> also because he’s an Arabic player, so they follow him because Egypt is close to Qatar. They support everyone but they have a special <b>[feeling]</b> for <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>. For myself, too, because he’s Arabic, he’s a good example. The image he gives to the people, it’s very positive and we take him as an example to someone that stays humble, works hard and achieves his dreams. But there are many players in this <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team that shows that character to the whole world<br /><br /><b>[El Zhar was unable to make a similar impact during his time at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> as likes of <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>, <a href="fernando-torres.html">Fernando Torres</a>, <a href="xabi-alonso.html">Xabi Alonso</a> and <a href="javier-mascherano.html">Javier Mascherano</a> fill the squad]</b> I mean, I was comfortable with these guys but I had maybe too much respect. As someone that always respects, I’m very respectful, to see this kind of player with you, I’m not saying I didn’t deserve it but you’re always there and say to yourself, ‘You need to do a lot more in order to get to this level’. I was training very hard every <b>[session]</b> but you’re always there and know it’s going to be difficult to be better than them. But you always try</p>
