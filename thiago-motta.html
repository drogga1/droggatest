  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Thiago Motta is aware that Sunday’s Ligue 1 clash with Monaco is important for his side]</b> It’s a very important match, it’s true. We’re going to play at home and we have often suffered against this team, but it is not crucial. If we win, it’s a big blow to Monaco, but it won’t be decisive.<br /><br /><b>[Under Unai Emery, the 34-year-old has emerge as a mainstay of the side]</b> I’m really happy to be able to help the team - and the season is not over yet, I hope to keep playing like this. We need to finish this season well because we have very high standards and we know that playing for PSG requires ambition. I’m here to win titles and I still want to do that this year<br /><br /><b>[Midfielder Marco Verratti talks about the experienced players’ influence in the dressing room]</b> I totally agree with Marco. The new players must understand that PSG is a club that has very great aims. We have a team with great players and new players must feel that. We help them to integrate well because if it happens, it is because we need them. It’s true that I do not like to talk a lot but sometimes I need to. There are times when I want to send a certain message to the squad. I have been here for 5 years. We have managed to create a very good group that gets on well on and off the field. I’m important, but it’s not just me. There are many players who have arrived almost at the same time and it is normal that these players have a little more influence. Everyone has his responsibilities in the locker room. I have mine<br /><br />In Spain, it was Barcelona’s philosophy that impressed me. Before the league season started, we did not do physical work, for example. Everything was with the ball. That’s where I learned that the most important thing was the ball. You could do 3 hours of physical training, but nothing could replace the ball. If you have the ball, you cannot concede a goal. In Italy, it was mainly defensively that I made progress. All the Italian coaches I had in my career were paying attention to that. In France, I understood that speed was very important. Even if I do not have that in my game! I try to replace it with the mind, by trying to think about the action before the others. Speed is very important in France because there is not much space and the players must be very keen<br /><br /><b>[On Genoa]</b> I arrived there at a time of my very difficult career because I had been injured for almost a year. I hesitated a lot before leaving Barcelona to go to Italy. When I arrived, I was very surprised. I was at Genoa, a club less known than Barcelona, but with a coach, Gian-Piero Gasperini, who helped me a lot. He was always trying new things. That’s when I learned the most in my career. Mentally, I grew up, but it was on the pitch that I made the greatest progress. I understood why it was necessary to take a step to the right and not to the left on the field. Small details that improved my level. Gasperini gave me a lot of confidence, he always believed in my abilities. It was a privilege for me to have been his player<br /><br />I still think like a gambler. I feel like a player. Physically, I feel good to continue. I will finish this season and we will see the future in the end. Since I was little, I’ve been interested in the game. I’ve taken things from each of my clubs. To stay at this level for so long, there is no secret: listen, learn, work. Every day. With each coach. Every teammate. I’m not the only one here, but I like to understand what to do on the field and not just repeat things like a robot. I try to pass this on to others as a player. I do not need to be a coach for that<br /><br />It’s very important. You do not reach the very high level by chance. Football does not stop at what we do on the pitch. There are things we must do away from it. Each player must think about what he needs to feel good on the pitch. That has always been my thought. I always tried to understand what my body was asking for. I hope that my health will last because I still have the same pleasure playing football at 34-years-old that I did when I was small</p>

  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain should make an attempt to sign Toni Kroos from Real Madrid]</b> I would really like to see him in Paris. He is well suited for PSG. He can play in all three positions in midfield and he is exceptional. I’ve admired him a lot for a long time.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho is always looking for enemies]</b> He’s a winner. In his head, there’s only one goal: winning. Entertaining doesn’t interest him. Mourinho has two sides: one happy when he wins, one pissed off when he loses. His mood changes depending on the result. If the team plays well, but loses, he can’t find anything positive. But if he wins playing badly, he’s overjoyed. Mourinho doesn’t look for beauty, he looks for an enemy. If he doesn’t have one, he’ll create one. With Inter, we had an 11-point lead in the league, we lost a game and then drew one. The Monday, he held a 15 minute press conference where he attacked everyone: Galliani, Milan, Roma, the referees, Juve. He needed to refresh the atmosphere.</p>

  <p><b>[Thiago Motta has slammed Paris Saint-Germain for their failure to line up replacements for him and Zlatan Ibrahimovic]</b> It was something you had to think about and plan on beforehand. The club knew I was going to retire, it had to be organized, whether it was regarding my departure or any another player, but that comes from the organization and the ability to project ahead in the future of the club.<br /><br />We all agreed with Unai <b>[Emery, who arrived that same summer]</b>, as we all agreed with Carlo <b>[Ancelotti]</b> and with Laurent <b>[Blanc]</b>. In the first year of Unai Emery here, a problem arose in my opinion, and the problem was that we let go of Ibra, who was able to score 50 goals per season, and we did not replace him with a player who could score 50 goals<br /><br />My goal is to coach the biggest clubs in the world. Coaching PSG after Tuchel? When the time comes, we will see, but in the meantime he has my full support if he needs anything. There are 99 per cent of the coaches today who want to coach PSG because it’s a big club, and the remaining 1% is Tuchel, who is already there. Of course I’ll be among the managers who want to take the position as soon as Tuchel leaves. I work for that. I played for PSG, I know how the club functions, the dressing room. I know the ambitions of the club, externally and internally. This is something very positive for me and the club.</p>

  <p><b>[Genoa have appointed former midfielder Thiago Motta as their new coach in his first senior role]</b> My idea it to play offensively. A short team that controls the game, high pressure and a lot of movement with and without the ball. I don’t like the numbers of the field because they trick you. You can be super offensive with a 5-3-2 and defensive in a 4-3-3. Depending on the quality of the guys. I had a game a while ago where the two full-backs ended up playing as the 9 and 10. The goalkeeper counts as one of the midfield seven. For me, the attacker is the first defender and the goalkeeper is the first attacker. The goalkeeper starts the play, with his feet and the attackers are the first to put pressure to recover the ball</p>

  <p><b>[What to expect from new Genoa boss Thiago Motta]</b> I include the goalkeeper as one of the seven in midfield.
