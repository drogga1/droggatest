  <p><b>[Genoa have appointed former midfielder Thiago Motta as their new coach in his first senior role]</b> My idea it to play offensively. A short team that controls the game, high pressure and a lot of movement with and without the ball. I don’t like the numbers of the field because they trick you. You can be super offensive with a 5-3-2 and defensive in a 4-3-3. Depending on the quality of the guys. I had a game a while ago where the two full-backs ended up playing as the 9 and 10. The goalkeeper counts as one of the midfield seven. For me, the attacker is the first defender and the goalkeeper is the first attacker. The goalkeeper starts the play, with his feet and the attackers are the first to put pressure to recover the ball</p>

  <p><b>[What to expect from new Genoa boss Thiago Motta]</b> I include the goalkeeper as one of the seven in midfield.
