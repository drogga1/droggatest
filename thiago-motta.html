  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain should make an attempt to sign Toni Kroos from Real Madrid]</b> I would really like to see him in Paris. He is well suited for PSG. He can play in all three positions in midfield and he is exceptional. I’ve admired him a lot for a long time.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho is always looking for enemies]</b> He’s a winner. In his head, there’s only one goal: winning. Entertaining doesn’t interest him. Mourinho has two sides: one happy when he wins, one p*ssed off when he loses. His mood changes depending on the result. If the team plays well, but loses, he can’t find anything positive. But if he wins playing badly, he’s overjoyed. Mourinho doesn’t look for beauty, he looks for an enemy. If he doesn’t have one, he’ll create one. With Inter, we had an 11-point lead in the league, we lost a game and then drew one. The Monday, he held a 15 minute press conference where he attacked everyone: Galliani, Milan, Roma, the referees, Juve. He needed to refresh the atmosphere.</p>

  <p><b>[Thiago Motta has slammed Paris Saint-Germain for their failure to line up replacements for him and Zlatan Ibrahimovic]</b> It was something you had to think about and plan on beforehand. The club knew I was going to retire, it had to be organized, whether it was regarding my departure or any another player, but that comes from the organization and the ability to project ahead in the future of the club.<br /><br />We all agreed with Unai <b>[Emery, who arrived that same summer]</b>, as we all agreed with Carlo <b>[Ancelotti]</b> and with Laurent <b>[Blanc]</b>. In the first year of Unai Emery here, a problem arose in my opinion, and the problem was that we let go of Ibra, who was able to score 50 goals per season, and we did not replace him with a player who could score 50 goals<br /><br />My goal is to coach the biggest clubs in the world. Coaching PSG after Tuchel? When the time comes, we will see, but in the meantime he has my full support if he needs anything. There are 99 per cent of the coaches today who want to coach PSG because it’s a big club, and the remaining 1% is Tuchel, who is already there. Of course I’ll be among the managers who want to take the position as soon as Tuchel leaves. I work for that. I played for PSG, I know how the club functions, the dressing room. I know the ambitions of the club, externally and internally. This is something very positive for me and the club.</p>

  <p><b>[Genoa have appointed former midfielder Thiago Motta as their new coach in his first senior role]</b> My idea it to play offensively. A short team that controls the game, high pressure and a lot of movement with and without the ball. I don’t like the numbers of the field because they trick you. You can be super offensive with a 5-3-2 and defensive in a 4-3-3. Depending on the quality of the guys. I had a game a while ago where the two full-backs ended up playing as the 9 and 10. The goalkeeper counts as one of the midfield seven. For me, the attacker is the first defender and the goalkeeper is the first attacker. The goalkeeper starts the play, with his feet and the attackers are the first to put pressure to recover the ball</p>

  <p><b>[What to expect from new Genoa boss Thiago Motta]</b> I include the goalkeeper as one of the seven in midfield.
