  <p><b>[Bordeaux winger Malcom has said that he is not aware of interest from Liverpool and Manchester United]</b> I don’t know anything about Liverpool or Manchester United. I’m very calm. I’m only thinking of Bordeaux today. I want to do my job well and give the French fans lots of joy. I will continue to work hard with my usual humility.<br /><br />France has changed my style of play a little bit. I defended more with Corinthians. In Bordeaux, I’ve been asked to defend only the midfield and seek to get in behind the defence. I’m using this No.10 shirt with the function of a No.10. I’m playing a lot, showing up, growing up, and displaying the real Malcom. But I know I can still improve</p>

  <p><b>[Bordeaux forward Malcom says he will only address talk of interest from Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City if a formal approach is made]</b> I’m very chilled out. I’m only thinking about Bordeaux. I have contract until 2020, this is a matter for my family and Fernando Garcia <b>[his agent]</b>. I’m very focused on what I want, on the work I’m doing. I don’t know how it would be if this chance appears. For now I’m focused on doing a great job here this season.<br /><br />I will work for this. I’ll wait for Tite to look at me in a different way so, who knows, I might have an opportunity with the Selecao. Work and dedication will always be present to reach this main goal. And if I’m not on the list in the end, I’ll just keep going with my work thinking that one day my time will come</p>

  <p><b>[Bordeaux starlet Malcom believes that countryman Neymar was wise to leave Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain]</b> Neymar made a good choice coming to France. We’re happy for him. I hope he can be happy in Paris. May he bring happiness and score a lot of goals…. just not against Bordeaux! With Neymar’s arrival, the French championship grew in visibility. There’s more people watching it<br /><br />There are no easy games in Ligue 1 - it’s the same as in Brazil: Chapecoense can beat Corinthians, Vitoria can beat Sao Paulo… so there’s no easy game. Last year Monaco showed great concentration to win the title. Now, with Kylian Mbappe and Neymar, I think PSG have a better chance of winning the title. But there are other teams fighting for it. The one most focused will be the Ligue 1 champiom<br /><br />I was calm. My head was never on Dortmund or any other club. My head is with Bordeaux, I’m focused on Bordeaux. I’m very happy, focused on my work and all I want is to give consistently<br /><br />Those kinds of games won’t poke Tite. I won’t become a national team player because of a single game, it will be due to my entire season. I’m calm. There’s no way I’m the Neymar of Bordeaux… The squad is very united, focused and hoping to reach our objectives</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona seal €41m Malcom deal after hijacking Roma move]</b> Malcom is an attacking player with a great future ahead of him. He stands out due to his electrifying pace and his technique with the ball at his feet. Malcom is a daring, pacey forward with an ability to shoot from distance. Despite being left footed, he is no slouch with his right also and can play on either flank. He has mainly operated on the right hand side so far in his career to great success, attacking defenders and getting into the box at every opportunity. Aside from his speed, he also has great technical ability and links up well with his team mates, one of the main aspects of Barça’s football</p>

I’m very happy with my development with every passing day. My objective is to make my dreams come true<br /><br />All that I have done has been worth it. I had a dream of being a professional footballer, and then my dream was to be a champion with my first club and after that I dreamed of playing in Europe.

The adaptation’s very good. I’m adapting and learning to speak a bit of Spanish. I have classes three times a week. But I am also learning a lot every day from being with my team-mates.
