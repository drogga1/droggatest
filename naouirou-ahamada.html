<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Ahamada happy to be France’s unsung hero]</b> We’ve got to be happy with how well everything’s going. Beating Spain 6-1 to reach the semi-finals is definitely something to be pleased about. Obviously it’s fun to score goals and provide assists, but I don’t need to do that to feel fulfilled And I feel I didn’t play too badly<br /><br /><b>[Ahamada and midfield partner <a href="lucien-agoume.html">Lucien Agoume</a> played decisive roles against a Spain team known for the quality of its passing game, pressing hard to deny their opponents space and cut out passes]</b> It’s never easy when you play Spain because they’re so good at keeping the ball. We knew all about the talent they have in midfield but we defended as a unit. We stuck together and stayed compact and we stopped them from playing<br /><br /><b>[Judging by their performances in Brazil, they have benefitted from the short time they have so far spent in Italy]</b> Yes, Italy’s had an impact on me and on my game. I’ve developed a lot physically and all I do there is run. I think I’ve also changed on a mental level. I’ve become a real warrior. You won’t see me holding back.<br /><br /><b>[The duo will not be lining up together in Thursday’s semi-final against Brazil, a game <a href="lucien-agoume.html">Agoume</a> will miss through suspension after picking up his second yellow card of the competition against Spain]</b> He’s my mate. We complement each other so well and we really understand one another on and off the pitch. Him being suspended is bad news for me and for the team as a whole because he’s our captain. There are 21 of us in this squad, though, and we’ve got plenty of back-up</p>
