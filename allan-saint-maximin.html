  <p><b>[<a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a> have completed their third signing of the transfer window, bringing in Nice winger Allan Saint-Maximin in a deal believed to be worth £16 million]</b> I want to do everything I can for the club. It’s my policy. My parents always said to me that when people give everything for you, you have to give 20 per cent more. I want to do more. If they give me one per cent, I will give 10. The fans are very important to me. My play involves a lot of dribbling and I know a lot of fans love that. I want to not just that but to score and give some assists. It’s very important because to win, you have to not just dribble, but to score, to provide assists, to run and to work hard. That’s what I want to do</p>

  <p><b>[Allan Saint-Maximin scores as <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> beat Hull ahead of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> restart]</b> I started playing football alone by myself in my house. That is when my parents realised that I loved football. I took the ball everywhere and I dribbled everywhere. Even when I went to church I would go with my ball. Just me and the ball</p>

  <p><b>[Allan Saint-Maximin on the death of George Floyd]</b> If this happened to your mother or your sister or your father, you can feel like you want to die, you don’t want to go to work, you don’t want to do anything, so people have to take this seriously and know that this does not have to happen again</p>
