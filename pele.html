  <p><b>[Pele in moving tribute to ‘magic’ <a href="gordon-banks.html">Gordon Banks</a>]</b> For many people, their memory of <a href="gordon-banks.html">Gordon Banks</a> is defined by the save he made against me in 1970. I understand why. When you are a footballer, you know straight away how well you have hit the ball. I hit that header exactly as I had hoped. Exactly where I wanted it to go. And I was ready to celebrate<br /><br />But then this man, Banks, appeared in my sight, like a kind of blue phantom, is how I described him. He came from nowhere and he did something I didn’t feel was possible. He pushed my header, somehow, up and over. And I couldn’t believe what I saw. Even now when I watch it l, I can’t believe it. I can’t believe how he moved so far, so fast<br /><br />I scored so many goals in my life, but many people, when they meet me, always ask me about that save. While it was indeed phenomenal, my memory of Gordon is not defined by that - it is defined by his friendship. He was a kind and warm man who gave so much to people.<br /><br />So, I am glad he saved my header - because that act was the start of a friendship between us that I will always treasure. Whenever we met, it was always like we had never been apart<br /><br />I have great sadness in my heart and I send condolences to the family he was so proud of. Rest in peace, my friend. Yes, you were a goalkeeper with magic. But you were also so much more. You were a fine human being</p>

  <p><b>[Pele denies claims depression left him housebound]</b> This depression thing, I don’t know if I was misunderstood. I’ve had some injuries in the past few years. I was operated on, which hindered me from doing commercials or appearing in public. People got concerned, and I thank them very much for that. But then someone came up with this story that I was depressed. I arrived here <b>[for the interview]</b> with the help of a walker. I’m fine, but of course, I can’t ride a bike. Maybe when I was injured and had to do an interview, I mentioned I was sad about it. But thank God I’m making a good recovery, I’m fine. I had a swollen tendon that forced me to medicate. It hurt a little and made movement a little difficult. But thank God I’m conscious - and not talking nonsense<br /><br />I never imagined I would be big <b>[in football]</b>. When Santos asked about taking me from BAC (Bauru AC, one of Pele’s youth clubs) to train at Santos, I thought it was a joke, I was 13, 14 and I wasn’t even making the first team there. But I went and got approved, I thought I was dreaming. I remember my father taking me to the Bauru bus station so I could go to train at Santos. It looked like something from another world, and now players are able to take private jets to go around. Life can be funny sometimes</p>
