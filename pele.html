You don’t see Neymar scoring with the head, and that counts.<br /><br /><b>[Pele believes the Selecao are now playing as a unit rather than a team of skilled individuals]</b> One of the things that gave me most satisfaction was to see Tite’s approach. Brazil always had good players - since the time of Leonidas, Brazil always had great players. But what was our problem? We didn’t have a team. I like his interview, he said: ‘Oh, let’s play these games only with Brazilian players who are here. If we need you, we will call you. But first we give the chance to those who are playing here <b>[in Brazil]</b>. Good players, new players’. I hope it works. Tite is on the right path</p>

Because I always say that he was one of the best in the world, and that’s true. Now, we can’t say that Maradona was a great header. He didn’t score goals with headers. And we cannot say Maradona shot very well with both feet, because he didn’t shoot with his right, only mainly with his left … So from time to time, when people make comparisons, I make jokes about that. For me he was a great player, just that you can’t compare Maradona with Pele..<br /><br />We are friends. We are always joking. I always say to him: ‘Maradona, you can be level with Pele when you have scored more than 1,000 goals’. And he says: ‘I can’t now, but it doesn’t matter!’</p>

  <p><b>[On Neymar]</b> People always ask me about Neymar. Wherever I go, everyone wants to know about Neymar and I am very proud because my son, who was a goalkeeper at Santos, Edinho, was coach of the youngsters at Santos for two or three years and Neymar was there at that time. So I spoke to Neymar’s father a few times. I had some photos taken with them, we did a commercial in Brazil. And I feel very proud that Neymar came out of Santos, and that my son was his coach. I feel great pride. I hope he is lucky with his career and I hope he keeps playing his football.<br /><br />I came from Santos, Neymar as well. When he was much younger, he was from Sao Vicente, close to Santos. And when he started out, my son told me, ‘There is a kid at Santos who is really good’. But I didn’t expect that. Years later, Neymar appeared. I hope he has the same good fortune that I had in my career. I hope he is fortunate because he is a great player and a great person as well<br /><br />It’s a great responsibility he has now. Because people started comparing Neymar to Messi. And as a Brazilian, I say that there’s no doubt that Neymar is one of the best in his position, because we have Cristiano Ronaldo who is a centre-forward as well. But with Messi it’s a bit different. Messi is an organiser and he also scores goals.<br /><br />Neymar is more of a striker. There is no doubt he has a great future ahead, but there are things he needs to improve on, in the next World Cups for example. Today, with different styles, Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi and Neymar are the best players in the world. There are other players, but the best in the world at the moment are those three<br /><br />For Neymar, I think it <b>[moving to PSG]</b> was the best thing. For Brazil, not much changes. There are other good players. But for him, I think it was the best thing because there was always the discussion, ‘Neymar, Messi, Neymar, Messi’. Now, he will have the opportunity to be the big star. But for the Brazil national team, not much changes<br /><br />They are different moments. Different eras. I was really happy at Santos, because Santos were winning almost all the titles at that time, we were world champions twice, and I never accepted leaving Santos. I had offers from Real Madrid, Manchester United, Benfica, Roma, from two or three Italian teams. But I was happy at Santos. I wasn’t going to move just for the sake of moving or for a little more money. But they were different times.<br /><br />And I only accepted to leave Santos and go to Cosmos at the end of my career. But it was to promote football in the USA. At that time, Mr. <b>[Henry]</b> Kissinger was in Sao Paulo, he was in Brazil. He called me and said, ‘Listen, we want to do a big promotion and implement football in the USA and we have an offer for you to come and coach’. So I believe it was different to going to play in Italy, Spain or Germany. It was more an offer to coach, to teach the kids, and for that reason I went to New York Cosmos, but it was at the end of my career<br /><br />I think in football there are always great surprises. Everyone talks about the World Cup and everyone criticised Brazil, Neymar got injured… in the last World Cup. And people forget that, of the five World Cups Brazil have, none of them were won in Brazil. They have won five and none of them were in Brazil.<br /><br />First in 1950, and I have a great memory of that. I was around 10 years old and my father was a professional with Bauru Atletico Clube, and I saw my father crying, with the other players, and I said, ‘What has happened?’ And he said, ‘Brazil lost the World Cup’. They were listening on the radio at that time.<br /><br />And later, Brazil won five World Cups, but the last one, which was in Brazil, was lost again. So it’s a difficult story to understand. Why does God do that? The two World Cups played in Brazil, and Brazil lost. So I think that now, the next World Cup is going to be in Russia and Tite, it looks like he is building a good team. They are confident and let’s hope they win. We are going to be there<br /><br />It’s difficult. I have spoken several times about players I have known. When I saw <b>[Johan]</b> Cruyff, in a game we played with Santos, a friendly, I said Cruyff would be a great player, and he was. Eusebio, <b>[Franz]</b> Beckenbauer, when I saw him play, as well. So it’s difficult to say, but Neymar has a big chance to be among the great players at the next World Cup</p>

At the last World Cup, we had the best players in the world but the team was disorganised. It seems that now we’ll have a team and a Selecao that gives us confidence.<br /><br /><b>[The 77-year-old, who suffered health problems last year, went on to assure those in attendance that is recovery is going well]</b> I’m fine, thank goodness, and I want to thank all those who sent me messages wishing me a good recovery from all over the world</p>

Johan Cruyff, Diego Maradona, Pele, Zico, Junior … All over the world now there are only two players. And Neymar, right? Our Brazilian is getting there. I would still stay with Messi. Scoring is important, no doubt, but if you do not have anyone to prepare, then the ball is not enough. For my team I prefer Messi.<br /><br />Messi’s been the most stable in the last 10 years. As for Cristiano Ronaldo, he’s a great goalscorer. Ronaldo’s been able to score goals, while you see Messi creating goals and directing the play, as well as scoring. Ronaldo’s a great goalscorer but in terms of the complete player, there’s no doubt that Messi is the best</p>

He might find that the tactical switch from his club to the national team isn’t straightforward, but Neymar is Brazil’s key player. He has to prepare himself for that. And I would go further: for me, technically, he is already the best player in the world. I’m absolutely sure of that.<br /><br />If you look around the world, the ones who stand out are Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar. There are no other superstars</p>

He began to want to appear in another way, not by scoring goals but by making gestures, simulating fouls, complicating the referees’ lives. That’s why his image became negative. We have talked about it several times together, despite everything he remains one of the best players in the world. A father does not criticise, a father educates his son. When I say to you that he is our child, it’s because he is considered a child of Santos. People think that I ‘twist his ear’ too often but I do it for his own good, I wish the best for him, for Brazil, I will do everything to help him.<br /><br />I already complimented Mbappé last year, saying he was a great player. He won the World Cup at 19, I was only 17 years old when I won it. I said to him that he could equal me, I think he can become the new Pele. A lot of people think I said that as a joke, but no, it’s not a joke! PSG are a great team, I hope they will play great football and they will go to the Champions League final.

I hope this project can help in the development of many, many children.<br /><br />It is a great responsibility to have my name linked to a city like this. Resende opened its doors and I am very proud that I can present them with this Center of Football Excellence, mainly to prepare children to be great people. We all have to work together to create good citizens. This is the great importance of the project<br /><br />I played 25 years with Santos and the Brazilian National Team, plus five more years with the Cosmos. And now God is sending me the bill<br /><br />You must always play in order to improve and keep trying, as I always did. You must never think you’re the best, you must always think you have to improve. That is what I must pass on to the children who want to be great players, that you always have to work<br /><br />I didn’t speak German but I learned a few English words and Beckenbauer used to joke with me. He already spoke English and one of the good things I learned from him was speaking English. So, I I speak English badly then it’s because of him<br /><br />I think that when we talk about goals, the attackers are the ones we discuss the most. It’s a good thing for me, I had the opportunity to score a lot of goal, but I did not score any of them alone. If I did not have a good goalkeeper, a full-back to help me … No one plays alone, so I think that’s important to remember</p>

  <p><b>[Pele believes French star <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> can emulate his illustrious career]</b> I already complimented (Kylian) <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> last year, saying he was a great player. He won the World Cup at 19, I was only 17 years old when I won it. I said to him that he could equal me, I think he can become the new Pele. A lot of people think I said that as a joke, but no, it’s not a joke!</p>

  <p><b>[On Lionel Messi]</b> How can you make a comparison between a guy who heads the ball well, shoots with the left, shoots with the right and another who only shoots with one leg, only has one skill and doesn’t head the ball well? How can you compare? To compare with Pele, it has to be someone who shoots well with the left, shoots well with the right, and scores headers. As far as I’m concerned, Maradona was one of the best players ever. If you ask me, ‘Was he better than Messi?’ Yes, he was. Much better.</p>

  <p><b>[Brazil legend Pele has advised Kylian Mbappe on how the French World Cup winner can become the best player in the world]</b> He is not yet the king. He is undergoing tests to become the king. He still has a lot of steps ahead of him. He is young, he has just started. In football, you do not always know everything. There is always something to learn. He can always improve his game, his movements. If I can give him advice, it’s taking care of his body and looking after himself. The technique, he already has it. The physical aspect is the most important thing for an athlete today. What is missing? Not much. Maybe his heading game, the impulse and the jump. That’s what makes us different again because I had a lot of momentum. I was going very high and I scored a lot of headed goals.<br /><br />No, he does not need to leave the PSG. He must continue to play the same way because he will become the best in the world. That’s important. If we have to make a comparison with Pele, Pele never left Santos to be the best player in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Pele picks <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> as perfect playing partner and reveals his hope for <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> renaissance]</b> I think <a href="lionel-messi.html">Leo Messi</a>. He is a skilled player, gives assists, passes, scores, dribbles well. If we were in a team together, the opponents would have to worry about two players, not just one!

I hope that at the next World Cup he is in good physical condition. People criticise him. Even I did it a few times, but we forget that he is a product of ours, of the nursery of Santos. We always want the best for him. I talk about it often with his father. Technically he is an excellent player<br /><br /><b>[Another product of the Santos academy to have rediscovered a spark of late is <a href="gabriel-barbosa.html">Gabriel Barbosa</a>]</b> <a href="gabriel-barbosa.html">Gabriel Barbosa</a> made himself known with the Santos shirt, went to Europe, returned.

  <p><b>[Pele in moving tribute to ‘magic’ <a href="gordon-banks.html">Gordon Banks</a>]</b> For many people, their memory of <a href="gordon-banks.html">Gordon Banks</a> is defined by the save he made against me in 1970. I understand why. When you are a footballer, you know straight away how well you have hit the ball. I hit that header exactly as I had hoped. Exactly where I wanted it to go. And I was ready to celebrate<br /><br />But then this man, Banks, appeared in my sight, like a kind of blue phantom, is how I described him. He came from nowhere and he did something I didn’t feel was possible. He pushed my header, somehow, up and over. And I couldn’t believe what I saw. Even now when I watch it l, I can’t believe it. I can’t believe how he moved so far, so fast<br /><br />I scored so many goals in my life, but many people, when they meet me, always ask me about that save. While it was indeed phenomenal, my memory of Gordon is not defined by that - it is defined by his friendship. He was a kind and warm man who gave so much to people.<br /><br />So, I am glad he saved my header - because that act was the start of a friendship between us that I will always treasure. Whenever we met, it was always like we had never been apart<br /><br />I have great sadness in my heart and I send condolences to the family he was so proud of. Rest in peace, my friend. Yes, you were a goalkeeper with magic. But you were also so much more. You were a fine human being</p>

  <p><b>[Pele rejects claims that he is too depressed to leave his house]</b> Thank you for your prayers and concerns. I’m fine. I’m turning 80 this year. I have my good and bad days.

Last week, I had the honour of meeting the <a href="brazilian-fa.html">CBF</a> <b>[<a href="brazilian-fa.html">Brazilian Football Confederation</a>]</b> president in the studio I was shooting my documentary in. I had two photo sessions last month for campaigns that use my image and testimony. I have several upcoming events scheduled. I do not avoid meeting commitments from my always busy schedule. I continue to accept my physical limitations in the best possible way, but I intend to keep the ball rolling. God bless you all</p>

  <p><b>[Pele denies claims depression left him housebound]</b> This depression thing, I don’t know if I was misunderstood. I’ve had some injuries in the past few years. I was operated on, which hindered me from doing commercials or appearing in public. People got concerned, and I thank them very much for that. But then someone came up with this story that I was depressed. I arrived here <b>[for the interview]</b> with the help of a walker. I’m fine, but of course, I can’t ride a bike. Maybe when I was injured and had to do an interview, I mentioned I was sad about it. But thank God I’m making a good recovery, I’m fine. I had a swollen tendon that forced me to medicate. It hurt a little and made movement a little difficult. But thank God I’m conscious - and not talking nonsense<br /><br />I never imagined I would be big <b>[in football]</b>. When Santos asked about taking me from BAC (Bauru AC, one of Pele’s youth clubs) to train at Santos, I thought it was a joke, I was 13, 14 and I wasn’t even making the first team there. But I went and got approved, I thought I was dreaming. I remember my father taking me to the Bauru bus station so I could go to train at Santos. It looked like something from another world, and now players are able to take private jets to go around. Life can be funny sometimes</p>
