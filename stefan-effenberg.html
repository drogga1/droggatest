  <p><b>[Stefan Effenberg criticising <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> ordering <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a>, who was preparing to take a penalty, to hand the responsibility to <a href="thomas-muller.html">Thomas Muller</a>]</b> You don’t want to go through something like this in front of 80,000 people. You have the ball in your hands and are ready to take a spot-kick, full of confidence, and then your coach steps up like a schoolteacher telling you to give it to <a href="thomas-muller.html">Muller</a>. That’s very bitter for any player and a bad situation to be in. You have to explain these kinds of decisions as a coach. You’re obliged to do that. You cannot just say, ‘I’m the coach and I make the decisions’</p>

  <p><b>[Former midfielder Stefan Effenberg believes that Bayern’s austere approach could ensure that the club will fail to compete at the highest level]</b> It will not be easy for Bayern - quite the contrary. You see how other teams are improving when €222m is invested in Neymar. Paris are certainly now among the favourites for the Champions League. They are hungry and have other options. If Uli Hoeness then publicly says ‘No, we are not ready to pay’, but what’s happening continues, then the gap between these clubs is growing.</p>

  <p><b>[Germany legend Stefan Effenberg believes it is hard to argue against those that criticise Mesut Ozil]</b> I have seen matches with Mesut where I say: ‘he must do more’. I remember those matches against Bayern in the Champions League. He disappointed many people there - including <b>[Germany manager]</b> Joachim Low. Steven Gerrarrd said he would let his team down and be a burden in matches away from home. You can’t say he is completely wrong. Ozil has to see and realise that. It is not like he is 20 years old and a young player. He turns 29 in October. You wait for an improvement in that area for years. You hoped there would be a development, but it hasn’t happen<br /><br /><b>[On Julian Draxler’s situation at PSG]</b> If he manages to push through <b>[into the team]</b> at Paris now he will be a world-class player. And that must be his goal. I see him fitting in well at PSG. His development has been great. Why shouldn’t he play alongside Neymar? Draxler is more mature than Mbappe. And experience is a very important factor</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich should sell Robert Lewandowski and build a German core for the future if the Polish striker is not happy with the club’s recruitment policy]</b> On the one hand, he’s attacked the philosophy of the club. Uli Hoeness has already said several times that they will not spend totals by €100 million or €150m. He also attacked his colleagues, who in his opinion apparently did not have the quality to win what he wants: the Champions League.<br /><br />I said a few weeks ago that Bayern are in danger of losing touch with PSG and Barcelona if they are not willing to pay these sums. However, Lewandowski is a player - in this role, he should not express such statements publicly. In addition, the decision of Uli Hoeness is now irrefutable and the quality of the team is high despite ‘low’ expenditure.<br /><br />After the new development centre is finally finished, I see today a huge potential in a completely different strategy: FC Bayern Germany. We have so many highly talented, potential world-class players in Germany - not 15 but 30 to 40! They have won the World Cup, the Confederations Cup and the European Under 21 Championship. This is exactly the opposite of what Lewandowski demands. €100m, €150m or €200m for international superstars? For this sum you get five or six players in Germany.<br /><br />Bayern already have <b>[Manuel]</b> Neuer, <b>[Mats]</b> Hummels, <b>[Jerome]</b> Boateng, <b>[Joshua]</b> Kimmich, <b>[Sebastian]</b> Rudy, <b>[Niklas]</b> Sule, and, of course, Thomas Muller. Why not expand this? For Timo Werner, it would be a logical next step to switch to Bayern. I cannot imagine that he would say ‘I’m going abroad’ or ‘I’m staying with Leipzig’ if they came calling.<br /><br /><b>[Leon]</b> Goretzka and <b>[Emre]</b> Can for the midfield, <b>[Jonas]</b> Hector for the left flank, <b>[Julian]</b> Brandt, <b>[Benjamin]</b> Henrichs, <b>[Kai]</b> Havertz, <b>[Kerem]</b> Demirbay, <b>[Amin]</b> Younes and <b>[Max]</b> Arnold … you could spend around €150m and have a team that know how to stand together. That is why they would be successful in Europe.<br /><br />If Bayern wants to go for this strategy, then they must fully commit. They have to separate themselves consistently from the foreign top players in the coming years, including Lewandowski. He could go to Paris, where such enormous sums are paid, or Barcelona. Then he has a club that does what he wants</p>

  <p><b>[Critics of Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema baffle Bayern Munich legend Stefan Effenberg]</b> Why is Benzema criticised so much in Spain? He plays with Cristiano and does not stop working for him. Criticising him for a lack of goals when he has Cristiano next to him does not seem very logical to me<br /><br />Look at Muller. Before, he scored 20 per season, now he gets less. The reason? Because he works for Lewandowski, who scores more thanks to Muller<br /><br /><b>[On Sergio Ramos]</b> I would not have liked to face him. I do not lie when I say that Madrid would not have won so many titles without Ramos. The same goes for Toni Kroos. His signing for Madrid helped him to give the final pass to the world elite. Ramos, Kroos and Cristiano form a backbone that, if performing at 100 per cent, will require Bayern to get the most out of themselves</p>

  <p><b>[Stefan Effenberg believes that manager Joachim Low should have excluded both Mesut Ozil and Ilkay Gundogan from the national team]</b> you bet on certain values, as the DFB repeatedly conveys, then the decision can only be made by throwing the two players out. Ozil and Gundogan have now been lucky that the DFB acted in this case in an inconsistent way, and not quickly<br /><br /><b>[Referring to Gundogan’s experience against the Saudis]</b> That’s the worst thing that can happen to you, because you’re asking yourself a lot of questions, like the value of wearing this jersey</p>

  <p><b>[On Mario Mandzukic]</b> I never understood why Bayern sold him. Mandzukic is one of the three best strikers in the world. If he were not so old, he would have a market value of €200 million. I would prefer him 10 times more than a Neymar.</p>

  <p><b>[Stefan Effenberg has panned former club Bayern Munich for spending €80 million <b>[£69m/$90m]</b> on Atletico Madrid defender Lucas Hernandez]</b> Bayern are undergoing a transformation this summer and have already spent a lot of money already. But there are a lot of question marks around the signings. <b>[Sporting director]</b> Hasan Salihamidzic always talks about Pavard and Hernandez as the signing of two world champions, but from my point of view it doesn’t matter that they became world champions with France in 2018. That doesn’t mean they will still be world champions in 10 years. If we look at the transfer fee paid for Hernandez, we can assume that there is only one winner: Atletico Madrid. The sum might seem normal in today’s transfer market but it gives me a stomach ache. It’s one of the reasons that fans often find it hard to understand what is going on. If things continue like this, we’ll be paying €5 million for a bus driver in five years! I would rather spend €80m on players who are at the top of their game or offensive or creative players</p>

  <p><b>[Former Bayern Munich midfielder Stefan Effenberg is of the opinion that James Rodriguez must leave the German champions]</b> If he looks at his personal situation in a reasonable manner, James must realise that the right thing for him to do is to leave the club. He has to play and have fun kicking the ball. If he is only allowed to play seven, 10, 12 or 15 minutes, he is lost. In the Bundesliga this season, he has only played 90 minutes three times - that’s not enough. As such, he cannot stay with Bayern. Even at Real Madrid he will find it difficult to get the playing time that matches his talent. Maybe he has to go somewhere completely new. Either way, he has to leave Bayern<br /><br />Eintracht Frankfurt was the perfect club for his development. Both parties can be very happy with how it went. Jovic can thank Frankfurt for the opportunity and their complete confidence, while the club can thank him for 25 goals in 43 matches across the season. Absolute top performances. But the next step, I’m relatively sure, is that he will leave and move to a top club. That’s the logical way in football</p>
