  <p><b>[Stefan Effenberg criticising <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> ordering <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a>, who was preparing to take a penalty, to hand the responsibility to <a href="thomas-muller.html">Thomas Muller</a>]</b> You don’t want to go through something like this in front of 80,000 people. You have the ball in your hands and are ready to take a spot-kick, full of confidence, and then your coach steps up like a schoolteacher telling you to give it to <a href="thomas-muller.html">Muller</a>. That’s very bitter for any player and a bad situation to be in. You have to explain these kinds of decisions as a coach. You’re obliged to do that. You cannot just say, ‘I’m the coach and I make the decisions’</p>

  <p><b>[Four-time <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> champion Stefan Effenberg advised <a href="james-rodriguez.html">James Rodriguez</a> to look for a new team in 2019-20, believing he is unlikely to get game time in <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> or <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> If he looks at his personal situation in a reasonable manner, James must realise that the right thing for him to do is to leave the club. He has to play and have fun kicking the ball. If he is only allowed to play seven, 10, 12 or 15 minutes, he is lost. In the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> this season, he has only played 90 minutes three times - that’s not enough. As such, he cannot stay with <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>. Even at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> he will find it difficult to get the playing time that matches his talent. Maybe he has to go somewhere completely new. Either way, he has to leave <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[Stefan Effenberg says <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> represents a risk that <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> do not need to take with <a href="mario-mandzukic.html">Mario Mandzukic</a> a more suitable option for a club looking to land the Champions League crown]</b> <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> knows neither the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> nor coach <b>[Niko]</b> Kovac, he speaks no German and is at a top Spanish club but not a regular player. He has completed just eight of 38 Primera Division games over 90 minutes, scoring five goals and assisting two. <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> has great qualities, but a transfer for <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> would be a risk. <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> needs someone who can help immediately, does not need any time to adjust, is not a risk. And there’s a better solution than <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> in my view<br /><br /><a href="mario-mandzukic.html">Mandzukic</a> would be the second absolute top transfer <b>[after <a href="ivan-perisic.html">Perisic</a>]</b>, who would help to bring <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> back to where they wants to go - in the top group of Europe. <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> would suddenly have another chance at winning the Champions League and we would not have to talk about <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a> or <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a>. He has great experience, knows the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and coach Kovac very well. He is rarely or never injured. And he stands for mentality and a self-sacrificing game. That’s what I love about him, that has always impressed me. <a href="mario-mandzukic.html">Mandzukic</a> is still hungry. He would be very helpful for two or three years</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Bayern and Germany midfielder Stefan Effenberg, meanwhile, says it is unfortunate that the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> giants cannot find a place for <a href="mario-gotze.html">Gotze</a>]</b> Unfortunately, there is no place in the current <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a> system for <a href="mario-gotze.html">Mario Gotze</a>. I think <a href="mario-gotze.html">Gotze</a> is an outstanding footballer. His biggest drawback is the pace. In the 3-4-3 system of <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a>, <a href="lucien-favre.html">Favre</a> wants to have speed. <a href="mario-gotze.html">Gotze</a> does not have it compared to <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> or Marco Reus</p>
