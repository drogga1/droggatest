  <p>[Lionesses legend Gillian Coultard reflects on England’s first Women’s World Cup run] People say a player ‘rose like a salmon’, but the size of our kit, it was like a parachute. It was a big occasion for us, playing the first game. I was the first one to score - and to score two, to have that accolade as well in a World Cup, it’s treasured. It was a big occasion for us, playing the first game. I was the first one to score - and to score two, to have that accolade as well in a World Cup, it’s treasured<br /><br />[She was the first woman to reach 100 caps for England, which in those days was some achievement, considering the tiny number of international matches they had, all of which meant time taken off from work, often unpaid] I was quite fortunate - I did get time off, and with pay. But quite a lot of the girls had to take holiday, or they lost pay, or they lost their jobs. We didn’t really have anything compared to what they’ve got now. We were playing World Cup games every two days. Now they play every four or five days. Everything has totally changed. But you have to have a starting point somewhere, and it’s got better each time<br /><br />[Coultard and her team-mates, meanwhile, were knocked out of the tournament by Germany, beaten 3-0 on a Tuesday evening] It’s really funny to see the old photographs flying around. You think, ‘Oh my God, where did you get that from?’ It’s a nice memory and one that a lot of us will treasure for a long, long time - we were the first to represent England in a World Cup<br /><br />[The 55-year-old spent most of her domestic career across four decades with the legendary Doncaster Belles] I’ve had some right ribbing about that! They didn’t realise what I’d done. It’s all out in the open now. It’s nice to reminisce, and it’s nice to see how things have progressed<br /><br />Over my career, we played about four or five [international] games a season. To achieve that amount of caps over that number of years … You look now at the girls who are playing between ten and fifteen a season. It’s a vast amount [of matches] now, but to be the first one with the hundred is always special<br /><br />I don’t think we’ve played particularly well. We struggled a bit against Scotland, but in any football match you’re not going to dominate for 90 minutes. I thought we were all right in the last game [against Argentina], I didn’t think we were fantastic, but it’s the points that matter. We’ve now got to go against Japan, the last one, and win the group. Getting out of the group is the first thing you need to do - everything else takes care of itself in the next stage<br /><br />When you get to a World Cup, past games that you’ve played against countries go out of the window, for me. It’s just one of those things. They know what they’ve got to do. It’s all to play for</p>
